59626605	from sand hill to pine   by bret harte     contents   from sand hill to pine        a niece of snapshot harrys       a treasure of the redwoods       a belle of canada city       what happened at the fonda       a jack and jill of the sierras       mr bilsons housekeeper     from sand hill to pine     a niece of snapshot harrys   i  there was a slight jarring though the whole frame of the coach a grinding and hissing from the brakes and then a sudden jolt as the vehicle ran upon and recoiled from the taut polestraps of the now arrested horses the murmur of a voice in the road was heard followed by the impatient accents of yuba bill the driver  whaat speak up cant ye  here the voice uttered something in a louder key but equally unintelligible to the now interested and fully awakened passengers  one of them dropped the window nearest him and looked out he could see the faint glistening of a rainwashed lantern near the wheelers heads mingling with the stronger coach lights and the glow of a distant open cabin door through the leaves and branches of the roadside the sound of falling rain on the roof a soft swaying of windtossed trees and an impatient movement on the boxseat were all they heard then yuba bills voice rose again apparently in answer to the other  why thats half a mile away  yes but ye might have dropped onto it in the dark and its all on the down grade responded the strange voice more audibly  the passengers were now thoroughly aroused  whats up ned asked the one at the window of the nearest of two figures that had descended from the box  tree fallen across the road said ned the expressman briefly  i dont see no tree responded the passenger leaning out of the window towards the obscurity ahead  now thats onfortnit said yuba bill grimly but ef any gentleman will only lend him an opery glass mebbe he can see round the curve and over the other side o the hill where it is now then addressing the stranger with the lantern bring along your axes cant ye  heres one bill said an officious outside passenger producing the instrument he had taken from its strap in the boot it was the regulation axe beautifully shaped highly polished and utterly ineffective as bill well knew  we aint cuttin no kindlins he said scornfully then he added brusquely to the stranger fetch out your biggest wood axeyouve got one ye knowand look sharp  i dont think bill need be so dd rough with the stranger considering hes saved the coach a very bad smash suggested a reflective young journalist in the next seat he talks as if the man was responsible  he aint quite sure if that isnt the fact said the express messenger in a lowered voice  why what do you mean clamored the others excitedly  wellthis is about the spot where the up coach was robbed six months ago returned the messenger  dear me said the lady in the back seat rising with a half hysterical laugh hadnt we better get out before they come  there is not the slightest danger madam said a quiet observant man who had scarcely spoken before or the expressman would not have told us nor would he i fancy have left his post beside the treasure on the box  the slight sarcasm implied in this was enough to redden the expressmans cheek in the light of the coach lamp which yuba bill had just unshipped and brought to the window he would have made some tart rejoinder but was prevented by yuba bill addressing the passengers yell have to put up with one light i reckon until weve got this job finished  how long will it last bill asked the man nearest the window  well said bill with a contemptuous glance at the elegant coach axe he was carrying in his hand considerin these purty firstclass highly expensive hash choppers that the kempany furnishes us i reckon it may take an hour  but is there no place where we can wait asked the lady anxiously i see a light in that house yonder  ye might try it though the kempany as a rule aint in the habit o makin social calls there returned bill with a certain grim significance then turning to some outside passengers he added now then them ez is goin to help me tackle that tree trot down i reckon that blitherin idiot the stranger with the lantern who had disappeared will have sense enough to fetch us some ropes with his darned axe  the passengers thus addressed apparently miners and workingmen good humoredly descended all except one who seemed disinclined to leave the much coveted seat on the box beside the driver  ill look after your places and keep my own he said with a laugh as the others followed bill through the dripping rain when they had disappeared the young journalist turned to the lady  if you would really like to go to that house i will gladly accompany you it was possible that in addition to his youthful chivalry there was a little youthful resentment of yuba bills domineering prejudices in his attitude however the quiet observant passenger lifted a look of approval to him and added in his previous level half contemptuous tone  youll be quite as well there as here madam and there is certainly no reason for your stopping in the coach when the driver chooses to leave it  the passengers looked at each other the stranger spoke with authority and bill had certainly been a little arbitrary  ill go too said the passenger by the window and youll come wont you ned he added to the express messenger the young man hesitated he was recently appointed and as yet fresh to the businessbut he was not to be taught his duty by an officious stranger he resented the interference youthfully by doing the very thing he would have preferred not to do and with assumed carelessnessyet feeling in his pocket to assure himself that the key of the treasure compartment was safeturned to follow them  wont you come too said the journalist politely addressing the cynical passenger  no i thank you ill take charge of the coach was the smiling rejoinder as he settled himself more comfortably in his seat  the little procession moved away in silence oddly enough no one except the lady really cared to go and twothe expressman and journalistwould have preferred to remain on the coach but the national instinct of questioning any purely arbitrary authority probably was a sufficient impulse as they neared the opened door of what appeared to be a fourroomed unpainted redwood boarded cabin the passenger who had occupied the seat near the window said  ill go first and sample the shanty  he was not however so far in advance of them but that the others could hear quite distinctly his offhand introduction of their party on the threshold and the somewhat lukewarm response of the inmates we thought wed just drop in and be sociable until the coach was ready to start again he continued as the other passengers entered this yer gentleman is ned brice adams  cos expressman this yer is frank frenshaw editor of the mountain banner this yers a lady so it aint necessary to give her name i reckoneven if we knowed it mines sam hexshill of hexshill  dobbss flour mills of stockton whar ef you ever come that way ill be happy to return the compliment and hospitality  the room they had entered had little of comfort and brightness in it except the fire of pine logs which roared and crackled in the adobe chimney the air would have been too warm but for the strong west wind and rain which entered the open door freely there was no other light than the fire and its tremulous and everchanging brilliancy gave a spasmodic mobility to the faces of those turned towards it or threw into stronger shadow the features that were turned away yet by this uncertain light they could see the figures of a man and two women the man rose and with a certain apathetic gesture that seemed to partake more of weariness and long suffering than positive discourtesy tendered seats on chairs boxes and even logs to the selfinvited guests the stage party were surprised to see that this man was the stranger who had held the lantern in the road  ah then you didnt go with bill to help clear the road said the expressman surprisedly  the man slowly drew up his tall shambling figure before the fire and then facing them with his hands behind him as slowly lowered himself again as if to bring his speech to the level of his hearers and give a lazier and more deliberate effect to his longdrawn utterance  wellno he said slowly ididntgowithnobilltohelpclearthe road idontreckonto gowithnobilltoclearany road ive just whittled this thing down to a pint and its thisi aint no stage kempanys nigger so far as turnin out and warnin em agin goin to smash over a fallen tree and slap down into the canyon with a passel of innercent passengers im that much a white man but i aint no nigger to work clearing things away for em nor i aint no scrub to work beside em he slowly straightened himself up again and with his former apathetic air looking down upon one of the women who was setting a coffeepot on the coals added but i reckon my old woman here kin give you some coffee and whiskeyof you keer for it  unfortunately the young expressman was more loyal to bill than diplomatic if bills a little rough he said with a heightened color perhaps he has some excuse for it you forget its only six months ago that this coach was held up not a hundred yards from this spot  the woman with the coffeepot here faced about stood up and either from design or some odd coincidence fell into the same dogged attitude that her husband had previously taken except that she rested her hands on her hips she was prematurely aged like many of her class and her black snakelike locks twisting loose from her comb as she lifted her head showed threads of white against the firelight then with slow and implacable deliberation she said  we forget well not much sonny we aint forgot it and we aint goin to forget it neither we aint bin likely to forget it for any time the last six months what with visitations from the county constables snoopins round from frisco detectives droppinsin from newspaper men and yawpins and starins from tramps and strangers on the roadwe havent had a chance to disremember much and when at last hiram tackled the head stage agent at marysville and allowed that this yer pesterin and persecutin had got ter stopwhat did that yer head agent tell him told him to shet his head and be thankful that his thievin old shanty wasnt burnt down around his ears forget that six months ago the coach was held up near here not much sonnynot much  the situation was embarrassing to the guests as ordinary politeness called for some expression of sympathy with their gloomy hostess and yet a selfish instinct of humanity warned them that there must be some foundation for this general distrust of the public the journalist was troubled in his conscience the expressman took refuge in an official reticence the lady coughed slightly and drew nearer to the fire with a vague but safe compliment to its brightness and comfort it devolved upon mr heckshill who felt the responsibility of his late airy introduction of the party to boldly keep up his role with an equally noncommittal lighthearted philosophy  well maam he said addressing his hostess its a queer world and no mans got sabe enough to say whats the rights and wrongs o anything some folks believe one thing and act upon it and other folks think differently and act upon that the only thing ye kin safely say is that things is ez they be my rule here and at the mill is jest to take things ez i find em  it occurred to the journalist that mr heckshill had the reputation in his earlier career of taking such things as unoccupied lands and timber as he found them without much reference to their actual owners apparently he was acting upon the same principle now as he reached for the demijohn of whiskey with the ingenuous pleasantry did somebody say whiskey or did i dream it  but this did not satisfy frenshaw i suppose he said ignoring heckshills diplomatic philosophy that you may have been the victim of some misunderstanding or some unfortunate coincidence perhaps the company may have confounded you with your neighbors who are believed to be friendly to the gang or you may have made some injudicious acquaintances perhaps  he was stopped by a suppressed but not unmusical giggle which appeared to come from the woman in the corner who had not yet spoken and whose face and figure in the shadow he had previously overlooked but he could now see that her outline was slim and graceful and the contour of her head charmingfacts that had evidently not escaped the observation of the expressman and mr heckshill and that might have accounted for the cautious reticence of the one and the comfortable moralizing of the other  the old woman cast an uneasy glance on the fair giggler but replied to frenshaw  thats it injerdishus acquaintances but just because we might happen to have friends or even be sorter related to folks in another line o business that aint none o ours the kempany haint no call to persecute us for it spose we do happen to know some one like  spit it out aunty now youve started in i dont mind said the fair giggler now apparently casting off all restraint in an outburst of laughter  well said the old woman with dogged desperation suppose then that that young girl thar is the niece of snapshot harry who stopped the coach the last time  and aint ashamed of it either interrupted the young girl rising and disclosing in the firelight an audacious but wonderfully pretty face and supposing he is my uncle that aint any cause for their bedevilin my poor old cousins hiram and sophy thar for all the indignation of her words her little white teeth flashed mischievously in the dancing light as if she rather enjoyed the embarrassment of her audience not excluding her own relatives evidently cousin sophy thought so too  its all very well for you to laugh flo you limb she retorted querulously yet with an admiring glance at the girl for ye know thar aint a man dare touch ye even with a word but its mighty hard on me and hiram all the same  never you mind sophy dear said the girl placing her hand half affectionately half humorously on the old womans shoulder mebbe i wont always be a discredit and a bother to you jest you hold your hosses and wait until uncle harry holds up the next pioneer coachthe dancing devil in her eyes glanced as if accidentally on the young expressmanand hell make a big enough pile to send me to europe and youll be quit o me  the embarrassment suspiciousness and uneasiness of the coach party here found relief in a half hysteric explosion of laughter in which even the dogged hiram and sophy joined it seemed as impossible to withstand the girls invincible audacity as her beauty she was quick to perceive her advantage and with a responsive laugh and a picturesque gesture of invitation said  now thats all settled yed better waltz in and have your whiskey and coffee afore the stage starts ye kin comfort yourselves that it aint stolen or pizoned even if it is served up to ye by snapshot harrys niece with another easy gesture she swung the demijohn over her arm and offering a tin cup to each of the men filled them in turn  the ice thus broken or perhaps thus perilously skated over the passengers were as profuse in their thanks and apologies as they had been constrained and artificial before heckshill and frenshaw vied with each other for a glance from the audacious flo if their compliments partook of an extravagance that was at times ironical the girl was evidently not deceived by it but replied in kind only the expressman who seemed to have fallen under the spell of her audacious glances was uneasy at the license of the others yet himself dumb towards her the lady discreetly drew nearer to the fire the old woman and her coffee hiram subsided into his apathetic attitude by the fire  a shout from the road at last proclaimed the return of yuba bill and his helpers it had the singular effect of startling the party into a vague and uneasy consciousness of indiscretion as if it had been the voice of the outer world of law and order and their manner again became constrained the leavetaking was hurried and perfunctory the diplomatic heckshill again lapsed into glittering generalities about the best of friends parting only the expressman lingered for a moment on the doorstep in the light of the fire and the girls dancing eyes  i hope he stammered with a very youthful blush to come the next timewithwitha better introduction  uncle harrys she said with a quick laugh and a mock curtsey as she turned away  once out of hearing the party broke into hurried comment and criticism of the scene they had just witnessed and particularly of the fair actress who had played so important a part averring their emphatic intention of wresting the facts from yuba bill at once and crossexamining him closely but oddly enough reaching the coach and that redoubted individual no one seemed to care to take the initiative and they all scrambled hurriedly to their seats without a word how far yuba bills irritability and imperious haste contributed to this or a fear that he might in turn catechise them kept them silent no one knew the cynically observant passenger was not there he and the sole occupant of the boxseat they were told had joined the clearing party some moments before and would be picked up by yuba bill later on  five minutes after bill had gathered up the reins they reached the scene of obstruction the great pinetree which had fallen from the steep bank above and stretched across the road had been partly lopped of its branches divided in two lengths which were now rolled to either side of the track leaving barely space for the coach to pass the huge vehicle slowed up as yuba bill skillfully guided his six horses through this narrow alley whose tassels of pine glistening with wet brushed the panels and sides of the coach and effectually excluded any view from its windows seen from the coach top the horses appeared to be cleaving their way through a dark shining olive sea that parted before and closed behind them as they slowly passed the leaders were just emerging from it and bill was gathering up his slackened reins when a peremptory voice called halt at the same moment the coach lights flashed upon a masked and motionless horseman in the road bill made an impulsive reach for his whip but in the same instant checked himself reined in his horses with a suppressed oath and sat perfectly rigid not so the expressman who caught up his rifle but it was arrested by bills arm and his voice in his ear  too latewere covereddont be a dd fool  the inside passengers still encompassed by obscurity knew only that the stage had stopped the outsiders knew by experience that they were covered by unseen guns in the wayside branches and scarcely moved  i didnt think it was the square thing to stop you bill till youd got through your work said a masterful but not unpleasant voice and if youll just hand down the express box ill pass you and the rest of your load through free but as were both in a hurry youd better look lively about it  hand it down said bill gruffly to the expressman  the expressman turned with a white check but blazing eyes to the compartment below his seat he lingered apparently in some difficulty with the lock of the compartment but finally brought out the box and handed it to another armed and masked figure that appeared mysteriously from the branches beside the wheels  thank you said the voice you can slide on now  and thank you for nothing said bill gathering up his reins its the first time any of your kind had to throw down a tree to hold me up  youre lying billthough you dont know it said the voice cheerfully far from throwing down a tree to stop you it was i sent word along the road to warn you from crashing down upon it and sending you and your load to hll before your time drive on  the angry bill waited for no second comment but laying his whip over the backs of his team drove furiously forward so rapidly had the whole scene passed that the inside passengers knew nothing of it and even those on the top of the coach roused from their stupor and inglorious inaction only to cling desperately to the terribly swaying coach as it thundered down the grade and try to keep their equilibrium yet furious as was their speed yuba bill could not help noticing that the expressman from time to time cast a hurried glance behind him bill knew that the young man had shown readiness and nerve in the attack although both were hopeless yet he was so much concerned at his set white face and compressed lips that when at the end of three miles unabated speed they galloped up to the first station he seized the young man by the arm and as the clamor of the news they had brought rose around them dragged him past the wondering crowd caught a decanter from the bar and opening the door of a side room pushed him into it and closed the door behind them  look yar brice stop it quit it right thar he said emphatically laying his large hand on the young fellows shoulder be a man youve shown you are one green ez you are for you had the sand in yethe clear grit tonight yet youd have been a dead man now if i hadnt stopped ye man you had no show from the beginning youve done your level best to save your treasure and im your witness to the kempany and proud of it too so shet your head andand pouring out a glass of whiskey swaller that  but brice waved him aside with burning eyes and dry lips  you dont know it all bill he said with a half choked voice  all what  swear that youll keep it a secret he said feverishly gripping bills arm in turn and ill tell you  go on  the coach was robbed before that  wot yer say ejaculated bill  the treasurea packet of greenbackshad been taken from the box before the gang stopped us  the hll you say  listen when you told me to hand down the box i had an ideaa dd fool one perhapsof taking that package out and jumping from the coach with it i knew they would fire at me only i might get away but if they killed me id have done only my duty and nobody else would have got hurt but when i got to the box i found that the lock had been forced and the money was gone i managed to snap the lock again before i handed it down i thought they might discover it at once and chase us but they didnt  and then thar war no greenbacks in the box that they took gasped bill with staring eyes  no  bill raised his hand in the air as if in solemn adjuration and then brought it down on his knee doubling up in a fit of uncontrollable but perfectly noiseless laughter oh lord he gasped hol me afore i bust right open hush he went on with a jerk of his fingers towards the next room not a word o this to any one its too much to keep i know its nearly killing me but we must swaller it ourselves oh jerusalem the golden oh brice think o that face o snapshot harrys ez he opened that treasure box afore his gang in the brush and he allers so keen and so easy and so cock sure created snakes id go through this every trip for one sight of him as he just riz up from that box and cussed he again shook with inward convulsions till his face grew purple and even the red came back to the younger mans cheek  but this dont bring the money back bill said brice gloomily  yuba bill swallowed the glass of whiskey at a gulp wiped his mouth and eyes smothered a second explosion and then gravely confronted brice  when do you think it was taken and how  it must have been taken when i left the coach on the road and went over to that settlers cabin said brice bitterly yet i believed everything was safe and i left two menboth passengersone inside and one on the box that man who sat the other side of you  jee whillikins ejaculated bill with his hand to his forehead the men i clean forgot to pick up in the road and now i reckon they never intended to be picked up either  no doubt a part of the gang said brice with increased bitterness i see it all now  no said bill decisively that aint snapshot harrys style hes a clean fighter with no underhand tricks and i dont believe he threw down that tree either look yer sonny he added suddenly laying his hand on brices shoulder a hundred to one that that was the work of a couple o dd sneaks or traitors in that gang who kem along as passengers i never took any stock in that coyote who paid extra for his boxseat  brice knew that bill never looked kindly on any passenger who by bribing the ticket agent secured this favorite seat which bill felt was due to his personal friends and was in his own selection he only returned gloomily  i dont see what difference it makes to us which robber got the money  ye dont said bill raising his head with a sudden twinkle in his eyes then ye dont know snapshot harry do ye suppose hes goin to sit down and twiddle his thumbs with that skin game played on him no sir he continued with a thoughtful deliberation drawing his fingers slowly through his long beard he spotted itand smelt out the whole trick ez soon ez he opened that box and thats why he didnt foller us hell hunt those sneak thieves into hll but what hell get em and he went on still more slowly by the livin hokey i reckon sonny thats jest how yell get your chance to chip in  i dont understand said brice impatiently  well said bill with more provoking slowness as if he were communing with himself rather than brice harrys mighty proud and high toned and to be given away like this has cut down into his heart you bet it aint the money hes thinkin of its this split in the gangthe loss of his power ez boss ye seeand ef he could get hold o them chaps hed let the money slide ez long ez they didnt get it so youve got a detective on your side thats worth the whole police force of californy ye never heard anything about snapshot harry did ye asked bill carelessly raising his eyes to brices eager face  the young man flushed slightly very little he said at the same time a vision of the pretty girl in the settlers cabin flashed upon him with a new significance  hes more than half white in some ways said bill thoughtfully and they say he lives somewhere about here in a cabin in the bush with a crippled sister and her darter who both swear by him it mightnt be hard to find himef a man was dead set on it  brice faced about with determined eyes ill do it he said quietly  ye might said bill still more deliberately stroking his beard mention my name ef ye ever get to see him  your name ejaculated the astonished brice  my name repeated bill calmly he knows its my bounden duty to kill him ef i get the chance and i know that hed plug me full o holes in a minit ef thar war a necessity for it but in these yer affairs sonny it seems to be the understood thing by the kempany that im to keep fiery young squirts like you and chuckleheaded passengers like themjerking his thumb towards the other roomfrom gettin themselves killed by their rashness so ontil the kempany fill the top o that coach with men who aint got any business to do but fightin other men who aint got any other business to do but to fight themthe odds are agin us harry has always acted square to methats how i know he aint in this sneakthief business and why he didnt foller us suspectin suthin and ive always acted square to him all the same id like ter hev seen his face when that box was opened lordy here bill again collapsed in his silent paroxysm of mirth ye might tell him how i laughed  i would hardly do that bill said the young man smiling in spite of himself but youve given me an idea and ill work it out  bill glanced at the young fellows kindling eyes and flushing cheek and nodded well rastle with that idea later on sonny ill fix you all right in my report to the kempany but the rest you must work alone ive started out the usual posse circusridin down the road after harry hed be a rough customer to meet just now continued bill with a chuckle ef thar was the ghost of a chance o them comin up with him for him and his gang is scattered miles away by this he paused tossed off another glass of whiskey wiped his mouth and saying to brice with a wink its about time to go and comfort them thar passengers led the way through the crowded barroom into the stage office  the spectacle of bills humorously satisfied face and brices bright eyes and heightened color was singularly effective the inside passengers who had experienced neither the excitement nor the danger of the robbery yet had been obliged to listen to the hairbreadth escapes of the others poohpoohed the whole affair and even the outsides themselves were at last convinced that the robbery was a slight one with little or no loss to the company the clamor subsided almost as suddenly as it had arisen the wiser passengers fashioned their attitude on the sangfroid of yuba bill and the whole coach load presently rolled away as complacently as if nothing had happened   ii  the robbery furnished the usual amount of copy for the local press there was the inevitable compliment to yuba bill for his wellknown coolness the conduct of the young expressman who though new to the service displayed an intrepidity that only succumbed to numbers was highly commended and even the passengers received their meed of praise not forgetting the lady who accepted the incident with the lighthearted pleasantry characteristic of the californian woman there was the usual allusion to the necessity of a vigilance committee to cope with this organized lawlessness but it is to be feared that the readers of the red dog clarion however ready to lynch a horse thief were of the opinion that rich stage express companies were quite able to take care of their own property  it was with full cognizance of these facts and their uselessness to him that the next morning mr ned brice turned from the road where the coach had just halted on the previous night and approached the settlers cabin if a little less sanguine than he was in yuba bills presence he was still doggedly inflexible in his design whatever it might have been for he had not revealed it even to yuba bill it was his own it was probably crude and youthful in its directness but for that reason it was probably more convincing than the vacillations of older counsel  he paused a moment at the closed door conscious however of some hurried movement within which signified that his approach had been observed the door was opened and disclosed only the old woman the same dogged expression was on her face as when he had last seen it with the addition of querulous expectancy in reply to his polite goodmorning she abruptly faced him with her hands still on the door  ye kin stop right there ef yer want ter make any talk about this yar robbery ye might ez well skedaddle to oncet for we aint takin any today  i have no wish to talk about the robbery said brice quietly and as far as i can prevent it you will not be troubled by any questions if you doubt my word or the intentions of the company perhaps you will kindly read that  he drew from his pocket a still damp copy of the red dog clarion and pointed to a paragraph  wots that she said querulously feeling for her spectacles  shall i read it  go on  he read it slowly aloud i grieve to say it had been jointly concocted the night before at the office of the clarion by himself and the young journalistthe latters assistance being his own personal tribute to the graces of miss flo it read as follows  the greatest assistance was rendered by hiram tarbox esq a resident of the vicinity in removing the obstruction which was no doubt the preliminary work of some of the robber gang and in providing hospitality for the delayed passengers in fact but for the timely warning of yuba bill by mr tarbox the coach might have crashed into the tree at that dangerous point and an accident ensued more disastrous to life and limb than the robbery itself  the sudden and unmistakable delight that expanded the old womans mouth was so convincing that it might have given brice a tinge of remorse over the success of his stratagem had he not been utterly absorbed in his purpose hiram she shouted suddenly  the old man appeared from some back door with a promptness that proved his near proximity and glanced angrily at brice until he caught sight of his wifes face then his anger changed to wonder  read that again young feller she said exultingly  brice reread the paragraph aloud for mr tarboxs benefit  that ar hiram tarbox esquire means you hiram she gasped in delighted explanation  hiram seized the paper read the paragraph himself spread out the whole page examined it carefully and then a fatuous grin began slowly to extend itself over his whole face invading his eyes and ears until the heavy harsh dogged lines of his nostrils and jaws had utterly disappeared  bgosh he said thats square kin i keep it  certainly said brice i brought it for you  is that all ye came for said hiram with sudden suspicion  no said the young man frankly yet he hesitated a moment as he added i would like to see miss flora  his hesitation and heightened color were more disarming to suspicion than the most elaborate and carefully prepared indifference with their knowledge and pride in their relatives fascinations they felt it could have but one meaning hiram wiped his mouth with his hand assumed a demure expression glanced at his wife and answered  she aint here now  mr brices face displayed his disappointment but the true lover holds a talisman potent with old and young mrs tarbox felt a sneaking maternal pity for this suddenly stricken strephon  shes gone home she added more gentlywent at sunup this mornin  home repeated brice wheres that  mrs tarbox looked at her husband and hesitated then she saida little in her old mannerher uncles  can you direct me the way there asked brice simply  the astonishment in their faces presently darkened into suspicion again ef thats your little game began hiram with a lowering brow  i have no little game but to see her and speak with her said brice boldly i am alone and unarmed as you see he continued pointing to his empty belt and small dispatch bag slung on his shoulder and certainly unable to do any one any harm i am willing to take what risks there are and as no one knows of my intention nor of my coming here whatever might happen to me no one need know it you would be safe from questioning  there was that hopeful determination in his manner that overrode their resigned doggedness ef we knew how to direct you thar said the old woman cautiously yed be killed outer hand afore ye even set eyes on the girl the house is in a holler with hills kept by spies yed be a dead man as soon as ye crossed its boundary  wot do you know about it interrupted her husband quickly in querulous warning wot are ye talkin about  you leave me alone hiram i aint goin to let that young feller get popped off without a show or without knowin jest wot hes got to tackle nohow ye kin fix it and cant ye see hes bound to go whatever ye says  mr tarbox saw this fact plainly in brices eyes and hesitated  the most that i kin tell ye he said gloomily is the way the gal takes when she goes from here but how far it is or if it aint a blind i cant swar for i hevnt bin thar myself and harry never comes here but on an off night when the coach aint runnin and thars no travel he stopped suddenly and uneasily as if he had said too much  thar ye go hiram and ye talk of others gabblin so ye might as well tell the young feller how that thar aint but one way and thats the way harry takes too when he comes yer oncet in an age to talk to his own flesh and blood and see a christian face that aint agin him  mr tarbox was silent ye know whar the tree was thrown down on the road he said at last  yes  the mountain rises straight up on the right side of the road all hazel brush and thornwhar a goat couldnt climb  yes  but thats a lie for thars a little trail not a foot wide runs up from the road for a mile keepin it in view all the while but bein hidden by the brush ye kin see everything from thar and hear a teamster spit on the road  go on said brice impatiently  then it goes up and over the ridge and down the other side into a little gulch until it comes to the canyon of the north fork where the stage road crosses over the bridge high up the trail winds round the bank of the fork and comes out on the left side of the stage road about a thousand feet below it thats the valley and hollow whar harry lives and thats the only way it can be found for all along the left of the stage road is a sheer pitch down that thousand feet whar no one kin git up or down  i understand said brice with sparkling eyes ill find my way all right  and when ye git thar look out for yourself put in the woman earnestly ye may have regular greenhorns luck and pick up flo afore ye cross the boundary for shes that bold that when she gets lonesome o stayin thar she goes wanderin out o bounds  hev ye any weppinany shootiniron about ye asked tarbox with a latent suspicion  the young man smiled and again showed his empty belt none he said truthfully  i aint sure ef that aint the safest thing arter all with a shot like harry remarked the old man grimly well so long he added and turned away  it was clearly a leavetaking and brice warmly thanking them both returned to the road  it was not far to the scene of the obstruction yet but for tarboxs timely hint the little trail up the mountain side would have escaped his observation ascending he soon found himself creeping along a narrow ledge of rock hidden from the road that ran fifty yards below by a thick network growth of thorn and bramble which still enabled him to see its whole parallel length perilous in the extreme to any hesitating foot at one point directly above the obstruction the ledge itself was missingbroken away by the fall of the tree from the forest crest higher up for an instant brice stood dizzy and irresolute before the gap looking down for a foothold his eye caught the faint imprint of a womans shoe on a clayey rock projecting midway of the chasm it must have been the young girls footprint made that morning for the narrow toe was pointed in the direction she would go where she could pass should he shrink from going without further hesitation he twined his fingers around the roots above him and half swung half pulled himself along until he once more felt the ledge below him  from time to time as he went on along the difficult track the narrow little toeprint pointed the way to him like an arrow through the wilds it was a pleasant thought and yet a perplexing one would he have undertaken this quest just to see her would he be content with that if his other motive failed for as he made his way up to the ridge he was more than once assailed by doubts of the practical success of his enterprise in the excitement of last night and even the hopefulness of the early morning it seemed an easy thing to persuade the vain and eccentric highwayman that their interests might be identical and to convince him that his brices assistance to recover the stolen greenbacks and insure the punishment of the robber with the possible addition of a reward from the express company would be an inducement for them to work together the risks that he was running seemed to his youthful fancy to atone for any defects in his logic or his plans yet as he crossed the ridge leaving the civilized highway behind him and descended the narrow trail which grew wilder at each step his arguments seemed no longer so convincing he now hurried forward however with a feverish haste to anticipate the worst that might befall him  the trail grew more intricate in the deep ferns the friendly little footprint had vanished in this primeval wilderness as he pushed through the gorge he could hear at last the roar of the north fork forcing its way through the canyon that crossed the gorge at right angles at last he reached its current shut in by two narrow precipitous walls that were spanned five hundred feet above by the stage road over a perilous bridge as he approached the gloomy canyon he remembered that the river seen from above seemed to have no banks but to have cut its way through the solid rock  he found however a faint ledge made by caught driftwood from the current and the debris of the overhanging cliffs again the narrow footprint on the ooze was his guide at last emerging from the canyon a strange view burst upon his sight the river turned abruptly to the right and following the mountain side left a small hollow completely walled in by the surrounding heights to his left was the ridge he had descended from on the other side and he now understood the singular detour he had made he was on the other side of the stage road also which ran along the mountain shelf a thousand feet above him the wall a sheer cliff made the hollow inaccessible from that side little hills covered with buckeye encompassed it it looked like a sylvan retreat and yet was as secure in its isolation and approaches as the outlaws den that it was  he was gazing at the singular prospect when a shot rang in the air it seemed to come from a distance and he interpreted it as a signal but it was followed presently by another and putting his hand to his hat to keep it from falling he found that the upturned brim had been pierced by a bullet he stopped at this evident hint and taking his dispatch bag from his shoulder placed it significantly upon a boulder and looked around as if to await the appearance of the unseen marksman the rifle shot rang out again the bag quivered and turned over with a bullet hole through it  he took out his white handkerchief and waved it another shot followed and the handkerchief was snapped from his fingers torn from corner to corner a feeling of desperation and fury seized him he was being played with by a masked and skillful assassin who only waited until it pleased him to fire the deadly shot but this time he could see the rifle smoke drifting from under a sycamore not a hundred yards away he set his white lips together but with a determined face and unfaltering step walked directly towards it in another moment he believed and almost hoped that all would be over with such a marksman he would not be maimed but killed outright  he had not covered half the distance before a man lounged out from behind the tree carelessly shouldering his rifle he was tall but slightly built with an amused critical manner and nothing about him to suggest the bloodthirsty assassin he met brice halfway dropping his rifle slantingly across his breast with his hands lightly grasping the lock and gazed at the young man curiously  you look as if youd had a big scare old man but youve clear grit for all that he said with a critical and reassuring smile now what are you doing here stay he continued as brices parched lips prevented him from replying immediately i ought to know your face hello youre the expressman his glance suddenly shifted and swept past brice over the ground beyond him to the entrance of the hollow but his smile returned as he apparently satisfied himself that the young man was alone well what do you want  i want to see snapshot harry said brice with an effort his voice came back more slowly than his color but that was perhaps hurried by a sense of shame at his physical weakness  what you want is a drop o whiskey said the stranger good humoredly taking his arm and well find it in that shanty just behind the tree to brices surprise a few steps in that direction revealed a fairsized cabin with a slight pretentiousness about it of neatness comfort and picturesque effect far superior to the tarbox shanty a few flowers were in boxes on the windowsigns as brice fancied of feminine taste when they reached the threshold somewhat of this quality was also visible in the interior when brice had partaken of the whiskey the stranger who had kept silence pointed to a chair and said smilingly  i am henry dimwood alias snapshot harry and this is my house  i came to speak with you about the robbery of greenbacks from the coach last night began brice hurriedly with a sudden access of hope at his reception i mean of coursehe stopped and hesitatedthe actual robbery before you stopped us  what said harry springing to his feet do you mean to say you knew it  brices heart sank but he remained steadfast and truthful yes he said i knew it when i handed down the box i saw that the lock had been forced but i snapped it together again it was my fault perhaps i should have warned you but i am solely to blame  did yuba bill know of it asked the highwayman with singular excitement  not at the time i give you my word replied brice quickly thinking only of loyalty to his old comrade i never told him till we reached the station  and he knew it then repeated harry eagerly  yes  did he say anything did he do anything did he look astonished  brice remembered bills uncontrollable merriment but replied vaguely and diplomatically he was certainly astonished  a laugh gathered in snapshot harrys eyes which at last overspread his whole face and finally shook his frame as he sat helplessly down again then wiping his eyes he said in a shaky voice  it would have been sure death to have trusted myself near that station but i think id have risked it just to have seen bills face when you told him just think of it bill who was a match for anybody bill who was never caught napping bill who only wanted supreme control of things to wipe me off the face of the earth bill who knew how everything was done and could stop it if he chose and then to have been robbed twice in one evening by my gang yes sir yuba bill and his rotten old coach were gone through twice inside half an hour by the gang  then you knew of it too said brice in uneasy astonishment  afterwards my young friendlike yuba billafterwards he stopped his whole expression changed it was done by two sneaking hounds he said sharply one whom i suspected before and one a new hand a pal of his they were detached to watch the coach and be satisfied that the greenbacks were aboard for it isnt my style to hold up except for something special they were to take seats on the coach as far as ringwood station three miles below where we held you up and to get out there and pass the word to us that it was all right they didnt that made us a little extra careful seeing something was wrong but never suspecting them we found out afterwards that they got one of my scouts to cut down that tree saying it was my orders and a part of our game calculating in the stoppage and confusion to collar the swag and get off with it without knowing it you played into their hands by going into tarboxs cabin  but how did you know this interrupted brice in wonder  they forgot one thing continued snapshot harry grimly they forgot that half an hour before and half an hour after a stage is stopped we have that road patrolled every foot of it while i was opening the box in the brush the two fools sneaking along the road came slap upon one of my patrols and then tried to run for it one was dropped but before he was plugged full of holes and hung up on a tree he confessed and said the other man who escaped had the greenbacks  brices face fell then they are lost he said bitterly  not unless he eats themas he may want to do before im done on him for he must either starve or come out that road is still watched by my men from tarboxs cabin to the bridge hes there somewhere and cant get forward or backward look he said rising and going to the door that road he pointed to the stage roada narrow ledge flanked on one side by a precipitous mountain wall and on the other by an equally precipitate descentis his limit and tether and he cant escape on either side  but the trail  there is but one entrance to itthe way you came and that is guarded too from the time you entered it until you reached the bottom you were signaled here from point to point he would have been dropped i merely gave you a hint of what might have happened to you if you were up to any little game you took it like a white man come now what is your business  thus challenged brice plunged with youthful hopefulness into his plan if as he voiced it it seemed to him a little extravagant he was buoyed up by the frankness of the highwayman who also had treated the double robbery with a levity that seemed almost as extravagant he suggested that they should work together to recover the money that the express company should know that the unprecedented stealthy introduction of robbers in the guise of passengers was not snapshot harrys method and he repudiated it as unmanly and unsportsmanlike and that by using his superior skill and knowledge of the locality to recover the money and deliver the culprit into the companys hands he would not only earn the reward that they should offer but that he would evoke a sentiment that all californians would understand and respect the highwayman listened with a tolerant smile but to brices surprise this appeal to his vanity touched him less than the prospective punishment of the thief  it would serve the dd hound right he muttered if instead of being shot like a man he was made to do time in prison like the ordinary sneak thief that he is when brice had concluded he said briefly the only trouble with your plans my young friend is that about twentyfive men have got to consider them and have their say about it every man in my gang is a shareholder in these greenbacks for i work on the square and its for him to say whether hell give them up for a reward and the good opinion of the express company perhaps he went on with a peculiar smile its just as well that you tried it on me first however ill sound the boys and see what comes of it but not until youre safe off the premises  and youll let me assist you said brice eagerly  snapshot harry smiled again well if you come across the dd thief and you recognize him and can get the greenbacks from him ill pass over the game to you he rose and added apparently by way of farewell perhaps its just as well that i should give you a guide part of the way to prevent accidents he went to a door leading to an adjoining room and called flo  brices heart leaped if he had forgotten her in the excitement of his interview he atoned for it by a vivid blush her own color was a little heightened as she slipped into the room but the two managed to look demurely at each other without a word of recognition  this is my niece flora said snapshot harry with a slight wave of the hand that was by no means uncourtly and her company will keep you from any impertinent questioning as well as if i were with you this is mr brice flo who came to see me on business and has quite forgotten my practical joking  the girl acknowledged brices bow with a shyness very different from her manner of the evening before brice felt embarrassed and evidently showed it for his host with a smile put an end to the constraint by shaking the young mans hand heartily bidding him goodby and accompanying him to the door  once on their way mr brices spirits returned i told you last night he said that i hoped to meet you the next time with a better introduction you suggested your uncles well are you satisfied  but you didnt come to see me said the girl mischievously  how do you know what my intentions were returned the young man gayly gazing at the girls charming face with a serious doubt as to the singleness of his own intentions  oh because i know she answered with a toss of her brown head i heard what you said to uncle harry  mr brices brow contracted perhaps you saw me too when i came he said with a slight touch of bitterness as he thought of his reception  miss flo laughed brice walked on silently the girl was heartless and worthy of her education after a pause she said demurely i knew he wouldnt hurt youbut you didnt thats where you showed your grit in walking straight on  and i suppose you were greatly amused he replied scornfully  the girl lifted her arms a little wearily as with a half sigh she readjusted her brown braids under her uncles gray slouch hat which she had caught up as she passed out thar aint much to laugh at here she said but it was mighty funny when you tried to put your hat straight and then found thur was that bullet hole right through the brim and the way you stared at itlordy  her musical laugh was infectious and swept away his outraged dignity he laughed too at last she said gazing at his hat it wont do for you to go back to your folks wearin that sort o thing here take mine with a saucy movement she audaciously lifted his hat from his head and placed her own upon it  but this is your uncles hat he remonstrated  all the same he spoiled yours she laughed adjusting his hat upon her own head but ill keep yours to remember you by ill loop it up by this hole and itll look mighty purty jes see she plucked a wild rose from a bush by the wayside and passing the stalk through the bullet hole pinned the brim against the crown by a thorn there she said putting on the hat again with a little affectation of coquetry hows that  mr brice thought it very picturesque and becoming to the graceful head and laughing eyes beneath it and said so then becoming in his turn audacious he drew nearer to her side  i suppose you know the forfeit of putting on a gentlemans hat  apparently she did for she suddenly made a warning gesture and said not here it would be a bigger forfeit than youd keer fo before he could reply she turned aside as if quite innocently and passed into the shade of a fringe of buckeyes he followed quickly i didnt mean that she said but in the mean time he had kissed the pink tip of her ear under its brown coils he was nevertheless somewhat discomfited by her undisturbed manner and serene face ye dont seem to mind bein shot at she said with an odd smile but it wont do for you to kalkilate that everybody shoots as keerfully as uncle harry  i dont understand he replied struck by her manner  ye aint very complimentary or youd allow that other folks might be wantin what you took just now and might consider you was poachin she returned gravely my best and strongest holt among those men is that uncle harry would kill the first one who tried anything like that onand they know it thats how i get all the liberty i want here and can come and go alone as i like  brices face flushed quickly with genuine shame and remorse do forgive me he said hurriedly i didnt thinkim a brute and a fool  uncle harry allowed you was either drunk or a born idiot when you was promenadin into the valley just now she said with a smile  and what did you think he asked a little uneasily  i thought you didnt look like a drinkin man she answered audaciously  brice bit his lip and walked on silently at which she cast a sidelong glance under her widely spaced heavy lashes and said demurely i thought last night it was mighty good for you to stand up for your frien yuba bill and then after ye knew who i was to let the folks see you kinder cottoned to me too not in the style o that landgrabber heckshill nor that peart newspaper man neither of course i gave them as good as they sent she went on with a little laugh but brice could see that her sensitive lip in profile had the tremulous and resentful curve of one who was accustomed to slight and annoyance was it possible that this reckless selfcontained girl felt her position keenly  i am proud to have your good opinion he said with a certain respect mingled with his admiring glance even if i have not your uncles  oh he likes you well enough or he wouldnt have hearkened to you a minute she said quickly when you opened out about them greenbacks i jes clutched my cheer so she illustrated her words with a gesture of her hands and her face actually seemed to grow pale at the recollectionand i nigh started up to stop ye but that idea of yuba bill bein robbed twice i think tickled him awful but it was lucky none o the gang heard ye or suspected anything i reckon thats why he sent me with youto keep them from doggin you and askin questions that a straight man like you would be sure to answer but they darent come nigh ye as long as im with you she threw back her head and rosecrested hat with a mock air of protection that however had a certain real pride in it  i am very glad of that if it gives me the chance of having your company alone returned brice smiling and very grateful to your uncle whatever were his reasons for making you my guide but you have already been that to me and he told her of the footprints but for you he added with gentle significance i should not have been here  she was silent for a moment and he could only see the back of her head and its heavy brown coils after a pause she asked abruptly wheres your handkerchief  he took it from his pocket her ingenious uncles bullet had torn rather than pierced the cambric  i thought so she said gravely examining it but i kin mend it as good as new i reckon you allow i cant sew she continued but i do heaps of mendin as the digger squaw and chinamen we have here do only the coarser work ill send it back to you and meanwhiles you keep mine  she drew a handkerchief from her pocket and handed it to him to his great surprise it was a delicate one beautifully embroidered and utterly incongruous to her station the idea that flashed upon him it is to be feared showed itself momentarily in his hesitation and embarrassment  she gave a quick laugh dont be frightened its bought and paid for uncle harry dont touch passengers fixins that aint his style you oughter know that yet in spite of her laugh he could see the sensitive pout of her lower lip  i was only thinking he said hurriedly and sympathetically that it was too fine for me but i will be proud to keep it as a souvenir of you its not too pretty for that  uncle gets me these things he dont keer what they cost she went on ignoring the compliment why ive got awfully fine gowns up there that i only wear when i go to marysville oncet in a while  does he take you there asked brice  no she answered quietly nota little defiantlythat hes afeard for they cant prove anything against him no man kin swear to him and thar aint an officer that keers to go for him but hes that shy for me he dont keer to have me mixed with him  but nobody recognizes you  sometimesbut i dont keer for that she cocked her hat a little audaciously but brice noticed that her arms afterwards dropped at her side with the same weary gesture he had observed before whenever i go into shops its always yes miss and no miss and certainly miss dimwood oh theyre mighty respectful i reckon they allow that snapshot harrys rifle carries far  presently she faced him again for their conversation had been carried on in profile there was a critical searching look in her brown eyes  here im talkin to you as if you were onemr brice was positive she was going to say one of the gang but she hesitated and concluded one of my relationslike cousin hiram  i wish you would think of me as being as true a friend said the young man earnestly  she did not reply immediately but seemed to be examining the distance they were not far from the canyon now and the river bank a fringe of buckeyes hid the base of the mountain which had begun to tower up above them to the invisible stage road overhead i am going to be a real guide to you now she said suddenly when we reach that buckeye corner and are out of sight we will turn into it instead of going through the canyon you shall go up the mountain to the stage road from this side  but it is impossible he exclaimed in astonishment your uncle said so  coming down but not going up she returned with a laugh i found it and no one knows it but myself  he glanced up at the towering cliff its nearly perpendicular flanks were seamed with fissures some clefts deeply set with stunted growths of thorn and scrub but still sheer and forbidding and then glanced back at her incredulously i will show you she said answering his look with a smile of triumph i havent tramped over this whole valley for nothing but wait until we reach the river bank they must think that weve gone through the canyon  they  yesany one who is watching us said the girl dryly  a few steps further on brought them to the buckeye thicket which extended to the river bank and mouth of the canyon the girl lingered for a moment ostentatiously before it and then saying come suddenly turned at right angles into the thicket brice followed and the next moment they were hidden by its friendly screen from the valley on the other side rose the mountain wall leaving a narrow trail before them it was composed of the rocky debris and fallen trees of the cliff from which buckeyes and larches were now springing it was uneven irregular and slowly ascending but the young girl led the way with the free footstep of a mountaineer and yet a grace that was akin to delicacy nor could he fail to notice that after the western girls fashion she was shod more elegantly and lightly than was consistent with the rude and rustic surroundings it was the same slim shoeprint which had guided him that morning presently she stopped and seemed to be gazing curiously at the cliff side brice followed the direction of her eyes on a protruding bush at the edge of one of the wooded clefts of the mountain flank something was hanging and in the freshening southerly wind was flapping heavily like a ravens wing or as if still saturated with the last nights rain thats mighty queer said flo gazing intently at the unsightly and incongruous attachment to the shrub which had a vague weird suggestion it wasnt there yesterday  it looks like a mans coat remarked brice uneasily  whew said the girl then somebody has come down who wont go up again theres a lot of fresh rocks and brush here too whats that she was pointing to a spot some yards before them where there had been a recent precipitation of debris and uprooted shrubs but mingled with it lay a mass of rags strangely akin to the tattered remnant that flagged from the bush a hundred feet above them the girl suddenly uttered a sharp feminine cry of mingled horror and disgustthe first weakness of sex she had shownand recoiling grasped brices arm dont go there come away  but brice had already seen that which while it shocked him was urging him forward with an invincible fascination gently releasing himself and bidding the girl stand back he moved toward the unsightly heap gradually it disclosed a grotesque caricature of a human figure but so maimed and doubled up that it seemed a stuffed and fallen scarecrow as is common in men stricken suddenly down by accident in the fullness of life the clothes asserted themselves before all else with a hideous ludicrousness obliterating even the majesty of death in their helpless yet ironical incongruity the garments seemed to have never fitted the wearer but to have been assumed in ghastly jocularitya boot half off the swollen foot a ripped waistcoat thrown over the shoulder were like the properties of some low comedian at first the body appeared to be headless but as brice cleared away the debris and lifted it he saw with horror that the head was twisted under the shoulder and swung helplessly from the dislocated neck but that horror gave way to a more intense and thrilling emotion as he saw the facealthough strangely free from laceration or disfigurement and impurpled and distended into the simulation of a selfcomplacent smilewas a face he recognized it was the face of the cynical traveler in the coachthe man who he was now satisfied had robbed it  a strange and selfish resentment took possession of him here was the man through whom he had suffered shame and peril and who even now seemed complacently victorious in death he examined him closely his coat and waistcoat had been partly torn away in his fall his shirt still clung to him but through its torn front could be seen a heavy treasure belt encircling his waist forgetting his disgust brice tore away the shirt and unloosed the belt it was saturated with water like the rest of the clothing but its pocket seemed heavy and distended in another instant he had opened it and discovered the envelope containing the packet of greenbacks its seal still inviolate and unbroken it was the stolen treasure  a faint sigh recalled him to himself the girl was standing a few feet from him regarding him curiously  its the thief himself he said in a breathless explanation in trying to escape he must have fallen from the road above but here are the greenbacks safe we must go back to your uncle at once he said excitedly come  are you mad she cried in astonishment  no returned brice in equal astonishment but you know i agreed with him that we should work together to recover the money and i must show him our good luck  he told you that if you met the thief and could get the money from him you were welcome to it said the girl gravely and you have got it  but not in the way he meant returned brice hurriedly this mans death is the result of his attempting to escape from your uncles guards along the road the merit of it belongs to them and your uncle it would be cowardly and mean of me to take advantage of it  the girl looked at him with an expression of mingled admiration and pity but the guards were placed there before he ever saw you said she impatiently and whatever uncle harry may want to do he must do what the gang says and with the money once in their possession or even in yours if they knew it i wouldnt give much for its chancesor yours eitherfor gettin out o this hollow again  but if they are treacherous that is no reason why i should be so protested brice stoutly  youve no right to say they were treacherous when they knew nothing of your plans said the girl sharply your company would have more call to say you were treacherous to it for making a plan without consultin them brice winced for he had never thought of that before you can offer that reward after you get away from here with the greenbacks but she added proudly with a toss of her head go back if you want to tell him all tell him where you found ittell him i did not take you through the canyon but was showin you a new trail i had never shown to them tell him that i am a traitor for i have given them and him away to you a stranger and that you consider yourself the only straight and honest one about here  brice flushed with shame forgive me he said hurriedly you are right and i am wrong again i will do just what you say i will first place these greenbacks in a secure placeand then  get away firstthats your only holt she interrupted him quickly her eyes still flashing through indignant tears come quick for i must put you on the trail before they miss me  she darted forward he followed but she kept the lead as much he fancied to evade his observation as to expedite his going presently they stopped before the sloping trunk of a huge pine that had long since fallen from the height above but although splintered where it had broken ground had preserved some fifty feet of its straight trunk erect and leaning like a ladder against the mountain wall there she said hurriedly pointing to its decaying but still projecting lateral branches you climb iti have at the top youll find its stuck in a cleft among the brush theres a little hollow and an old waterway from a spring above which makes a trail through the brush its as good as the trail you took from the stage road this mornin but its not as safe comin down keep along it to the spring and it will land ye jest the other side of uncle hirams cabin go quick ill wait here until yeve reached the cleft  but you he said turning toward her how can i ever thank you  as if anticipating a leavetaking the girl had already withdrawn herself a few yards away and simply made an upward gesture with her hand quick up with you every minute now is a risk to me  thus appealed to brice could only comply perhaps he was a little hurt at the girls evident desire to avoid a gentler parting securing his prized envelope within his breast he began to ascend the tree its inclination and the aid offered by the broken stumps of branches made this comparatively easy and in a few moments he reached its top and stood upon a little ledge in the wall a swift glance around him revealed the whole waterway or fissure slanting upward along the mountain face then he turned quickly to look down the dizzy height at first he could distinguish nothing but the top of the buckeyes and their white clustering blossoms then something flutteredthe torn white handkerchief of his that she had kept and then he caught a single glimpse of the flowerplumed hat receding rapidly among the trees and flora dimwood was gone   iii  in twentyfour hours edward brice was in san francisco but although successful and the bearer of the treasure it is doubtful if he approached this end of his journey with the temerity he had shown on entering the robbers valley a consciousness that the methods he had employed might excite the ridicule if not the censure of his principals or that he might have compromised them in his meeting with snapshot harry considerably modified his youthful exultation it is possible that floras reproach which still rankled in his mind may have quickened his sensitiveness on that point however he had resolved to tell the whole truth except his episode with flora and to place the conduct of snapshot harry and the tarboxes in as favorable a light as possible but first he had recourse to the manager a man of shrewd worldly experience who had recommended him to his place when he had finished and handed him the treasured envelope the man looked at him with a critical and yet not unkindly expression perhaps its just as well brice that you did come to me at first and did not make your report to the president and directors  i suppose said brice diffidently that they wouldnt have liked my communicating with the highwayman without their knowledge  more than thatthey wouldnt have believed your story  not believe it cried brice flushing quickly do you think  the manager checked him with a laugh hold on i believe every word of it and why because youve added nothing to it to make yourself the regular hero why with your opportunity and no one able to contradict you you might have told me you had a handtohand fight with the thief and had to kill him to recover the money and even brought your handkerchief and hat back with the bullet holes to prove it brice winked as he thought of the fair possessor of those articles but as a story for general circulation it wont do have you told it to any one else does any one know what happened but yourself  brice thought of flora but he had resolved not to compromise her and he had a consciousness that she would be equally loyal to him no one he answered boldly  very good and i suppose you wouldnt mind if it were kept out of the newspapers youre not hankering after a reputation as a hero  certainly not said brice indignantly  well then well keep it where it is you will say nothing i will hand over the greenbacks to the company but only as much of your story as i think theyll stand youre all right as it is yuba bill has already set you up in his report to the company and the recovery of this money will put you higher only the public need know nothing about it  but asked brice amazedly how can it be prevented the shippers who lost the money will have to know that it has been recovered  why should they the company will assume the risk and repay them just the same its a great deal better to have the reputation for accepting the responsibility than for the shippers to think that they only get their money through the accident of its recovery  brice gasped at this large business truth besides it occurred to him that it kept the secret and floras participation in it from snapshot harry and the gang he had not thought of that before  come continued the manager with official curtness what do you say are you willing to leave it to me  brice hesitated a moment it was not what his impulsive truthful nature had suggested it was not what his youthful fancy had imagined he had not worked upon the sympathies of the company on behalf of snapshot harry as he believed he would do he had not even impressed the manager his story far from exciting a chivalrous sentiment had been pronounced improbable yet he reflected he had so far protected her and he consented with a sigh  nevertheless the result ought to have satisfied him a dazzling check inclosed in a letter of thanks from the company the next day and his promotion from the road to the san francisco office would have been quite enough for any one but edward brice yet he was grateful albeit a little frightened and remorseful over his luck he could not help thinking of the kindly tolerance of the highwayman the miserable death of the actual thief which had proved his own salvation and above all the generous highspirited girl who had aided his escape while on his way to san francisco and yet in the first glow of his success he had written her a few lines from marysville inclosed in a letter to mr tarbox he had received no reply  then a week passed he wrote again and still no reply then a vague feeling of jealousy took possession of him as he remembered her warning hint of the attentions to which she was subjected and he became singularly appreciative of snapshot harrys proficiency as a marksman then cruelest of all for your impassioned lover is no lover at all if not cruel in his imaginings he remembered how she had evaded her uncles espionage with him could she not equally with another perhaps that was why she had hurried him awaywhy she had prevented his returning to her uncle following this came another week of disappointment and equally miserable cynical philosophy in which he persuaded himself he was perfectly satisfied with his material advancement that it was the only outcome of his adventure to be recognized and he was more miserable than ever  a month had passed when one morning he received a small package by post the address was in a handwriting unknown to him but opening the parcel he was surprised to find only a handkerchief neatly folded examining it closely he found it was his ownthe one he had given her the rent made by her uncles bullet so ingeniously and delicately mended as to almost simulate embroidery the joy that suddenly filled him at this proof of her remembrance showed him too plainly how hollow had been his cynicism and how lasting his hope turning over the wrapper eagerly he discovered what he had at first thought was some business card it was indeed printed and not engraved in some common newspaper type and bore the address hiram tarbox land and timber agent 1101 california street he again examined the parcel there was nothing elsenot a line from her but it was a clue at last and she had not forgotten him he seized his hat and ten minutes later was breasting the steep sand hill into which california street in those days plunged and again emerged at its crest with a few struggling houses  but when he reached the summit he could see that the outline of the street was still plainly marked along the distance by cottages and new suburban villalike blocks of houses no 1101 was in one of these blocks a small tenement enough but a palace compared to mr tarboxs sierran cabin he impetuously rang the bell and without waiting to be announced dashed into the little drawingroom and mr tarboxs presence that had changed too mr tarbox was arrayed in a suit of clothes as new as cheaply decorative as fresh and apparently as damp as his own drawing room  did you get my letter did you give her the one i inclosed why didnt you answer burst out brice after his first breathless greeting  mr tarboxs face here changed so suddenly into his old dejected doggedness that brice could have imagined himself back in the sierran cabin the man straightened and bowed himself at brices questions and then replied with bold deliberate emphasis  yes i did get your letter i didnt give no letter o yours to her and i didnt answer your letter before for i didnt propose to answer it at all  why demanded brice indignantly  i didnt give her your letter because i didnt kalkilate to be any gobetween twixt you and snapshot harrys niece look yar mr brice sense i read that ar paragraph in that paper you gave me i allowed to myself that it wasnt the square thing for me to have any more doins with him and i quit it i jest chucked your letter in the fire i didnt answer you because i reckoned id no call to correspond with ye and when i showed ye that trail over to harrys camp it was ended ive got a house and business to look arter and it dont jibe with keepin company with road agents thats what i got outer that paper you gave me mr brice  rage and disgust filled brice at the mans utter selfishness and shameless desertion of his kindred none the less powerfully that he remembered the part he himself had played in concocting the paragraph do you mean to say he demanded passionately that for the sake of that foolish paragraph you gave up your own kindred that you truckled to the mean prejudices of your neighbors and kept that poor defenseless girl from the only honest roof she could find refuge under that you dared to destroy my letter to her and made her believe i was as selfish and ungrateful as yourself  young feller said mr tarbox still more deliberately yet with a certain dignity that brice had never noticed before whats between you and flo and what rights she has fer thinkin ye ez selfish and ez ongrateful ez meef she does i dunnobut when ye talk o me givin up my kindred and sling such hogwash ez ongrateful and selfish round this yer sittinroom mebbe it mout occur to ye that harry dimwood might hev his opinion o what was ongrateful and selfish ef id played in between his niece and a young man o the express company his natral enemy its one thing to hev helped ye to see her in her uncles own camp but another to help ye by makin a clandecent postoffis o my cabin ef instead o writin youd hev posted yourself by comin to me you mout hev found out that when i broke with harry i offered to take flo with me for good and allef hed keep away from us and thats the kind o honest roof that that thar poor defenseless girl got under when her crippled mother died three weeks ago and left harry free it was by trucklin to them mean prejudices and readin that thar foolish paragraph that i settled this thing then and thar  brices revulsion of sentiment was so complete and the gratitude that beamed in his eyes was so sincere that mr tarbox hardly needed the profuse apologies which broke from him forgive me he continued to stammer i have wronged you wronged hereverybody but as you know mr tarbox how i have felt over this how deeplyhow passionately  it does make a man loony sometimes said mr tarbox relaxing into demure dryness again so i reckon you did mebbe she reckoned so too for she asked me to give you the handkercher i sent ye it looked as if shed bin doin some fancy work on it  brice glanced quickly at mr tarboxs face it was stolid and imperturbable she had evidently kept the secret of what passed in the hollow to herself for the first time he looked around the room curiously i didnt know you were a land agent before he said  no more i was all that kem out o that paragraph mr brice that man heckshill who was so mighty perlite that night wrote to me afterwards that he didnt know my name till hed seed that paragraph and he wanted to know ef ez a wellknown citizen i could recommend him some timber lands i recommended him half o my own quarter section and he took it hes puttin up a mill thar and thats another reason why we want peace and quietness up thar im tryin betwixt and between us mr brice to get harry to clar out and sell his rights in the valley and the water power on the fork to heckshill and me im opening a business here  then youve left mrs tarbox with miss flora in your cabin while you attend to business here said brice tentatively  not exactly mr brice the old woman thought it a good chance to come to frisco and put flo in one o them catholic convent schoolsthat asks no questions whar the raw logs come from and turns em out firstclass plank all round you foller me mr brice but mrs tarbox is jest in the next room and would admire to tell ye all thisand ill go in and send her to you and with a patronizing wave of the hand mr tarbox complacently disappeared in the hall  mr brice was not sorry to be left to himself in his utter bewilderment flo separated from her detrimental uncle and placed in a convent school tarbox the obscure pioneer a shrewd speculator emerging into success and taking the uncles place and all this within that month which he had wasted with absurd repinings how feeble seemed his own adventure and advancement how even ludicrous his pretensions to any patronage and superiority how this common backwoodsman had set him in his place as easily as she had evaded the advances of the journalist and heckshill they had taught him a lesson perhaps even the sending back of his handkerchief was part of it his heart grew heavy he walked to the window and gazed out with a long sigh  a light laugh that might have been an echo of the one which had attracted him that night in tarboxs cabin fell upon his ear he turned quickly to meet flora dimwoods laughing eyes shining upon him as she stood in the doorway  many a time during that month he had thought of this meetinghad imagined what it would be likewhat would be his manner towards herwhat would be her greeting and what they would say he would be cold gentle formal gallant gay sad trustful reproachful even as the moods in which he thought of her came to his foolish brain he would always begin with respectful seriousness or a frankness equal to her own but never never again would he offend as he had offended under the buckeyes and now with her pretty face shining upon him all his plans his speeches his preparations vanished and left him dumb yet he moved towards her with a brief articulate something on his lipssomething between a laugh and a sighbut that really was a kiss andin point of factpromptly folded her in his arms  yet it was certainly direct and perhaps the best that could be done for the young lady did not emerge from it as coolly as unemotionally nor possibly as quickly as she had under the shade of the buckeyes but she persuaded himby still holding his handto sit beside her on the chilly highly varnished green rep sofa albeit to him it was a bank in a bower of enchantment then she said with adorable reproachfulness you dont ask what i did with the body  mr edward brice started he was young and unfamiliar with the evasive expansiveness of the female mind at such supreme moments  the bodyoh yescertainly  i buried it myselfit was suthin too awfuland the gang would have been sure to have found it and the empty belt i burned that so that nobody knows nothin  it was not a time for strictly grammatical negatives and i am afraid that the girls characteristically familiar speech even when pathetically corrected here and there by the influence of the convent endeared her the more to him and when she said and now mr edward brice sit over at that end of the sofy and lets talk they talked they talked for an hour more or less continuously until they were surprised by a discreet cough and the entrance of mrs tarbox then there was more talk and the discovery that mr brice was long due at the office  ye might drop in now and then whenever ye feel like it and flo is at home suggested mrs tarbox at parting  mr brice did drop in frequently during the next month on one of these occasions mr tarbox accompanied him to the door and nowez everything is settled and in order mr brice and ef you should be wantin to say anything about it to your bosses at the office ye may mention my name ez flo dimwoods second cousin and say im a depositor in their bank and with greater deliberation ef anything at any time should be thrown up at ye for marryin a niece o snapshot harrys ye might mention keerless like that snapshot harry under the name o henry j dimwood has held shares in their old bank for years     a treasure of the redwoods   part i  mr jack fleming stopped suddenly before a lifeless and decaying redwoodtree with an expression of disgust and impatience it was the very tree he had passed only an hour before and he now knew he had been describing that mysterious and hopeless circle familiar enough to those lost in the woods  there was no mistaking the tree with its one broken branch which depended at an angle like the arm of a semaphore nor did it relieve his mind to reflect that his mishap was partly due to his own foolish abstraction he was returning to camp from a neighboring mining town and while indulging in the usual daydreams of a youthful prospector had deviated from his path in attempting to make a short cut through the forest he had lost the sun his only guide in the thickly interlaced boughs above him which suffused though the long columnar vault only a vague melancholy twilight he had evidently penetrated some unknown seclusion absolutely primeval and untrodden the thick layers of decaying bark and the desiccated dust of ages deadened his footfall and invested the gloom with a profound silence  as he stood for a moment or two irresolute his ear by this time attuned to the stillness caught the faint but distinct lap and trickle of water he was hot and thirsty and turned instinctively in that direction a very few paces brought him to a fallen tree at the foot of its upturned roots gurgled the spring whose upwelling stream had slowly but persistently loosened their hold on the soil and worked their ruin a pool of cool and clear water formed by the disruption of the soil overflowed and after a few yards sank again in the sodden floor  as he drank and bathed his head and hands in this sylvan basin he noticed the white glitter of a quartz ledge in its depths and was considerably surprised and relieved to find hard by an actual outcrop of that rock through the thick carpet of bark and dust this betokened that he was near the edge of the forest or some rocky opening he fancied that the light grew clearer beyond and the presence of a few fronds of ferns confirmed him in the belief that he was approaching a different belt of vegetation presently he saw the vertical beams of the sun again piercing the opening in the distance with this prospect of speedy deliverance from the forest at last secure he did not hurry forward but on the contrary coolly retraced his footsteps to the spring again the fact was that the instincts and hopes of the prospector were strongly dominant in him and having noticed the quartz ledge and the contiguous outcrop he determined to examine them more closely he had still time to find his way home and it might not be so easy to penetrate the wilderness again unfortunately he had neither pick pan nor shovel with him but a very cursory displacement of the soil around the spring and at the outcrop with his hands showed him the usual red soil and decomposed quartz which constituted an indication yet none knew better than himself how disappointing and illusive its results often were and he regretted that he had not a pan to enable him to test the soil by washing it at the spring if there were only a miners cabin handy he could easily borrow what he wanted it was just the usual luckthe things a man sees when he hasnt his gun with him  he turned impatiently away again in the direction of the opening when he reached it he found himself on a rocky hillside sloping toward a small green valley a light smoke curled above a clump of willows it was from the chimney of a low dwelling but a second glance told him that it was no miners cabin there was a larger clearing around the house and some rude attempt at cultivation in a roughly fenced area nevertheless he determined to try his luck in borrowing a pick and pan there at the worst he could inquire his way to the main road again  a hurried scramble down the hill brought him to the dwellinga rambling addition of sheds to the usual log cabin but he was surprised to find that its exterior and indeed the palings of the fence around it were covered with the stretched and drying skins of animals the pelts of bear panther wolf and fox were intermingled with squirrel and wildcat skins and the displayed wings of eagle hawk and kingfisher there was no trail leading to or from the cabin it seemed to have been lost in this opening of the encompassing woods and left alone and solitary  the barking of a couple of tethered hounds at last brought a figure to the door of the nearest leanto shed it seemed to be that of a young girl but it was clad in garments so ridiculously large and disproportionate that it was difficult to tell her precise age a calico dress was pinned up at the skirt and tightly girt at the waist by an apronso long that one corner had to be tucked in at the apron string diagonally to keep the wearer from treading on it an enormous sunbonnet of yellow nankeen completely concealed her head and face but allowed two knotted and twisted brown tails of hair to escape under its frilled cape behind she was evidently engaged in some culinary work and still held a large tin basin or pan she had been cleaning clasped to her breast  flemings eye glanced at it covetously ignoring the figure behind it but he was diplomatic  i have lost my way in the woods can you tell me in what direction the main road lies  she pointed a small red hand apparently in the direction he had come straight over tharacross the hill  fleming sighed he had been making a circuit of the forest instead of going through itand this open space containing the cabin was on a remote outskirt  how far is it to the road he asked  jest a spell arter ye rise the hill ef ye keep longside the woods but its a right smart chance beyond ef ye go through it  this was quite plain to him in the local dialect a spell was under a mile a right smart chance might be three or four miles farther luckily the spring and outcrop were near the outskirts he would pass near them again on his way he looked longingly at the pan which she still held in her hands would you mind lending me that pan for a little while he said half laughingly  wot for demanded the girl quickly yet her tone was one of childish curiosity rather than suspicion fleming would have liked to avoid the question and the consequent exposure of his discovery which a direct answer implied but he saw it was too late now  i want to wash a little dirt he said bluntly  the girl turned her deep sunbonnet toward him somewhere in its depths he saw the flash of white teeth go along with yeyere funnin she said  i want to wash out some dirt in that panim prospecting for gold he said dont you understand  are ye a miner  well yesa sort of one he returned with a laugh  then yed better be scootin out o this mighty quick afore dad comes he dont cotton to miners and wont have em around thats why he lives out here  well i dont live out here responded the young man lightly i shouldnt be here if i hadnt lost my way and in half an hour ill be off again so im not likely to bother him but he added as the girl still hesitated ill leave a deposit for the pan if you like  leave a which  the money that the pans worth said fleming impatiently  the huge sunbonnet stiffly swung around like the windsail of a ship and stared at the horizon i dont want no money ye kin git said the voice in its depths  look here he said desperately i only wanted to prove to you that ill bring your pan back safe now look if you dont like to take money ill leave this ring with you until i come back there he slipped a small specimen ring made out of his first gold findings from his little finger  the sunbonnet slowly swung around again and stared at the ring then the little red right hand reached forward took the ring placed it on the forefinger of the left hand with all the other fingers widely extended for the sunbonnet to view and all the while the pan was still held against her side by the other hand fleming noticed that the hands though tawny and not over clean were almost childlike in size and that the forefinger was much too small for the ring he tried to fathom the depths of the sunbonnet but it was dented on one side and he could discern only a single pale blue eye and a thin black arch of eyebrow  well said fleming is it a go  of course yell be comin back for it again said the girl slowly  there was so much of hopeless disappointment at that prospect in her voice that fleming laughed outright im afraid i shall for i value the ring very much he said  the girl handed him the pan its our bread pan she said  it might have been anything for it was by no means new indeed it was battered on one side and the bottom seemed to have been broken but it would serve and fleming was anxious to be off thank you he said briefly and turned away the hound barked again as he passed he heard the girl say shut your head tige and saw her turn back into the kitchen still holding the ring before the sunbonnet  when he reached the woods he attacked the outcrop he had noticed and detached with his hands and the aid of a sharp rock enough of the loose soil to fill the pan this he took to the spring and lowering the pan in the pool began to wash out its contents with the centrifugal movement of the experienced prospector the saturated red soil overflowed the brim with that liquid ooze known as slumgullion and turned the crystal pool to the color of blood until the soil was washed away then the smaller stones were carefully removed and examined and then another washing of the now nearly empty pan showed the fine black sand covering the bottom this was in turn as gently washed away  alas the clean pan showed only one or two minute glistening yellow scales like pinheads adhering from their specific gravity to the bottom gold indeed but merely enough to indicate the color and common to ordinary prospecting in his own locality  he tried another panful with the same result he became aware that the pan was leaky and that infinite care alone prevented the bottom from falling out during the washing still it was an experiment and the result a failure  fleming was too old a prospector to take his disappointment seriously indeed it was characteristic of that performance and that period that failure left neither hopelessness nor loss of faith behind it the prospector had simply miscalculated the exact locality and was equally as ready to try his luck again but fleming thought it high time to return to his own mining work in camp and at once set off to return the pan to its girlish owner and recover his ring  as he approached the cabin again he heard the sound of singing it was evidently the girls voice uplifted in what seemed to be a fragment of some negro campmeeting hymn       dar was a poor man and his name it was lazarum      lord bress de lambglory hallelugerum      lord bress de lamb  the first two lines had a brisk movement accented apparently by the clapping of hands or the beating of a tin pan but the refrain lord bress de lamb was drawn out in a lugubrious chant of infinite tenuity       the rich man died and he went straight to hellerum      lord bress de lambglory hallelugerum      lord bress de lamb  fleming paused at the cabin door before he could rap the voice rose again       when ye see a poo man be sure to give him crumbsorum      lord bress de lambglory hallelugerum      lord bress de lamb  at the end of this interminable refrain drawn out in a youthful nasal contralto fleming knocked the girl instantly appeared holding the ring in her fingers i reckoned it was you she said with an affected briskness to conceal her evident dislike at parting with the trinket there it is  but fleming was too astounded to speak with the opening of the door the sunbonnet had fallen back like a buggy top disclosing for the first time the head and shoulders of the wearer she was not a child but a smart young woman of seventeen or eighteen and much of his embarrassment arose from the consciousness that he had no reason whatever for having believed her otherwise  i hope i didnt interrupt your singing he said awkwardly  it was only one o mammys campmeetin songs said the girl  your mother is she in he asked glancing past the girl into the kitchen  taint mothershes dead mammys our old nurse shes gone to jimtown and taken my duds to get some new ones fitted to me these are some o mothers  this accounted for her strange appearance but fleming noticed that the girls manner had not the slightest consciousness of their unbecomingness nor of the charms of face and figure they had marred  she looked at him curiously hev you got religion  well no said fleming laughing im afraid not  dad hezhes got it powful  is that the reason he dont like miners asked fleming  take not to yourself the mammon of unrighteousness said the girl with the confident air of repeating a lesson thats what the book says  but i read the bible too replied the young man  dad says the letter killeth said the girl sententiously  fleming looked at the trophies nailed on the walls with a vague wonder if this peculiar scriptural destructiveness had anything to do with his skill as a marksman the girl followed his eye  dads a mighty hunter afore the lord  what does he do with these skins  trades em off for grub and fixins but he dont believe in trottin round in the mud for gold  dont you suppose these animals would have preferred it if he had gold hunting takes nothing from anybody  the girl stared at him and then to his great surprise laughed instead of being angry it was a very fascinating laugh in her imperfectly nourished pale face and her little teeth revealed the bluish milky whiteness of pips of young indian corn  wot yer lookin at she asked frankly  you he replied with equal frankness  its them duds she said looking down at her dress i reckon i aint got the hang o em  yet there was not the slightest tone of embarrassment or even coquetry in her manner as with both hands she tried to gather in the loose folds around her waist  let me help you he said gravely  she lifted up her arms with childlike simplicity and backed toward him as he stepped behind her drew in the folds and pinned them around what proved a very small waist indeed then he untied the apron took it off folded it in half and retied its curtailed proportions around the waist it does feel a heap easier she said with a little shiver of satisfaction as she lifted her round cheek and the tail of her blue eyes with their brown lashes over her shoulder it was a tempting momentbut jack felt that the whole race of gold hunters was on trial just then and was adamant perhaps he was a gentle fellow at heart too  i could loop up that dress also if i had more pins he remarked tentatively jack had sisters of his own  the pins were forthcoming in this operationa kind of festooningthe girls petticoat a piece of common washedout blue flannel as pale as her eyes but of the commonest material became visible but without fear or reproach to either  there that looks more tidy said jack critically surveying his work and a little of the small ankles revealed the girl also examined it carefully by its reflection on the surface of the saucepan looks a little like a chiny girl dont it  jack would have resented this thinking she meant a chinese until he saw her pointing to a cheap crockery ornament representing a dutch shepherdess on the shelf there was some resemblance  you beat mammy out o sight she exclaimed gleefully it will jest set her clear crazy when she sees me  then you had better say you did it yourself said fleming  why asked the girl suddenly opening her eyes on him with relentless frankness  you said your father didnt like miners and he mightnt like your lending your pan to me  im more afraid o lyin than o dad she said with an elevation of moral sentiment that was however slightly weakened by the addition mammyll say anything ill tell her to say  well goodby said fleming extending his hand  ye didnt tell me what luck ye had with the pan she said delaying taking his hand  fleming shrugged his shoulders oh my usual lucknothing he returned with a smile  ye seem to keer more for gettin yer old ring back than for any luck she continued i reckon you aint much o a miner  im afraid not  ye didnt say wot yer name was in case dad wants to know  i dont think he will want to but its john fleming  she took his hand you didnt tell me yours he said holding the little red fingers in case i wanted to know  it pleased her to consider the rejoinder intensely witty she showed all her little teeth threw away his hand and said  g long with ye mr fleming its tinka  tinker  yes short for katinkakatinka jallinger  goodby miss jallinger  goodby dads name is henry boone jallinger of kentucky ef ye was ever askin  thank you  he turned away as she swiftly reentered the house as he walked away he half expected to hear her voice uplifted again in the campmeeting chant but he was disappointed when he reached the top of the hill he turned and looked back at the cabin  she was apparently waiting for this and waved him an adieu with the humble pan he had borrowed it flashed a moment dazzlingly as it caught the declining sun and then went out even obliterating the little figure behind it   part ii  mr jack fleming was indeed not much of a miner he and his partnersboth as young hopeful and inefficient as himselfhad for three months worked a claim in a mountain mining settlement which yielded them a certain amount of healthy exercise goodhumored grumbling and exalted independence to dig for three or four hours in the morning smoke their pipes under a redwoodtree for an hour at noon take up their labors again until sunset when they washed up and gathered sufficient gold to pay for their daily wants was without their seeking it or even knowing it the realization of a charming socialistic ideal which better men than themselves had only dreamed of fleming fell back into this refined barbarism giving little thought to his woodland experience and no revelation of it to his partners he had transacted their business at the mining town his deviations en route were nothing to them and small account to himself  the third day after his return he was lying under a redwood when his partner approached him  you arent uneasy in your mind about any unpaid billsay a wash billthat youre owing  why  theres a big nigger woman in camp looking for you shes got a folded account paper in her hand it looks deucedly like a bill  there must be some mistake suggested fleming sitting up  she says not and shes got your name pat enough faulkner his other partner headed her straight up the gulch away from camp while i came down to warn you so if you choose to skedaddle into the brush out there and lie low until we get her away well fix it  nonsense ill see her  his partner looked aghast at this temerity but fleming jumping to his feet at once set out to meet his mysterious visitor this was no easy matter as the ingenious faulkner was laboriously leading his charge up the steep gulch road with great politeness but many audible misgivings as to whether this was not jack flemings day for going to jamestown  he was further lightening the journey by cheering accounts of the recent depredations of bears and panthers in that immediate locality when overtaken by fleming he affected a start of joyful surprise to conceal the look of warning which fleming did not heedhaving no eyes but for faulkners companion she was a very fat negro woman panting with exertion and suppressed impatience flemings heart was filled with compunction  is you marse fleming she gasped  yes said fleming gently what can i do for you  well ye kin pick dis yar insek dis caterpillier she said pointing to faulkner off my paf ye kin tell dis yar chipmunk dat when he comes to showin me mule tracks for bar tracks hes barkin up de wrong tree dat when he tells me dat he sees panfers apromenadin round in de short grass or hidin behime rocks in de open he haint talkin to no nigger chile but a growed woman ye kin tell him dat mammy curtis lived in de woods afo he was born and hez seen more bars and mountain lyuns dan he hez hairs in his mustarches  the word mammy brought a flash of recollection to fleming  i am very sorry he began but to his surprise the negro woman burst into a goodtempered laugh  all right honey slongs you is marse fleming and de man dat took dat ar pan offer tinka de odder day i aint mindin yo frens bedevilments ive got somefin fo you yar and a little box and she handed him a folded paper  fleming felt himself reddening he knew not why at which faulkner discreetly but ostentatiously withdrew conveying to his other partner painful conviction that fleming had borrowed a pan from a traveling tinker whose negro wife was even now presenting a bill for the same and demanding a settlement relieved by his departure fleming hurriedly tore open the folded paper it was a letter written upon a leaf torn out of an old account book whose ruled lines had undoubtedly given his partners the idea that it was a bill fleming hurriedly read the following traced with a pencil in a schoolgirls hand   mr j fleming  dear sirafter you went away that day i took that pan you brought back to mix a batch of bread and biscuits the next morning at breakfast dad says whats gone o them thar biscuitsmy teeth is just broke with themtheyre so grittytheyre abominable whats this says he and with that he chucks over to me two or three flakes of gold that was in them you see what had happened mr fleming was this you had better luck than you was knowing of it was this way some of the gold you washed had got slipped into the sides of the pan where it was broke and the sticky dough must have brought it out and i kneaded them up unbeknowing of course i had to tell a wicked lie but be ye all things to all men says the book and i thought you ought to know your good luck and i send mammy with this and the gold in a little box of course if dad was a hunter of mammon and not of gods own beasts he would have been mighty keen about finding where it came from but he allows it was in the water in our near spring so goodby do you care for your ring now as much as you did  yours very respectfully  katinka jallinger   as mr fleming glanced up from the paper mammy put a small cardboard box in his hand for an instant he hesitated to open it not knowing how far mammy was intrusted with the secret to his great relief she said briskly well dar now dat jobs done gone and often my hans i allow to quit and jest get off dis yer camp afo ye kin shake a stick so dont tell me nuffin i aint gotter tell when i goes back  fleming understood you can tell her i thank herandill attend to it he said vaguely that isi  hold dar thats just enuff honeyno mo so long to ye and youse folks  he watched her striding away toward the main road and then opened the box  it contained three flakes of placer or surface gold weighing in all about a quarter of an ounce they could easily have slipped into the interstices of the broken pan and not have been observed by him if this was the result of the washing of a single panand he could now easily imagine that other flakes might have escapedwhatbut he stopped dazed and bewildered at the bare suggestion he gazed upon the vanishing figure of mammy could shecould katinkahave the least suspicion of the possibilities of this discovery or had providence put the keeping of this secret into the hands of those who least understood its importance for an instant he thought of running after her with a word of caution but on reflection he saw that this might awaken her suspicion and precipitate a discovery by another  his only safety for the present was silence until he could repeat his experiment and that must be done quickly  how should he get away without his partners knowledge of his purpose he was too loyal to them to wish to keep this good fortune to himself but he was not yet sure of his good fortune it might be only a little pocket which he had just emptied it might be a larger one which another trial would exhaust  he had put up no notice he might find it already in possession of katinkas father or any chance prospector like himself in either case he would be covered with ridicule by his partners and the camp or more seriously rebuked for his carelessness and stupidity no he could not tell them the truth nor could he lie he would say he was called away for a day on private business  luckily for him the active imagination of his partners was even now helping him the theory of the tinker and the pan was indignantly rejected by his other partner his blushes and embarrassment were suddenly remembered by faulkner and by the time he reached his cabin they had settled that the negro woman had brought him a love letter he was young and good looking what was more natural than that he should have some distant love affair  his embarrassed statement that he must leave early the next morning on business that he could not at present disclose was considered amply confirmatory and received with maliciously significant acquiescence only said faulkner at your age sonnyhe was nine months older than flemingi should have gone tonight surely providence was favoring him  he was off early the next morning he was sorely tempted to go first to the cabin but every moment was precious until he had tested the proof of his good fortune  it was high noon before he reached the fringe of forest a few paces farther and he found the spring and outcrop to avert his partners suspicions he had not brought his own implements but had borrowed a pan spade and pick from a neighbors claim before setting out the spot was apparently in the same condition as when he left it and with a beating heart he at once set to work an easy task with his new implements he nervously watched the water overflow the pan of dirt at its edges until emptied of earth and gravel the black sand alone covered the bottom a slight premonition of disappointment followed a rich indication would have shown itself before this a few more workings and the pan was quite empty except for a few pinpoints of color almost exactly the quantity he found before he washed another pan with the same result another taken from a different level of the outcrop yielded neither more nor less there was no mistake it was a failure his discovery had been only a little pocket and the few flakes she had sent him were the first and last of that discovery  he sat down with a sense of relief he could face his partners again without disloyalty he could see that pretty little figure once more without the compunction of having incurred her fathers prejudices by locating a permanent claim so near his cabin in fact he could carry out his partners fancy to the letter  he quickly heaped his implements together and turned to leave the wood but he was confronted by a figure that at first he scarcely recognized yetit was katinka the young girl of the cabin who had sent him the gold she was dressed differentlyperhaps in her ordinary everyday garmentsa bright sprigged muslin a chip hat with blue ribbons set upon a coil of luxurious brown hair but what struck him most was that the girlish and diminutive character of the figure had vanished with her illfitting clothes the girl that stood before him was of ordinary height and of a prettiness and grace of figure that he felt would have attracted anywhere fleming felt himself suddenly embarrasseda feeling that was not lessened when he noticed that her pretty lip was compressed and her eyebrows a little straightened as she gazed at him  ye made a bee line for the woods i see she said coldly i allowed ye might have been droppin in to our house first  so i should said fleming quickly but i thought i ought to first make sure of the information you took the trouble to send me he hesitated to speak of the ill luck he had just experienced he could laugh at it himselfbut would she  and ye got a new pan she said half poutingly  here seemed his opportunity yes but im afraid it hasnt the magic of yours i havent even got the color i believe you bewitched your old pan  her face flushed a little and brightened and her lip relaxed with a smile go long with yer ye dont mean to say ye had no luck today  nonebut in seeing you  her eyes sparkled ye see i said all long ye werent much o a miner ye aint got no faith ef ye had as much as a grain o mustard seed yed remove mountains its in the book  yes and this mountain is on the bedrock and my faith is not strong enough he said laughingly and then that would be having faith in mammon and you dont want me to have that  she looked at him curiously i jest reckon ye dont care a picayune whether ye strike anything or not she said half admiringly  to please you ill try again if youll look on perhaps youll bring me luck as you did before you shall take the pan i will fill it and you shall wash it out youll be my mascot  she stiffened a little at this and then said pertly wots that  my good fairy  she smiled again this time with a new color in her pale face maybe i am she said with sudden gravity  he quickly filled the pan again with soil brought it to the spring and first washed out the greater bulk of loose soil now come here and kneel down beside me he said and take the pan and do as i show you  she knelt down obediently suddenly she lifted her little hand with a gesture of warning wait a minitjest a minittill the water runs clear again  the pool had become slightly discolored from the first washing  that makes no difference he said quickly  ah but wait please she laid her brown hand upon his arm a pleasant warmth seemed to follow her touch then she said joyously look down there  where he asked  theredont ye see it  see what  you and me  he looked where she pointed the pool had settled resumed its mirrorlike calm and reflected distinctly not only their two bending faces but their two figures kneeling side by side two tall redwoods rose on either side of them like the columns before an altar  there was a moment of silence the drone of a bumblebee near by seemed to make the silence swim drowsily in their ears far off they heard the faint beat of a woodpecker the suggestion of their kneeling figures in this magic mirror was vague unreasoning yet for the moment none the less irresistible his arm instinctively crept around her little waist as he whisperedhe scarce knew what he saidperhaps here is the treasure i am seeking  the girl laughed released herself and sprang up the pan sank ingloriously to the bottom of the pool where fleming had to grope for it assisted by tinka who rolled up her sleeve to her elbow for a minute or two they washed gravely but with no better success than attended his own individual efforts the result in the bottom of the pan was the same fleming laughed  you see he said gayly the mammon of unrighteousness is not for meat least so near your fathers tabernacle  that makes no difference now said the girl quickly for dad is goin to move anyway farther up the mountains he says its gettin too crowded for him herewhen the last settler took up a section three miles off  and are you going too asked the young man earnestly  tinka nodded her brown head fleming heaved a genuine sigh well ill try my hand here a little longer ill put up a notice of claim i dont suppose your father would object you know he couldnt legally  i reckon ye might do it ef ye wantedef ye was that keen on gettin gold said tinka looking away there was something in the girls tone which this budding lover resented he had become sensitive  oh well he said i see that it might make unpleasantness with your father i only thought he went on with tenderer tentativeness that it would be pleasant to work here near you  yed be only wastin yer time she said darkly  fleming rose gravely perhaps youre right he answered sadly and a little bitterly and ill go at once  he walked to the spring and gathered up his tools thank you again for your kindness and goodby  he held out his hand which she took passively and he moved away  but he had not gone far before she called him he turned to find her still standing where he had left her her little hands clinched at her side and her widely opened eyes staring at him suddenly she ran at him and catching the lapels of his coat in both hands held him rigidly fast  no no ye shant goye mustnt go she said with hysterical intensity i want to tell ye something listenyouyoumr fleming ive been a wicked wicked girl ive told lies to dadto mammyto you ive borne false witnessim worse than sapphiraive acted a big lie oh mr fleming ive made you come back here for nothing ye didnt find no gold the other day there wasnt any it was all me iisalted that pan  salted it echoed fleming in amazement  yes salted it she faltered thats what dad says they call itwhat those wicked sons of mammon do to their claims to sell them iput gold in the pan myself it wasnt there before  but why gasped fleming  she stopped then suddenly the fountains in the deep of her blue eyes were broken up she burst into a sob and buried her head in her hands and her hands on his shoulder becausebecauseshe sobbed against himi wanted you to come back  he folded her in his arms he kissed her lovingly forgivingly gratefully tearfully smilinglyand paused then he kissed her sympathetically understandingly apologetically explanatorily in lieu of other conversation then becoming coherent he asked  but where did you get the gold  oh she said between fitful and despairing sobs somewherei dont knowout of the old runlong agowhen i was little i didnt never dare say anything to dadhed have been crazy mad at his own daughter digginand i never cared nor thought a single bit about it until i saw you  and you have never been there since  never  nor anybody else  no  suddenly she threw back her head her chip hat fell back from her face rosy with a dawning inspiration oh say jackyou dont think thatafter all this timethere mightshe did not finish the sentence but grasping his hand cried come  she caught up the pan he seized the shovel and pick and they raced like boy and girl down the hill when within a few hundred feet of the house she turned at right angles into the clearing and saying dont be skeered dads away ran boldly on still holding his hand along the little valley at its farther extremity they came to the run a halfdried watercourse whose rocky sides were marked by the erosion of winter torrents it was apparently as wild and secluded as the forest spring nobody ever came here said the girl hurriedly after dad sunk the well at the house  one or two pools still remained in the run from the last seasons flow water enough to wash out several pans of dirt  selecting a spot where the white quartz was visible fleming attacked the bank with the pick after one or two blows it began to yield and crumble away at his feet he washed out a panful perfunctorily more intent on the girl than his work she eager alert and breathless had changed places with him and become the anxious prospector but the result was the same he threw away the pan with a laugh to take her little hand but she whispered try again  he attacked the bank once more with such energy that a great part of it caved and fell filling the pan and even burying the shovel in the debris he unearthed the latter while tinka was struggling to get out the pan  the mean thing is stuck and wont move she said pettishly i think its broken now too just like ours  fleming came laughingly forward and putting one arm around the girls waist attempted to assist her with the other the pan was immovable and indeed seemed to be broken and bent suddenly he uttered an exclamation and began hurriedly to brush away the dirt and throw the soil out of the pan  in another moment he had revealed a fragment of decomposed quartz like discolored honeycombed cheese half filling the pan but on its side where the pick had struck it glancingly there was a yellow streak like a ray of sunshine and as he strove to lift it he felt in that unmistakable omnipotency of weight that it was seamed and celled with gold   the news of mr flemings engagement two weeks later to the daughter of the recluse religious hunter who had made a big strike at lone run excited some skeptical discussion even among the honest congratulations of his partners  thats a mighty queer story how jack got that girl sweet on him just by borrowin a prospectin pan of her said faulkner between the whiffs of his pipe under the trees you and me might have borrowed a hundred prospectin pans and never got even a drink thrown in then to think of that old preachin coonhunter hevin to give in and pass his strike over to his daughters feller jest because he had scruples about gold diggin himself hed hev booted you and me outer his ranch first  lord ye aint takin no stock in that hogwash responded the other why everybody knows old man jallinger pretended to be sick o miners and minin camps and couldnt bear to hev em near him only jest because he himself was all the while secretly prospectin the whole lode and didnt want no interlopers it was only when fleming nippled in by gettin hold o the girl that jallinger knew the secret was out and thats the way he bought him off why jack wasnt no minernever wasye could see that he never struck anything the only treasure he found in the woods was tinka jallinger     a belle of canada city   cissy was tying her hat under her round chin before a small glass at her window the window gave upon a background of serrated mountain and oliveshadowed canyon with a faint additional outline of a higher snow levelthe only dreamy suggestion of the whole landscape the foreground was a glaringly fresh and unpicturesque mining town whose irregular attempts at regularity were set forth with all the cruel uncompromising clearness of the californian atmosphere there was the straight main street with its new brick block of stores ending abruptly against a tangled bluff there was the ruthless clearing in the sedate pines where the hideous spire of the new church imitated the soaring of the solemn shafts it had displaced with almost irreligious mockery yet this foreground was cissys worldher life her sole girlish experience she did not however bother her pretty head with the view just then but moved her cheek up and down before the glass the better to examine by the merciless glare of the sunlight a few freckles that starred the hollows of her temples like others of her sex she was a poor critic of what was her real beauty and quarreled with that peculiar texture of her healthy skin which made her face as eloquent in her sunkissed cheek as in her bright eyes and expression nevertheless she was somewhat consoled by the ravishing effect of the bowknot she had just tied and turned away not wholly dissatisfied indeed as the acknowledged belle of canada city and the daughter of its principal banker small wonder that a certain frank vanity and childlike imperiousness were among her faultsand her attractions  she bounded down the stairs and into the front parlor for their house possessed the unheardof luxury of a double drawingroom albeit the second apartment contained a desk and was occasionally used by cissys father in private business interviews with anxious seekers of advances who shunned the publicity of the bank here she instantly flew into the arms of her bosom friend miss piney tibbs a girl only a shade or two less pretty than herself who always more or less ill at ease in these splendors was awaiting her impatiently for miss tibbs was merely the daughter of the hotelkeeper and although tibbs was a southerner and had owned his own niggers in the states she was of inferior position and a protegee of cissys  thank goodness youve come exclaimed miss tibbs for ive bin sittin here till i nigh took root what kep ye  how does it look responded cissy as a relevant reply  the it referred to cissys new hat and to the young girl the coherence was perfectly plain miss tibbs looked at it severely it would not do for a protegee to be too complaisant  hem must have cost a heap o money  it did came from the best milliner in san francisco  of course said piney with half assumed envy when your popper runs the bank and just wallows in gold  never mind dear replied cissy cheerfully soll your popper some day im goin to get mine to let your popper into somethingditch stocks and such yes true o king popperll do anything for me she added a little loftily  loyal as piney was to her friend she was by no means convinced of this she knew the difference between the two men and had a vivid recollection of hearing her own father express his opinion of cissys respected parent as a gold shark and quartz miner crusher it did not however affect her friendship for cissy she only said lets come caught cissy around the waist pranced with her out into the veranda and gasped out of breath where are we goin first  down main street said cissy promptly  and lets stop at markhams store theyve got some new things in from sacramento added piney  country styles returned cissy with a supercilious air no besides markhams head clerk is gettin too presumptuous just guess he asked me while i was buyin something if i enjoyed the dance last monday  but you danced with him said the simple piney in astonishment  but not in his store among his customers said cissy sapiently no were going down main street past secamps those secamp girls are sure to be at their windows looking out this hat will just turn em greengreener than ever  youre just horrid ciss said piney with admiration  and then continued cissy well just sail down past the new block to the parsons and make a call  oh i see said piney archly itll be just about the time when the new engineer of the mill works has a clean shirt on and is smoking his cigyar before the office  cissy tossed her hat disdainfully much anybody cares whether hes there or not i havent forgotten how he showed us over the mill the other day in a pair of overalls just like a workman  but they say hes awfully smart and well educated and neednt work and im sure its very nice of him to dress just like the other men when hes with em urged piney  bah that was just to show that he didnt care what we thought of him hes that conceited and it wasnt respectful considering one of the directors was there all dressed up dont tell me you can see it in his eye looking you over without blinking and then turning away as if hed got enough of you he makes me tired  piney did not reply the engineer had seemed to her to be a singularly attractive young man yet she was equally impressed with cissys superior condition which could find flaws in such perfection following her friend down the steps of the veranda they passed into the staring graveled walk of the new garden only recently recovered from the wild wood its accurate diamond and heart shaped beds of vivid green set in white quartz borders giving it the appearance of elaborately iced confectionery a few steps further brought them to the road and the wooden sidewalk to main street which carried civic improvements to the hillside and mr trixits very door turning down this thoroughfare they stopped laughing and otherwise assumed a conscious half artificial air for it was the hour when canada city lounged listlessly before its shops its saloons its offices and mills or even held lazy meetings in the dust of the roadway and the passage down the principal street of its two prettiest girls was an event to be viewed as if it were a civic procession hats flew off as they passed place was freely given impeding barrels and sacks were removed from the wooden pavement and preoccupied indwellers hastily summoned to the front door to do homage to cissy trixit and piney as they went by not but that canada city in the fierce and unregenerate days of its youth had seen fairer and higher colored faces more gayly bedizened on its thoroughfares but never anything so fresh and innocent men stood there all unconsciously reverencing their absent mothers sisters and daughters in their spontaneous homage to the pair and seemed to feel the wholesome breath of their eastern homes wafted from the freshly ironed skirts of these foolish virgins as they rustled by i am afraid that neither cissy nor piney appreciated this feeling few women did at that time indeed these young ladies assumed a slight air of hauteur  really they do stare so said cissy with eyes dilating with pleasurable emotion well have to take the back street next time  piney proud in the glory reflected from cissy and in her own answered we willsure  there was only one interruption to this triumphal progress and that was so slight as to be noticed by only one of the two girls as they passed the new works at the mill the new engineer as piney had foreseen was leaning against the doorpost smoking a pipe he took his hat from his head and his pipe from his month as they approached and greeted them with an easy goodafternoon yet with a glance that was quietly observant and tolerantly critical  there said cissy when they had passed didnt i tell you did you ever see such conceit in your born days i hope you did not look at him  piney conscious of having done so and of having blushed under his scrutiny nevertheless stoutly asserted that she had merely looked at him to see who it was but cissy was placated by passing the secamps cottage from whose window the three strapping daughters of john secamp lately an emigrant from missouri were as cissy had surmised lightening the household duties by gazing at theto themunwonted wonders of the street whether their complexions still bearing traces of the alkali dust and inefficient nourishment of the plains took a more yellow tone from the spectacle of cissys hat i cannot say cissy thought they did perhaps piney was nearer the truth when she suggested that they were only looking to enable them to make a homemade copy of the hat next week  their progress forward and through the outskirts of the town was of the same triumphal character teamsters withheld their oaths and their uplifted whips as the two girls passed by weary miners toiling in ditches looked up with a pleasure that was half reminiscent of their past younger skylarkers stopped in their horseplay with half smiling half apologetic faces more ambitious riders on the highway urged their horses to greater speed under the girls inspiring eyes and vaquero billy charging them full tilt brought up his mustang on its haunches and rigid forelegs with a sweeping bow of his sombrero within a foot of their artfully simulated terror in this way they at last reached the clearing in the forest the church with its ostentatious spire and the reverend mr windibrooks dwelling otherwise humorously known as the pastorage where cissy intended to call  the reverend mr windibrook had been selected by his ecclesiastical superiors to minister to the spiritual wants of canada city as being what was called a hearty man certainly if considerable lung capacity absence of reserve and power of handshaking and back slapping were necessary to the redemption of canada city mr windibrooks ministration would have been successful but singularly enough the rude miner was apt to resent this familiarity and it is recorded that isaac wood otherwise known as grizzly woods once responded to a cheerful back slap from the reverend gentleman by an ostentatiously friendly hug which nearly dislocated the parsons ribs perhaps mr windibrook was more popular on account of his admiring enthusiasm of the prosperous moneygetting members of his flock and a singular sympathy with their methods and mr trixits daring speculations were an especially delightful theme to him  ah miss trixit he said as cissy entered the little parlor and how is your dear father still startling the money market with his fearless speculations this brother jones turning to a visitor is the daughter of our napoleon of finance montagu trixit only last week in that deal in the comstock he cleared fifty thousand dollars yes sir repeating it with unction fiftythousanddollarsin about two hours and with a single stroke of the pen i believe i am not overstating miss trixit he added appealing to cissy with a portentous politeness that was as badly fitting as his previous heartiness  cissy colored slightly i dont know she said simply she was perfectly truthful she knew nothing of her fathers business except the vague reputation of his success  her modesty however produced a singular hilarity in mr windibrook and a playful push you dont know ha but i do yes sirto the visitori have reason to remember it i called upon him the next day i used sir the freedom of an old friend trixit i said clapping my hand on his shoulder the lord has been good to you i congratulate you  hm he said without looking up what do you reckon those congratulations are worth  many a man sir who didnt know his style would have been staggered but i knew my man i looked him straight in the eye a new organ i said and as good a one as sacramento can turn out  he took up a piece of paper scrawled a few lines on it to his cashier and said will that do mr windibrooks voice sank to a thrilling whisper it was an order for one thousand dollars fact sir that is the father of this young lady  ye had better luck than bishop briggs had with old johnson the excelsior bank president said the visitor encouraged by windibrooks heartiness into a humorous retrospect briggs goes to him for a subscription for a new fence round the buryingroundthe old one havin rotted away ye dont want no fence sez johnson short like no fence round a buryinground sez briggs starin no them as is in the buryinground cant get out and them as isnt dont want to get in nohow so you kin just traveli aint givin money away on uselessnesses ha ha  a chill silence followed which checked even pineys giggle mr windibrook evidently had no heartiness for nonsubscribing humor there are those who can jest with sacred subjects he said ponderously but i have always found mr trixit though blunt eminently practical your father is still away he added shifting the conversation to cissy hovering wherever he can extract the honey to store up for the provision of age an industrious worker  hes still away said cissy feeling herself on safe ground though she was not aware of her fathers entomological habits in san francisco i think  she was glad to get away from mr windibrooks heartiness and console herself with mrs windibrooks constitutional depression which was partly the result of nervous dyspepsia and her husbands boisterous cordiality i suppose dear you are dreadfully anxious about your father when he is away from home she said to cissy with a sympathetic sigh  cissy conscious of never having felt a moments anxiety and accustomed to his absences replied naively why  oh responded mrs windibrook on account of his great business responsibilities you know so much depends upon him  again cissy did not comprehend she could not understand why this masterful man her father who was equal to her own and it seemed everybodys needs had any responsibility or was not as infallible and constant as the sunshine or the air she breathed without being his confidante or even his associate she had since her mothers death no other experience youthfully alive to the importance of their wealth it seemed to her however only a natural result of being his daughter she smiled vaguely and a little impatiently they might have talked to her about herself it was a little tiresome to always have to answer questions about her popper nevertheless she availed herself of mrs windibrooks invitation to go into the garden and see the new summerhouse that had been put up among the pines and gradually diverted her hostesss conversation into gossip of the town if it was somewhat lugubrious and hesitating it was however a relief to cissy and bearing chiefly upon the vicissitudes of others gave her the comforting glow of comparison  touching the complexion of the secamp girls mrs windibrook attributed it to their great privations in the alkali desert one day continued mrs windibrook when their father was ill with fever and ague they drove the cattle twenty miles to water through that dreadful poisonous dust and when they got there their lips were cracked and bleeding and their eyelids like burning knives and mamie secamps hair which used to be a beautiful brown like your own my dear was bleached into a rusty yellow  and they will wear colors that dont suit them said cissy impatiently  never mind dear said mrs windibrook ambiguously i suppose they will have their reward  nor was the young engineer discussed in a lighter vein it pains me dreadfully to see that young man working with the common laborers and giving himself no rest just because he says he wants to know exactly how the thing is done and why the old works failed she remarked sadly when mr windibrook knew he was the son of judge masterton and had rich relations he wished of course to be civil but somehow young masterton and he didnt hit off indeed mr windibrook was told that he had declared that the prosperity of canada city was only a mushroom growth and it seems too shocking to repeat dear but they say he said that the new churchour churchwas simply using the almighty as a big bluff to the other towns of course mr windibrook couldnt see him after that why he even said your father ought to send you to school somewhere and not let you grow up in this half civilized place  strangely enough cissy did not hail this corroboration of her dislike to young masterton with the liveliness one might have expected perhaps it was because piney tibbs was no longer present having left cissy at the parsonage and returned home still she enjoyed her visit after a fashion romped with the younger windibrooks and climbed a tree in the security of her sylvan seclusion and the promptings of her still healthy girlish blood and only came back to cake and tea and her new hat which she had prudently hung up in the summerhouse as the afternoon was waning when they returned to the house they found that mr windibrook had gone out with his visitor and cissy was spared the advertisement of a boisterous escort home which he generally insisted upon she gayly took leave of the infant windibrook and his mother sallied out into the empty road and once more became conscious of her new hat  the shadows were already lengthening and a cool breeze stirred the deep aisles of the pines on either side of the highway one or two people passed her hurriedly talking and gesticulating evidently so preoccupied that they did not notice her again a rapid horseman rode by without glancing round overtook the pedestrians exchanged a few hurried words with them and then spurred swiftly away as one of them shouted after him theres another dispatch confirming it a group of men talking by the roadside failed to look up as she passed cissy pouted slightly at this want of taste which made some late election news or the report of a horse race more enthralling than her new hat and its owner even the toilers in the ditches had left their work and were congregated around a man who was reading aloud from a widely margined extra of the canada city press it seemed provoking as she knew her cheeks were glowing from her romp and was conscious that she was looking her best however the secamps cottage was just before her and the girls were sure to be on the lookout she shook out her skirts and straightened her pretty little figure as she approached the house but to her surprise her coming had evidently been anticipated by them and they were actuallyand unexpectedlyawaiting her behind the low whitewashed garden palings as she neared them they burst into a shrill discordant laugh so full of irony gratified malice and mean exaltation that cissy was for a moment startled but only for a moment she had her fathers reckless audacity and bore them down with a display of such pink cheeks and flashing eyes that their laughter was checked and they remained openmouthed as she swept by them  perhaps this incident prevented her from noticing another but more passive one a group of men standing before the new millthe same men who had so solicitously challenged her attention with their bows a couple of hours agoturned as she approached and suddenly dispersed it was not until this was repeated by another group that its oddity forced itself upon her still angry consciousness then the street seemed to be full of those excited preoccupied groups who melted away as she advanced only one man met her curious eyesthe engineeryet she missed the usual critical smile with which he was wont to greet her and he gave her a bow of such profound respect and gravity that for the first time she felt really uneasy was there something wrong with her hat that dreadful fateful hat was it too conspicuous did he think it was vulgar she was eager to cross the street on the next block where there were large plateglass windows which she and pineyif piney were only with her nowhad often used as mirrors  but there was a great crowd on the next block congregated around the bankher fathers bank a vague terror she knew not what now began to creep over her she would have turned into a side street but mingled with her fear was a resolution not to show itnot to even think of itto combat it as she had combated the horrid laugh of the secamp girls and she kept her way with a beating heart but erect head without looking across the street  there was another crowd before the newspaper officealso on the other sideand a bulletin board but she would not try to read it only one idea was in her mindto reach home before any one should speak to her for the last intelligible sound that had reached her was the laugh of the secamp girls and this was still ringing in her ears seeming to voice the hidden strangeness of all she saw and stirring her as that had with childish indignation she kept on with unmoved face however and at last turned into the planked sideterracea part of her fathers munificenceand reached the symmetrical gardenbeds and graveled walk she ran up the steps of the veranda and entered the drawingroom through the open french window glancing around the familiar room at her fathers closed desk at the open piano with the piece of music she had been practicing that morning the whole walk seemed only a foolish dream that had frightened her she was cissy trixit the daughter of the richest man in the town this was her fathers house the wonder of canada city  a ring at the front doorbell startled her without waiting for the servant to answer it she stepped out on the veranda and saw a boy whom she recognized as a waiter at the hotel kept by pineys father he was holding a note in his hand and staring intently at the house and garden seeing cissy he transferred his stare to her snatching the note from him she tore it open and read in pineys wellknown scrawl dad wont let me come to you now dear but ill try to slip out late tonight why should she want to come she had said nothing about coming nowand why should her father prevent her cissy crushed the note between her fingers and faced the boy  what are you staring atidiot  the boy grinned hysterically a little frightened at cissys straightened brows and snapping eyes  get away theres no answer  the boy ran off and cissy returned to the drawingroom then it occurred to her that the servant had not answered the bell she rang again furiously there was no response she called down the basement staircase and heard only the echo of her voice in the depths how still the house was were they all outsusan norah the cook the chinaman and the gardener she ran down into the kitchen the back door was open the fires were burning dishes were upon the table but the kitchen was empty upon the floor lay a damp copy of the extra she picked it up quickly several black headlines stared her in the face enormous defalcation montagu trixit absconded 50000 dollars missing run on the bank  she threw the paper through the open door as she would have hurled back the accusation from living lips then in a revulsion of feeling lest any one should find her there she ran upstairs and locked herself in her own room  so that was what it all meant allfrom the laugh of the secamp girls to the turning away of the townspeople as she went by her father was a thief who had stolen money from the bank and run away leaving her alone to bear it no it was all a liea wicked jealous lie a foolish lie for how could he steal money from his own bank cissy knew very little of her fatherperhaps that was why she believed in him she knew still less of business but she knew that he did she had often heard them say itperhaps the very ones who now called him names he who had made canada city what it was he who windibrook said only today had like moses touched the rocks of the canada with his magic wand of finance and streams of public credit and prosperity had gushed from it she would never speak to them again she would shut herself up here dismiss all the servants but the chinaman and wait until her father returned  there was a knock and the entreating voice of norah the cook outside the door cissy unlocked it and flung it open indignantly  ah its yourself missand i never knew ye kem back till i met that gossoon of a hotel waiter in the street said the panting servant sure it was only an hour ago while i was at me woorrck in the kitchen and jim rushes in and sez for the love of god if iver ye want to see a blessed cint of the money ye put in the masthers bank off wid ye now and draw it outfor theres a run on the bank  it was an infamous lie said cissy fiercely  sure miss how was oi to know and if the masther has gone away its ownly takin me money from the other divils down there thats drawin it out and dividin it betwixt and between them  cissy had a very vague idea of what a run on the bank meant but norahs logic seemed to satisfy her feminine reason she softened a little  mr windibrook is in the parlor miss and a jintleman on the veranda continued norah encouraged  cissy started ill come down she said briefly  mr windibrook was waiting beside the piano with his soft hat in one hand and a large white handkerchief in the other he had confidently expected to find cissy in tears and was ready with boisterous condolement but was a little taken aback as the young girl entered with a pale face straightened brows and eyes that shone with audacious rebellion however it was too late to change his attitude ah my young friend he said a little awkwardly we must not give way to our emotions but try to recognize in our trials the benefits of a great lesson but he added hurriedly seeing her stand still silent but erect before him i see that you do he paused coughed slightly cast a glance at the verandawhere cissy now for the first time observed a man standing in an obviously assumed attitude of negligent abstractionmoved towards the back room and in a lower voice said a word with you in private  without replying cissy followed him  if said mr windibrook with a sickly smile you are questioned regarding your fathers affairs you may remember his peculiar and utterly unsolicited gift of a certain sum towards a new organ to which i alluded today you can say that he always expressed great liberality towards the church and it was no surprise to you  cissy only stared at him with dangerous eyes  mrs windibrook continued the reverend gentleman in his highest heartiest voice albeit a little hurried wished me to say to you that until you heard fromyour friendsshe wanted you to come and stay with her do come do  cissy with her bright eyes fixed upon her visitor said i shall stay here  but said mr windibrook impatiently you cannot that man you see on the veranda is the sheriffs officer the house and all that it contains are in the hands of the law  cissys face whitened in proportion as her eyes grew darker but she said stoutly i shall stay here till my popper tells me to go  till your popper tells you to go repeated mr windibrook harshly dropping his heartiness and his handkerchief in a burst of unguarded temper your papa is a thief escaping from justice you foolish girl a disgraced felon who dare not show his face again in canada city and you are lucky yes lucky miss if you do not share his disgrace  and youre a wicked wicked liar said cissy clinching her little fists at her side and edging towards him with a sidelong bantamlike movement as she advanced her freckled cheek close to his with an effrontery so like her absconding father that he recoiled before it and a mean doublefaced hypocrite too didnt you always praise him didnt you call him a napoleon and amoses didnt you say he was the making of canada city didnt you get him to raise your salary and start a subscription for your new house oh youyoustinking beast  here the stranger on the veranda still gazing abstractedly at the landscape gave a low and apparently unconscious murmur as if enraptured with the view mr windibrook recalled to an attempt at dignity took up his hat and handkerchief when you have remembered yourself and your position miss trixit he said loftily the offer i have made you  i despise it id sooner stay in the woods with the grizzlies and rattlesnakes said cissy pantingly go and leave me alone do you hear she stamped her little foot are you listening go  mr windibrook promptly retreated through the door and down the steps into the garden at which the stranger on the veranda reluctantly tore himself away from the landscape and slowly entered the parlor through the open french window here however he became equally absorbed and abstracted in the condition of his beard carefully stroking his shaven cheek and lips and pulling his goatee  after a pause he turned to the angry cissy standing by the piano radiant with glowing cheeks and flashing eyes and said slowly i reckon you gave the parson as good as he sent it kinder settles a man to hear the frozen truth about himself sometimes and youve helped old shadbelly considerably on the way towards salvation but he was right about one thing miss trixit the house is in the hands of the law im representing it as deputy sheriff mebbe you might remember mejake poolewhen your father was addressing the last citizens meeting sittin next to him on the platformim in possession it isnt a job im hankerin much arter id a lief rather hunt hoss thieves or track down road agents than this kind o fancy underhand work so youll excuse me miss if i aint got the style he paused rubbed his chin thoughtfully and then said slowly and with great deliberation ef theres any little thing here missany keepsakes or such trifles ez you keer for in partickler things you wouldnt like strangers to haveyou just make a little pile of em and drop em down somewhere outside the back door there aint no inventory taken nor sealin up of anythin done just yet though i have to see there aint anythin disturbed but i kalkilate to walk out on that veranda for a spell and look at the landscape he paused again and said with a sigh of satisfaction its a mighty pooty view out thar it just takes me every time  as he turned and walked out through the french window cissy did not for a moment comprehend him then strangely enough his act of rude courtesy for the first time awakened her to the full sense of the situation this house her fathers house was no longer hers if her father should never return she wanted nothing from it nothing she gripped her beating heart with the little hand she had clinched so valiantly a moment ago suddenly her hand dropped some one had glided noiselessly into the back room a figure in a blue blouse a chinaman their house servant ah fe he cast a furtive glance at the stranger on the veranda and then beckoned to her stealthily she came towards him wonderingly when he suddenly whipped a note from his sleeve and with a dexterous movement slipped it into her fingers she tore it open a single glance showed her a small key inclosed in a line of her fathers handwriting drawing quickly back into the corner she read as follows if this reaches you in time take from the second drawer of my desk an envelope marked private contracts and give it to the bearer there was neither signature nor address  putting her finger to her lips she cast a quick glance at the absorbed figure on the veranda and stepped before the desk she fitted the key to the drawer and opened it rapidly but noiselessly there lay the envelope and among other ticketed papers a small roll of greenbackssuch as her father often kept there it was his money she did not scruple to take it with the envelope handing the latter to the chinaman who made it instantly disappear up his sleeve like a conjurers act she signed him to follow her into the hall  who gave you that note ah fe she whispered breathlessly  chinaman  who gave it to him  chinaman  and to him  nollee chinaman  another chinaman  yesheap chinamanallee same as gang  you mean it

questioning eyes  lettee me see him said ah fe  cissy handed him the missive he examined closely some halfadozen chinese characters that were scrawled along the length of the outer fold and which she had innocently supposed were a part of the markings of the rice paper on which the note was written  heap chinaman velly much walkeelongee way spose you look he pointed through the open front door to the prospect beyond it was a familiar one to cissythe long canada the crest on crest of serried pines and beyond the dim snowline ah fes brown finger seemed to linger there  in the snow she whispered her cheek whitening like that dim line but her eyes sparkling like the sunshine over it  allee same john said ah fe plaintively  ah fe whispered cissy take me with you to hop li  no good said ah fe

do  the young girl was irresistible ah fes face relaxed allee litee he said with a resigned smile  you wait here a moment said cissy brightening she flew up the staircase in a few minutes she was back again she had exchanged her smart rosesprigged chintz for a pathetic little bluechecked frock of her schooldays the fateful hat had given way to a brown straw flat bent like a frame around her charming face all the girlishness and indeed a certain honest boyishness of her nature seemed to have come out in her glowing freckled cheek brilliant audacious eyes and the quick stride which brought her to ah fes side  now lets go she said out the back way and down the side streets she paused cast a glance through the drawingroom at the contemplative figure of the sheriffs deputy on the veranda and then passed out of the house forever    the excitement over the failure of montagu trixits bank did not burn itself out until midnight by that time however it was pretty well known that the amount of the defalcations had been exaggerated that it had been preceded by the suspension of the excelsior bank of san francisco of which trixit was also a managing director occasioned by the discovery of the withdrawal of securities for use in the branch bank at canada city that he had fled the state eastward across the sierras yet that owing to the vigilance of the police on the frontier he had failed to escape and was in hiding but there were adverse reports of a more sinister nature it was said that others were implicated that they dared not bring him to justice it was pointed out that there was more concern among many who were not openly connected with the bank than among its unfortunate depositors besides the inevitable downfall of those who had invested their fortunes in it there was distrust or suspicion everywhere even trixits enemies were forced to admit the saying that canada city was the bank and the bank was trixit  perhaps this had something to do with an excited meeting of the directors of the new mill to whose discussions dick masterton the engineer had been hurriedly summoned when the president told him that he had been selected to undertake the difficult and delicate mission of discovering the whereabouts of montagu trixit and if possible procuring an interview with him he was amazed what had the new mill which had always kept itself aloof from the bank and its methods to do with the disgraced manager he was still more astonished when the president added bluntly  trixit holds securities of ours for money advanced to the mill by himself privately they do not appear on the books but if he chooses to declare them as assets of the bank its a bad thing for us if he is bold enough to keep them he may be willing to make some arrangement with us to carry them on if he has got away or committed suicide as some say its for you to find the whereabouts of the securities and get them he is said to have been last seen near the summit you understand our position  masterton did with suppressed disgust but he was young and there was the thrill of adventure in this i will go he said quietly  we thought you would you must take the up stage tonight come again and get your final instructions by the way you might get some information at trixits house youererare acquainted with his daughter i think  which makes it quite impossible for me to seek her for such a purpose said masterton coldly  a few hours later he was on the coach as they cleared the outskirts of the town they passed two chinamen plodding sturdily along in the dust of the highway    mr masterton started from a slight doze in the heavy lumbering mountain wagon which had taken the place of the smart concord coach that he had left at the last station the scenery too had changed the four horses threaded their way through rocky defiles of stunted larches and hardy brush with here and there open patches of shrunken snow yet at the edge of declivities he could still see through the rolledup leather curtains the valley below bathed in autumn the glistening rivers half spent with the long summer drought and the green slopes rolling upward into crest after crest of ascending pines at times a drifting haze always imperceptible from below veiled the view a chill wind blew through the vehicle and made the steel sledgerunners that hung beneath the wagon ready to be shipped under the useless wheels an ominous provision a few rude stations half blacksmith shops half grocery marked the deserted but wellworn road along narrow packers wagon or a tortuous file of chinamen carrying mysterious bundles depending from bamboo poles was their rare and only company the rough sheepskin jackets which these men wore over their characteristic blue blouses and their heavy leggings were a new revelation to masterton accustomed to the thinly clad coolie of the mines they seemed a distinct race  i never knew those chaps get so high up but they seem to understand the cold he remarked  the driver looked up and ejaculated his disgust and his tobacco juice at the same moment  i reckon theyre everywhar in californy whar you want em and whar you dont you take my word for it afore long californy will hev to reckon that she ginerally dont want em ef a white man has to live here with a race tied up together in a language ye cant understand ways that no feller knowsfrom their prayin to devils swappin their wives and havin their bones sent back to chinywot are ye goin to do and where are ye wot are ye goin to make outer men that look so much alike ye cant tell em apart that think alike and act alike and never in ways that ye kin catch on to fellers knotted together in some underhand secret way o communicatin with each other so that ef ye kick a chinaman up here on the summit another chinaman will squeal in the valley and the way they do it just gets me look yer ill tell ye somethin that happened thats gospel truth some of the boys that reckoned to hev some fun with the chinee gang over at cedar camp started out one afternoon to raid em they groped along through the woods whar nobody could see em kalkilatin to come down with a rush on the camp over two miles away and nobody did see em only one chinaman wot they met a mile from the camp burnin punk to his joss or devil and he scooted away just in the contrary direction well sir when they waltzed into that camp darn my skin ef there was a chinaman there or as much as a grain of rice to grab somebody had warned em well this sort o got the boys and they set about discoverin how it was done one of em noticed that there was some of them bits of tissue paper slips that they toss around at funerals lyin along the road near the camp and another remembered that the chinaman they met on the hill tossed a lot of that paper in the air afore he scooted well sir the wind carried just enough of that paper straight down the hill into that camp ten minutes afore they could get there to give them chinamen warninwhatever it was fact why ive seen em stringin along the road just like them fellers we passed just now and then stop all of a suddent like hounds off the scent jabber among themselves and start off in a different direction  just what theyre doing now by thunder interrupted another passenger who was looking through the rolledup curtain at his side  all the passengers turned by one accord and looked out the file of chinamen under observation had indeed turned and was even then moving rapidly away at right angles from the road  got some signal you bet said the driver some yeller paper or piece o joss stick in the road what  the remark was addressed to the passenger who had just placed his finger on his lip and indicated a stolidlooking chinaman overlooked before who was sitting in the back or steerage seat  oh he be darned said the driver impatiently he is no account hes only the laundryman from rocky canyon im talkin of the coolie gang  but here the conversation flagged and the air growing keener the flaps of the leather side curtains were battened down masterton gave himself up to conflicting reflections the information that he had gathered was meagre and unsatisfactory and he could only trust to luck and circumstance to fulfill his mission the first glow of adventure having passed he was uneasily conscious that the mission was not to his taste the pretty flushed but defiant face of cissy that afternoon haunted him he had not known the immediate cause of it but made no doubt that she had already heard the news of her fathers disgrace when he met her he regretted now that he hadnt spoken to her if only a few formal words of sympathy he had always been half tenderly amused at her frank conceit and her airsthe innocent undisguised pride of the country belle so different from the hard aplomb of the city girl and now the foolish little moth dancing in the sunshine of prosperity had felt the chill of winter in its pretty wings the contempt he had for the father had hitherto shown itself in tolerant pity for the daughter so proud of her fathers position and what it brought her in the revelation that his own directors had availed themselves of that fathers methods and the ignoble character of his present mission he felt a stirring of selfreproach what would become of her of course frivolous as she was she would not feel the keenness of this misfortune like another nor yet rise superior to it she would succumb for the present to revive another season in a dimmer glory elsewhere his critical cynical observation of her had determined that any filial affection she might have would be merged and lost in the greater deprivation of her position  a sudden darkening of the landscape below and a singular opaque whitening of the air around them aroused him from his thoughts the driver drew up the collar of his overcoat and laid his whip smartly over the backs of his cattle the air grew gradually darker until suddenly it seemed to disintegrate into invisible gritty particles that swept through the wagon presently these particles became heavier more perceptible and polished like small shot and a keen wind drove them stingingly into the faces of the passengers or insidiously into their pockets collars or the folds of their clothes the snow forced itself through the smallest crevice  well get over this when once weve passed the bend the road seems to dip beyond said masterton cheerfully from his seat beside the driver  the driver gave him a single scornful look and turned to the passenger who occupied the seat on the other side of him i dont like the look o things down there but ef we are stuck well have to strike out for the next station  but said masterton as the wind volleyed the sharp snow pellets in their faces and the leaders were scarcely distinguishable through the smokelike discharges it cant be worse than here  the driver did not speak but the other passenger craned over his back and said explanatorily  i reckon ye dont know these storms this kind o dry snow dont stick and dont clog look  indeed between the volleys masterton could see that the road was perfectly bare and windswept and except slight drifts and banks beside outlying bushes and shrubswhich even then were again blown away before his eyesthe level landscape was unclothed and unchanged where these mysterious snow pellets went to puzzled and confused him they seemed to vanish as they had appeared into the air about them  id make a straight rush for the next station said the other passenger confidently to the driver if were stuck were that much on the way if we turn back now well have to take the grade anyway when the storms over and neither you nor i know when thatll be it may be only a squall just now but its gettin rather late in the season just pitch in and drive all ye know  the driver laid his lash on the horses and for a few moments the heavy vehicle dashed forward in violent conflict with the storm at times the elastic hickory framework of its domed leather roof swayed and bent like the ribs of an umbrella at times it seemed as if it would be lifted bodily off at times the whole interior of the vehicle was filled with a thin smoke by drifts through every cranny but presently to mastertons great relief the interminable level seemed to end and between the whitened blasts he could see that the road was descending again the horses were urged forward and at last he could feel that the vehicle began to add the momentum of its descent to its conflict with the storm the blasts grew less violent or became only the natural resistance of the air to their dominant rush with the cessation of the snow volleys and the clearing of the atmosphere the road became more strongly defined as it plunged downward to a terrace on the mountain flank several hundred feet below presently they came again upon a thicker growth of bushes and here and there a solitary fir the wind died away the cold seemed to be less bitter masterton in his relief glanced smilingly at his companions on the box but the drivers mouth was compressed as he urged his team forward and the other passenger looked hardly less anxious they were now upon the level terrace and the storm apparently spending its fury high up and behind them but in spite of the clearing of the air he could not but notice that it was singularly dark what was more singular the darkness seemed to have risen from below and to flow in upon them as they descended a curtain of profound obscurity darker even than the mountain wall at their side shut out the horizon and the valley below but for the temperature masterton would have thought a thunderstorm was closing in upon them an odd feeling of uneasiness crept over him  a few fitful gusts now came from the obscurity one of them was accompanied by what seemed a flight of small startled birds crossing the road ahead of them a second larger and more sustained flight showed his astonished eyes that they were white and each bird an enormous flake of snow for an instant the air was filled with these disks shreds patchestwo or three clinging togetherlike the downfall shaken from a tree striking the leather roof and sides with a dull thud spattering the road into which they descended with large rosettes that melted away only to be followed by hundreds more that stuck and stayed in five minutes the ground was white with it the long road gleaming out ahead in the darkness the roof and sides of the wagon were overlaid with it as with a coating of plaster of paris the harness of the horses and even the reins stood out over their steaming backs like white trappings in five minutes more the steaming backs themselves were blanketed with it the arms and legs of the outside passengers pinioned to the seats with it and the arms of the driver kept free only by incessant motion it was no longer snowing it was snowballing it was an avalanche out of the slopes of the sky the exhausted horses floundered in it the clogging wheels dragged in it the vehicle at last plunged into a billow of itand stopped  the bewildered and half blinded passengers hurried out into the road to assist the driver to unship the wheels and fit the steel runners in their axles but it was too late by the time the heavy wagon was converted into a sledge it was deeply imbedded in wet and clinging snow the narrow longhandled shovels borrowed from the prospectors kits were powerless before this heavy half liquid impediment at last the driver with an oath relinquished the attempt and unhitching his horses collected the passengers and led them forward by a narrower and more sheltered trail toward the next stations now scarce a mile away the led horses broke a path before them the snow fell less heavily but it was nearly an hour before the straggling procession reached the house and the snowcoated and exhausted passengers huddled and steamed round the redhot stove in the barroom the driver had vanished with his team into the shed mastertons fellow passenger on the boxseat after a few whispered words to the landlord also disappeared  i see youve got jake poole with you said one of the barroom loungers to masterton indicating the passenger who had just left i reckon hes here on the same fool business  masterton looked his surprise and mystification  jake poole the deputy sheriff repeated the other i reckon hes here pretendin to hunt for montagu trixit like the san francisco detectives that kem up yesterday  masterton with difficulty repressed a start he had heard of poole but did not know him by sight i dont think i understand he said coolly  i reckon youre a stranger in these parts returned the lounger looking at masterton curiously ef you warnt yed know that about the last man san francisco or canada city wanted to ketch is monty trixit he knows too much and they know it but theyve got to keep up a show chasea kind o cirkisridinup here to satisfy the stockholders you bet that jake poole hez got his ordersthey might kill him to shut his mouth ef they got an excuseand he made a fightbut he aint no such fool no sir why the sickest man you ever saw was that director that kem up here with a detective when he found that monty hadnt left the state  then he is hiding about here said masterton with assumed calmness  the man paused lowered his voice and said i wouldnt swear he wasnt a mile from whar were talkin now why they do allow that hes taken a drink at this very bar since the news cameand that thars a hoss kept handy in the stable already saddled just to tempt him ef he was inclined to scoot  thats only a bluff to start him goin so that they kin shoot him in his tracks said a bystander  that aint no good ef he has as they say he has papers stowed away with a friend that would frighten some mighty partickler men out o their boots returned the first speaker but hes got his spies too and thar aint a man that crosses the divide as aint spotted by them the officers brag about havin put a cordon around the district and yet theyve just found out that he managed to send a telegraphic dispatch from black rock station right under their noses why only an hour or so arter the detectives and the news arrived here thar kem along one o them emigrant teams from pike and the driver said that a smartlookin chap in storeclothes had come out of an old prospectors cabin up thar on the rise about a mile away and asked for a newspaper and the description the teamster gave just fitted trixit to a t well the information was give so public like that the detectives had to make a rush over thar and bgosh although thar wasnt a soul passed them but a file of chinese coolies when they got thar they found nothinnothin but them chinamen cookin their rice by the roadside  masterton smiled carelessly and walked to the window as if intent upon the still falling snow but he had at once grasped the situation that seemed now almost providential for his inexperience and his mission the man he was seeking was within his possible reach if the story he had heard was true the detectives would not be likely to interfere with his plans for he was the only man who really wished to meet the fugitive the presence of poole made him uneasy though he had never met the man before was it barely possible that he was on the same mission on behalf of others if what he heard was true there might be others equally involved with the absconding manager but then the spieshow could the deputy sheriff elude them and how could he  he was turning impatiently away from the window when his eye caught sight of a straggling file of chinamen breasting the storm on their way up the hill a sudden idea seized him perhaps they were the spies in question he remembered the drivers story a sudden flash of intuition made him now understand the singular way the file of coolies which they met had diverted their course after passing the wagon they had recognized the deputy on the box staythere was another chinaman in the coach he might have given them the signal he glanced hurriedly around the room for him he was gone perhaps he had already joined the file he had just seen his only hope was to follow thembut how and how to do it quietly the afternoon was waning it would be three or four hours before the down coach would arrive from which the driver expected assistance now if ever was his opportunity  he made his way through the back door and found himself among the straw and chips of the stableyard and woodshed still uncertain what to do he mechanically passed before the long shed which served as temporary stalls for the steaming wagon horses at the further end to his surprise was a tethered mustang ready saddled and bridledthe opportune horse left for the fugitive according to the loungers story masterton cast a quick glance around the stable it was deserted by all save the feeding animals  he was new to adventures of this kind or he would probably have weighed the possibilities and consequences he was ordinarily a thoughtful reflective man but like most men of intellect he was also imaginative and superstitious and this crowning accident of the providential situation in which he found himself was superior to his logic there would also be a grim irony in his taking this horse for such a purpose he again looked and listened there was no one within sight or hearing he untied the rope from the bitring leaped into the saddle and emerged cautiously from the shed the wet snow muffled the sound of the horses hoofs moving round to the rear of the stable so as to bring it between himself and the station he clapped his heels into the mustangs flanks and dashed into the open  at first he was confused and bewildered by the half hidden boulders and snowshrouded bushes that beset the broken ground and dazzled by the still driving storm but he knew that they would also divert attention from his flight and beyond he could now see a white slope slowly rising before him near whose crest a few dark spots were crawling in file like alpine climbers they were the chinamen he was seeking he had reasoned that when they discovered they were followed they would in the absence of any chance of signaling through the storm detach one of their number to give the alarm him he would follow he felt his revolver safe on his hip he would use it only if necessary to intimidate the spies  for some moments his ascent through the wet snow was slow and difficult but as he advanced he felt a change of temperature corresponding to that he had experienced that afternoon on the wagon coming down the air grew keener the snow drier and finer he kept a sharp lookout for the moving figures and scanned the horizon for some indication of the prospectors deserted hut suddenly the line of figures he was watching seemed to be broken and then gathered together as a group had they detected him evidently they had for as he had expected one of them had been detached and was now moving at right angles from the party towards the right with a thrill of excitement he urged his horse forward the group was far to the left and he was nearing the solitary figure but to his astonishment as he approached the top of the slope he now observed another figure as far to the left of the group as he was to the right and that figure he could see even at that distance was not a chinaman he halted for a better observation for an instant he thought it might be the fugitive himself but as quickly he recognized it was another manthe deputy it was he whom the chinaman had discovered it was he who had caused the diversion and the dispatch of the vedette to warn the fugitive his own figure had evidently not yet been detected his heart beat high with hope he again dashed forward after the flying messenger who was undoubtedly seeking the prospectors ruined hut andtrixit  but it was no easy matter at this elevation the snow had formed a crust over which the single chinamana lithe young figureskimmed like a skater while mastertons horse crashed though it into unexpected depths again the runner could deviate by a shorter cut while the horseman was condemned to the one half obliterated trail the only thing in mastertons favor however was that he was steadily increasing his distance from the group and the deputy sheriff and so cutting off their connection with the messenger but the trail grew more and more indistinct as it neared the summit until at last it utterly vanished still he kept up his speed toward the active little figurewhich now seemed to be that of a mere boyskimming over the frozen snow twice a stumble and flounder of the mustang through the broken crust ought to have warned him of his recklessness but now a distinct glimpse of a low blackened shanty the prospectors ruined hut toward which the messenger was making made him forget all else the distance was lessening between them he could see the long pigtail of the fugitive standing out from his bent head when suddenly his horse plunged forward and downward in an awful instant of suspense and twilight such as he might have seen in a dream he felt himself pitched headlong into suffocating depths followed by a shock the crushing weight and steaming flank of his horse across his shoulder utter darkness andmerciful unconsciousness  how long he lay there thus he never knew with his returning consciousness came this strange twilight againthe twilight of a dream he was sitting in the new church at canada city as he had sat the first sunday of his arrival there gazing at the pretty face of cissy trixit in the pew opposite him and wondering who she was again he saw the startled awakened light that came into her adorable eyes the faint blush that suffused her cheek as she met his inquiring gaze and the conscious half conceited half girlish toss of her little head as she turned her eyes away and then a file of brown chinamen muttering some harsh uncouth gibberish interposed between them this was followed by what seemed to be the crashing in of the church roof a stifling heat succeeded by a long deadly chill but he knew that this last was all a dream and he tried to struggle to his feet to see cissys face againa reality that he felt would take him out of this horrible tranceand he called to her across the pew and heard her sweet voice again in answer and then a wave of unconsciousness once more submerged him  he came back to life with a sharp tingling of his whole frame as if pierced with a thousand needles he knew he was being rubbed and in his attempts to throw his torturers aside he saw faintly by the light of a flickering fire that they were chinamen and he was lying on the floor of a rude hut with his first movements they ceased and wrapping him like a mummy in warm blankets dragged him out of the heap of loose snow with which they had been rubbing him toward the fire that glowed upon the large adobe hearth the stinging pain was succeeded by a warm glow a pleasant languor which made even thought a burden came over him and yet his perceptions were keenly alive to his surroundings he heard the chinamen mutter something and then depart leaving him alone but presently he was aware of another figure that had entered and was now sitting with its back to him at a rude table roughly extemporized from a packingbox apparently engaged in writing it was a small chinaman evidently the one he had chased the events of the past few hourshis mission his intentions and every incident of the pursuitflashed back upon him where was he what was he doing here had trixit escaped him  in his exhausted state he was unable to formulate a question which even then he doubted if the chinaman could understand so he simply watched him lazily and with a certain kind of fascination until he should finish his writing and turn round his long pigtail which seemed ridiculously disproportionate to his sizethe pigtail which he remembered had streamed into the air in his flighthad partly escaped from the discovered hat under which it had been coiled but what was singular it was not the wiry black pigtail of his mongolian fellows but soft and silky and as the firelight played upon it it seemed of a shining chestnut brown it was likelikehe stoppedwas he dreaming again a long sigh escaped him  the figure instantly turned he started it was cissy trixit there was no mistaking that charming sensitive face glowing with health and excitement albeit showing here and there the mark of the pigment with which it had been stained now hurriedly washed off a little of it had run into the corners of her eyelids and enhanced the brilliancy of her eyes  he found his tongue with an effort what are you doing here he asked with a faint voice and a fainter attempt to smile  thats what i might ask about you she said pertly but with a slight touch of scorn but i guess i know as well as i do about the others i came here to see my father she added defiantly  and you are thetheonei chased  yes and id have outrun you easily even with your horse to help you she said proudly only i turned back when you went down into that prospectors hole with your horse and his broken neck atop of you  he groaned slightly but more from shame than pain the young girl took up a glass of whiskey ready on the table and brought it to him take that it will fetch you all right in a moment popper says no bones are broken  masterton waived the proffered glass your fatheris he here he asked hurriedly recalling his mission  not now hes gone to the stationtofetchmy clothes she said with a little laugh  to the station repeated masterton bewildered  yes she replied to the station of course you dont know the news she added with an air of girlish importance theyve stopped all proceedings against him and hes as free as you are  masterton tried to rise but another groan escaped him he was really in pain cissys bright eyes softened she knelt beside him her soft breath fanning his hair and lifted him gently to a sitting position  oh ive done it before she laughed as she read his wonder with his gratitude in his eyes the horse was already stiff and you were nearly so by the time i came up to you and gotshe laughed againthe other chinaman to help me pull you out of that hole  i know i owe you my life he said his face flushing  it was lucky i was there she returned naively perhaps lucky you were chasing me  im afraid that of the many who would run after you i should be the least lucky he said with an attempt to laugh that did not however conceal his mortification but i assure you that i only wished to have an interview with your fathera business interview perhaps as much in his interest as my own  the old look of audacity came back to her face i guess thats what they all came here for except one but it didnt keep them from believing and saying he was a thief behind his back yet they all wanted hisconfidence she added bitterly  masterton felt that his burning cheeks were confessing the truth of this you excepted one he said hesitatingly  yesthe deputy sheriff he came to help me  you  yes me a coquettish little toss of her head added to his confusion he threw up his job just to follow me without my knowing it to see that i didnt come to any harm he saw me only once too at the house when he came to take possession he said he thought i was clear grit to risk everything to find father and he said he saw it in me when he was there thats how he guessed where i was gone when i ran away and followed me  he was as right as he was lucky said masterton gravely but how did you get here  she slipped down on the floor beside him with an unconscious movement that her masculine garments only made the more quaintly girlish and clasping her knee with both hands looked at the fire as she rocked herself slightly backward and forward as she spoke  it will shock a proper man like you i know she began demurely but i came alone with only a chinaman to guide me i got these clothes from our laundryman so that i shouldnt attract attention i would have got a chinese ladys dress but i couldnt walk in their shoesshe looked down at her little feet encased in wooden sandalsand i had a long way to walk but even if i didnt look quite right to chinamen no white man was able to detect the difference you passed me twice in the stage and you didnt know me i traveled night and day most of the time walking and being passed along from one chinaman to another or when we were alone being slung on a pole between two coolies like a bale of goods i ate what they could give me for i dared not go into a shop or a restaurant i couldnt shut my eyes in their dens so i stayed awake all night yet i got ahead of you and the sheriffthough i didnt know at the time what you were after she added presently  he was overcome with wondering admiration of her courage and of selfreproach at his own shortsightedness this was the girl he had looked upon as a spoiled village beauty satisfied with her small triumphs and provincial elevation and vacant of all other purpose here was shethe allunconscious heroineand he her critic helpless at her feet it was not a cheerful reflection and yet he took a certain delight in his expiation perhaps he had half believed in her without knowing it what could he do or say i regret to say he dodged the question meanly  and you think your disguise escaped detection he said looking markedly at her escaped braid of hair  she followed his eyes rather than his words half pettishly caught up the loosened braid swiftly coiled it around the top of her head and clapping the weatherbeaten and battered conical hat back again upon it defiantly said yes everybody isnt as critical as you are and even you wouldnt beof a chinaman  he had never seen her except when she was arrayed with the full intention to affect the beholders and perfectly conscious of her attractions he was utterly unprepared for this complete ignoring of adornment now albeit he was for the first time aware how her real prettiness made it unnecessary she looked fully as charming in this grotesque headcovering as she had in that paragon of fashion the new hat which had excited his tolerant amusement  im afraid im a very poor critic he said bluntly i never conceived that this sort of thing was at all to your taste  i came to see my father because i wanted to she said with equal bluntness  and i came to see him though i didnt want to he said with a cynical laugh  she turned and fixed her brown eyes inquiringly upon him  why did you come then  i was ordered by my directors  then you did not believe he was a thief she asked her eyes softening  it would ill become me to accuse your father or my directors he answered diplomatically  she was quick enough to detect the suggestion of moral superiority in his tone but woman enough to forgive it youre no friend of windibrook she said i know  i am not he replied frankly  if you would like to see my popper i can manage it she said hesitatingly hell do anything for me she added with a touch of her old pride  who could blame him returned masterton gravely but if he is a free man now and able to go where he likes and to see whom he likes he may not care to give an audience to a mere messenger  you wait and let me see him first said the girl quickly then as the sound of sleighbells came from the road outside she added here he is ill get your clothes they are out here drying by the fire in the shed she disappeared through a back door and returned presently bearing his dried garments dress yourself while i take popper into the shed she said quickly and ran out into the road  masterton dressed himself with difficulty although circulation was now restored and he felt a glow through his warmed clothes he had been sorely bruised and shaken by his fall he had scarcely finished dressing when montagu trixit entered from the shed masterton looked at him with a new interest and a respect he had never felt before there certainly was little of the daughter in this keenfaced resolutelipped man though his brown eyes like hers had the same frank steadfast audacity with a business brevity that was hurried but not unkindly he hoped masterton had fully recovered  thanks to your daughter im all right now said masterton i need not tell you that i believe i owe my life to her energy and courage for i think you have experienced what she can do in that way but you have had the advantage of those who have only enjoyed her social acquaintance in knowing all the time what she was capable of he added significantly  she is a good girl said trixit briefly yet with a slight rise in color on his dark sallow cheek and a sudden wavering of his steadfast eyes she tells me you have a message from your directors i think i know what it is but we wont discuss it now as i am going directly to sacramento i shall not see them but i will give you an answer to take to them when we reach the station i am going to give you a lift there when my daughter is ready and here she is  it was the old cissy that stepped into the room dressed as she was when she left her fathers house two days before oddly enough he fancied that something of her old conscious manner had returned with her clothes and as he stepped with her into the back seat of the covered sleigh in waiting he could not help saying i really think i understand you better in your other clothes  a slight blush mounted to cissys cheek but her eyes were still audacious all the same i dont think youd like to walk down main street with me in that rig although you once thought nothing of taking me over your old mill in your blue blouse and overalls and having apparently greatly relieved her proud little heart by this enigmatic statement she grew so chatty and confidential that the young man was satisfied that he had been in love with her from the first  when they reached the station trixit drew him aside taking an envelope marked private contracts from his pocket he opened it and displayed some papers these are the securities tell your directors that you have seen them safe in my hands and that no one else has seen them tell them that if they will send me their renewed notes dated from today to sacramento within the next three days i will return the securities that is my message  the young man bowed but before the coach started he managed to draw near to cissy you are not returning to canada city he said  the young girl made a gesture of indignation no i am never going there again i go with my popper to sacramento  then i suppose i must say goodby  the girl looked at him in surprise popper says you are coming to sacramento in three days  am i  he looked at her fixedly she returned his glance audaciously steadfastly  you are she said in her low but distinct voice  i will  and he did     what happened at the fonda   part i  well said the editor of the mountain clarion looking up impatiently from his copy whats the matter now  the intruder in his sanctum was his foreman he was also acting as pressman as might be seen from his shirtsleeves spattered with ink rolled up over the arm that had just been working the archimedian lever that moves the world which was the editors favorite allusion to the handpress that strict economy obliged the clarion to use his braces slipped from his shoulders during his work were looped negligently on either side their functions being replaced by one hand which occasionally hitched up his trousers to a securer position a pair of downatheel slippersdear to the country printercompleted his negligee  but the editor knew that the inkspattered arm was sinewy and ready that a stout and loyal heart beat under the soiled shirt and that the slipshod slippers did not prevent its owners foot from being put down very firmly on occasion he accordingly met the shrewd goodhumored blue eyes of his faithful henchman with an interrogating smile  i wont keep you long said the foreman glancing at the editors copy with his habitual half humorous toleration of that work it being his general conviction that news and advertisements were the only valuable features of a newspaper i only wanted to talk to you a minute about makin suthin more o this yer accident to colonel starbottle  well weve a full report of it in havent we said the editor wonderingly i have even made an editorial para about the frequency of these accidents and called attention to the danger of riding those half broken spanish mustangs  yes ye did that said the foreman tolerantly but ye see thars some folks around here that allow it warnt no accident theres a heap of them believe that no runaway hoss ever mauled the colonel ez he got mauled  but i heard it from the colonels own lips said the editor and he surely ought to know  he mout know and he moutnt and if he did know he wouldnt tell said the foreman musingly rubbing his chin with the cleaner side of his arm ye didnt see him when he was picked up did ye  no said the editor only after the doctor had attended him why  jake parmlee ez picked him up outer the ditch says that he was half choked and his black silk neckhandkercher was pulled tight around his throat there was a mark on his nose ez ef some one had tried to gouge out his eye and his left ear was chawed ez ef hed bin down in a reglar roughandtumble clinch  he told me his horse bolted buckjumped threw him and he lost consciousness said the editor positively he had no reason for lying and a man like starbottle who carries a derringer and is a dead shot would have left his mark on somebody if hed been attacked  thats what the boys say is just the reason why he lied he was took suddent dont ye seehed no showand dont like to confess it see a man like him aint goin to advertise that he kin be tackled and left senseless and no one else got hurt by it his political influence would be ruined here  the editor was momentarily staggered at this large truth  nonsense he said with a laugh who would attack colonel starbottle in that fashion he might have been shot on sight by some political enemy with whom he had quarreledbut not beaten  spose it warnt no political enemy said the foreman doggedly  then who else could it be demanded the editor impatiently  thats jest for the press to find out and expose returned the foreman with a significant glance at the editors desk i reckon thats whar the clarion ought to come in  in a matter of this kind said the editor promptly the paper has no business to interfere with a mans statement the colonel has a perfect right to his own secretif there is one which i very much doubt but he added in laughing recognition of the half reproachful half humorous discontent on the foremans face what dreadful theory have you and the boys got about itand what do you expect to expose  well said the foreman very seriously its jest this you see the colonel is mighty sweet on that spanish woman ramierez up on the hill yonder it was her mustang he was ridin when the row happened near her house  well said the editor with disconcerting placidity  wellhesitated the foreman you see theyre a bad lot those greasers especially the ramierez her husband  the editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial prejudice against this race which he himself had always combated ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estatethe last of many leagues formerly owned by the spanish grantee his landlordand had a wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms gambling took place at the fonda and it was said the common prejudice against the mexican did not however prevent the american from trying to win his money  then you think ramierez was jealous of the colonel but in that case he would have knifed himspanish fashionand not without a struggle  theres more ways they have o killin a man than that he might hev been dragged off his horse by a lasso and choked said the foreman darkly  the editor had heard of this vaquero method of putting an enemy hors de combat but it was a clumsy performance for the public road and the brutality of its manner would have justified the colonel in exposing it  the foreman saw the incredulity expressed in his face and said somewhat aggressively of course i know ye dont take no stock in whats said agin the greasers and thats what the boys know and what they said and thats the reason why i thought i oughter tell ye so that ye mightnt seem to be always favorin em  the editors face darkened slightly but he kept his temper and his good humor so that to prove that the clarion is unbiased where the mexicans are concerned i ought to make it their only accuser and cast a doubt on the americans veracity he said with a smile  i dont mean that said the foreman reddening only i thought ye mightas ye understand these folks waysye might be able to get at them easy and mebbe make some copy outer the blamed thing it would just make a stir here and be a big boom for the clarion  ive no doubt it would said the editor dryly however ill make some inquiries but you might as well let the boys know that the clarion will not publish the colonels secret without his permission meanwhile he continued smiling if you are very anxious to add the functions of a reporter to your other duties and bring me any discoveries you may make illlook over your copy  he good humoredly nodded and took up his pen againa hint at which the embarrassed foreman under cover of hitching up his trousers awkwardly and reluctantly withdrew  it was with some natural youthful curiosity but no lack of loyalty to colonel starbottle that the editor that evening sought this warhorse of the democracy as he was familiarly known in his invalid chamber at the palmetto hotel he found the hero with a bandaged ear andperhaps it was fancy suggested by the story of the chokingcheeks more than usually suffused and apoplectic nevertheless he was seated by the table with a mint julep before him and welcomed the editor by instantly ordering another  the editor was glad to find him so much better  gad sir no bones broken but a good deal of possum scratching about the head for such a little throw like that i must have slid a yard or two on my left ear before i brought up  you were unconscious from the fall i believe  only for an instant sira single instant i recovered myself with the assistance of a nothen gentlemana mr parmleewho was passing  then you think your injuries were entirely due to your fall  the colonel paused with the mint julep halfway to his lips and set it down sir he ejaculated with astounded indignation  you say you were unconscious returned the editor lightly and some of your friends think the injuries inconsistent with what you believe to be the cause they are concerned lest you were unknowingly the victim of some foul play  unknowingly sir do you take me for a chuckleheaded niggah that i dont know when im thrown from a buckjumping mustang or do they think im a chinaman to be hustled and beaten by a gang of bullies do they know sir that the account i have given i am responsible for sirpersonally responsible  there was no doubt to the editor that the colonel was perfectly serious and that the indignation arose from no guilty consciousness of a secret a man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in defense  they feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly disposed person during your unconsciousness explained the editor diplomatically but as you say that was only for a moment and that you were aware of everything that happenedhe paused  perfectly sir perfectly as plain as i see this julep before me i had just left the ramierez rancho the senoraa devilish pretty woman sirafter a little playful badinage had offered to lend me her daughters mustang if i could ride it home you know what it is mr grey he said gallantly im an older man than you sir but a challenge from a dd fascinating creature i trust sir i am not yet old enough to decline gad sir i mounted the brute ive ridden morgan stock and blue grass thoroughbreds bareback sir but ive never thrown my leg over such a blanked chinese cracker before after he bolted i held my own fairly but he buckjumped before i could lock my spurs under him and the second jump landed me  how far from the ramierez fonda were you when you were thrown  a matter of four or five hundred yards sir  then your accident might have been seen from the fonda  scarcely sir for in that case i may say without vanity thatertheer senora would have come to my assistance  but not her husband  the oldfashioned shirtfrill which the colonel habitually wore grew erectile with a swelling indignation possibly half assumed to conceal a certain conscious satisfaction beneath mr grey he said with pained severity as a personal friend of mine and a representative of the pressa power which i respecti overlook a disparaging reflection upon a lady which i can only attribute to the levity of youth and thoughtlessness at the same time sir he added with illogical sequence if ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions he knew where i could be found sir and that it was not my habit to decline giving gentlemenof any nationalitysatisfactionsirpersonal satisfaction  he paused and then added with a singular blending of anxiety and a certain natural dignity i trust sir that nothing of thiserkind will appear in your paper  it was to keep it out by learning the truth from you my dear colonel said the editor lightly that i called today why it was even suggested he added with a laugh that you were half strangled by a lasso  to his surprise the colonel did not join in the laugh but brought his hand to his loose cravat with an uneasy gesture and a somewhat disturbed face  i admit sir he said with a forced smile that i experienced a certain sensation of choking and i may have mentioned it to mr parmlee but it was due i believe sir to my cravat which i always wear loosely as you perceive becoming twisted in my fall and in rolling over  he extended his fat white hand to the editor who shook it cordially and then withdrew nevertheless although perfectly satisfied with his mission and firmly resolved to prevent any further discussion on the subject mr greys curiosity was not wholly appeased what were the relations of the colonel with the ramierez family from what he himself had said the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack might have been possible and the assault itself committed while the colonel was unconscious  mr grey however kept this to himself briefly told his foreman that he found no reason to add to the account already in type and dismissed the subject from his mind the colonel left the town the next day  one morning a week afterward the foreman entered the sanctum cautiously and closing the door of the composingroom behind him stood for a moment before the editor with a singular combination of irresolution shamefacedness and humorous discomfiture in his face  answering the editors look of inquiry he began slowly mebbe ye remember when we was talkin last week o colonel starbottles accident i sorter allowed that he knew all the time why he was attacked that way only he wouldnt tell  yes i remember you were incredulous said the editor smiling  well i take it all back i reckon he told all he knew i was wrong i cave  why asked the editor wonderingly  well i have been through the mill myself  he unbuttoned his shirt collar pointed to his neck which showed a slight abrasion and a small livid mark of strangulation at the throat and added with a grim smile and ive got about as much proof as i want  the editor put down his pen and stared at him  you see mr grey it was partly your fault when you bedeviled me about gettin that news and allowed i might try my hand at reportin i was fool enough to take up the challenge so once or twice when i was off duty here i hung around the ramierez shanty once i went in thar when they were gamblin thar war one or two americans thar that war winnin as far as i could see and was pretty full o that aguardiente that they sell tharthat kills at forty rods you see i had a kind o suspicion that ef thar was any foul play goin on it might be worked on these fellers arter they were drunk and war goin home with thar winnins  so you gave up your theory of the colonel being attacked from jealousy said the editor smiling  hol on i aint through yet i only reckoned that ef thar was a gang of roughs kept thar on the premises they might be used for that purpose and i only wanted to ketch em at thar work so i jest meandered into the road when they war about comin out and kept my eye skinned for what might happen thar was a kind o corral about a hundred yards down the road half adobe wall and a stockade o palms on top of it about six feet high some of the palms were off and i peeped through but thar warnt nobody thar i stood thar alongside the bank leanin my back agin one o them openins and jest watched and waited  all of a suddent i felt myself grabbed by my coat collar behind and my neckhandkercher and collar drawn tight around my throat till i couldnt breathe the more i twisted round the tighter the clinch seemed to get i couldnt holler nor speak but thar i stood with my mouth open pinned back agin that cursed stockade and my arms and legs movin up and down like one o them dancin jacks it seems funny mr greyi reckon i looked like a darned foolbut i dont wanter feel agin as i did jest then the clinch o my throat got tighter everything got black about me i was jest goin off and kalkilatin it was about time for you to advertise for another foreman when suthin brokefetched away  it was my collar button and i dropped like a shot it was a minute before i could get my breath agin and when i did and managed to climb that darned stockade and drop on the other side thar warnt a soul to be seen a few hosses that stampeded in my gettin over the fence war all that was there i was mighty shook up you betand to make the hull thing perfectly ridiclous when i got back to the road after all id got through darn my skin ef thar warnt that pesky lot o drunken men staggerin along jinglin the scads they had won and enjoyin themselves and nobody afollowin em i jined em jest for kempanys sake till we got back to town but nothin happened  but my dear richards said the editor warmly this is no longer a matter of mere reporting but of business for the police you must see the deputy sheriff at once and bring your complaintor shall i its no joking matter  hol on mr grey replied richards slowly ive told this to nobody but younor am i goin tosabe its an affair of my ownand i reckon i kin take care of it without goin to the revised statutes of the state of california or callin out the sheriffs posse  his humorous blue eyes just then had certain steely points in them like glittering facets as he turned them away which the editor had seen before on momentous occasions and he was speaking slowly and composedly which the editor also knew boded no good to an adversary  dont be a fool richards he said quietly dont take as a personal affront what was a common vulgar crime you would undoubtedly have been robbed by that rascal had not the others come along  richards shook his head i might hev bin robbed a dozen times afore they came alongef that was the little game no mr greyit warnt no robbery  had you been paying court to the senora ramierez like colonel starbottle asked the editor with a smile  not much returned richards scornfully she aint my style buthe hesitated and then added thar was a mighty purty gal tharand her darter i reckona reglar pink fairy she kem in only a minute and they sorter hustled her out aginfor darn my skin ef she didnt look as much out o place in that smoky old garlicsmellin room as an angel at a bullfight and what got meshe was ez white ez you or me with blue eyes and a lot o dark reddish hair in a long braid down her back why only for her purty singsong voice and her gracias senor youd hev reckoned she was a blue grass girl jest fresh from across the plains  a little amused at his foremans enthusiasm mr grey gave an ostentatious whistle and said come now richards look here really  only a little girla mere child mr greynot moren fourteen if a day responded richards in embarrassed depreciation  yes but those people marry at twelve said the editor with a laugh look out your appreciation may have been noticed by some other admirer  he half regretted this speech the next moment in the quick flushthe male instinct of rivalrythat brought back the glitter of richardss eyes i reckon i kin take care of that sir he said slowly and i kalkilate that the next time i meet that chapwhoever he may behe wont see so much of my back as he did  the editor knew there was little doubt of this and for an instant believed it his duty to put the matter in the hands of the police richards was too good and brave a man to be risked in a barroom fight but reflecting that this might precipitate the scandal he wished to avoid he concluded to make some personal investigation a stronger curiosity than he had felt before was possessing him it was singular too that richardss description of the girl was that of a different and superior typethe hidalgo or fairskinned spanish settler if this was true what was she doing thereand what were her relations to the ramierez   part ii  the next afternoon he went to the fonda situated on the outskirts of the town which had long outgrown it it still bore traces of its former importance as a hacienda or smaller farm of one of the old spanish landholders the patio or central courtyard still existed as a stableyard for carts and even one or two horses were tethered to the railings of the inner corridor which now served as an open veranda to the fonda or inn the opposite wing was utilized as a tienda or general shopa magazine for such goods as were used by the mexican inhabitantsand belonged also to ramierez  ramierez himselfroundwhiskered and sancho panzalike in buildwelcomed the editor with fat perfunctory urbanity the fonda and all it contained was at his disposicion  the senora coquettishly bewailed in rising and falling inflections his long absence his infidelity and general perfidiousness truly he was growing great in writing of the affairs of his nationhe could no longer see his humble friends yet not long agotruly that very weekthere was the head impresor of don panchos imprenta himself who had been there  a great man of a certainty and they must take what they could get they were only poor innkeepers when the governor came not they must welcome the alcalde to which the editorotherwise don panchoreplied with equal effusion he had indeed recommended the fonda to his impresor who was but a courier before him but what was this the impresor had been ravished at the sight of a beautiful girla mere muchachayet of a beauty that deprived the sensesthis angelclearly the daughter of his friend here was the old miracle of the orange in full fruition and the lovely fragrant blossom all on the same treeat the fonda and this had been kept from him  yes it was but a thing of yesterday said the senora obviously pleased the muchachafor she was but thathad just returned from the convent at san jose where she had been for four years ah what would you the fonda was no place for the child who should know only the litany of the virginand they had kept her there and nowthat she was home againshe cared only for the horse from morning to night caballeros might come and go there might be a festivalall the same to her it made nothing if she had the horse to ride even now she was with one in the fields would don pancho attend and see cota and her horse  the editor smilingly assented and accompanied his hostess along the corridor to a few steps which brought them to the level of the open meadows of the old farm inclosure a slight white figure on horseback was careering in the distance at a signal from senora ramierez it wheeled and came down rapidly towards them but when within a hundred yards the horse was suddenly pulled up vaquero fashion and the little figure leaped off and advanced toward them on foot leading the horse  to his surprise mr grey saw that she had been riding bareback and from her discreet halt at that distance he half suspected astride his effusive compliments to the mother on this exhibition of skill were sincere for he was struck by the girls fearlessness but when both horse and rider at last stood before him he was speechless and embarrassed  for richards had not exaggerated the girls charms she was indeed dangerously pretty from her tawny little head to her small feet and her figure although comparatively diminutive was perfectly proportioned gray eyed and blonde as she was in color her racial peculiarities were distinct and only the goodhumored and enthusiastic richards could have likened her to an american girl  but he was the more astonished in noticing that her mustang was as distinct and peculiar as herselfa mongrel mare of the extraordinary type known as a pinto or calico horse mottled in lavender and pink arabian in proportions and half broken her greenish gray eyes in which too much of the white was visible had he fancied a singular similarity of expression to cotas own  utterly confounded and staring at the girl in her white many flounced frock bare head and tawny braids as she stood beside this incarnation of equine barbarism grey could remember nothing like it outside of a circus  he stammered a few words of admiration of the mare miss cota threw out her two arms with a graceful gesture and a profound curtsey and said  a la disposicion de le usted senor  grey was quick to understand the malicious mischief which underlay this formal curtsey and danced in the girls eyes and even fancied it shared by the animal itself but he was a singularly good rider of untrained stock and rather proud of his prowess he bowed  i accept that i may have the honor of laying the senoritas gift again at her little feet  but here the burly ramierez intervened ah mother of god may the devil fly away with all this nonsense i will have no more of it he said impatiently to the girl have a care don pancho he turned to the editor it is a trick  one i think i know said grey sapiently the girl looked at him curiously as he managed to edge between her and the mustang under the pretense of stroking its glossy neck i shall keep my own spurs he said to her in a lower voice pointing to the sharp smallroweled american spurs he wore instead of the large blunt fivepointed star of the mexican pattern  the girl evidently did not understand him thenthough she did a moment later for without attempting to catch hold of the mustangs mane grey in a single leap threw himself across its back the animal utterly unprepared was at first stupefied but by this time her rider had his seat he felt her sensitive spine arch like a cats beneath him as she sprang rocketwise into the air  but here she was mistaken instead of clinging tightly to her flanks with the inner side of his calves after the old vaquero fashion to which she was accustomed he dropped his spurred heels into her sides and allowed his body to rise with her spring and the cruel spur to cut its track upward from her belly almost to her back  she dropped like a shot he dexterously withdrawing his spurs and regaining his seat jarred but not discomfited again she essayed a leap the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her smooth barrel she tried a third leap but this time dropped halfway as she felt the steel scraping her side and then stood still trembling grey leaped off  there was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife assisted by a lounging vaquero in the corridor ashamed of his victory grey turned apologetically to cota to his surprise she glanced indifferently at the trickling sides of her favorite and only regarded him curiously  ah she said drawing in her breath you are strongand you comprehend  it was only a trick for a trick senorita he replied reddening let me look after those scratches in the stable he added as she was turning away leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in the rear  he would have taken the riata which she was still holding but she motioned him to precede her he did so by a few feet but he had scarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly by the shoulders and shoving him into the entrance slammed the door upon him  amazed and a little indignant he turned in time to hear a slight sound of scuffling outside and to see cota reenter with a flushed face  pardon senor she said quickly but i feared she might have kicked you rest tranquil however for the servant he has taken her away  she pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face who was angrily driving the mustang toward the corral  consider it no more i was rude santa maria i almost threw you too but she added with a dazzling smile you must not punish me as you have her for you are very strongand you comprehend  but grey did not comprehend and with a few hurried apologies he managed to escape his fair but uncanny tormentor besides this unlookedfor incident had driven from his mind the more important object of his visitthe discovery of the assailants of richards and colonel starbottle  his inquiries of the ramierez produced no result senor ramierez was not aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda and except from some drunken american or irish revelers he had been free of disturbance  ah the peonan old vaquerowas not an angel truly but he was dangerous only to the bull and the wild horsesand he was afraid even of cota mr grey was fain to ride home empty of information  he was still more concerned a week later on returning unexpectedly one afternoon to his sanctum to hear a musical childish voice in the composingroom  it was cota she was there as richards explained on his invitation to view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would not be likely to disturb mr grey at his work but the beaming face of richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion and the unwonted splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for the occasion  grey was worried and perplexed believing the girl a malicious flirt yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish curiosity as she watched richards swing the lever of the press or stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his composingstick he had even printed a card with her name senorita cota ramierez the type of which had been set up to the accompaniment of ripples of musical laughter by her little brown fingers  the editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not noticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly on himself even while apparently listening to richards were more than ever like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had wandered so coldly  he withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foremans innocent teteatete but it was not very long after that cota passed him on the highroad with the pinto horse in a gallop and blew him an audacious kiss from the tips of her fingers  for several days afterwards richardss manner was tinged with a certain reserve on the subject of cota which the editor attributed to the delicacy of a serious affection but he was surprised also to find that his foremans eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat abated further discussion regarding it naturally dropped and the editor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened by a chance incident  an intimate friend and old companion of hisone enriquez saltillohad diverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him enriquez was a scion of one of the oldest spanishcalifornia families and in addition to his friendship for the editor it pleased him also to affect an intense admiration of american ways and habits and even to combine the current california slang with his native precision of speechand a certain ironical levity still more his own  it seemed therefore quite natural to mr grey to find him seated with his feet on the editorial desk his hat cocked on the back of his head reading the clarion exchanges but he was up in a moment and had embraced grey with characteristic effusion  i find myself my leetle brother but an hour ago two leagues from this spot i say to myself hola it is the home of don panchomy friend i shall find him composing the magnificent editorial leader collecting the subscription of the big pumpkin and the great gooseberry or gouging out the eye of the rival editor at which i shall assist i hesitate no longer i fly on the instant and i am here  grey was delighted saltillo knew the spanish population thoroughlyhis own superior race and their mexican and indian allies if any one could solve the mystery of the ramierez fonda and discover richardss unknown assailant it was he but grey contented himself at first with a few brief inquiries concerning the beautiful cota and her anonymous association with the ramierez enriquez was as briefly communicative  of your suspicions my leetle brother you are righton the half that leetle angel of a cota is without doubt the daughter of the adorable senora ramierez but not of the admirable senorher husband ah what would you we are a simple patriarchal race thees ramierez he was the mexican tenant of the old spanish landlordsuch as my fatherand we are ever the fathers of the poor and sometimes of their children it is possible therefore that the exquisite cota resemble the spanish landlord ah stopremain tranquil i remember he went on suddenly striking his forehead with a dramatic gesture the old owner of thees ranch was my cousin tiburcio of a consequence my friend thees angel is my second cousin behold i shall call there on the instant i shall embrace my longlost relation i shall introduce my best friend don pancho who lofe her i shall say bless you my children and it is feenish i go i am gone even now  he started up and clapped on his hat but grey caught him by the arm  for heavens sake enriquez be serious for once he said forcing him back into the chair and dont speak so loud the foreman in the other room is an enthusiastic admirer of the girl in fact it is on his account that i am making these inquiries  ah the gentleman of the pantuflos whose trousers will not remain i have seen him friend truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive from the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash but in recognition of greys half serious impatience remain tranquil on him i shall not go back i have said the friend of my friend is ever the same as my friend he is truly not seducing to the eye but without doubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time i shall gif to him my second cousin it is feenish i will tell him now  he attempted to rise but was held down and vigorously shaken by grey  ive half a mind to let you do it and get chucked through the window for your pains said the editor with a half laugh listen to me this is a more serious matter than you suppose  and grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on starbottle and richards as he proceeded he noticed however that the ironical light died out of enriquezs eyes and a singular thoughtfulness yet unlike his usual precise gravity came over his face he twirled the ends of his penciled mustachean unfailing sign of enriquezs emotion  the same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as the gallant starbottle and the excellent richards shall not prove that it come from ramierez though they both were at the fonda he said gravely the cause of it have not come today nor yesterday nor last week the cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant starbottle or excellent richards before there was any american in californiabefore you and i my leetle brother have lif the cause happen firsttwo hundred years ago  the editors start of impatient incredulity was checked by the unmistakable sincerity of enriquezs face it is so he went on gravely it is an old storyit is a long story i shall make him shortand new  he stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression  it was when the padres first have the mission and take the heathen and convert himand save his soul it was their business you comprehend my pancho the more heathen they convert the more soul they save the better business for their mission shop but the heathen do not always wish to be convert the heathen fly the heathen skidaddle the heathen will not remain or will backslide what will you do so the holy fathers make a little game you do not of a possibility comprehend how the holy fathers make a convert my leetle brother he added gravely  no said the editor  i shall tell to you they take from the presidio five or six dragonsyou comprehendthe cavalry soldiers and they pursue the heathen from his little hut when they cannot surround him and he fly they catch him with the lasso like the wild hoss the lasso catch him around the neck he is obliged to remain sometime he is strangle sometime he is dead but the soul is save you believe not pancho i see you wrinkle the browyou flash the eye you like it not believe me i like it not neither but it is so  he shrugged his shoulders threw away his half smoked cigarette and went on  one time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul when he find the heathen who is a young girl have escape the soldiers he of himself have seize the lasso and flung it he is lucky he catch herbut look you she stop notshe still fly she not only fly but of a surety she drag the good padre

father and a peon of my cousin have both been picked up lassoed and dragged dead  many peoples have died of him in the strangling sometime he is seen sometime it is the woman only that one seessometime it is but the hoss but ever somebody is deadstrangle of a truth my friend the gallant starbottle and the ambitious richards have just escaped  the editor looked curiously at his friend there was not the slightest suggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner nothing indeed but a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament it struck him also that his speech had but little of the odd california slang which was always a part of his imitative levity he was puzzled  do you mean to say that this superstition is well known he asked after a pause  among my peopleyes  and do you believe in it  enriquez was silent then he arose and shrugged his shoulders quien sabe it is not more difficult to comprehend than your story  he gravely put on his hat with it he seemed to have put on his old levity come behold it is a long time between drinks let us to the hotel and the barkeep who shall give up the smash of brandy and the julep of mints before the lasso of friar pedro shall prevent us the swallow let us skiddadle  mr grey returned to the clarion office in a much more satisfied condition of mind whatever faith he held in enriquezs sincerity for the first time since the attack on colonel starbottle he believed he had found a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident the legend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital copy  no names would be mentioned yet even if colonel starbottle recognized his own adventure he could not possibly object to this interpretation of it the editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of a ghost story or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation nor could richards find fault with this view of his own experience hitherto kept a secret so long as it did not refer to his relations with the fair cota summoning him at once to his sanctum he briefly repeated the story he had just heard and his purpose of using it to his surprise richardss face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to enriquezs own  its a good story mr grey he said awkwardly and i aint sayin it aint mighty good newspaper stuff but it wont do now for the whole mysterys up and the assailant found  found when why didnt you tell me before exclaimed grey in astonishment  i didnt reckon ye were so keen on it said richards embarrassedly andandit wasnt my own secret altogether  go on said the editor impatiently  well said richards slowly and doggedly ye see there was a fool that was sweet on cota and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride her cursed pink and yaller mustang naturally the beast bolted at once but he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so when it took to buckjumpin the first buck threw him clean into the road but didnt stun him yet when he tried to rise the first thing he knowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody he was held so tight that he couldnt turn but he managed to get out his revolver and fire two shots under his arm the grip held on for a minute and then loosened and the somethin slumped down on top o him but he managed to work himself around and thenwhat do you think he sawwhy that thar hoss with two bullet holes in his neck lyin beside him but still grippin his coat collar and neckhandkercher in his teeth yes sir the rough that attacked colonel starbottle the villain that took me behind when i was leanin agin that cursed fence was that same godforsaken hellinvented pinto hoss  in a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience and the singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda undoubtedly cota had saved him from a similar attack  but why not tell this story with the other said the editor returning to his first idea its tremendously interesting  it wont do said richards with dogged resolution  why  because mr greythat fool was myself  you again attacked  yes said richards with a darkening face again attacked and by the same hoss cotas hoss whether cota was or was not knowin its tricks she was actually furious at me for killin itand its all over twixt me and her  nonsense said the editor impulsively she will forgive you you didnt know your assailant was a horse when you fired look at the attack on you in the road  richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness its no use mr grey i oughter guessed it was a hoss thenthar was nothin else in that corral no cotas already gone away back to san jose and i reckon the ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off so on account of its bein her hoss and what happened betwixt me and her you see my mouth is shut  and the columns of the clarion too said the editor with a sigh  i know its hard sir but its better so ive reckoned mebbe she was a little crazy and since youve told me that spanish yarn it mout be that she was sort o playin she was that priest and trained that mustang ez she did  after a pause something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as he sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders yes sir i was a fool for weve lost the only bit of real sensation news that ever came in the way of the clarion     a jack and jill of the sierras   it was four oclock in the afternoon and the hottest hour of the day on that sierran foothill the western sun streaming down the milelong slope of closeset pine crests had been caught on an outlying ledge of glaring white quartz covered with mining tools and debris and seemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage the air above it shimmered and became visible a white canvas tent on it was an object not to be borne the steeltipped picks and shovels intolerable to touch and eyesight and a tilted tin prospecting pan falling over flashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence at such moments the five members of the eureka mining company prudently withdrew to the nearest pinetree which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the glistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that line cut like a knife the men lay or squatted in this shadow feverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond the burning ledge yet so irritating was the dry air fragrant with the aroma of the heated pines that occasionally one would start up and walk about until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave a momentary relief and as he believed saved him from sunstroke suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously  derned if the blasted bucket aint empty agin not a drop left by jimminy  a stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted heads then every man lay down again as if trying to erase himself  who brought the last demanded the foreman  i did said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably on his back and if anybody reckons im going to face tophet agin down that slope hes mistaken the speaker was thirstybut he had principles  we must throw round for it said the foreman taking the dice from his pocket  he cast the lowest number fell to parkhurst a florid fullblooded texan all right gentlemen he said wiping his forehead and lifting the tin pail with a resigned air only ef anything comes to me on that bare stretch o stage roadand im kinder seein things spotty and black now remember you aint anywhar nearer the water than you were i aint sayin it for myselfbut it mout be rough on youand  give me the pail interrupted a tall young fellow rising ill risk it  cries of good old ned and hunky boy greeted him as he took the pail from the perspiring parkhurst who at once lay down again you maynt be a professin christian in good standin ned bray continued parkhurst from the ground but youre about as white as they make em and youre goin to do a heavenly act i repeat it gentsa heavenly act  without a reply bray walked off with the pail stopping only in the underbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern part of which he put within the crown of his hat and stuck the rest in its band around the outer brim making a parasollike shade above his shoulders thus equipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail which began to descend towards the stage road here he was in the full glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks which scorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash the descent was steep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine needles that had fallen from above nor were his troubles over when a few rods further he came upon the stage road which here swept in a sharp curve round the flank of the mountain its red dust ground by heavy wagons and packtrains into a fine powder was nevertheless so heavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the foot and he was obliged to literally wade through it yet there were two hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach that point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped diagonally from it to creep along the mountain side to the spring he was seeking  when he reached the trail he paused to take breath and wipe the blinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung himself over the bank into it a single misstep here would have sent him headlong to the tops of pinetrees a thousand feet below holding his pail in one hand with the other he steadied himself by clutching the ferns and brambles at his side and at last reached the springa niche in the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide he had merely accomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the eureka company four or five times a day but the day was exceptionally hot he held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear cold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin he threw the water over his head and shoulders he swung his legs over the ledge and let the overflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles gentle and delicious rigors came over him he sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark olive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain a hawk was swinging lazily above it apparently within a stones throw of him he knew it was at least a mile away thirty feet above him ran the stage road he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs the dull jar of harness and the labored creaking of the pioneer coach as it crawled up the long ascent part of which he had just passed he thought of ita slow drifting cloud of dust and heat as he had often seen it abandoned by even its passengers who sought shelter in the wayside pines as they toiled behind it to the summitand hugged himself in the grateful shadows of the spring it had passed out of hearing and thought he had turned to fill his pail when he was startled by a shower of dust and gravel from the road above and the next moment he was thrown violently down blinded and pinned against the ledge by the fall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders his last flash of consciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped from the pack of some passing mule  how long he remained unconscious he never knew it was probably not long for his chilled hands and arms thrust by the blow on his shoulders into the pool of water assisted in restoring him he came to with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back but his head and shoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft fabrics and draperies which to his connecting consciousness seemed as if the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack with a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the pool and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings in doing so his hand suddenly touched human flesha soft bared arm with the same astounding discovery came one more terrible that arm belonged to the weight that was pressing him down and now assisted by his struggles it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the abyss below with a desperate effort he turned on his side caught the bodyas such it wasdragged it back on the ledge at the same moment that freeing his head from its coveringa feminine skirthe discovered it was a woman  she had been also unconscious although the touch of his cold wet hand on her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself in a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes suddenly she began to stare at him to draw in her knees and feet toward her sideways with a feminine movement as she smoothed out her skirt and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned she was a tall handsome girl from what he could judge of her halfsitting figure in her torn silk dustcloak which although its cape and one sleeve were split into ribbons had still protected her delicate wellfitting gown beneath she was evidently a lady  whatis itwhat has happened she said faintly yet with a slight touch of formality in her manner  you must have fallenfrom the road above said bray hesitatingly  from the road above she repeated with a slight frown as if to concentrate her thought she glanced upward then at the ledge before her and then for the first time at the darkening abyss below the color which had begun to return suddenly left her face here and she drew instinctively back against the mountain side yes she half murmured to herself rather than to him it must be so i was walking too near the bankandi fell then turning to him she said and you found me lying here when you came  i think stammered bray that i was here when you fell and ii broke the fall he was sorry for it a moment afterward  she lifted her handsome gray eyes to him saw the dust dirt and leaves on his back and shoulders the collar of his shirt torn open and a few spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead her black eyebrows straightened again as she said coldly dear me i am very sorry i couldnt help it you know i hope you are not otherwise hurt  no he replied quickly but you are you sure you are not injured it must have been a terrible shock  im not hurt she said helping herself to her feet by the aid of the mountainside bushes and ignoring his proffered hand but she added quickly and impressively glancing upward toward the stage road overhead why dont they come they must have missed me i must have been here a long time its too bad  they missed you he repeated diffidently  yes she said impatiently of course i wasnt alone dont you understand i got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under the trees it was so hot and stuffy my foot must have slipped up thereandisliddown have you heard any one calling me have you called out yourself  mr bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness he smiled vaguely and foolishly but on turning around in her impatience she caught sight of the chasm again and lapsed quite white against the mountain side  let me give you some water from the spring he said eagerly as she sank again to a sitting posture it will refresh you  he looked hesitatingly around him he had neither cup nor flask but he filled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips she drank a little extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket dipped its point in the water and wiped her face delicately after a certain feline fashion then catching sight of some small object in the fork of a bush above her she quickly pounced upon it and with a swift sweep of her hand under her skirt put on her fallen slipper and stood on her feet again  how does one get out of such a place she asked fretfully and then glancing at him half indignantly why dont you shout  i was going to tell you he said gently that when you are a little stronger we can get out by the way i came inalong the trail  he pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline somehow with this tall beautiful creature beside him it looked more perilous than before she may have thought so too for she drew in her breath sharply and sank down again  is there no other way  none  how did you happen to be here she asked suddenly opening her gray eyes upon him what did you come here for she went on almost impertinently  to fetch a pail of water he stopped and then it suddenly occurred to him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this tall goodlooking girl even if he had saved her he gave a little laugh and added mischievously just like jack and jill you know  what she said sharply bending her black brows at him  jack and jill he returned carelessly i broke my crown you know and youhe did not finish  she stared at him trying to keep her face and her composure but a smile that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable here lifted the corners of her mouth and she turned her face aside but the smile and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed were unfortunately on the side toward him emboldened by this he went on i couldnt think what had happened at first i had a sort of idea that part of a mules pack had fallen on top of meblankets flour and all that sort of thing you know until  her smile had vanished well she said impatiently until  until i touched you im afraid i gave you a shock my hand was dripping from the spring  she colored so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the time and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak which had been half torn off her bare arm was pinned together over it when and how had she managed to do it without his detecting the act  at all events she said coldly im glad you have not received greater injury fromyour mule pack  i think weve both been very lucky he said simply  she did not reply but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail then she listened i thought i heard voices she said half rising  shall i shout he asked  no you say theres no usetheres only this way out of it  i might go up first and perhaps get assistancea rope or chair he suggested  and leave me here alone she cried with a horrified glance at the abyss no thank you i should be over that ledge before you came back theres a dreadful fascination in it even now no i think id rather goat once i never shall be stronger as long as i stay near it i may be weaker  she gave a petulant little shiver and then though paler and evidently agitated composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft ladylike way and leaned back against the mountain side he saw her also glance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief and with a heightened color he quickly reknotted it around his throat they moved from the ledge toward the trail suddenly she started back  but its only wide enough for one and i nevernevercould even stand on it a minute alone she exclaimed  he looked at her critically we will go together side by side he said quietly but you will have to take the outside  outside she repeated recoiling impossible i shall fall  i shall keep hold of you he explained you need not fear that stop ill make it safer he untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief which he wore around his shoulders knotted one end of it firmly to his belt and handed her the other  do you think you can hold on to that  idont knowshe hesitated if i should fall  stay a moment is your belt strong he pointed to a girdle of yellow leather which caught her tunic around her small waist  yes she said eagerly its real leather  he gently slipped the edge of the handkerchief under it and knotted it they were thus linked together by a foot of handkerchief  i feel much safer she said with a faint smile  but if i should fall he remarked looking into her eyes you would go too have you thought of that  yes her previous charming smile returned it would be really jack and jill this time  they passed out on the trail now i must take your arm he said laughingly not you mine he passed his arm under hers holding it firmly it was the one he had touched for the first few steps her uncertain feet took no hold of the sloping mountain side which seemed to slip sideways beneath her he was literally carrying her on his shoulder but in a few moments she saw how cleverly he balanced himself always leaning toward the hillside and presently she was able to help him by a few steps she expressed her surprise at his skill  its nothing i carry a pail of water up here without spilling a drop  she stiffened slightly under this remark and indeed so far overdid her attempt to walk without his aid that her foot slipped on a stone and she fell outward toward the abyss but in an instant his arm was transferred from her elbow to her waist and in the momentum of his quick recovery they both landed panting against the mountain side  im afraid youd have spilt the pail that time she said with a slightly heightened color as she disengaged herself gently from his arm  no he answered boldly for the pail never would have stiffened itself in a tiff and tried to go alone  of course not if it were only a pail she responded  they moved on again in silence the trail was growing a little steeper toward the upper end and the road bank bray was often himself obliged to seek the friendly aid of a manzanita or thornbush to support them suddenly she stopped and caught his arm there she said listen theyre coming  bray listened he could hear at intervals a faroff shout then a nearer onea nameeugenia so that was hers  shall i shout back he asked  not yet she answered are we near the top a sudden glow of pleasure came over himhe knew not why except that she did not look delighted excited or even relieved  only a few yards more he said with an unaffected half sigh  then id better untie this she suggested beginning to fumble at the knot of the handkerchief which linked them  their heads were close together their fingers often met he would have liked to say something but he could only add are you sure you will feel quite safe it is a little steeper as we near the bank  you can hold me she replied simply with a superbly unconscious lifting of her arm as she yielded her waist to him again but without raising her eyes  he didholding her rather tightly i fear as they clambered up the remaining slope for it seemed to him as a last embrace as he lifted her to the road bank the shouts came nearer and glancing up he saw two men and a woman running down the hill toward them he turned to eugenia in that instant she had slipped the tattered dustcoat from her shoulder thrown it over her arm set her hat straight and was calmly awaiting them with a selfpossession and coolness that seemed to shame their excitement he noticed too with the quick perception of unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments that she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side and was wearing it on her breast  goodness heavens genie what has happened where have you been  eugenia this is perfect madness began the elder man didactically you have alarmed us beyond measurekept the stage waiting and now it is gone  genie look here i say weve been hunting for you everywhere whats up said the younger man with brotherly brusqueness  as these questions were all uttered in the same breath eugenia replied to them collectively it was so hot that i kept along the bank here while you were on the other side i heard the trickle of water somewhere down there and searching for it my foot slipped this gentlemanshe indicated braywas on a little sort of a trail there and assisted me back to the road again  the two men and the woman turned and stared at bray with a look of curiosity that changed quickly into a half contemptuous unconcern they saw a youngish sort of man with a long mustache a two days growth of beard a not overclean face that was further streaked with red on the temple a torn flannel shirt that showed a very white shoulder beside a sunburnt throat and neck and soiled white trousers stuck into muddy high bootsin fact the picture of a brokendown miner but their unconcern was as speedily changed again into resentment at the perfect ease and equality with which he regarded them a regard the more exasperating as it was not without a suspicion of his perception of some satire or humor in the situation  ahem very much obliged i am sure ier  the lady has thanked me interrupted bray with a smile  did you fall far said the younger man to eugenia ignoring bray  not far she answered with a half appealing look at bray  only a few feet added the latter with prompt mendacity just a little slip down  the three newcomers here turned away and surrounding eugenia conversed in an undertone quite conscious that he was the subject of discussion bray lingered only in the hope of catching a parting glance from eugenia the words you do it no you it would come better from her were distinctly audible to him to his surprise however she suddenly broke through them and advancing to him with a dangerous brightness in her beautiful eyes held out her slim hand my father mr neworth my brother harry neworth and my aunt mrs dobbs she said indicating each one with a graceful inclination of her handsome head all think i ought to give you something and send you away i believe that is the way they put it i think differently i come to ask you to let me once more thank you for your good service to me todaywhich i shall never forget when he had returned her firm handclasp for a minute she coolly rejoined the discomfited group  shes no sardine said bray to himself emphatically but i suspect shell catch it from her folks for this i ought to have gone away at once like a gentleman hang it  he was even angrily debating with himself whether he ought not to follow her to protect her from her gesticulating relations as they all trailed up the hill with her when he reflected that it would only make matters worse and with it came the dreadful reflection that as yet he had not carried the water to his expecting and thirsty comrades he had forgotten them for these lazy snobbish purseproud san franciscansfor bray had the miners supreme contempt for the moneyed trading classes what would the boys think of him he flung himself over the bank and hastened recklessly down the trail to the spring but here again he lingeredthe place had become suddenly hallowed how deserted it looked without her he gazed eagerly around on the ledge for any trace that she had lefta bow a bit of ribbon or even a hairpin that had fallen from her  as the young man slowly filled the pail he caught sight of his own reflection in the spring it certainly was not that of an adonis he laughed honestly his sense of humor had saved him from many an extravagance and mitigated many a disappointment before this well she was a plucky handsome girleven if she was not for him and he might never set eyes on her again yet it was a hard pull up that trail once more carrying an insensible pail of water in the hand that had once sustained a lovely girl he remembered her reply to his badinage of course notif it were only a pail and found a dozen pretty interpretations of it yet he was not in love no he was too poor and too level headed for that and he was unaffectedly and materially tired too when he reached the road again and rested leaving the spring and its little idyl behind  by this time the sun had left the burning ledge of the eureka company and the stage road was also in shadow so that his return through its heavy dust was less difficult and when he at last reached the camp he found to his relief that his prolonged absence had been overlooked by his thirsty companions in a larger excitement and disappointment for it appeared that a wellknown san francisco capitalist whom the foreman had persuaded to visit their claim with a view to advance and investment had actually come over from red dog for that purpose and had got as far as the summit when he was stopped by an accident and delayed so long that he was obliged to go on to sacramento without making his examination  that was only his excusemere flapdoodle interrupted the pessimistic jerrold he was foolin you hed heard of suthin better the idea of calling that affair an accident or one that would stop any man who meant business  bray had become uneasily conscious what was the accident he asked  a dd fool womans accident broke in the misogynist parkhurst and its true thats what makes it so cussed mean for theres allus a woman at the bottom of such thingsbet your life think of em comin here thar ought to be a law agin it  but what was it persisted bray becoming more apprehensive  why what does that blasted fool of a capitalist do but bring with him his daughter and auntie to see the wonderful scenery with popa dear as if it was a cheap sundayschool panorama and what do these chuckleheaded women do but get off the coach and go to wanderin about and playin here we go round the mulberry bush until one of em tumbles down a ravine and then theres a great to do and dear popa was up and down the road yellin me cheyld me cheyld and then there was camphor and sal volatile and eau de cologne to be got and the coach goes off and popa dear gets left and then has to hurry off in a buggy to catch it so we get left too just because that godforsaken fool neworth brings his women here  under this recital poor bray sat as completely crushed as when the fair daughter of neworth had descended upon his shoulders at the spring he saw it all his was the fault it was his delay and dalliance with her that had checked neworths visit worse than that it was his subsequent audacity and her defense of him that would probably prevent any renewal of the negotiations he had shipwrecked his partners prospects in his absurd vanity and pride he did not dare to raise his eyes to their dejected faces he would have confessed everything to them but the same feeling of delicacy for her which had determined him to keep her adventures to himself now forever sealed his lips how might they not misconstrue his conductand hers perhaps something of this was visible in his face  come old man said the cheerful misogynist with perfect innocence dont take it so hard some time in a mans life a womans sure to get the drop on him as i said afore and this yer womans got the drop on five of us buthallo ned old manwhats the matter with your head he laid his hand gently on the matted temple of his younger partner  i hada slipon the trail he stammered had to go back again for another pailful thats what delayed me you know boys he added but its nothing  nothing ejaculated parkhurst clapping him on the back and twisting him around by the shoulders so that he faced his companions nothing look at him gentlemen and he says its nothing thats how a man takes it he didnt go round yellin and wringin his hands and sayin me payl me payl when it spilt he just humped himself and trotted back for another and yet every drop of water in that overset bucket meant hard work and hard sweat and was as precious as gold  luckily for bray whose mingled emotions under parkhursts eloquence were beginning to be hysterical the foreman interrupted  well boys its time we got to work again and took another heave at the old ledge but now that this job of neworths is overi dont mind tellin ye suthin as their leader usually spoke but little and to the point the four men gathered around him although i engineered this affair and got it up somehow i never saw that neworth standing on this ledge no boys i never saw him here the look of superstition which bray and the others had often seen on this old miners face and which so often showed itself in his acts was there and though i wanted him to come and allowed to have him come im kinder relieved that he didnt and so let whatsoever lucks in the air come to us five alone boys just as we stand  the next morning bray was up before his companions and although it was not his turn offered to bring water from the spring he was not in love with eugeniahe had not forgotten his remorse of the previous daybut he would like to go there once more before he relentlessly wiped out her image from his mind and he had heard that although neworth had gone on to sacramento his son and the two ladies had stopped on for a day or two at the ditch superintendents house on the summit only two miles away she might pass on the road he might get a glimpse of her again and a wave of her hand before this thing was over forever and he should have to take up the daily routine of his work again it was not loveof that he was assuredbut it was the way to stop it by convincing himself of its madness besides in view of all the circumstances it was his duty as a gentleman to show some concern for her condition after the accident and the disagreeable contretemps which followed it  thus bray alas none of these possibilities occurred he found the spring had simply lapsed into its previous unsuggestive obscuritya mere niche in the mountain side that held onlywater the stage road was deserted save for an early curlyheaded schoolboy whom he found lurking on the bank but who evaded his company and conversation he returned to the camp quite cured of his fancy his late zeal as a watercarrier had earned him a day or twos exemption from that duty his place was taken the next afternoon by the womanhating parkhurst and he was the less concerned by it as he had heard that the same afternoon the ladies were to leave the summit for sacramento  but then occurred a singular coincidence the new waterbringer was as scandalously late in his delivery of the precious fluid as his predecessor an hour passed and he did not return his unfortunate partners toiling away with pick and crowbar on the burning ledge were clamorous from thirst and bray was becoming absurdly uneasy it could not be possible that eugenias accident had been repeated or had she met him with inquiries but no she was already gone the mystery was presently cleared however by the abrupt appearance of parkhurst running towards them but without his pail the cry of consternation and despair which greeted that discovery was however quickly changed by a single breathless half intelligible sentence he had shot before him from his panting lips and he was holding something in his outstretched palm that was more eloquent than words gold  in an instant they had him under the shade of the pinetree and were squatting round him like schoolboys he was profoundly agitated his story far from being brief was incoherent and at times seemed irrelevant but that was characteristic they would remember that he had always held the theory that even in quartz mining the deposits were always found near water past or present with signs of fluvial erosion he didnt call himself one of your blanked scientific miners but his head was level it was all very well for them to say yes yes now but they didnt use to well when he got to the spring he noticed that there had been a kind of landslide above it of course from water cleavage and there was a distinct mark of it on the mountain side where it had uprooted and thrown over some small bushes  excited as bray was he recognized with a hysterical sensation the track made by eugenia in her fall which he himself had noticed but he had thought only of her  when i saw that continued parkhurst more rapidly and coherently i saw that there was a crack above the hole where the water came throughas if it had been the old channel of the spring i widened it a little with my clasp knife and thenin a little pouch or pocket of decomposed quartzi found that not only that boys he continued rising with a shout but the whole slope above the spring is a mass of seepage underneath as if youd played a hydraulic hose on it and its ready to tumble and is just rotten with quartz  the men leaped to their feet in another moment they had snatched picks pans and shovels and the foreman leading with a coil of rope thrown over his shoulders were all flying down the trail to the highway their haste was wise the spring was not on their claim it was known to others it was doubtful if parkhursts discovery with his knife amounted to actual work on the soil they must take it up with a formal notice and get to work at once  in an hour they were scattered over the mountain side like bees clinging to the fragrant slope of laurel and myrtle above the spring an excavation was made beside it and the ledge broadened by a dozen feet even the spring itself was utilized to wash the hastily filled prospecting pans and when the pioneer coach slowly toiled up the road that afternoon the passengers stared at the scarcely dry notice of location pinned to the pine by the road bank whence eugenia had fallen two days before  eagerly and anxiously as edward bray worked with his companions it was with more conflicting feelings there was a certain sense of desecration in their act how her proud lip would have curled had she seen himhe who but a few hours before would have searched the whole slope for the treasure of a ribbon a handkerchief or a bow from her dressnow delving and picking the hillside for that fortune her accident had so mysteriously disclosed mysteriously he believed for he had not fully accepted parkhursts story that gentle misogynist had never been an active prospector an inclination to theorize without practice and to combat his partners experience were all against his alleged process of discovery although the gold was actually there and his conduct that afternoon was certainly peculiar he did but little of the real work but wandered from man to man with suggestions advice and exhortations and the air of a superior patron this might have been characteristic but mingled with it was a certain nervous anxiety and watchfulness he was continually scanning the stage road and the trail staring eagerly at any wayfarer in the distance and at times falling into fits of strange abstraction at other times he would draw near to one of his fellow partners as if for confidential disclosure and then check himself and wander aimlessly away and it was not until evening came that the mystery was solved  the prospecting pans had been duly washed and examined the slope above and below had been fully explored and tested with a result and promise that outran their most sanguine hopes there was no mistaking the fact that they had made a big strike that singular gravity and reticence so often observed in miners at these crises had come over them as they sat that night for the last time around their old campfire on the eureka ledge when parkhurst turned impulsively to bray roll over here he said in a whisper i want to tell ye suthin  bray rolled beyond the squatting circle and the two men gradually edged themselves out of hearing of the others in the silent abstraction that prevailed nobody noticed them  its got suthin to do with this discovery said parkhurst in a low mysterious tone but as far as the gold goes and our equal rights to it as partners it dont affect them if i he continued in a slightly patronizing paternal tone choose to make you and the other boys sharers in what seems to be a special providence to me i reckon we wont quarrel on it its a mighty curious singular thing its one of those things ye read about in books and dont take any stock in but weve got the goldand ive got the black and white to prove iteven if it aint exactly human  his voice sank so low his manner was so impressive that despite his known exaggeration bray felt a slight thrill of superstition meantime parkhurst wiped his brow took a folded slip of paper and a sprig of laurel from his pocket and drew a long breath  when i got to the spring this afternoon he went on in a nervous tremulous and scarcely audible voice i saw this bit o paper folded notewise lyin on the ledge before it on top of it was this sprig of laurel to catch the eye i aint the man to pry into other folks secrets or read what aint mine but on the back o this note was written to jack its a common enough name but its a singular thing ef youll recollect thar aint another jack in this company not on the whole ridge betwixt this and the summit except myself so i opened it and this is what it read he held the paper sideways toward the leaping light of the still near campfire and read slowly with the emphasis of having read it many times before  i want you to believe that i at least respect and honor your honest manly calling and when you strike it rich as you surely will i hope you will sometimes think of jill  in the thrill of joy hope and fear that came over bray he could see that parkhurst had not only failed to detect his secret but had not even connected the two names with their obvious suggestion but do you know anybody named jill he asked breathlessly  its no name said parkhurst in a sombre voice its a thing  a thing repeated bray bewildered  yes a measureyou knowtwo fingers of whiskey  oh a gill said bray  thats what i said young man returned parkhurst gravely  bray choked back a hysterical laugh spelling was notoriously not one of parkhursts strong points but what has a gill got to do with it he asked quickly  its one of them sphinx things dont you see a sort of riddle or rebus you know youve got to study it out as them old chaps did but i fetched it what comes after gills eh  pints i suppose said bray  and after pints  quarts  quartz and there you are so i looked about me for quartz and sure enough struck it the first pop  bray cast a quick look at parkhursts grave face the man was evidently impressed and sincere have you told this to any one he asked quickly  no  then dont or youll spoil the charm and bring us ill luck thats the rule you know i really dont know that you ought to have told me added the artful bray dissembling his intense joy at this proof of eugenias remembrance  but said parkhurst blankly you see old man youd been the last man at the spring and i kinder thought  dont think said bray promptly and above all dont talk not a word to the boys of this stay give me the paper and the sprig ive got to go to san francisco next week and ill take care of it and think it out he knew that parkhurst might be tempted to talk but without the paper his story would be treated lightly parkhurst handed him the paper and the two men returned to the campfire  that night bray slept but little the superstition of the lover is no less keen than that of the gambler and bray while laughing at parkhursts extravagant fancy i am afraid was equally inclined to believe that their good fortune came through eugenias influence at least he should tell her so and her precious note became now an invitation as well as an excuse for seeking her the only fear that possessed him was that she might have expected some acknowledgment of her note before she left that afternoon the only thing he could not understand was how she had managed to convey the note to the spring for she could not have taken it herself but this would doubtless be explained by her in san francisco whither he intended to seek her his affairs the purchasing of machinery for their new claim would no doubt give him easy access to her father  but it was one thing to imagine this while procuring a new and fashionable outfit in san francisco and quite another to stand before the palatial residence of the neworths on rincon hill with the consciousness of no other introduction than the memory of the neworths discourtesy on the mountain and even in his fine feathers bray hesitated at this moment a carriage rolled up to the door and eugenia an adorable vision of laces and silks alighted  forgetting everything else he advanced toward her with outstretched hand he saw her start a faint color come into her face he knew he was recognized but she stiffened quickly again the color vanished her beautiful gray eyes rested coldly on him for a moment and then with the faintest inclination of her proud head she swept by him and entered the house  but bray though shocked was not daunted and perhaps his own pride was awakened he ran to his hotel summoned a messenger inclosed her note in an envelope and added these lines   dear miss neworthi only wanted to thank you an hour ago as i should like to have done before for the kind note which i inclose but which you have made me feel i have no right to treasure any longer and to tell you that your most generous wish and prophecy has been more than fulfilled  yours very gratefully  edmund bray   within the hour the messenger returned with the still briefer reply  miss neworth has been fully aware of that preoccupation with his good fortune which prevented mr bray from an earlier acknowledgment of her foolish note  cold as this response was brays heart leaped she had lingered on the summit and had expected a reply he seized his hat and jumping into the first cab at the hotel door drove rapidly back to the house he had but one idea to see her at any cost but one concern to avoid a meeting with her father first or a denial at her very door  he dismissed the cab at the street corner and began to reconnoitre the house it had a large garden in the rear reclaimed from the adjacent scrub oak infested sand hill and protected by a high wall if he could scale that wall he could command the premises it was a bright morning she might be tempted into the garden a taller scrub oak grew near the wall to the mountainbred bray it was an easy matter to swing himself from it to the wall and he did but his momentum was so great that he touched the wall only to be obliged to leap down into the garden to save himself from falling there he heard a little cry felt his feet strike some tin utensil and rolled on the ground beside eugenia and her overturned wateringpot  they both struggled to their feet with an astonishment that turned to laughter in their eyes and the same thought in the minds of each  but we are not on the mountains now mr bray said eugenia taking her handkerchief at last from her sobering face and straightening eyebrows  but we are quits said bray and you now know my real name i only came here to tell you why i could not answer your letter the same day i never got iti mean he added hurriedly another man got it first  she threw up her head and her face grew pale another man got it she repeated and you let another man  no no interrupted bray imploringly you dont understand one of my partners went to the spring that afternoon and found it but he neither knows who sent it nor for whom it was intended he hastily recounted parkhursts story his mysterious belief and his interpretation of the note the color came back to her face and the smile to her lips and eyes i had gone twice to the spring after i saw you but i couldnt bear its deserted look without you he added boldly here seeing her face grew grave again he added but how did you get the letter to the spring and how did you know that it was found that day  it was her turn to look embarrassed and entreating but the combination was charming in her proud face i got the little schoolboy at the summit she said with girlish hesitation to take the note he knew the spring but he didnt know you i told himit was very foolish i knowto wait until you came for water to be certain that you got the note to wait until you came up for i thought you might question him or give him some word her face was quite rosy now but she added and her lip took a divine pout he said he waited two hours that you never took the least concern of the letter or him but went around the mountain side peering and picking in every hole and corner of it and then he got tired and ran away of course i understand it now it wasnt you but oh please i beg you mr bray dont  bray released the little hand which he had impulsively caught and which had allowed itself to be detained for a blissful moment  and now dont you think mr bray she added demurely that you had better let me fill my pail again while you go round to the front door and call upon me properly  but your father  my father as a wellknown investor regrets exceedingly that he did not make your acquaintance more thoroughly in his late brief interview he is as your foreman knows exceedingly interested in the mines on eureka ledge he will be glad if you will call she led him to a little door in the wall which she unbolted and now jill must say goodby to jack for she must make herself ready to receive a mr bray who is expected  and when bray a little later called at the front door he was respectfully announced he called another day and many days after he came frequently to san francisco and one day did not return to his old partners he had entered into a new partnership with one who he declared had made the first strike on eureka mountain     mr bilsons housekeeper   i  when joshua bilson of the summit house buckeye hill lost his wife it became necessary for him to take a housekeeper to assist him in the management of the hotel already all buckeye had considered this a mere preliminary to taking another wife after a decent probation as the relations of housekeeper and landlord were confidential and delicate and bilson was a man and not above female influence there was however some change of opinion on that point when miss euphemia trotter was engaged for that position buckeye hill which had confidently looked forward to a buxom widow or with equal confidence to the promotion of some pretty but inefficient chambermaid was startled by the selection of a maiden lady of middle age and above the medium height at once serious precise and masterful and to all appearances outrageously competent more carefully taking stock of her it was accepted she had three good pointsdark serious eyes a trim but somewhat thin figure and wellkept hands and feet these which in so susceptible a community would have been enough in the words of one critic to have married her to three men she seemed to make of little account herself and her attitude toward those who were inclined to make them of account was ceremonious and frigid indeed she seemed to occupy herself entirely with looking after the servants chinese and europeans examining the bills and stores of traders and shopkeepers in a fashion that made her respected andfeared it was whispered in fact that bilson stood in awe of her as he never had of his wife and that he was henpecked in his own farmyard by a strange pullet  nevertheless he always spoke of her with a respect and even a reverence that seemed incompatible with their relative positions it gave rise to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting miss trotter had a secret interest in the hotel and represented a san francisco syndicate miss trotter was a woman of independent property and had advanced large sums to bilson miss trotter was a woman of no property but she was the only daughter ofvariouslya late distinguished nobleman a ruined millionaire and a foreign statesman bent on making her own living  alas for romance miss euphemia trotter or miss e trotter as she preferred to sign herself loathing her sentimental prefix was really a poor girl who had been educated in an eastern seminary where she eventually became a teacher she had survived her parents and a neglected childhood and had worked hard for her living since she was fourteen she had been a nurse in a hospital an assistant in a reformatory had observed men and women under conditions of pain and weakness and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness and suffering yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy which she used equally to herself as to others that she had ever indulged in any romance of human existence i greatly doubt the lanky girl teacher at the vermont academy had enough to do to push herself forward without entangling girl friendships or confidences and so became a prematurely hard duenna paid to look out for restrain and report if necessary any vagrant flirtation or small intrigue of her companions a pronounced old maid at fifteen she had nothing to forget or forgive in others and still less to learn from them  it was spring and down the long slopes of buckeye hill the flowers were already effacing the last dented footprints of the winter rains and the winds no longer brought their monotonous patter in the pine woods there were the song and flash of birds and the quickening stimulus of the stirring aromatic sap miners and tunnelmen were already forsaking the direct road for a ramble through the woodland trail and its sylvan charms and occasionally breaking into shouts and horseplay like great boys the schoolchildren were disporting there there were some older couples sentimentally gathering flowers side by side miss trotter was also there but making a short cut from the bank and express office and by no means disturbed by any gentle reminiscence of her girlhood or any other instinctive participation in the wanton season spring came she knew regularly every year and brought spring cleaning and other necessary changes and rehabilitations this year it had brought also a considerable increase in the sum she was putting by and she was perhaps satisfied in a practical way if not with the blind instinctiveness of others she was walking leisurely holding her gray skirt well over her slim ankles and smartly booted feet and clear of the brushing of daisies and buttercups when suddenly she stopped a few paces before her partly concealed by a myrtle a young woman startled at her approach had just withdrawn herself from the embrace of a young man and slipped into the shadow nevertheless in that moment miss trotters keen eyes had recognized her as a very pretty swedish girl one of her chambermaids at the hotel miss trotter passed without a word but gravely she was not shocked nor surprised but it struck her practical mind at once that if this were an affair with impending matrimony it meant the loss of a valuable and attractive servant if otherwise a serious disturbance of that servants duties she must look out for another girl to take the place of frida pauline jansen that was all it is possible therefore that miss jansens criticism of miss trotter to her companion as a spying jealous old cat was unfair this companion miss trotter had noticed only to observe that his face and figure were unfamiliar to her his red shirt and heavy boots gave no indication of his social condition in that locality he seemed more startled and disturbed at her intrusion than the girl had been but that was more a condition of sex than of degree she also knew in such circumstances it is the woman always who is the most composed and selfpossessed  a few days after this miss trotter was summoned in some haste to the office chris calton a young man of twentysix partner in the roanoke ledge had fractured his arm and collarbone by a fall and had been brought to the hotel for that rest and attention under medical advice which he could not procure in the roanoke companys cabin she had a retired quiet room made ready when he was installed there by the doctor she went to see him and found a goodlooking curly headed young fellow even boyish in appearance and manner who received her with that air of deference and timidity which she was accustomed to excite in the masculine breastwhen it was not accompanied with distrust it struck her that he was somewhat emotional and had the expression of one who had been spoiled and petted by women a rather unusual circumstance among the men of the locality perhaps it would be unfair to her to say that a disposition to show him that he could expect no such nonsense there sprang up in her heart at that moment for she never had understood any tolerance of such weakness but a certain precision and dryness of manner was the only result of her observation she adjusted his pillow asked him if there was anything that he wanted but took her directions from the doctor rather than from himself with a practical insight and minuteness that was as appalling to the patient as it was an unexpected delight to dr duchesne i see you quite understand me miss trotter he said with great relief  i ought to responded the lady dryly i had a dozen such cases some of them with complications while i was assistant at the sacramento hospital  ah then returned the doctor dropping gladly into purely professional detail youll see this is very simple not a comminuted fracture constitution and blood healthy all youve to do is to see that he eats properly keeps free from excitement and worry but does not get despondent a little company his partners and some of the boys from the ledge will drop in occasionally not too much of them you know and of course absolute immobility of the injured parts the lady nodded the patient lifted his blue eyes for an instant to hers with a look of tentative appeal but it slipped off miss trotters dark pupilswhich were as abstractedly critical as the doctorswithout being absorbed by them when the door closed behind her the doctor exclaimed by jove youre in luck chris thats a splendid woman just the one to look after you the patient groaned slightly do what she says and well pull you through in no time why shes able to adjust those bandages herself  this indeed she did a week later when the surgeon had failed to call unveiling his neck and arm with professional coolness and supporting him in her slim arms against her stiff erect buckramed breast while she replaced the splints with masculine firmness of touch and serene and sexless indifference his stammered embarrassed thanks at the relieffor he had been in considerable painshe accepted with a certain pride as a tribute to her skill a tribute which dr duchesne himself afterward fully indorsed  on reentering his room the third or fourth morning after his advent at the summit house she noticed with some concern that there was a slight flush on his cheek and a certain exaltation which she at first thought presaged fever but an examination of his pulse and temperature dispelled that fear and his talkativeness and good spirits convinced her that it was only his youthful vigor at last overcoming his despondency a few days later this cheerfulness not being continued dr duchesne followed miss trotter into the hall we must try to keep our patient from moping in his confinement you know he began with a slight smile and he seems to be somewhat of an emotional nature accustomed to be amused andererpetted  his friends were here yesterday returned miss trotter dryly but i did not interfere with them until i thought they had stayed long enough to suit your wishes  i am not referring to them said the doctor still smiling but you know a womans sympathy and presence in a sickroom is often the best of tonics or sedatives  miss trotter raised her eyes to the speaker with a half critical impatience  the fact is the doctor went on i have a favor to ask of you for our patient it seems that the other morning a new chambermaid waited upon him whom he found much more gentle and sympathetic in her manner than the others and more submissive and quiet in her wayspossibly because she is a foreigner and accustomed to servitude i suppose you have no objection to her taking charge of his room  miss trotters cheek slightly flushed not from wounded vanity but from the consciousness of some want of acumen that had made her make a mistake she had really believed from her knowledge of the patients character and the doctors preamble that he wished her to show some more kindness and personal sympathy to the young man and had even been prepared to question its utility she saw her blunder quickly and at once remembering that the pretty swedish girl had one morning taken the place of an absent fellow servant in the rebound from her error she said quietly you mean frida certainly she can look after his room if he prefers her but for her blunder she might have added conscientiously that she thought the girl would prove inefficient but she did not she remembered the incident of the wood yet if the girl had a lover in the wood she could not urge it as a proof of incapacity she gave the necessary orders and the incident passed  visiting the patient a few days afterward she could not help noticing a certain shy gratitude in mr caltons greeting of her which she quietly ignored this forced the ingenuous chris to more positive speech he dwelt with great simplicity and enthusiasm on the swedish girls gentleness and sympathy you have no idea ofhernatural tenderness miss trotter he stammered naively miss trotter remembering the wood thought to herself that she had some faint idea of it but did not impart what it was he spoke also of her beauty not being clever enough to affect an indifference or ignorance of it which made miss trotter respect him and smile an unqualified acquiescence frida certainly was pretty but when he spoke of her as miss jansen and said she was so much more ladylike and refined than the other servants she replied by asking him if his bandages hurt him and receiving a negative answer graciously withdrew  indeed his bandages gave him little trouble now and his improvement was so marked and sustained that the doctor was greatly gratified and indeed expressed as much to miss trotter with the conscientious addition that he believed the greater part of it was due to her capable nursing yes maam he has to thank you for it and no one else  miss trotter raised her dark eyes and looked steadily at him accustomed as he was to men and women the look strongly held him he saw in her eyes an intelligence equal to his own a knowledge of good and evil and a toleration and philosophy equal to his own but a something else that was as distinct and different as their sex and therein lay its charm for it merely translated itself in his mind that she had very pretty eyes which he had never noticed before without any aggressive intellectual quality and with this alas came the mans propensity to reason it meant of course but one thing he saw it all now if he in his preoccupation and coolness had noticed her eyes so also had the younger and emotional chris the young fellow was in love with her it was that which had stimulated his recovery and she was wondering if he the doctor had observed it he smiled back the superior smile of our sex in moments of great inanity and poor miss trotter believed he understood her a few days after this she noticed that frida jansen was wearing a pearl ring and a somewhat ostentatious locket she remembered now that mr bilson had told her that the roanoke ledge was very rich and that calton was likely to prove a profitable guest but it was not her business  it became her business however some days later when mr calton was so much better that he could sit in a chair or even lounge listlessly in the hall and corridor it so chanced that she was passing along the upper hall when she saw fridas pink cotton skirt disappear in an adjacent room and heard her light laugh as the door closed but the room happened to be a cardroom reserved exclusively for gentlemens poker or euchre parties and the chambermaids had no business there miss trotter had no doubt that mr calton was there and that frida knew it but as this was an indiscretion so open flagrant and likely to be discovered by the first passing guest she called to her sharply she was astonished however at the same moment to see mr calton walking in the corridor at some distance from the room in question indeed she was so confounded that when frida appeared from the room a little flurried but with a certain audacity new to her miss trotter withheld her rebuke and sent her off on an imaginary errand while she herself opened the cardroom door it contained simply mr bilson her employer his explanation was glaringly embarrassed and unreal miss trotter affected obliviousness but was silent perhaps she thought her employer was better able to take care of himself than mr calton  a week later this tension terminated by the return of calton to roanoke ledge a convalescent man a very pretty watch and chain afterward were received by miss trotter with a few lines expressing the gratitude of the expatient mr bilson was highly delighted and frequently borrowed the watch to show to his guests as an advertisement of the healing powers of the summit hotel what mr calton sent to the more attractive and flirtatious frida did not as publicly appear and possibly mr bilson did not know it the incident of the cardroom was forgotten since that discovery miss trotter had felt herself debarred from taking the girls conduct into serious account and it did not interfere with her work   ii  one afternoon miss trotter received a message that mr calton desired a few moments private conversation with her a little curious she had him shown into one of the sittingrooms but was surprised on entering to find that she was in the presence of an utter stranger this was explained by the visitor saying briefly that he was chriss elder brother and that he presumed the name would be sufficient introduction miss trotter smiled doubtfully for a more distinct opposite to chris could not be conceived the stranger was apparently strong practical and masterful in all those qualities in which his brother was charmingly weak miss trotter for no reason whatever felt herself inclined to resent them  i reckon miss trotter he said bluntly that you dont know anything of this business that brings me here at least he hesitated with a certain rough courtesy i should judge from your general style and gait that you wouldnt have let it go on so far if you had but the fact is that darned fool brother of minebeg your pardonhas gone and got himself engaged to one of the girls that help herea yellowhaired foreigner called frida jansen  i was not aware that it had gone so far as that said miss trotter quietly although his admiration for her was well known especially to his doctor at whose request i selected her to especially attend to your brother  the doctor is a fool broke in mr calton abruptly he only thought of keeping chris quiet while he finished his job  and really mr calton continued miss trotter ignoring the interruption i do not see what right i have to interfere with the matrimonial intentions of any guest in this house even though oras you seem to put itbecause the object of his attentions is in its employ  mr calton staredangrily at first and then with a kind of wondering amazement that any womanabove all a housekeepershould take such a view but he stammered i thought youyoulooked after the conduct of those girls  im afraid youve assumed too much said miss trotter placidly my business is to see that they attend to their duties here frida jansens duty wasas i have just told youto look after your brothers room and as far as i understand you you are not here to complain of her inattention to that duty but of its resulting in an attachment on your brothers part and as you tell me an intention as to her future which is really the one thing that would make my looking after her conduct an impertinence and interference if you had come to tell me that he did not intend to marry her but was hurting her reputation i could have understood and respected your motives  mr calton felt his face grow red and himself discomfited he had come there with the firm belief that he would convict miss trotter of a grave fault and that in her penitence she would be glad to assist him in breaking off the match on the contrary to find himself arraigned and put on his defense by this tall slim woman erect and smartly buckramed in logic and whalebone was preposterous but it had the effect of subduing his tone  you dont understand he said awkwardly yet pleadingly my brother is a fool and any woman could wind him round her finger she knows it she knows he is rich and a partner in the roanoke ledge thats all she wants she is not a fit match for him ive said he was a foolbut hang it all thats no reason why he should marry an ignorant girla foreigner and a servantwhen he could do better elsewhere  this would seem to be a matter between you and your brother and not between myself and my servant said miss trotter coldly if you cannot convince him your own brother i do not see how you expect me to convince her a servant over whom i have no control except as a mistress of her work when on your own showing she has everything to gain by the marriage if you wish mr bilson the proprietor to threaten her with dismissal unless she gives up your brothermiss trotter smiled inwardly at the thought of the cardroom incidentit seems to me you might only precipitate the marriage  mr calton looked utterly blank and hopeless his reason told him that she was right more than that a certain admiration for her clearsightedness began to possess him with the feeling that he would like to have shown up a little better than he had in this interview if chris had fallen in love with herbut chris was a fool and wouldnt have appreciated her  but you might talk with her miss trotter he said now completely subdued even if you could not reason her out of it you might find out what she expects from this marriage if you would talk to her as sensibly as you have to me  it is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have said miss trotter with a faint smile which mr calton thought quite pretty but i will see about it  whatever miss trotter intended to do did not transpire she certainly was in no hurry about it as she did not say anything to frida that day and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank and postoffice her way home again lay through the summit woods it recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to fridas flirtations neither that nor mr bilsons presumed gallantries however seemed inconsistent in miss trotters knowledge of the world with a serious engagement with young calton she was neither shocked nor horrified by it and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to speak of it to the elder mr calton  her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood the faint perfume was reminiscent of atlantic hillsides where long ago a girl teacher she had walked with the girl pupils of the vermont academy and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains she smileda little sadlyas the thought occurred to her that after this interval of years it was again her business to restrain the callow affections should she never have the matchmaking instincts of her sex never become the trusted confidante of youthful passion young calton had not confessed his passion to her nor had frida revealed her secret only the elder brother had appealed to her hard practical common sense against such sentiment was there something in her manner that forbade it she wondered if it was some uneasy consciousness of this quality which had impelled her to snub the elder calton and rebelled against it  it was quite warm she had been walking a little faster than her usual deliberate gait and checked herself halting in the warm breath of the syringas here she heard her name called in a voice that she recognized but in tones so faint and subdued that it seemed to her part of her thoughts she turned quickly and beheld chris calton a few feet from her panting partly from running and partly from some nervous embarrassment his handsome but weak mouth was expanded in an apologetic smile his blue eyes shone with a kind of youthful appeal so inconsistent with his long brown mustache and broad shoulders that she was divided between a laugh and serious concern  i saw yougo into the woodbut i lost you he said breathing quickly and then when i did see you againyou were walking so fast i had to run after you i wantedto speakto youif youll let me i wont detain youi can walk your way  miss trotter was a little softened but not so much as to help him out with his explanation she drew her neat skirts aside and made way for him on the path beside her  you see he went on nervously taking long strides to her shorter ones and occasionally changing sides in his embarrassment my brother jim has been talking to you about my engagement to frida and trying to put you against her and me he said as much to me and added you half promised to help him but i didnt believe himmiss trotteri know you wouldnt do ityou havent got it in your heart to hurt a poor girl he says he has every confidence in youthat youre worth a dozen such girls as she is and that im a big fool or id see it i dont say youre not all he says miss trotter but im not such a fool as he thinks for i know your goodness too i know how you tended me when i was ill and how you sent frida to comfort me you know toofor youre a woman yourselfthat all you could say or anybody could wouldnt separate two people who loved each other  miss trotter for the first time felt embarrassed and this made her a little angry i dont think i gave your brother any right to speak for me or of me in this matter she said icily and if you are quite satisfied as you say you are of your own affection and fridas i do not see why you should care for anybodysinterference  now you are angry with me he said in a doleful voice which at any other time would have excited her mirth and ive just done it oh miss trotter dont please forgive me i didnt mean to say your talk was no good i didnt mean to say you couldnt help us please dont be mad at me  he reached out his hand grasped her slim fingers in his own and pressed them holding them and even arresting her passage the act was without familiarity or boldness and she felt that to snatch her hand away would be an imputation of that meaning instead of the boyish impulse that prompted it she gently withdrew her hand as if to continue her walk and said with a smile  then you confess you need helpin what way  with her  miss trotter stared with her she repeated this was a new idea was it possible that this common ignorant girl was playing and trifling with her golden opportunity then you are not quite sure of her she said a little coldly  shes so high spirited you know he said humbly and so attractive and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things of herwellhe threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless despairtheres no knowing what she might do  miss trotters obvious thought was that frida knew on which side her bread was buttered but remembering that the proprietor was a widower it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on both sides her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened at this suggestion and there was a hardening of her face as she said well if you cant trust her perhaps your brother may be right  i dont say that miss trotter said chris pleadingly yet with a slight wincing at her words you could convince her if you would only try only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself look miss trotter ill leave it all to youthere if you will only help me i will promise not to see hernot to go near her againuntil you have talked with her there even my brother would not object to that and if he has every confidence in you im showing you ive moredont you see come now promisewont you dear miss trotter he again took her hand and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim fingers and this time she did not withdraw them indeed it seemed to her in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy as if a hand had been put into her loveless past grasping and seeking hers in its loneliness none of her school friends had ever appealed to her like this simple weak and loving young man perhaps it was because they were of her own sex and she distrusted them  nevertheless this momentary weakness did not disturb her good common sense she looked at him fixedly for a moment and then said with a faint smile perhaps she does not trust you perhaps you cannot trust yourself  he felt himself reddening with a strange embarrassment it was not so much the question that disturbed him as the eyes of miss trotter eyes that he had never before noticed as being so beautiful in their color clearness and half tender insight he dropped her hand with a newfound timidity and yet with a feeling that he would like to hold it longer  i mean she said stopping short in the trail at a point where a fringe of almost impenetrable buckeyes marked the extreme edge of the woodsi mean that you are still very young and as frida is nearly your own ageshe could not resist this peculiarly feminine innuendoshe may doubt your ability to marry her in the face of opposition she may even think my interference is a proof of it but she added quickly to relieve his embarrassment and a certain abstracted look with which he was beginning to regard her i will speak to her and she concluded playfully you must take the consequences  he said thank you but not so earnestly as his previous appeal might have suggested and with the same awkward abstraction in his eyes miss trotter did not notice it as her own eyes were at that moment fixed upon a point on the trail a few rods away look she said in a lower voice i may have the opportunity now for there is frida herself passing chris turned in the direction of her glance it was indeed the young girl walking leisurely ahead of them there was no mistaking the smart pink calico gown in which frida was wont to array her rather generous figure nor the long yellow braids that hung margueritewise down her back with the consciousness of good looks which she always carried there was in spite of her affected ease a slight furtiveness in the occasional swift turn of her head as if evading or seeking observation  i will overtake her and speak to her now continued miss trotter i may not have so good a chance again to see her alone you can wait here for my return if you like  chris started out of his abstraction stay he stammered with a faint tentative smile perhapsdont you thinki had better go first and tell her you want to see her i can send her here you see she mighthe stopped  miss trotter smiled it was part of your promise you know that you were not to see her again until i had spoken but no matter have it as you wish i will wait here only be quick she has just gone into the grove  without another word the young man turned away and she presently saw him walking toward the pine grove into which frida had disappeared then she cleared a space among the matted moss and chickweed and gathering her skirts about her sat down to wait the unwonted attitude the whole situation and the part that she seemed destined to take in this sentimental comedy affected her like some quaint childs play out of her lost youth and she smiled albeit with a little heightening of color and lively brightening of her eyes indeed as she sat there listlessly probing the roots of the mosses with the point of her parasol the casual passerby might have taken herself for the heroine of some love tryst she had a faint consciousness of this as she glanced to the right and left wondering what any one from the hotel who saw her would think of her sylvan rendezvous and as the recollection of chris kissing her hand suddenly came back to her her smile became a nervous laugh and she found herself actually blushing  but she was recalled to herself as suddenly chris was returning he was walking directly towards her with slow determined steps quite different from his previous nervous agitation and as he drew nearer she saw with some concern an equally strange change in his appearance his colorful face was pale his eyes fixed and he looked ten years older she rose quickly  i came back to tell you he said in a voice from which all trace of his former agitation had passed that i relieve you of your promise it wont be necessary for you to seefrida i thank you all the same miss trotter he said avoiding her eyes with a slight return to his boyish manner it was kind of you to promise to undertake a foolish errand for me and to wait here and the best thing i can do is to take myself off now and keep you no longer please dont ask me why sometime i may tell you but not now  then you have seen her asked miss trotter quickly premising fridas refusal from his face  he hesitated a moment then he said gravely yes dont ask me any more miss trotter please goodby he paused and then with a slight uneasy glance toward the pine grove dont let me keep you waiting here any longer he took her hand held it lightly for a moment and said go now  miss trotter slightly bewildered and unsatisfied nevertheless passed obediently out into the trail he gazed after her for a moment and then turned and began rapidly to ascend the slope where he had first overtaken her and was soon out of sight miss trotter continued her way home but when she had reached the confines of the wood she turned as if taking some sudden resolution and began slowly to retrace her steps in the direction of the pine grove what she expected to see there possibly she could not have explained what she actually saw after a moments waiting were the figures of frida and mr bilson issuing from the shade her respected employer wore an air of somewhat ostentatious importance mingled with rustic gallantry fridas manner was also conscious with gratified vanity and although they believed themselves alone her voice was already pitched into a high key of nervous affectation indicative of the peasant but there was nothing to suggest that chris had disturbed them in their privacy and confidences yet he had evidently seen enough to satisfy himself of her faithlessness had he ever suspected it before  miss trotter waited only until they had well preceded her and then took a shorter cut home she was quite prepared that evening for an interview which mr bilson requested she found him awkward and embarrassed in her cool selfpossessed presence he said he deemed it his duty to inform her of his approaching marriage with miss jansen but it was because he wished distinctly to assure her that it would make no difference in miss trotters position in the hotel except to promote her to the entire control of the establishment he was to be married in san francisco at once and he and his wife were to go abroad for a year or two indeed he contemplated eventually retiring from business if mr bilson was uneasily conscious during this interview that he had once paid attentions to miss trotter which she had ignored she never betrayed the least recollection of it she thanked him for his confidence and wished him happiness  sudden as was this good fortune to miss trotter an independence she had so often deservedly looked forward to she was nevertheless keenly alive to the fact that she had attained it partly through chriss disappointment and unhappiness her sane mind taught her that it was better for him that he had been saved an illassorted marriage that the girl had virtually rejected him for bilson before he had asked her mediation that morning yet these reasons failed to satisfy her feelings it seemed cruel to her that the interest which she had suddenly taken in poor chris should end so ironically in disaster to her sentiment and success to her material prosperity she thought of his boyish appeal to her of what must have been his utter discomfiture in the discovery of fridas relations to mr bilson that afternoon but more particularly of the singular change it had effected in him how nobly and gently he had taken his loss how much more like a man he looked in his defeat than in his passion the element of respect which had been wanting in her previous interest in him was now present in her thoughts it prevented her seeking him with perfunctory sympathy and worldly counsel it made her feel strangely and unaccountably shy of any other expression  as mr bilson evidently desired to avoid local gossip until after his marriage he had enjoined secrecy upon her and she was also debarred from any news of chris through his brother who had he known of fridas engagement would have naturally come to her for explanation it also convinced her that chris himself had not revealed anything to his brother   iii  when the news of the marriage reached buckeye hill it did not however make much scandal owing possibly to the scant number of the sex who are apt to disseminate it and to many the name of miss jansen was unknown the intelligence that mr bilson would be absent for a year and that the superior control of the summit hotel would devolve upon miss trotter did however create a stir in that practical business community no one doubted the wisdom of the selection every one knew that to miss trotters tact and intellect the success of the hotel had been mainly due possibly the satisfaction of buckeye hill was due to something else slowly and insensibly miss trotter had achieved a social distinction the wives and daughters of the banker the lawyer and the pastor had made much of her and now as an independent woman of means she stood first in the district guests deemed it an honor to have a personal interview with her the governor of the state and the supreme court judges treated her like a private hostess middleaged miss trotter was considered as eligible a match as the proudest heiress in california the old romantic fiction of her past was revived againthey had known she was a real lady from the first she received these attentions as became her sane intellect and cool temperament without pride affectation or hesitation only her dark eyes brightened on the day when mr bilsons marriage was made known and she was called upon by james calton  i did you a great injustice he said with a smile  i dont understand you she replied a little coldly  why this woman and her marriage he said you must have known something of it all the time and perhaps helped it along to save chris  you are mistaken returned miss trotter truthfully i knew nothing of mr bilsons intentions  then i have wronged you still more he said briskly for i thought at first that you were inclined to help chris in his foolishness now i see it was your persuasions that changed him  let me tell you once for all mr calton she returned with an impulsive heat which she regretted that i did not interfere in any way with your brothers suit he spoke to me of it and i promised to see frida but he afterwards asked me not to i know nothing of the matter  well laughed mr calton whatever you did it was most efficacious and you did it so graciously and tactfully that it has not altered his high opinion of you if indeed he hasnt really transferred his affections to you  luckily miss trotter had her face turned from him at the beginning of the sentence or he would have noticed the quick flush that suddenly came to her cheek and eyes yet for an instant this calm collected woman trembled not at what mr calton might have noticed but at what she had noticed in herself mr calton construing her silence and averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech continued hurriedly  i mean dont you see that i believe no other woman could have influenced my brother as you have  you mean i think that he has taken his broken heart very lightly said miss trotter with a bitter little laugh so unlike herself that mr calton was quite concerned at it  no he said gravely i cant say that hes regularly cut up you know and changed youd hardly know him more like a gloomy crank than the easy fool he used to be he went on with brotherly directness it wouldnt be a bad thing you know if you could manage to see him miss trotter in fact as hes off his feed and has some trouble with his arm again owing to all this i reckon ive been thinking of advising him to come up to the hotel once more till hes better so long as shes gone it would be all right you know  by this time miss trotter was herself again she reasoned or thought she did that this was a question of the business of the hotel and it was clearly her duty to assent to chriss coming the strange yet pleasurable timidity which possessed her at the thought she ignored completely  he came the next day luckily she was so much shocked by the change in his appearance that it left no room for any other embarrassment in the meeting his face had lost its fresh color and round outline the lines of his mouth were drawn with pain and accented by his drooping mustache his eyes which had sought hers with a singular seriousness no longer wore the look of sympathetic appeal which had once so exasperated her but were filled with an older experience indeed he seemed to have approximated so near to her own age that by one of those paradoxes of the emotions she felt herself much younger and in smile and eye showed it at which he colored faintly but she kept her sympathy and inquiries limited to his physical health and made no allusion to his past experiences indeed ignoring any connection between the two he had been shockingly careless in his convalescence had had a relapse in consequence and deserved a good scolding his relapse was a reflection upon the efficacy of the hotel as a perfect cure she should treat him more severely now and allow him no indulgences i do not know that miss trotter intended anything covert but their eyes met and he colored again ignoring this also and promising to look after him occasionally she quietly withdrew  but about this time it was noticed that a change took place in miss trotter always scrupulously correct and even severe in her dress she allowed herself certain privileges of color style and material she who had always affected dark shades and stiff white cuffs and collars came out in delicate tints and laces which lent a brilliancy to her dark eyes and short crisp black curls slightly tinged with gray one warm summer evening she startled every one by appearing in white possibly a reminiscence of her youth at the vermont academy the masculine guests thought it pretty and attractive even the women forgave her what they believed a natural expression of her prosperity and new condition but regretted a taste so inconsistent with her age for all that miss trotter had never looked so charming and the faint autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer  one evening she found chris so much better that he was sitting on the balcony but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask him to come into her own little drawingroom ostensibly to avoid the cool night air it was the former cardroom of the hotel but now fitted with feminine taste and prettiness she arranged a seat for him on the sofa which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness the last vestige of his youth  its very kind of you to invite me in here he began bitterly when you are so run after by every one and to leave judge fletcher just now to talk to me but i suppose you are simply pitying me for being a fool  i thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on the balcony and i think judge fletcher is old enough to take care of himself she returned with the faintest touch of coquetry and a smile which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself as anything else  and im a baby who cant he said angrily after a pause he burst out abruptly miss trotter will you answer me one question  go on she said smilingly  did you knowthatwoman was engaged to bilson when i spoke to you in the wood  no she answered quickly but without the sharp resentment she had shown at his brothers suggestion i only knew it when mr bilson told me the same evening  and i only knew it when news came of their marriage he said bitterly  but you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the wood she responded  when i saw them together in the wood he repeated dazedly  miss trotter was startled and stopped short was it possible he had not seen them together she was shocked that she had spoken but it was too late to withdraw her words yes she went on hurriedly i thought that was why you came back to say that i was not to speak to her  he looked at her fixedly and said slowly you thought that well listen to me i saw no one i knew nothing of this i suspected nothing i returned before i had reached the woodbecausebecausei had changed my mind  changed your mind she repeated wonderingly  yes changed my mind i couldnt stand it any longer i did not love the girli never loved heri was sick of my folly sick of deceiving you and myself any longer now you know why i didnt go into the wood and why i didnt care where she was nor who was with her  i dont understand she said lifting her clear eyes to his coldly  of course you dont he said bitterly i didnt understand myself and when you do understand you will hate and despise meif you do not laugh at me for a conceited fool hear me out miss trotter for i am speaking the truth to you now if i never spoke it before i never asked the girl to marry me i never said to her half what i told to you and when i asked you to intercede with her i never wanted you to do itand never expected you would  may i ask why you did it then said miss trotter with an acerbity which she put on to hide a vague tantalizing consciousness  you would not believe me if i told you and you would hate me if you did he stopped and locking his fingers together threw his hands over the back of the sofa and leaned toward her you never liked me miss trotter he said more quietly not from the first from the day that i was brought to the hotel when you came to see me i could see that you looked upon me as a foolish petted boy when i tried to catch your eye you looked at the doctor and took your speech from him and yet i thought i had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were and whose sympathy i longed so much to have you may not believe me but i thought you were a queen for you were the first lady i had ever seen and you were so different from the other girls i knew or the women who had been kind to me you may laugh but its the truth im telling you miss trotter  he had relapsed completely into his old pleading boyish wayit had struck her even as he had pleaded to her for frida  i knew you didnt like me that day you came to change the bandages although every touch of your hands seemed to ease my pain you did it so coldly and precisely and although i longed to keep you there with me you scarcely waited to take my thanks but left me as if you had only done your duty to a stranger and worst of all he went on more bitterly the doctor knew it tooguessed how i felt toward you and laughed at me for my hopelessness that made me desperate and put me up to act the fool i did yes miss trotter i thought it mighty clever to appear to be in love with frida and to get him to ask to have her attend me regularly and when you simply consented without a word or thought about it and me i knew i was nothing to you  miss trotter felt a sudden thrill the recollection of dr duchesnes strange scrutiny of her of her own mistake which she now knew might have been the truthflashed across her confused consciousness in swift corroboration of his words it was a double revelation to her for what else was the meaning of this subtle insidious benumbing sweetness that was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast she felt she ought to listen no longerto speakto say somethingto get upto turn and confront him coldlybut she was powerless her reason told her that she had been the victim of a trickthat having deceived her once he might be doing so again but she could not break the spell that was upon her nor did she want to she must know the culmination of this confession whose preamble thrilled her so strangely  the girl was kind and sympathetic he went on but i was not so great a fool as not to know that she was a flirt and accustomed to attention i suppose it was in my desperation that i told my brother thinking he would tell you as he did he would not tell me what you said to him except that you seemed to be indignant at the thought that i was only flirting with frida then i resolved to speak with you myselfand i did i know it was a stupid clumsy contrivance it never seemed so stupid before i spoke to you it never seemed so wicked as when you promised to help me and your eyes shone on me for the first time with kindness and it never seemed so hopeless as when i found you touched with my love for another you wonder why i kept up this deceit until you promised well i had prepared the bitter cup myselfi thought i ought to drink it to the dregs  she turned quietly passionately and standing up faced him with a little cry why are you telling me this now  he rose too and catching her hands in his said with a white face because i love you    half an hour later when the underhousekeeper was summoned to receive miss trotters orders she found that lady quietly writing at the table among the orders she received was the notification that mr caltons rooms would be vacated the next day when the servant who like most of her class was devoted to the goodnatured goodlooking liberal chris asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better miss trotter with equal placidity answered that it was his intention to put himself under the care of a specialist in san francisco and that she miss trotter fully approved of his course she finished her letterthe servant noticed that it was addressed to mr bilson at parisand handing it to her bade that it should be given to a groom with orders to ride over to the summit postoffice at once to catch the last post as the housekeeper turned to go she again referred to the departing guest it seems such a pity maam that mr calton couldnt stay as he always said you did him so much good miss trotter smiled affably but when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh and then dropping her handsome graystreaked head in her slim hands cried like a girlor indeed as she had never cried when a girl  when the news of mr caltons departure became known the next day some lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor miss trotter agreed with them with the consoling suggestion that he might return for a day or two he did return for a day it was thought that the change to san francisco had greatly benefited him though some believed he would be an invalid all his life  meantime miss trotter attended regularly to her duties with the difference perhaps that she became daily more socially popular and perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine guests it was finally whispered that the great judge boompointer was a serious rival of judge fletcher for her hand when three months later some excitement was caused by the intelligence that mr bilson was returning to take charge of his hotel owing to the resignation of miss trotter who needed a complete change everybody knew what that meant a few were ready to name the day when she would become mrs boompointer others had seen the engagement ring of judge fletcher on her slim finger  nevertheless miss trotter married neither and by the time mr and mrs bilson had returned she had taken her holiday and the summit house knew her no more  three years later and at a foreign spa thousands of miles distant from the scene of her former triumphs miss trotter reappeared as a handsome stately grayhaired stranger whose aristocratic bearing deeply impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival and believed her to be a grand duchess at the least they were still more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the wellknown baroness x and afterwards engaged in a very confidential conversation with that lady but they would have been still more surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation  i am afraid you will find the spa very empty just now said the baroness critically but there are a few of your compatriots here however and they are always amusing you see that somewhat faded blonde sitting quite alone in that arbor that is her position day after day while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women here quite the opposite experience one has of american women where its all the other way is it not and there is an odd story about her which may account for if it does not excuse her husbands neglect theyre very rich but they say she was originally a mere servant in a hotel  you forget that i told you i was once only a housekeeper in one said miss trotter smiling  nonsense i mean that this woman was a mere peasant and frightfully ignorant at that  miss trotter put up her eyeglass and after a moments scrutiny said gently i think you are a little severe i know her its a mrs bilson  no my dear you are quite wrong that was the name of her first husband i am told she was a widow who married againquite a fascinating young man and evidently her superiorthat is what is so funny she is a mrs caltonmrs chris calton as she calls herself  is her husbandmr caltonhere said miss trotter after a pause in a still gentler voice  naturally not he has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to the schwartzberg he returns tomorrow you will find her very stupid but he is very jolly though a little spoiled by women why do we always spoil them  miss trotter smiled and presently turned the subject but the baroness was greatly disappointed to find the next day that an unexpected telegram had obliged miss trotter to leave the spa without meeting the caltons
