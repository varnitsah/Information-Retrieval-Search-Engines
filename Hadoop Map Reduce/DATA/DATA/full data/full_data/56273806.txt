56273806	the angel and the author and others   by jerome k jerome  author of paul kelver idle thoughts of an idle fellow the passing of the third floor back and others  london hurst and blackett limited 182 high holborn wc 1908     chapter i   i had a vexing dream one night not long ago it was about a fortnight after christmas  i dreamt i flew out of the window in my nightshirt  i went up and up  i was glad that i was going up  they have been noticing me i thought to myself  if anything i have been a bit too good  a little less virtue and i might have lived longer  but one cannot have everything  the world grew smaller and smaller  the last i saw of london was the long line of electric lamps bordering the embankment later nothing remained but a faint luminosity buried beneath darkness  it was at this point of my journey that i heard behind me the slow throbbing sound of wings  i turned my head  it was the recording angel  he had a weary look i judged him to be tired  yes he acknowledged it is a trying period for me your christmas time  i am sure it must be i returned the wonder to me is how you get through it all  you see at christmas time i went on all we men and women become generous quite suddenly  it is really a delightful sensation  you are to be envied he agreed  it is the first christmas number that starts me off i told him those beautiful picturesthe sweet child looking so pretty in her furs giving bovril with her own dear little hands to the shivering street arab the good old redfaced squire shovelling out plum pudding to the crowd of grateful villagers  it makes me yearn to borrow a collecting box and go round doing good myself  and it is not only mei should say i i continued i dont want you to run away with the idea that i am the only good man in the world thats what i like about christmas it makes everybody good  the lovely sentiments we go about repeating the noble deeds we do from a little before christmas up to say the end of january why noting them down must be a comfort to you  yes he admitted noble deeds are always a great joy to me  they are to all of us i said i love to think of all the good deeds i myself have done  i have often thought of keeping a diaryjotting them down each day  it would be so nice for ones children  he agreed there was an idea in this  that book of yours i said i suppose now it contains all the good actions that we men and women have been doing during the last six weeks it was a bulky looking volume  yes he answered they were all recorded in the book    the author tells of his good deeds   it was more for the sake of talking of his than anything else that i kept up with him  i did not really doubt his care and conscientiousness but it is always pleasant to chat about ones self  my five shillings subscription to the daily telegraphs sixpenny fund for the unemployedgot that down all right i asked him  yes he replied it was entered  as a matter of fact now i come to think of it i added it was ten shillings altogether  they spelt my name wrong the first time  both subscriptions had been entered he told me  then i have been to four charity dinners i reminded him i forget what the particular charity was about  i know i suffered the next morning  champagne never does agree with me  but then if you dont order it people think you cant afford it  not that i dont like it its my liver if you understand  if i take more  he interrupted me with the assurance that my attendance had been noted  last week i sent a dozen photographs of myself signed to a charity bazaar  he said he remembered my doing so  then let me see i continued i have been to two ordinary balls  i dont care much about dancing but a few of us generally play a little bridge and to one fancy dress affair  i went as sir walter raleigh some men cannot afford to show their leg  what i say is if a man can why not  it isnt often that one gets the opportunity of really looking ones best  he told me all three balls had been duly entered and commented upon  and of course you remember my performance of talbot champneys in our boys the week before last in aid of the fund for poor curates i went on  i dont know whether you saw the notice in the morning post but  he again interrupted me to remark that what the morning post man said would be entered one way or the other to the critic of the morning post and had nothing to do with me  of course not i agreed and between ourselves i dont think the charity got very much  expenses when you come to add refreshments and one thing and another mount up but i fancy they rather liked my talbot champneys  he replied that he had been present at the performance and had made his own report  i also reminded him of the four balcony seats i had taken for the monster show at his majestys in aid of the fund for the destitute british in johannesburg  not all the celebrated actors and actresses announced on the posters had appeared but all had sent letters full of kindly wishes and the othersall the celebrities one had never heard ofhad turned up to a man  still on the whole the show was well worth the money  there was nothing to grumble at  there were other noble deeds of mine  i could not remember them at the time in their entirety  i seemed to have done a good many  but i did remember the rummage sale to which i sent all my old clothes including a coat that had got mixed up with them by accident and that i believe i could have worn again  and also the raffle i had joined for a motorcar  the angel said i really need not be alarmed that everything had been noted together with other matters i may be had forgotten    the angel appears to have made a slight mistake   i felt a certain curiosity  we had been getting on very well togetherso it had seemed to me  i asked him if he would mind my seeing the book  he said there could be no objection  he opened it at the page devoted to myself and i flew a little higher and looked down over his shoulder  i can hardly believe it even nowthat i could have dreamt anything so foolish  he had got it all down wrong  instead of to the credit side of my account he had put the whole bag of tricks to my debit  he had mixed them up with my sinswith my acts of hypocrisy vanity selfindulgence  under the head of charity he had but one item to my credit for the past six months my giving up my seat inside a tramcar late one wet night to a dismallooking old woman who had not had even the politeness to say thank you she seemed just half asleep  according to this idiot all the time and money i had spent responding to these charitable appeals had been wasted  i was not angry with him at first  i was willing to regard what he had done as merely a clerical error  you have got the items down all right i said i spoke quite friendly but you have made a slight mistakewe all do now and again you have put them down on the wrong side of the book  i only hope this sort of thing doesnt occur often  what irritated me as much as anything was the grave passionless face the angel turned upon me  there is no mistake he answered  no mistake i cried  why you blundering  he closed the book with a weary sigh  i felt so mad with him i went to snatch it out of his hand  he did not do anything that i was aware of but at once i began falling  the faint luminosity beneath me grew and then the lights of london seemed shooting up to meet me  i was coming down on the clock tower at westminster  i gave myself a convulsive twist hoping to escape it and fell into the river  and then i awoke  but it stays with me the weary sadness of the angels face  i cannot shake remembrance from me  would i have done better had i taken the money i had spent upon these fooleries gone down with it among the poor myself asking nothing in return  is this fraction of our superfluity flung without further thought or care into the collection box likely to satisfy the impracticable idealist who actually suggestedone shrugs ones shoulders when one thinks of itthat one should sell all one had and give to the poor    the author is troubled concerning his investments   or is our charity but a salve to consciencean insurance at decidedly moderate premium in case after all there should happen to be another world  is charity lending to the lord something we can so easily do without  i remember a lady tidying up her house clearing it of rubbish  she called it giving to the fresh air fund  into the heap of lumber one of her daughters flung a pair of crutches that for years had been knocking about the house  the lady picked them out again  we wont give those away she said they might come in useful again one never knows  another lady i remember coming downstairs one evening dressed for a fancy ball  i forget the title of the charity but i remember that every lady who sold more than ten tickets received an autograph letter of thanks from the duchess who was the president  the tickets were twelve and sixpence each and included light refreshments and a very substantial supper  one presumes the odd sixpence reached the pooror at least the noisier portion of them  a little decolletee isnt it my dear suggested a lady friend as the charitable dancer entered the drawingroom  perhaps it isa little she admitted but we all of us ought to do all we can for the cause  dont you think so dear  really seeing the amount we give in charity the wonder is there are any poor left  it is a comfort that there are  what should we do without them  our furclad little girls our jolly redfaced squires we should never know how good they were but for the poor  without the poor how could we be virtuous  we should have to go about giving to each other and friends expect such expensive presents while a shilling here and there among the poor brings to us all the sensations of a good samaritan providence has been very thoughtful in providing us with poor  dear lady bountiful does it not ever occur to you to thank god for the poor  the clean grateful poor who bob their heads and curtsey and assure you that heaven is going to repay you a thousandfold  one does hope you will not be disappointed  an eastend curate once told me with a twinkle in his eye of a smart lady who called upon him in her carriage and insisted on his going round with her to show her where the poor hid themselves  they went down many streets and the lady distributed her parcels  then they came to one of the worst a very narrow street  the coachman gave it one glance  sorry my lady said the coachman but the carriage wont go down  the lady sighed  i am afraid we shall have to leave it she said  so the gallant greys dashed past  where the real poor creep i fear there is no room for lady bountifuls fine coach  the ways are very narrowwide enough only for little sister pity stealing softly  i put it to my friend the curate  but if all this charity is as you say so useless if it touches but the fringe if it makes the evil worse what would you do    and questions a man of thought   i would substitute justice he answered there would be no need for charity     but it is so delightful to give i answered  yes he agreed  it is better to give than to receive  i was thinking of the receiver  and my ideal is a long way off  we shall have to work towards it slowly     chapter ii   philosophy and the daemon   philosophy it has been said is the art of bearing other peoples troubles  the truest philosopher i ever heard of was a woman  she was brought into the london hospital suffering from a poisoned leg  the house surgeon made a hurried examination  he was a man of blunt speech  it will have to come off he told her  what not all of it  the whole of it i am sorry to say growled the house surgeon  nothing else for it  no other chance for you whatever explained the house surgeon  ah well thank gawd its not my ead observed the lady  the poor have a great advantage over us betteroff folk  providence provides them with many opportunities for the practice of philosophy  i was present at a high tea given last winter by charitable folk to a party of charwomen  after the tables were cleared we sought to amuse them  one young lady who was proud of herself as a palmist set out to study their lines  at sight of the first toilworn hand she took hold of her sympathetic face grew sad  there is a great trouble coming to you she informed the ancient dame  the placidfeatured dame looked up and smiled  what only one my dear  yes only one asserted the kind fortuneteller much pleased after that all goes smoothly  ah murmured the old dame quite cheerfully we was all of us a short lived family  our skins harden to the blows of fate  i was lunching one wednesday with a friend in the country  his son and heir aged twelve entered and took his seat at the table  well said his father and how did we get on at school today  oh all right answered the youngster settling himself down to his dinner with evident appetite  nobody caned demanded his father withas i noticeda sly twinkle in his eye  no replied young hopeful after reflection no i dont think so adding as an afterthought as he tucked into beef and potatoes cepting o course me    when the daemon will not work   it is a simple science philosophy  the idea is that it never matters what happens to you provided you dont mind it  the weak point in the argument is that nine times out of ten you cant help minding it  no misfortune can harm me says marcus aurelius without the consent of the daemon within me  the trouble is our daemon cannot always be relied upon  so often he does not seem up to his work  youve been a naughty boy and im going to whip you said nurse to a fouryearold criminal  you tant retorted the young ruffian gripping with both hands the chair that he was occupying ise sittin on it  his daemon was no doubt resolved that misfortune as personified by nurse should not hurt him  the misfortune alas proved stronger than the daemon and misfortune he found did hurt him  the toothache cannot hurt us so long as the daemon within us that is to say our will power holds on to the chair and says it cant  but sooner or later the daemon lets go and then we howl  one sees the idea in theory it is excellent  one makes believe  your bank has suddenly stopped payment  you say to yourself  this does not really matter  your butcher and your baker say it does and insist on making a row in the passage  you fill yourself up with gooseberry wine  you tell yourself it is seasoned champagne  your liver next morning says it is not  the daemon within us means well but forgets it is not the only thing there  a man i knew was an enthusiast on vegetarianism  he argued that if the poor would adopt a vegetarian diet the problem of existence would be simpler for them and maybe he was right  so one day he assembled some twenty poor lads for the purpose of introducing to them a vegetarian lunch  he begged them to believe that lentil beans were steaks that cauliflowers were chops  as a third course he placed before them a mixture of carrots and savoury herbs and urged them to imagine they were eating saveloys  now you all like saveloys he said addressing them and the palate is but the creature of the imagination  say to yourselves i am eating saveloys and for all practical purposes these things will be saveloys  some of the lads professed to have done it but one disappointedlooking youth confessed to failure  but how can you be sure it was not a saveloy the host persisted  because explained the boy i havent got the stomachache  it appeared that saveloys although a dish of which he was fond invariably and immediately disagreed with him  if only we were all daemon and nothing else philosophy would be easier  unfortunately there is more of us  another argument much approved by philosophy is that nothing matters because a hundred years hence say at the outside we shall be dead what we really want is a philosophy that will enable us to get along while we are still alive  i am not worrying about my centenary i am worrying about next quarterday  i feel that if other people would only go away and leave meincometax collectors critics men who come round about the gas all those sort of peoplei could be a philosopher myself i am willing enough to make believe that nothing matters but they are not  they say it is going to be cut off and talk about judgment summonses  i tell them it wont trouble any of us a hundred years hence they answer they are not talking of a hundred years hence but of this thing that was due last april twelvemonth  they wont listen to my daemon  he does not interest them  nor to be candid does it comfort myself very much this philosophical reflection that a hundred years later on ill be sure to be deadthat is with ordinary luck  what bucks me up much more is the hope that they will be dead  besides in a hundred years things may have improved  i may not want to be dead  if i were sure of being dead next morning before their threat of cutting off that water or that gas could by any possibility be carried out before that judgment summons they are bragging about could be made returnable i mighti dont say i shouldbe amused thinking how i was going to dish them  the wife of a very wicked man visited him one evening in prison and found him enjoying a supper of toasted cheese  how foolish of you edward argued the fond lady to be eating toasted cheese for supper  you know it always affects your liver  all day long tomorrow you will be complaining  no i shant interrupted edward not so foolish as you think me  they are going to hang me tomorrowearly  there is a passage in marcus aurelius that used to puzzle me until i hit upon the solution  a footnote says the meaning is obscure  myself i had gathered this before i read the footnote  what it is all about i defy any human being to explain  it might mean anything it might mean nothing  the majority of students incline to the latter theory though a minority maintain there is a meaning if only it could be discovered  my own conviction is that once in his life marcus aurelius had a real good time  he came home feeling pleased with himself without knowing quite why  i will write it down he said to himself now while it is fresh in my mind  it seemed to him the most wonderful thing that anybody had ever said maybe he shed a tear or two thinking of all the good he was doing and later on went suddenly to sleep  in the morning he had forgotten all about it and by accident it got mixed up with the rest of the book  that is the only explanation that seems to me possible and it comforts me  we are none of us philosophers all the time  philosophy is the science of suffering the inevitable which most of us contrive to accomplish without the aid of philosophy  marcus aurelius was an emperor of rome and diogenes was a bachelor living rent free  i want the philosophy of the bank clerk married on thirty shillings a week of the farm labourer bringing up a family of eight on a precarious wage of twelve shillings  the troubles of marcus aurelius were chiefly those of other people  taxes will have to go up i am afraid no doubt he often sighed  but after all what are taxes  a thing in conformity with the nature of mana little thing that zeus approves of one feels sure  the daemon within me says taxes dont really matter  maybe the paterfamilias of the period who did the paying worried about new sandals for the children his wife insisting she hadnt a frock fit to be seen in at the amphitheatre that if there was one thing in the world she fancied it was seeing a christian eaten by a lion but now she supposed the children would have to go without her found that philosophy came to his aid less readily  bother these barbarians marcus aurelius may have been tempted in an unphilosophical moment to exclaim i do wish they would not burn these poor peoples houses over their heads toss the babies about on spears and carry off the older children into slavery  why dont they behave themselves  but philosophy in marcus aurelius would eventually triumph over passing fretfulness  but how foolish of me to be angry with them he would argue with himself  one is not vexed with the figtree for yielding figs with the cucumber for being bitter  one must expect barbarians to behave barbariously  marcus aurelius would proceed to slaughter the barbarians and then forgive them  we can most of us forgive our brother his transgressions having once got even with him  in a tiny swiss village behind the angle of the schoolhouse wall i came across a maiden crying bitterly her head resting on her arm  i asked her what had happened  between her sobs she explained that a school companion a little lad about her own age having snatched her hat from her head was at that moment playing football with it the other side of the wall  i attempted to console her with philosophy  i pointed out to her that boys would be boysthat to expect from them at that age reverence for feminine headgear was to seek what was not conformable with the nature of boy  but she appeared to have no philosophy in her  she said he was a horrid boy and that she hated him  it transpired it was a hat she rather fancied herself in  he peeped round the corner while we were talking the hat in his hand  he held it out to her but she took no notice of him  i gathered the incident was closed and went my way but turned a few steps further on curious to witness the end  step by step he approached nearer looking a little ashamed of himself but still she wept her face hidden in her arm  he was not expecting it to all seeming she stood there the personification of the grief that is not to be comforted oblivious to all surroundings  incautiously he took another step  in an instant she had landed him over the head with a long narrow wooden box containing one supposes pencils and pens  he must have been a hardheaded youngster the sound of the compact echoed through the valley  i met her again on my way back  hat much damaged i inquired  oh no she answered smiling besides it was only an old hat  ive got a better one for sundays  i often feel philosophical myself generally over a good cigar after a satisfactory dinner  at such times i open my marcus aurelius my pocket epicurus my translation of platos republic  at such times i agree with them  man troubles himself too much about the unessential  let us cultivate serenity  nothing can happen to us that we have not been constituted by nature to sustain  that foolish farm labourer on his precarious wage of twelve shillings a week let him dwell rather on the mercies he enjoys  is he not spared all anxiety concerning safe investment of capital yielding four per cent  is not the sunrise and the sunset for him also  many of us never see the sunrise  so many of our sotermed poorer brethen are privileged rarely to miss that early morning festival  let the daemon within them rejoice  why should he fret when the children cry for bread  is it not in the nature of things that the children of the poor should cry for bread  the gods in their wisdom have arranged it thus  let the daemon within him reflect upon the advantage to the community of cheap labour  let the farm labourer contemplate the universal good     chapter iii   literature and the middle classes   i am sorry to be compelled to cast a slur upon the literary profession but observation shows me that it still contains within its ranks writers born and bred in and moving amidstif without offence one may put it bluntlya purely middleclass environment men and women to whom park lane will never be anything than the shortest route between notting hill and the strand to whom debretts peeragegiltedged and bound in red a tastefullooking volumeever has been and ever will remain a drawing room ornament and not a social necessity  now what is to become of these writersof us if for the moment i may be allowed to speak as representative of this rapidlydiminishing yet nevertheless still numerous section of the world of art and letters  formerly provided we were masters of style possessed imagination and insight understood human nature had sympathy with and knowledge of life and could express ourselves with humour and distinction our pathway was comparatively speaking free from obstacle  we drew from the middleclass life around us passed it through our own middleclass individuality and presented it to a public composed of middleclass readers  but the middleclass public for purposes of art has practically disappeared  the social strata from which george eliot and dickens drew their characters no longer interests the great b p hetty sorrell little emly would be pronounced provincial a deronda or a wilfer family ignored as suburban  i confess that personally the terms provincial and suburban as epithets of reproach have always puzzled me  i never met anyone more severe on what she termed the suburban note in literature than a thin lady who lived in a semidetached villa in a bystreet of hammersmith  is art merely a question of geography and if so what is the exact limit  is it the fourmile cab radius from charing cross  is the cheesemonger of tottenham court road of necessity a man of taste and the oxford professor of necessity a philistine  i want to understand this thing  i once hazarded the direct question to a critical friend  you say a book is suburban i put it to him and there is an end to the matter  but what do you mean by suburban  well he replied i mean it is the sort of book likely to appeal to the class that inhabits the suburbs  he lived himself in chancery lane    may a man of intelligence live say in surbiton   but there is jones the editor of the evening gentleman i argued he lives at surbiton  it is just twelve miles from waterloo  he comes up every morning by the eightfifteen and returns again by the fiveten would you say that a book is bound to be bad because it appeals to jones then again take tomlinson he lives as you are well aware at forest gate which is epping way and entertains you on kakemonos whenever you call upon him  you know what i mean of course  i think kakemono is right  they are long things they look like coloured hieroglyphics printed on brown paper  he gets behind them and holds them up above his head on the end of a stick so that you can see the whole of them at once and he tells you the name of the japanese artist who painted them in the year 1500 bc and what it is all about  he shows them to you by the hour and forgets to give you dinner  there isnt an easy chair in the house  to put it vulgarly what is wrong with tomlinson from a high art point of view  theres a man i know who lives in birmingham you must have heard of him  he is the great collector of eighteenth century caricatures the rowlandson and gilray school of things  i dont call them artistic myself they make me ill to look at them but people who understand art rave about them  why cant a man be artistic who has got a cottage in the country  you dont understand me retorted my critical friend a little irritably as i thought  i admit it i returned  it is what i am trying to do  of course artistic people live in the suburbs he admitted  but they are not of the suburbs  though they may dwell in wimbledon or hornsey i suggested they sing with the scotch bard my heart is in the southwest postal district  my heart is not here  you can put it that way if you like he growled  i will if you have no objection i agreed  it makes life easier for those of us with limited incomes  the modern novel takes care however to avoid all doubt upon the subject  its personages one and all reside within the halfmile square lying between bond street and the parka neighbourhood that would appear to be somewhat densely populated  true a year or two ago there appeared a fairly successful novel the heroine of which resided in onslow gardens an eminent critic observed of it that it fell short only by a little way of being a serious contribution to english literature  consultation with the keeper of the cabmans shelter at hyde park corner suggested to me that the little way the critic had in mind measures exactly eleven hundred yards  when the nobility and gentry of the modern novel do leave london they do not go into the provinces to do that would be vulgar they make straight for barchester towers or what the duke calls his little place up northlocalities one presumes suspended somewhere in midair  in every social circle exist great souls with yearnings towards higher things  even among the labouring classes one meets with naturally refined natures gentlemanly persons to whom the loom and the plough will always appear low whose natural desire is towards the dignities and graces of the servants hall  so in grub street we can always reckon upon the superior writer whose temperament will prompt him to make respectful study of his betters  a reasonable supply of highclass novels might always have been depended upon the trouble is that the public now demands that all stories must be of the upper ten thousand auld robin grey must be sir robert grey south african millionaire and jamie the youngest son of the old earl otherwise a cultured public can take no interest in the ballad  a modern nursery rhymester to succeed would have to write of little lord jack and lady jill ascending one of the many beautiful eminences belonging to the ancestral estates of their parents bearing between them on a silver rod an exquisitely painted sevres vase filled with ottar of roses  i take up my fourpennyhalfpenny magazine  the heroine is a youthful duchess her husband gambles with thousandpound notes with the result that they are reduced to living on the first floor of the carlton hotel the villain is a russian prince  the baronet of a simpler age has been unable poor fellow to keep pace with the times  what selfrespecting heroine would abandon her husband and children for sin and a paltry five thousand a year  to the heroine of the pastto the clergymans daughter or the lady artisthe was dangerous  the modern heroine misbehaves herself with nothing below cabinet rank  i turn to something less pretentious a weekly periodical that my wife tells me is the best authority she has come across on blouses  i find in it what once upon a time would have been called a farce  it is now a drawingroom comedietta  all rights reserved  the dramatis personae consist of the earl of danbury the marquis of rottenborough with a past and an american heiressa character that nowadays takes with lovers of the simple the place formerly occupied by rose the millers daughter  i sometimes wonder is it such teaching as that of carlyle and tennyson that is responsible for this present tendency of literature  carlyle impressed upon us that the only history worth consideration was the life of great men and women and tennyson that we needs must love the highest  so literature striving ever upward ignores plain romola for the lady ponsonby de tompkins the provincialisms of a charlotte bronte for what a certain critic born before his time would have called the doins of the hupper succles  the british drama has advanced by even greater bounds  it takes place now exclusively within castle walls andwhat messrs lumley  cos circular would describe asdesirable town mansions suitable for gentlemen of means  a living dramatist who should know tells us that drama does not occur in the back parlour  dramatists have it has been argued occasionally found it there but such may have been dramatists with eyes capable of seeing through clothes  i once wrote a play which i read to a distinguished manager  he said it was a most interesting play they always say that  i waited wondering to what other manager he would recommend me to take it  to my surprise he told me he would like it for himselfbut with alterations  the whole thing wants lifting up was his opinion  your hero is a barrister my public take no interest in plain barristers  make him the solicitor general  but hes got to be amusing i argued  a solicitor general is never amusing  my manager pondered for a moment  let him be solicitor general for ireland he suggested  i made a note of it  your heroine he continued is the daughter of a seaside lodginghouse keeper  my public do not recognize seaside lodgings  why not the daughter of an hotel proprietor  even that will be risky but we might venture it  an inspiration came to him  or better still let the old man be the managing director of an hotel trust that would account for her clothes  unfortunately i put the thing aside for a few months and when i was ready again the public taste had still further advanced  the doors of the british drama were closed for the time being on all but members of the aristocracy and i did not see my comic old man as a marquis which was the lowest title that just then one dared to offer to a low comedian  now how are we middleclass novelists and dramatists to continue to live i am aware of the obvious retort but to us it absolutely is necessary we know only parlours we call them drawingrooms  at the bottom of our middleclass hearts we regard them fondly the foldingdoors thrown back they make rather a fine apartment  the only drama that we know takes place in such rooms the hero sitting in the gentlemans easy chair of green repp the heroine in the ladys ditto without armsthe chair i mean  the scornful glances the bitter words of our middleclass world are hurled across these threelegged lootables the weddingcake ornament under its glass case playing the part of white ghost  in these days when imperial cement is at a premium who would dare suggest that the emotions of a parlour can by any possibility be the same as those exhibited in a salon furnished in the style of louis quatorze that the tears of bayswater can possibly be compared for saltness with the lachrymal fluid distilled from south audley street glands that the laughter of clapham can be as catching as the cultured cackle of curzon street  but we whose best clothes are exhibited only in parlours what are we to do  how can we lay bare the souls of duchesses explain the heartthrobs of peers of the realm  some of my friends who being conservative attend primrose tourneys or is it courts of love  i speak as an outsider  something mediaeval i know it is do it is true occasionally converse with titled ladies  but the period for conversation is always limited owing to the impatience of the man behind and i doubt if the interview is ever of much practical use to them as conveying knowledge of the workings of the aristocratic mind  those of us who are not primrose knights miss even this poor glimpse into the world above us  we know nothing simply nothing concerning the deeper feelings of the upper ten  personally i once received a letter from an earl but that was in connection with a dairy company of which his lordship was chairman and spoke only of his lordships views concerning milk and the advantages of the cash system  of what i really wished to knowhis lordships passions yearnings and general attitude to lifethe circular said nothing  year by year i find myself more and more in a minority  one by one my literary friends enter into this charmed aristocratic circle after which one hears no more from them regarding the middleclasses  at once they set to work to describe the mental sufferings of grooms of the bedchamber the hidden emotions of ladies in their own right the religious doubts of marquises  i want to know how they do ithow the devil they get there  they refuse to tell me  meanwhile i see nothing before me but the workhouse  year by year the public grows more impatient of literature dealing merely with the middle classes  i know nothing about any other class  what am i to do  commonplace peoplefriends of mine without conscience counsel me in flippant phrase to have a shot at it  i expect old fellow you know just as much about it as these other johnnies do  i am not defending their conversation either as regards style or matter i am merely quoting  and even if you dont what does it matter  the average reader knows less  how is he to find you out  but as i explain to them it is the law of literature never to write except about what you really know  i want to mix with the aristocracy study them understand them so that i may earn my living in the only way a literary man nowadays can earn his living namely by writing about the upper circles  i want to know how to get there     chapter iv   man and his master   there is one thing that the anglosaxon does better than the french or turk or rooshian to which add the german or the belgian  when the anglosaxon appoints an official he appoints a servant when the others put a man in uniform they add to their long list of masters  if among your acquaintances you can discover an american or englishman unfamiliar with the continental official it is worth your while to accompany him the first time he goes out to post a letter say  he advances towards the postoffice a breezy selfconfident gentleman borne up by pride of race  while mounting the steps he talks airily of just getting this letter off his mind and then picking up jobson and going on to durands for lunch  he talks as if he had the whole day before him  at the top of the steps he attempts to push open the door  it will not move  he looks about him and discovers that is the door of egress not of ingress  it does not seem to him worth while redescending the twenty steps and climbing another twenty  so far as he is concerned he is willing to pull the door instead of pushing it  but a stern official bars his way and haughtily indicates the proper entrance  oh bother he says and down he trots again and up the other flight  i shall not be a minute he remarks over his shoulder  you can wait for me outside  but if you know your way about you follow him in  there are seats within and you have a newspaper in your pocket the time will pass more pleasantly  inside he looks round bewildered  the german postoffice generally speaking is about the size of the bank of england  some twenty different windows confront your troubled friend each one bearing its own particular legend  starting with number one he sets to work to spell them out  it appears to him that the posting of letters is not a thing that the german postoffice desires to encourage  would he not like a dog licence instead is what one window suggests to him  oh never mind that letter of yours come and talk about bicycles pleads another  at last he thinks he has found the right hole the word registration he distinctly recognizes  he taps at the glass  nobody takes any notice of him  the foreign official is a man whose life is saddened by a public always wanting something  you read it in his face wherever you go  the man who sells you tickets for the theatre  he is eating sandwiches when you knock at his window  he turns to his companion  good lord you can see him say heres another of em  if there has been one man worrying me this morning there have been a hundred  always the same story all of em want to come and see the play  you listen now bet you anything hes going to bother me for tickets  really it gets on my nerves sometimes  at the railway station it is just the same  another man who wants to go to antwerp  dont seem to care for rest these people flying here flying there whats the sense of it  it is this absurd craze on the part of the public for letterwriting that is spoiling the temper of the continental postoffice official  he does his best to discourage it  look at them he says to his assistantthe thoughtful german government is careful to provide every official with another official for company lest by sheer force of ennui he might be reduced to taking interest in his worktwenty of em all in a row  some of em been there for the last quarter of an hour  let em wait another quarter of an hour advises the assistant perhaps theyll go away  my dear fellow he answers do you think i havent tried that  theres simply no getting rid of em  and its always the same cry stamps stamps stamps  pon my word i think they live on stamps some of em  well let em have their stamps suggests the assistant with a burst of inspiration perhaps it will get rid of em    why the man in uniform has generally sad eyes   whats the use wearily replies the older man  there will only come a fresh crowd when those are gone  oh well argues the other that will be a change anyhow  im tired of looking at this lot  i put it to a german postoffice clerk oncea man i had been boring for months  i said  you think i write these lettersthese short stories these threeact playson purpose to annoy you  do let me try to get the idea out of your head  personally i hate workhate it as much as you do  this is a pleasant little town of yours given a free choice i could spend the whole day mooning round it never putting pen to paper  but what am i to do  i have a wife and children  you know what it is yourself they clamour for food bootsall sorts of things  i have to prepare these little packets for sale and bring them to you to send off  you see you are here  if you were not hereif there were no postoffice in this town maybe id have to train pigeons or cork the thing up in a bottle fling it into the river and trust to luck and the gulf stream  but you being here and calling yourself a postofficewell its a temptation to a fellow  i think it did good  anyhow after that he used to grin when i opened the door instead of greeting me as formerly with a face the picture of despair  but to return to our inexperienced friend  at last the wicket is suddenly opened  a peremptory official demands of him name and address  not expecting the question he is a little doubtful of his address and has to correct himself once or twice  the official eyes him suspiciously  name of mother continues the official  name of what  mother repeats the official  had a mother of some sort i suppose  he is a man who loved his mother sincerely while she lived but she has been dead these twenty years and for the life of him he cannot recollect her name  he thinks it was margaret henrietta but is not at all sure  besides what on earth has his mother got to do with this registered letter that he wants to send to his partner in new york  when did it die asks the official  when did what die  mother  no no the child  what child  the indignation of the official is almost picturesque  all i want to do explains your friend is to register a letter  a what  this letter i want  the window is slammed in his face  when ten minutes later he does reach the right wicketthe bureau for the registration of letters and not the bureau for the registration of infantile deathsit is pointed out to him that the letter either is sealed or that it is not sealed  i have never been able yet to solve this problem  if your letter is sealed it then appears that it ought not to have been sealed  if on the other hand you have omitted to seal it that is your fault in any case the letter cannot go as it is  the continental official brings up the public on the principle of the nurse who sent the eldest girl to see what tommy was doing and tell him he mustnt  your friend having wasted half an hour and mislaid his temper for the day decides to leave this thing over and talk to the hotel porter about it  next to the burgomeister the hotel porter is the most influential man in the continental town maybe because he can swear in seven different languages  but even he is not omnipotent    the travellers one friend   three of us on the point of starting for a walking tour through the tyrol once sent on our luggage by post from constance to innsbruck  our idea was that reaching innsbruck in the height of the season after a weeks tramp on two flannel shirts and a change of socks we should be glad to get into fresh clothes before showing ourselves in civilized society  our bags were waiting for us in the postoffice we could see them through the grating  but some informalityi have never been able to understand what it washad occurred at constance  the suspicion of the swiss postal authorities had been aroused and special instructions had been sent that the bags were to be delivered up only to their rightful owners  it sounds sensible enough  nobody wants his bag delivered up to anyone else  but it had not been explained to the authorities at innsbruck how they were to know the proper owners  three wretchedlooking creatures crawled into the postoffice and said they wanted those three bagsthose bags there in the cornerwhich happened to be nice clean respectable looking bags the sort of bags that anyone might want  one of them produced a bit of paper it is true which he said had been given to him as a receipt by the postoffice people at constance  but in the lonely passes of the tyrol one man set upon by three might easily be robbed of his papers and his body thrown over a precipice  the chief clerk shook his head  he would like us to return accompanied by someone who could identify us  the hotel porter occurred to us as a matter of course keeping to the back streets we returned to the hotel and fished him out of his box  i am mr j i said this is my friend mr b and this is mr s  the porter bowed and said he was delighted  i want you to come with us to the postoffice i explained and identify us  the hotel porter is always a practical man his calling robs him of all sympathy with the hidebound formality of his compatriots  he put on his cap and accompanied us back to the office  he did his best no one could say he did not  he told them who we were they asked him how he knew for reply he asked them how they thought he knew his mother he just knew us it was second nature with him  he implied that the question was a silly one and suggested that as his time was valuable they should hand us over the three bags and have done with their nonsense  they asked him how long he had known us  he threw up his hands with an eloquent gesture memory refused to travel back such distance  it appeared there was never a time when he had not known us  we had been boys together  did he know anybody else who knew us  the question appeared to him almost insulting  everybody in innsbruck knew us honoured us respected useverybody that is except a few postoffice officials people quite out of society  would he kindly bring along say one undoubtedly respectable citizen who could vouch for our identity  the request caused him to forget us and our troubles  the argument became a personal quarrel between the porter and the clerk  if he the porter was not a respectable citizen of innsbruck where was such an one to be found    the disadvantage of being an unknown person   both gentlemen became excited and the discussion passed beyond my understanding  but i gathered dimly from what the clerk said that ill natured remarks relative to the porters grandfather and a missing cow had never yet been satisfactorily replied to and from observations made by the porter that stories were in circulation about the clerks aunt and a sergeant of artillery that should suggest to a discreet nephew of the lady the inadvisability of talking about other peoples grandfathers  our sympathies were naturally with the porter he was our man but he did not seem to be advancing our cause much  we left them quarrelling and persuaded the head waiter that evening to turn out the gas at our end of the table dhote  the next morning we returned to the postoffice by ourselves  the clerk proved a reasonable man when treated in a friendly spirit  he was a bit of a climber himself  he admitted the possibility of our being the rightful owners  his instructions were only not to deliver up the bags and he himself suggested a way out of the difficulty  we might come each day and dress in the postoffice behind the screen  it was an awkward arrangement even although the clerk allowed us the use of the back door  and occasionally in spite of the utmost care bits of us would show outside the screen  but for a couple of days until the british consul returned from salzburg the postoffice had to be our dressing room  the continental official i am inclined to think errs on the side of prudence     chapter v   if only we had not lost our tails   a friend of mine thinks it a pity that we have lost our tails  he argues it would be so helpful if like the dog we possessed a tail that wagged when we were pleased that stuck out straight when we were feeling mad  now do come and see us again soon says our hostess dont wait to be asked  drop in whenever you are passing  we take her at her word  the servant who answers our knocking says she will see  there is a scuffling of feet a murmur of hushed voices a swift opening and closing of doors  we are shown into the drawingroom the maid breathless from her search one supposes having discovered that her mistress is at home  we stand upon the hearthrug clinging to our hat and stick as to things friendly and sympathetic the suggestion forcing itself upon us is that of a visit to the dentist  our hostess enters wreathed in smiles  is she really pleased to see us or is she saying to herself drat the man  why must he choose the very morning i had intended to fix up the clean curtains  but she has to pretend to be delighted and ask us to stay to lunch  it would save us hours of anxiety could we look beyond her smiling face to her tail peeping out saucily from a plackethole  is it wagging or is it standing out rigid at right angles from her skirt  but i fear by this time we should have taught our tails polite behaviour we should have schooled them to wag enthusiastically the while we were growling savagely to ourselves  man put on insincerity to hide his mind when he made himself a garment of figleaves to hide his body  one sometimes wonders whether he has gained so very much  a small acquaintance of mine is being brought up on strange principles  whether his parents are mad or not is a matter of opinion  their ideas are certainly peculiar  they encourage him rather than otherwise to tell the truth on all occasions  i am watching the experiment with interest  if you ask him what he thinks of you he tells you  some people dont ask him a second time  they say  what a very rude little boy you are  but you insisted upon it he explains i told you id rather not say  it does not comfort them in the least  yet the result is he is already an influence  people who have braved the ordeal and emerged successfully go about with swelled head    and little boys would always tell the truth   politeness would seem to have been invented for the comfort of the undeserving  we let fall our rain of compliments upon the unjust and the just without distinction  every hostess has provided us with the most charming evening of our life  every guest has conferred a like blessing upon us by accepting our invitation  i remember a dear good lady in a small south german town organizing for one winters day a sleighing party to the woods  a sleighing party differs from a picnic  the people who want each other cannot go off together and lose themselves leaving the bores to find only each other  you are in close company from early morn till late at night  we were to drive twenty miles six in a sledge dine together in a lonely wirtschaft dance and sing songs and afterwards drive home by moonlight  success depends on every member of the company fitting into his place and assisting in the general harmony  our chieftainess was fixing the final arrangements the evening before in the drawingroom of the pension  one place was still to spare  tompkins  two voices uttered the name simultaneously three others immediately took up the refrain  tompkins was our manthe cheeriest merriest companion imaginable  tompkins alone could be trusted to make the affair a success  tompkins who had only arrived that afternoon was pointed out to our chieftainess  we could hear his goodtempered laugh from where we sat grouped together at the other end of the room  our chieftainess rose and made for him direct  alas she was a shortsighted ladywe had not thought of that  she returned in triumph followed by a dismallooking man i had met the year before in the black forest and had hoped never to meet again  i drew her aside  whatever you do i said dont ask   i forget his name  one of these days ill forget him altogether and be happier  i will call him johnson  he would turn the whole thing into a funeral before we were halfway there  i climbed a mountain with him once  he makes you forget all your other troubles that is the only thing he is good for  but who is johnson she demanded  why thats johnson i explainedthe thing youve brought over  why on earth didnt you leave it alone  wheres your womans instinct  great heavens she cried i thought it was tompkins  ive invited him and hes accepted  she was a stickler for politeness and would not hear of his being told that he had been mistaken for an agreeable man but that the error most fortunately had been discovered in time  he started a row with the driver of the sledge and devoted the journey outwards to an argument on the fiscal question  he told the proprietor of the hotel what he thought of german cooking and insisted on having the windows open  one of our partya german studentsang deutschland deutschland uber alleswhich led to a heated discussion on the proper place of sentiment in literature and a general denunciation by johnson of teutonic characteristics in general  we did not dance  johnson said that of course he spoke only for himself but the sight of middleaged ladies and gentlemen catching hold of each other round the middle and jigging about like children was to him rather a saddening spectacle but to the young such gambolling was natural  let the young ones indulge themselves  only four of our party could claim to be under thirty with any hope of success  they were kind enough not to impress the fact upon us  johnson enlivened the journey back by a searching analysis of enjoyment of what did it really consist  yet on wishing him goodnight our chieftainess thanked him for his company in precisely the same terms she would have applied to tompkins who by unflagging good humour and tact would have made the day worth remembering to us all for all time    and everyone obtained his just deserts   we pay dearly for our want of sincerity  we are denied the payment of praise it has ceased to have any value  people shake me warmly by the hand and tell me that they like my books  it only bores me  not that i am superior to complimentnobody isbut because i cannot be sure that they mean it  they would say just the same had they never read a line i had written  if i visit a house and find a book of mine open face downwards on the windowseat it sends no thrill of pride through my suspicious mind  as likely as not i tell myself the following is the conversation that has taken place between my host and hostess the day before my arrival  dont forget that man j is coming down tomorrow  tomorrow  i wish you would tell me of these things a little earlier  i did tell youtold you last week  your memory gets worse every day  you certainly never told me or i should have remembered it  is he anybody important  oh no writes books  what sort of booksi mean is he quite respectable  of course or i should not have invited him  these sort of people go everywhere nowadays  by the by have we got any of his books about the house  i dont think so  ill look and see  if you had let me know in time i could have ordered one from mudies  well ive got to go to town ill make sure of it and buy one  seems a pity to waste money  wont you be going anywhere near mudies  looks more appreciative to have bought a copy  it will do for a birthday present for someone  on the other hand the conversation may have been very different  my hostess may have said  oh i am glad hes coming  i have been longing to meet him for years  she may have bought my book on the day of publication and be reading it through for the second time  she may by pure accident have left it on her favourite seat beneath the window  the knowledge that insincerity is our universal garment has reduced all compliment to meaningless formula a lady one evening at a party drew me aside  the chief guesta famous writerhad just arrived  tell me she said i have so little time for reading what has he done  i was on the point of replying when an inveterate wag who had overheard her interposed between us  the cloister and the hearth he told her and adam bede  he happened to know the lady well  she has a good heart but was ever muddleheaded  she thanked that wag with a smile and i heard her later in the evening boring most evidently that literary lion with elongated praise of the cloister and the hearth and adam bede  they were among the few books she had ever read and talking about them came easily to her  she told me afterwards that she had found that literary lion a charming man but  well she laughed he has got a good opinion of himself  he told me he considered both books among the finest in the english language  it is as well always to make a note of the authors name  some people never domore particularly playgoers  a wellknown dramatic author told me he once took a couple of colonial friends to a play of his own  it was after a little dinner at kettners they suggested the theatre and he thought he would give them a treat  he did not mention to them that he was the author and they never looked at the programme  their faces as the play proceeded lengthened it did not seem to be their school of comedy  at the end of the first act they sprang to their feet  lets chuck this rot suggested one  lets go to the empire suggested the other  the wellknown dramatist followed them out  he thinks the fault must have been with the dinner  a young friend of minea man of good familycontracted a mesalliance that is he married the daughter of a canadian farmer a frank amiable girl bewitchingly pretty with more character in her little finger than some girls possess in their whole body  i met him one day some three months after his return to london    and only people would do parlour tricks who do them well   well i asked him how is it shaping  she is the dearest girl in the world he answered  she has only got one fault she believes what people say  she will get over that i suggested  i hope she does he replied its awkward at present  i can see it leading her into difficulty i agreed  she is not accomplished he continued  he seemed to wish to talk about it to a sympathetic listener  she never pretended to be accomplished  i did not marry her for her accomplishments  but now she is beginning to think she must have been accomplished all the time without knowing it she plays the piano like a schoolgirl on a parents visitingday  she told them she did not playnot worth listening toat least she began by telling them so  they insisted that she did that they had heard about her playing and were thirsting to enjoy it  she is good nature itself  she would stand on her head if she thought it would give real joy to anyone  she took it they really wanted to hear her and so let em have it  they tell her that her touch is something quite out of the commonwhich is the truth if only she could understand itwhy did she never think of taking up music as a profession  by this time she is wondering herself that she never did  they are not satisfied with hearing her once  they ask for more and they get it  the other evening i had to keep quiet on my chair while she thumped through four pieces one after the other including the beethoven sonata  we knew it was the beethoven sonata  she told us before she started it was going to be the beethoven sonata otherwise for all any of us could have guessed it might have been the battle of prague  we all sat round with wooden faces staring at our boots  afterwards those of them that couldnt get near enough to her to make a fool of her crowded round me  wanted to know why i had never told them i had discovered a musical prodigy  ill lose my temper one day and pull somebodys nose i feel i shall  shes got a recitation whether intended to be serious or comic i had never been able to make up my mind  the way she gives it confers upon it all the disadvantages of both  it is chiefly concerned with an angel and a child  but a dog comes into it about the middle and from that point onward it is impossible to tell who is talkingsometimes you think it is the angel and then it sounds more like the dog  the child is the easiest to follow it talks all the time through its nose  if i have heard that recitation once i have heard it fifty times and now she is busy learning an encore    and all the world had sense   what hurts me most he went on is having to watch her making herself ridiculous  yet what am i to do  if i explain things to her she will be miserable and ashamed of herself added to which her franknessperhaps her greatest charmwill be murdered  the trouble runs through everything  she wont take my advice about her frocks  she laughs and repeats to mewell the lies that other women tell a girl who is spoiling herself by dressing absurdly especially when she is a pretty girl and they are anxious she should go on spoiling herself  she bought a hat last week one day when i was not with her  it only wants the candles to look like a christmas tree  they insist on her taking it off so they may examine it more closely with the idea of having one built like it for themselves and she sits by delighted and explains to them the secret of the thing  we get to parties half an hour before the opening time she is afraid of being a minute late  they have told her that the party cant begin without herisnt worth calling a party till shes there  we are always the last to go  the other people dont matter but if she goes they will feel the whole thing has been a failure  she is dead for want of sleep and they are sick and tired of us but if i look at my watch they talk as if their hearts were breaking and she thinks me a brute for wanting to leave friends so passionately attached to us  why do we all play this silly game what is the sense of it he wanted to know  i could not tell him     chapter vi   fire and the foreigner   they are odd folk these foreigners  there are moments of despair when i almost give them upfeel i dont care what becomes of themfeel as if i could let them muddle on in their own waywash my hands of them so to speak and attend exclusively to my own business we all have our days of feebleness  they will sit outside a cafe on a freezing night with an east wind blowing and play dominoes  they will stand outside a tramcar rushing through the icy air at fifteen miles an hour and refuse to go inside even to oblige a lady  yet in railway carriages in which you could grill a bloater by the simple process of laying it underneath the seat they will insist on the window being closed light cigars to keep their noses warm and sit with the collars of their fur coats buttoned up around their necks  in their houses they keep the double windows hermetically sealed for three or four months at a time and the hot air quivering about the stoves scorches your face if you venture nearer to it than a yard  travel can broaden the mind  it can also suggest to the britisher that in some respects his countrymen are nothing near so silly as they are supposed to be  there was a time when i used to sit with my legs stretched out before the english coal fire and listen with respectful attention while people who i thought knew all about it explained to me how wicked and how wasteful were our methods  all the heat from that fire they told me was going up the chimney  i did not like to answer them that notwithstanding i felt warm and cosy  i feared it might be merely british stupidity that kept me warm and cosy not the fire at all  how could it be the fire  the heat from the fire was going up the chimney  it was the glow of ignorance that was making my toes tingle  besides if by sitting close in front of the fire and looking hard at it i did contrive by hypnotic suggestion maybe to fancy myself warm what should i feel like at the other end of the room  it seemed like begging the question to reply that i had no particular use for the other end of the room that generally speaking there was room enough about the fire for all the people i really cared for that sitting altogether round the fire seemed quite as sensible as sulking by ones self in a corner the other end of the room that the fire made a cheerful and convenient focus for family and friends  they pointed out to me how a stove blocking up the centre of the room with a dingy looking fluepipe wandering round the ceiling would enable us to sit ranged round the walls like patients in a hospital waitingroom and use up coke and potatopeelings  since then i have had practical experience of the scientific stove  i want the oldfashioned unsanitary wasteful illogical open fireplace i want the heat to go up the chimney instead of stopping in the room and giving me a headache and making everything go round  when i come in out of the snow i want to see a firesomething that says to me with a cheerful crackle hallo old man cold outside isnt it  come and sit down  come quite close and warm your hands  thats right put your foot under him and persuade him to move a yard or two  thats all hes been doing for the last hour lying there roasting himself lazy little devil hell get softening of the spine thats what will happen to him  put your toes on the fender  the tea will be here in a minute    my british stupidity   i want something that i can toast my back against while standing with coat tails tucked up and my hands in my pockets explaining things to people  i dont want a comfortless staring white thing in a corner of the room behind the sofaa thing that looks and smells like a family tomb  it may be hygienic and it may be hot but it does not seem to do me any good  it has its advantages it contains a cupboard into which you can put things to dry  you can also forget them and leave them there  then people complain of a smell of burning and hope the house is not on fire and you ease their mind by explaining to them that it is probably only your boots  complicated internal arrangements are worked by a key  if you put on too much fuel and do not work this key properly the thing explodes  and if you do not put on any coal at all and the fire goes out suddenly then likewise it explodes  that is the only way it knows of calling attention to itself  on the continent you know when the fire wants seeing to merely by listening  sounded like the diningroom that last explosion somebody remarks  i think not observes another i distinctly felt the shock behind memy bedroom i expect  bits of ceiling begin to fall and you notice that the mirror over the sideboard is slowly coming towards you  why it must be this stove you say curious how difficult it is to locate sound  you snatch up the children and hurry out of the room  after a while when things have settled down you venture to look in again  maybe it was only a mild explosion  a tenpound note and a couple of plumbers in the house for a week will put things right again  they tell me they are economical these german stoves but you have got to understand them  i think i have learnt the trick of them at last and i dont suppose all told it has cost me more than fifty pounds  and now i am trying to teach the rest of the family  what i complain about the family is that they do not seem anxious to learn  you do it they say pressing the coal scoop into my hand it makes us nervous  it is a pretty patriarchal idea i stand between the trusting admiring family and these explosive stoves that are the terror of their lives they gather round me in a group and watch me the capable allknowing head who fears no foreign stove  but there are days when i get tired of going round making up fires  nor is it sufficient to understand only one particular stove  the practical foreigner prides himself upon having various stoves adapted to various work  hitherto i have been speaking only of the stove supposed to be best suited to reception rooms and bedrooms  the hall is provided with another sort of stove altogether an iron stove this that turns up its nose at coke and potatopeelings  if you give it anything else but the best coal it explodes  it is like living surrounded by peppery old colonels trying to pass a peaceful winter among these passionate stoves there is a stove in the kitchen to be used only for roasting this one will not look at anything else but wood  give it a bit of coal meaning to be kind and before you are out of the room it has exploded  then there is a trick stove specially popular in belgium  it has a little door at the top and another little door at the bottom and looks like a peppercaster  whether it is happy or not depends upon those two little doors  there are times when it feels it wants the bottom door shut and the top door open or vice versa or both open at the same time or both shutit is a fussy little stove  ordinary intelligence does not help you much with this stove  you want to be bred in the country  it is a question of instinct you have to have belgian blood in your veins to get on comfortably with it  on the whole it is a mild little stove this belgian pet  it does not often explode it only gets angry and throws its cover into the air and flings hot coals about the room  it lives generally speaking inside an iron cupboard with two doors  when you want it you open these doors and pull it out into the room  it works on a swivel  and when you dont want it you try to push it back again and then the whole thing tumbles over and the girl throws her hands up to heaven and says mon dieu and screams for the cook and the femme journee and they all three say mon dieu and fall upon it with buckets of water  by the time everything has been extinguished you have made up your mind to substitute for it just the ordinary explosive stove to which you are accustomed    i am considered cold and mad   in your own house you can of course open the windows and thus defeat the foreign stove  the rest of the street thinks you mad but then the englishman is considered by all foreigners to be always mad  it is his privilege to be mad  the street thinks no worse of you than it did before and you can breathe in comfort  but in the railway carriage they dont allow you to be mad  in europe unless you are prepared to draw at sight upon the other passengers throw the conductor out of the window and take the train in by yourself it is useless arguing the question of fresh air  the rule abroad is that if any one man objects to the window being open the window remains closed  he does not quarrel with you he rings the bell and points out to the conductor that the temperature of the carriage has sunk to little more than ninety degrees fahrenheit  he thinks a window must be open  the conductor is generally an old soldier he understands being shot he understands being thrown out of window but not the laws of sanitation if as i have explained you shoot him or throw him out on the permanent way that convinces him  he leaves you to discuss the matter with the second conductor who by your action has now of course become the first conductor  as there are generally half a dozen of these conductors scattered about the train the process of educating them becomes monotonous  you generally end by submitting to the law  unless you happen to be an american woman  never did my heart go out more gladly to america as a nation than one spring day travelling from berne to vevey  we had been sitting for an hour in an atmosphere that would have rendered a dante disinclined to notice things  dante after ten minutes in that atmosphere would have lost all interest in the show he would not have asked questions  he would have whispered to virgil  get me out of this old man theres a good fellow    sometimes i wish i were an american woman   the carriage was crowded chiefly with germans  every window was closed every ventilator shut  the hot air quivered round our feet  seventeen men and four women were smoking two children were sucking peppermints and an old married couple were eating their lunch consisting chiefly of garlic  at a junction the door was thrown open  the foreigner opens the door a little way glides in and closes it behind him  this was not a foreigner but an american lady en voyage accompanied by five other american ladies  they marched in carrying packages  they could not find six seats together so they scattered up and down the carriage  the first thing that each woman did the moment she could get her hands free was to dash for the nearest window and haul it down  astonishes me said the first woman that somebody is not dead in this carriage  their idea i think was that through asphyxiation we had become comatose and but for their entrance would have died unconscious  it is a current of air that is wanted said another of the ladies  so they opened the door at the front of the carriage and four of them stood outside on the platform chatting pleasantly and admiring the scenery while two of them opened the door at the other end and took photographs of the lake of geneva  the carriage rose and cursed them in six languages  bells were rung conductors came flying in  it was all of no use  those american ladies were cheerful but firm  they argued with volubility they argued standing in the open doorway  the conductors familiar no doubt with the american lady and her ways shrugged their shoulders and retired  the other passengers undid their bags and bundles and wrapped themselves up in shawls and jaeger nightshirts  i met the ladies afterwards in lausanne  they told me they had been condemned to a fine of forty francs apiece  they also explained to me that they had not the slightest intention of paying it     chapter vii   too much postcard   the postcard craze is dying out in germanythe land of its birthi am told  in germany they do things thoroughly or not at all  the german when he took to sending postcards abandoned almost every other pursuit in life  the german tourist never knew where he had been until on reaching home again he asked some friend or relation to allow him to look over the postcards he had sent  then it was he began to enjoy his trip  what a charming old town the german tourist would exclaim  i wish i could have found time while i was there to have gone outside the hotel and have had a look round  still it is pleasant to think one has been there  i suppose you did not have much time his friend would suggest  we did not get there till the evening the tourist would explain  we were busy till dark buying postcards and then in the morning there was the writing and addressing to be done and when that was over and we had had our breakfast it was time to leave again  he would take up another card showing the panorama from a mountain top  sublime colossal he would cry enraptured  if i had known it was anything like that id have stopped another day and had a look at it  it was always worth seeing the arrival of a party of german tourists in a schwartzwald village  leaping from the coach they would surge round the solitary gendarme  where is the postcard shop  tell uswe have only two hourswhere do we get postcards  the gendarme scenting trinkgeld would head them at the doublequick stout old gentlemen unaccustomed to the doublequick stouter frauen gathering up their skirts with utter disregard to all propriety slim fraulein clinging to their beloved would run after him  nervous pedestrians would fly for safety into doorways careless loiterers would be swept into the gutter  in the narrow doorway of the postcard shop trouble would begin  the cries of suffocated women and trampled children the curses of strong men would rend the air  the german is a peaceful lawabiding citizen but in the hunt for postcards he was a beast  a woman would pounce on a tray of cards commence selecting suddenly the tray would be snatched from her  she would burst into tears and hit the person nearest to her with her umbrella  the cunning and the strong would secure the best cards  the weak and courteous be left with pictures of post offices and railway stations  torn and dishevelled the crowd would rush back to the hotel sweep crockery from the table andsucking stumpy pencilswrite feverishly  a hurried meal would follow  then the horses would be put to again the german tourists would climb back to their places and be driven away asking of the coachman what the name of the place they had just left might happen to be    the postcard as a family curse   one presumes that even to the patient german the thing grew tiresome  in the fliegende blatter two young clerks were represented discussing the question of summer holidays  where are you going asks a of b  nowhere answers b  cant you afford it asks the sympathetic a  only been able to save up enough for the postcards answers b gloomily no money left for the trip  men and women carried bulky volumes containing the names and addresses of the people to whom they had promised to send cards  everywhere through winding forest glade by silver sea on mountain pathway one met with prematurely aged looking tourists muttering as they walked  did i send aunt gretchen a postcard from that last village that we stopped at or did i address two to cousin lisa  then again maybe the picture postcard led to disappointment uninteresting towns clamoured as illfavoured spinsters in a photographic studio to be made beautiful  i want says the lady a photograph my friends will really like  some of these secondrate photographers make one look quite plain  i dont want you to flatter me if you understand i merely want something nice  the obliging photographer does his best  the nose is carefully toned down the wart becomes a dimple her own husband doesnt know her  the postcard artist has ended by imagining everything as it might have been  if it were not for the houses says the postcard artist to himself this might have been a picturesque old high street of mediaeval aspect  so he draws a picture of the high street as it might have been  the lover of quaint architecture travels out of his way to see it and when he finds it and contrasts it with the picture postcard he gets mad  i bought a postcard myself once representing the market place of a certain french town  it seemed to me looking at the postcard that i hadnt really seen francenot yet  i travelled nearly a hundred miles to see that market place  i was careful to arrive on market day and to get there at the right time  i reached the market square and looked at it then i asked a gendarme where it was  he said it was therethat i was in it  i said i dont mean this one i want the other one the picturesque one  he said it was the only market square they had  i took the postcard from my pocket  where are all the girls i asked him  what girls he demanded    the artists dream   why these girls i showed him the postcard there ought to have been about a hundred of them  there was not a plain one among the lot  many of them i should have called beautiful  they were selling flowers and fruit all kinds of fruitcherries strawberries rosycheeked apples luscious grapesall freshly picked and sparkling with dew  the gendarme said he had never seen any girlsnot in this particular square referring casually to the blood of saints and martyrs he said he would like to see a few girls in that town worth looking at  in the square itself sat six motherly old souls round a lamppost  one of them had a moustache and was smoking a pipe but in other respects i have no doubt was all a woman should be  two of them were selling fish  that is they would have sold fish no doubt had anyone been there to buy fish  the gaily clad thousands of eager purchasers pictured in the postcard were represented by two workmen in blue blouses talking at a corner mostly with their fingers a small boy walking backwards with the idea apparently of not missing anything behind him and a yellow dog that sat on the kerb and had given up all hopejudging from his expressionof anything ever happening again  with the gendarme and myself these four were the only living creatures in the square  the rest of the market consisted of eggs and a few emaciated fowls hanging from a sort of broom handle  and wheres the cathedral i asked the gendarme  it was a gothic structure in the postcard of evident antiquity  he said there had once been a cathedral  it was now a brewery he pointed it out to me  he said he thought some portion of the original south wall had been retained  he thought the manager of the brewery might be willing to show it to me  and the fountain i demanded and all these doves  he said there had been talk of a fountain  he believed the design had already been prepared  i took the next train back  i do not now travel much out of my way to see the original of the picture postcard  maybe others have had like experience and the picture postcard as a guide to the continent has lost its value  the dealer has fallen back upon the eternal feminine  the postcard collector is confined to girls  through the kindness of correspondents i possess myself some fifty to a hundred girls or perhaps it would be more correct to say one girl in fifty to a hundred different hats  i have her in big hats i have her in small hats i have her in no hat at all  i have her smiling and i have her looking as if she had lost her last sixpence  i have her overdressed i have her decidedly underdressed but she is much the same girl  very young men cannot have too many of her but myself i am getting tired of her  i suppose it is the result of growing old    why not the eternal male for a change   girls of my acquaintance are also beginning to grumble at her  i often think it hard on girls that the artist so neglects the eternal male  why should there not be portraits of young men in different hats young men in big hats young men in little hats young men smiling archly young men looking noble  girls dont want to decorate their rooms with pictures of other girls they want rows of young men beaming down upon them  but possibly i am sinning my mercies  a father hears what young men dont  the girl in real life is feeling it keenly the impossible standard set for her by the popular artist  real skirts dont hang like that she grumbles its not in the nature of skirts  you cant have feet that size  it isnt our fault they are not made  look at those waists  there would be no room to put anything  nature in fashioning woman has not yet crept up to the artistic ideal the young man studies the picture on the postcard on the coloured almanack given away at christmas by the local grocer on the advertisement of jones soap and thinks with discontent of polly perkins who in a natural way is as pretty a girl as can be looked for in this imperfect world  thus it is that woman has had to take to shorthand and typewriting  modern woman is being ruined by the artist    how women are ruined by art   mr anstey tells a story of a young barber who fell in love with his own wax model  all day he dreamed of the impossible  shethe young lady of waxlike complexion with her everlasting expression of dignity combined with amiability  no girl of his acquaintance could compete with her  if i remember rightly he died a bachelor still dreaming of waxlike perfection  perhaps it is as well we men are not handicapped to the same extent  if every hoarding if every picture shop window if every illustrated journal teemed with illustrations of the ideal young man in perfect fitting trousers that never bagged at the knees  maybe it would result in our cooking our own breakfasts and making our own beds to the end of our lives  the novelist and playwright as it is have made things difficult enough for us  in books and plays the young man makes love with a flow of language a wealth of imagery that must have taken him years to acquire what does the novelreading girl think i wonder when the real young man proposes to her  he has not called her anything in particular  possibly he has got as far as suggesting she is a duck or a daisy or hinting shyly that she is his bee or his honeysuckle in his excitement he is not quite sure which  in the novel she has been reading the hero has likened the heroine to half the vegetable kingdom  elementary astronomy has been exhausted in his attempt to describe to her the impression her appearance leaves on him  bond street has been sacked in his endeavour to get it clearly home to her what different parts of her are likeher eyes her teeth her heart her hair her ears  delicacy alone prevents his extending the catalogue  a fiji island lover might possibly go further we have not yet had the fiji island novel  by the time he is through with it she must have a somewhat confused notion of herselfa vague conviction that she is a sort of condensed south kensington museum    difficulty of living up to the poster   poor angelina must feel dissatisfied with the edwin of real life  i am not sure that art and fiction have not made life more difficult for us than even it was intended to be  the view from the mountain top is less extensive than represented by the picture postcard  the play i fear me does not always come up to the poster  polly perkins is pretty enough as girls go but oh for the young lady of the grocers almanack  poor dear john is very nice and loves usso he tells us in his stupid halting way but how can we respond when we remember how the man loved in the play  the artist has fashioned his dream of delight and the workaday world by comparison seems tame to us     chapter viii   the lady and the problem   she is a good woman the heroine of the problem play but accidents will happen and other people were to blame  perhaps that is really the problem who was responsible for the heroines past  was it her father  she does not say sonot in so many words that is not her way  it is not for her the silentlysuffering victim of complicated antecedent incidents to purchase justice for herself by pointing the finger of accusation against him who whatever his faults may be was once at all events her father  that one fact in his favour she can never forget  indeed she would not if she could  that one asset for whatever it may be worth by the time the day of judgment arrives he shall retain  it shall not be taken from him  after all he was my father  she admits it with the accent on the was  that he is so no longer he has only himself to blame  his subsequent behaviour has apparently rendered it necessary for her to sever the relationship  i love you she has probably said to him paraphrasing othellos speech to cassio it is my duty andas by this time you must be awareit is my keen if occasionally somewhat involved sense of duty that is the cause of almost all our troubles in this play  you will always remain the object of what i cannot help feeling is misplaced affection on my part mingled with contempt  but never more be relative of mine  certain it is that but for her father she would never have had a past failing anyone else on whom to lay the blame for whatever the lady may have done we can generally fall back upon the father  he becomes our sheetanchor so to speak  there are plays in which at first sight it would almost appear there was nobody to blamenobody except the heroine herself  it all seems to happen just because she is no better than she ought to be clearly the fathers fault for ever having had a daughter no better than she ought to be  as the heroine of a certain problem play once put it neatly and succinctly to the old man himself it is you parents that make us children what we are  she had him there  he had not a word to answer for himself but went off centre leaving his hat behind him  sometimes however the father is merely a scientistwhich in stageland is another term for helpless imbecile  in stageland if a gentleman has not got to have much brain and you do not know what else to make of him you let him be a scientistand then of course he is only to blame in a minor degree  if he had not been a scientistthinking more of his silly old stars or beetles than of his intricate daughter he might have done something  the heroine does not say precisely what perhaps have taken her up stairs now and again while she was still young and susceptible of improvement and have spanked some sense into her    the stage hero who for once had justice done to him   i remember witnessing long ago in a country barn a highly moral play it was a problem play now i come to think of it  at least that is it would have been a problem play but that the party with the past happened in this case to be merely a male thing  stage life presents no problems to the man  the hero of the problem play has not got to wonder what to do he has got to wonder only what the heroine will do next  the herohe was not exactly the hero he would have been the hero had he not been hanged in the last act  but for that he was rather a nice young man full of sentiment and not ashamed of it  from the scaffold he pleaded for leave to embrace his mother just once more before he died  it was a pretty idea  the hangman himself was touched  the necessary leave was granted him  he descended the steps and flung his arms round the sobbing old lady andbit off her nose  after that he told her why he had bitten off her nose  it appeared that when he was a boy he had returned home one evening with a rabbit in his pocket  instead of putting him across her knee and working into him the eighth commandment she had said nothing but that it seemed to be a fairly useful sort of rabbit and had sent him out into the garden to pick onions  if she had done her duty by him then he would not have been now in his present most unsatisfactory position and she would still have had her nose  the fathers and mothers in the audience applauded but the children scenting addition to precedent looked glum  maybe it is something of this kind the heroine is hinting at  perhaps the problem has nothing to do with the heroine herself but with the heroines parents what is the best way of bringing up a daughter who shows the slightest sign of developing a tendency towards a past  can it be done by kindness  and if not how much  occasionally the parents attempt to solve the problem so far as they are concerned by dying youngshortly after the heroines birth  no doubt they argue to themselves this is their only chance of avoiding future blame  but they do not get out of it so easily  ah if i had only had a motheror even a father cries the heroine one feels how mean it was of them to slip away as they did  the fact remains however that they are dead  one despises them for dying but beyond that it is difficult to hold them personally responsible for the heroines subsequent misdeeds  the argument takes to itself new shape  is it fate that is to blame  the lady herself would seem to favour this suggestion  it has always been her fate she explains to bring suffering and misery upon those she loves  at first according to her own account she rebelled against this cruel fatepossibly instigated thereto by the people unfortunate enough to be loved by her  but of late she has come to accept this strange destiny of hers with touching resignation  it grieves her when she thinks of it that she is unable to imbue those she loves with her own patient spirit they seem to be a fretful little band  considered as a scapegoat fate as compared with the father has this advantage it is always about it cannot slip away and die before the real trouble begins it cannot even plead a scientific head it is there all the time  with care one can blame it for most everything  the vexing thing about it is that it does not mind being blamed  one cannot make fate feel small and mean  it affords no relief to our harrowed feelings to cry out indignantly to fate look here what you have done look at this sweet and wellproportioned lady compelled to travel first class accompanied by an amount of luggage that must be a perpetual nightmare to her maid from one fashionable european resort to another forced to exist on a wellsecured income of apparently five thousand a year most of which has to go in clothes beloved by only the best people in the play talked about by everybody incessantly to the exclusion of everybody elseall the neighbours interested in her and in nobody else much all the women envying her all the men tumbling over one another after herlooks in spite of all her worries not a day older than twentythree and has discovered a dressmaker never yet known to have been an hour behind her promise  and all your fault yours fate  will nothing move you to shame    she has a way of mislaying her husband   it brings no satisfaction with it speaking out ones mind to fate  we want to see him before us the thing of flesh and blood that has brought all this upon her  was it that early husbandor rather the gentleman she thought was her husband  as a matter of fact he was a husband  only he did not happen to be hers  that naturally confused her  then who is my husband she seems to have said to herself i had a husband i remember it distinctly  difficult to know them apart from one another says the lady with the past the way they dress them all alike nowadays  i suppose it does not really matter  they are much the same as one another when you get them home  doesnt do to be too fussy  she is a careless woman  she is always mislaying that early husband  and she has an unfortunate knack of finding him at the wrong moment  perhaps that is the problem what is a lady to do with a husband for whom she has no further use  if she gives him away he is sure to come back like the clever dog that is sent in a hamper to the other end of the kingdom and three days afterwards is found gasping on the doorstep  if she leaves him in the middle of south africa with most of the heavy baggage and all the debts she may reckon it a certainty that on her return from her next honeymoon he will be the first to greet her  her surprise at meeting him again is a little unreasonable  she seems to be under the impression that because she has forgotten him he is for all practical purposes dead  why i forgot all about him she seems to be arguing to herself seven years ago at least  according to the laws of nature there ought to be nothing left of him but just his bones  she is indignant at finding he is still alive and lets him know ittells him he is a beast for turning up at his sisters party and pleads to him for one last favour that he will go away where neither she nor anybody else of any importance will ever see him or hear of him again  thats all she asks of him  if he make a point of it she willthough her costume is ill adapted to the exercisego down upon her knees to ask it of him  he brutally retorts that he doesnt know where to get  the lady travels round a good deal and seems to be in most places  she accepts weekend invitations to the houses of his nearest relatives  she has married his first cousin and is now getting up a bazaar with the help of his present wife  how he is to avoid her he does not quite see  perhaps by the by that is really the problem where is the early husband to disappear to  even if every time he saw her coming he were to duck under the table somebody would be sure to notice it and make remarks  ought he to take himself out one dark night tie a brick round his neck and throw himself into a pond    what is a lady to do with a husband when she has finished with him   but men are so selfish  the idea does not even occur to him and the lady herself is too generous to do more than just hint at it  maybe it is society that is to blame  there comes a luminous moment when it is suddenly revealed to the heroine of the problem play that it is society that is at the bottom of this thing  she has felt all along there was something the matter  why has she never thought of it before here all these years has she been going about blaming her poor old father her mother for dying too soon the remarkable circumstances attending her girlhood that dear old stupid husband she thought was hers and all the while the really culpable party has been existing unsuspected under her very nose  she clears away the furniture a bit and tells society exactly what she thinks of itshe is always good at that telling people what she thinks of them  other peoples failings do not escape her not for long  if society would only step out for a moment and look at itself with her eyes something might be done  if society now that the thing has been pointed out to it has still any lingering desire to live let it look at her  this that she is society has made her  let society have a walk round her and then go home and reflect    could sheherselfhave been to blame   it lifts a load from us fixing the blame on society  there were periods in the play when we hardly knew what to think  the scientific father the dead mother the early husband it was difficult to grasp the fact that they alone were to blame  one felt there was something to be said for even them  ugly thoughts would cross our mind that perhaps the heroine herself was not altogether irreproachablethat possibly there would have been less problem if thinking a little less about her clothes yearning a little less to do nothing all day long and be perfectly happy she had pulled herself together told herself that the world was not built exclusively for her and settled down to the existence of an ordinary decent woman  looking at the thing all round that is perhaps the best solution of the problem it is society that is to blame  we had better keep to that     chapter ix   civilization and the unemployed   where civilization fails is in not providing men and women with sufficient work  in the stone age man was one imagines kept busy  when he was not looking for his dinner or eating his dinner or sleeping off the effects of his dinner he was hard at work with a club clearing the neighbourhood of what one doubts not he would have described as aliens the healthy palaeolithic man would have had a contempt for cobden rivalling that of mr chamberlain himself  he did not take the incursion of the foreigner lying down  one pictures him in the minds eye unscientific perhaps but active to a degree difficult to conceive in these degenerate days  now up a tree hurling cocoanuts the next moment on the ground flinging roots and rocks  both having tolerably hard heads the argument would of necessity be long and heated  phrases that have since come to be meaningless had in those days a real significance  when a palaeolithic politician claimed to have crushed his critic he meant that he had succeeded in dropping a tree or a ton of earth upon him  when it was said that one bright and intelligent member of that early sociology had annihilated his opponent that opponents friends and relations took no further interest in him  it meant that he was actually annihilated  bits of him might be found but the most of him would be hopelessly scattered  when the adherents of any particular cave dweller remarked that their man was wiping the floor with his rival it did not mean that he was talking himself red in the face to a bored audience of sixteen friends and a reporter  it meant that he was dragging that rival by the legs round the enclosure and making the place damp and untidy with him    early instances of dumping   maybe the cave dweller finding nuts in his own neighbourhood growing scarce would emigrate himself for even in that age the politician was not always logical  thus roles became reversed  the defender of his country became the alien dumping himself where he was not wanted  the charm of those early political arguments lay in their simplicity  a child could have followed every point  there could never have been a moments doubt even among his own followers as to what a palaeolithic statesman really meant to convey  at the close of the contest the party who considered it had won the moral victory would be cleared away or buried neatly on the spot according to taste and the discussion until the arrival of the next generation was voted closed  all this must have been harassing but it did serve to pass away the time  civilization has brought into being a section of the community with little else to do but to amuse itself  for youth to play is natural the young barbarian plays the kitten plays the colt gambols the lamb skips  but man is the only animal that gambols and jumps and skips after it has reached maturity  were we to meet an elderly bearded goat springing about in the air and behaving generally speaking like a kid we should say it had gone mad  yet we throng in our thousands to watch elderly ladies and gentlemen jumping about after a ball twisting themselves into strange shapes rushing racing falling over one another and present them with silverbacked hairbrushes and goldhandled umbrellas as a reward to them for doing so  imagine some scientific inhabitant of one of the larger fixed stars examining us through a magnifyingglass as we examine ants  our amusements would puzzle him  the ball of all sorts and sizes from the marble to the pushball would lead to endless scientific argument  what is it  why are these men and women always knocking it about seizing it wherever and whenever they find it and worrying it  the observer from that fixed star would argue that the ball must be some malignant creature of fiendish power the great enemy of the human race watching our cricketfields our tenniscourts our golf links he would conclude that a certain section of mankind had been told off to do battle with the ball on behalf of mankind in general  as a rule so he would report it is a superior class of insect to which this special duty has been assigned  they are a friskier gaudier species than their fellows    cricket as viewed from the fixed stars   for this one purpose they appear to be kept and fed  they do no other work so far as i have been able to ascertain  carefully selected and trained their mission is to go about the world looking for balls whenever they find a ball they set to work to kill it  but the vitality of these balls is extraordinary  there is a mediumsized reddish species that on an average takes three days to kill  when one of these is discovered specially trained champions are summoned from every corner of the country  they arrive in hot haste eager for the battle which takes place in the presence of the entire neighbourhood  the number of champions for some reason or another is limited to twentytwo  each one seizing in turn a large piece of wood rushes at the ball as it flies along the ground or through the air and strikes at it with all his force  when exhausted he can strike no longer he throws down his weapon and retires into a tent where he is restored to strength by copious draughts of a drug the nature of which i have been unable to discover  meanwhile another has picked up the fallen weapon and the contest is continued without a moments interruption  the ball makes frantic efforts to escape from its tormentors but every time it is captured and flung back  so far as can be observed it makes no attempt at retaliation its only object being to get away though occasionallywhether by design or accidentit succeeds in inflicting injury upon one or other of its executioners or more often upon one of the spectators striking him either on the head or about the region of the waist which judging by results would appear from the balls point of view to be the better selection  these small reddish balls are quickened into life evidently by the heat of the sun in the cold season they disappear and their place is taken by a much larger ball  this ball the champions kill by striking it with their feet and with their heads  but sometimes they will attempt to suffocate it by falling on it some dozen of them at a time  another of these seemingly harmless enemies of the human race is a small white ball of great cunning and resource  it frequents sandy districts by the sea coast and open spaces near the large towns  it is pursued with extraordinary animosity by a floridfaced insect of fierce aspect and rotundity of figure  the weapon he employs is a long stick loaded with metal  with one blow he will send the creature through the air sometimes to a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile yet so vigorous is the constitution of these balls that it will fall to earth apparently but little damaged  it is followed by the rotund man accompanied by a smaller insect carrying spare clubs  though hampered by the prominent whiteness of its skin the extreme smallness of this ball often enables it to defy rediscovery and at such times the fury of the little round man is terrible to contemplate  he dances round the spot where the ball has disappeared making frenzied passes at the surrounding vegetation with his club uttering the while the most savage and bloodcurdling growls  occasionally striking at the small creature in fury he will miss it altogether and having struck merely the air will sit down heavily upon the ground or striking the solid earth will shatter his own club  then a curious thing takes place all the other insects standing round place their right hand before their mouth and turning away their faces shake their bodies to and fro emitting a strange crackling sound  whether this is to be regarded as a mere expression of their grief that the blow of their comrade should have miscarried or whether one may assume it to be a ceremonious appeal to their gods for better luck next time i have not as yet made up my mind  the striker meanwhile raises both arms the hands tightly clenched towards the heavens and utters what is probably a prayer prepared expressly for the occasion    the heir of all ages  his inheritance   in similar manner he the celestial observer proceeds to describe our billiard matches our tennis tournaments our croquet parties  maybe it never occurs to him that a large section of our race surrounded by eternity would devote its entire span of life to sheer killing of time a middleaged friend of mine a cultured gentleman a ma of cambridge assured me the other day that notwithstanding all his experiences of life the thing that still gave him the greatest satisfaction was the accomplishment of a successful drive to leg  rather a quaint commentary on our civilization is it not  the singers have sung and the builders have builded  the artists have fashioned their dreams of delight  the martyrs for thought and freedom have died their death knowledge has sprung from the bones of ignorance civilization for ten thousand years has battled with brutality to this resultthat a specimen gentleman of the twentieth century the heir of all the ages finds his greatest joy in life the striking of a ball with a chunk of wood  human energy human suffering has been wasted  such crown of happiness for a man might surely have been obtained earlier and at less cost  was it intended  are we on the right track  the childs play is wiser  the battered doll is a princess  within the sand castle dwells an ogre  it is with imagination that he plays  his games have some relation to life it is the man only who is content with this everlasting knocking about of a ball  the majority of mankind is doomed to labour so constant so exhausting that no opportunity is given it to cultivate its brain civilization has arranged that a small privileged minority shall alone enjoy that leisure necessary to the development of thought  and what is the answer of this leisured class  it is  we will do nothing for the world that feeds us clothes us keeps us in luxury  we will spend our whole existence knocking balls about watching other people knocking balls about arguing with one another as to the best means of knocking balls about    is it playing the game   is itto use their own jargonplaying the game  and the queer thing is this overworked world that stints itself to keep them in idleness approves of the answer  the flannelled fool the muddied oaf is the pet of the people their hero their ideal  but maybe all this is mere jealousy  myself i have never been clever at knocking balls about     chapter x   patience and the waiter   the slowest waiter i know is the british railway refreshmentroom waiter  his very breathingregular harmonious penetrating instinct as it is with all the better attributes of a wellpreserved grandfathers clockconveys suggestion of dignity and peace  he is a huge impressive person  there emanates from him an atmosphere of lotusland  the otherwise unattractive refreshmentroom becomes an oasis of repose amid the turmoil of a fretful world  all things conspire to aid him the ancient joints ranged side by side like corpses in a morgue each one decently hidden under its white muslin shroud whispering of death and decay the dish of dead flies thoughtfully placed in the centre of the table the framed advertisements extolling the virtues of heavy beers and stouts of weird champagnes emanating from hauntedlooking chateaux situateif one may judge from the illustrationin the midst of desert lands the sleepinviting buzz of the bluebottles  the spirit of the place steals over you  on entering with a quarter of an hour to spare your idea was a cutlet and a glass of claret  in the face of the refreshmentroom waiter the notion appears frivolous not to say unenglish  you order cold beef and pickles with a pint of bitter in a tankard  to win the british waiters approval you must always order beer in a tankard  the british waiter in his ideals is mediaeval there is a shakespearean touch about a tankard  a soapy potato will of course be added  afterwards a ton of cheese and a basin of rabbits food floating in water the british salad will be placed before you  you will work steadily through the whole anticipating the somnolence that will subsequently fall upon you with a certain amount of satisfaction  it will serve to dispel the last lingering regret at the reflection that you will miss your appointment and suffer thereby serious inconvenience if not positive loss  these things are of the worldthe noisy tiresome world you have left without  to the english traveller the foreign waiter in the earlier stages of his career is a burden and a trial  when he is completewhen he really can talk english i rejoice in him  when i object to him is when his english is worse than my french or german and when he will for his own educational purposes insist nevertheless that the conversation shall be entirely in english  i would he came to me some other time  i would so much rather make it after dinner or say the next morning  i hate giving lessons during meal times  besides to a man with feeble digestion this sort of thing can lead to trouble  one waiter i met at an hotel in dijon knew very little englishabout as much as a poll parrot  the moment i entered the salle amanger he started to his feet  ah  you english he cried  well what about us i answered  it was during the period of the boer war  i took it he was about to denounce the english nation generally  i was looking for something to throw at him  you englishyou englishman yes he repeated  and then i understood he had merely intended a question  i owned up that i was and accused him in turn of being a frenchman  he admitted it introductions as it were thus over i thought i would order dinner  i ordered it in french  i am not bragging of my french i never wanted to learn french  even as a boy it was more the idea of others than of myself  i learnt as little as possible  but i have learnt enough to live in places where they cant or wont speak anything else  left to myself i could have enjoyed a very satisfactory dinner  i was tired with a long days journey and hungry  they cook well at this hotel  i had been looking forward to my dinner for hours and hours  i had sat down in my imagination to a consomme bisque sole au gratin a poulet saute and an omelette au fromage    waiterkind in the making   it is wrong to let ones mind dwell upon carnal delights i see that now at the time i was mad about it  the fool would not even listen to me  he had got it into his garlicsodden brain that all englishmen live on beef and nothing but beef  he swept aside all my suggestions as though they had been the prattlings of a foolish child  you haf nice biftek  not at all done  yes  no i dont i answered  i dont want what the cook of a french provincial hotel calls a biftek  i want something to eat  i want apparently he understood neither english nor french  yes yes he interrupted cheerfully with pottitoes  with what i asked  i thought for the moment he was suggesting potted pigs feet in the nearest english he could get to it  pottito he repeated boil pottito  yes  and pell hell  i felt like telling him to go there i suppose he meant pale ale  it took me about five minutes to get that beefsteak out of his head  by the time i had done it i did not care what i had for dinner  i took potdu jour and veal  he added on his own initiative a thing that looked like a poultice  i did not try the taste of it  he explained it was plum poodeen  i fancy he had made it himself  this fellow is typical you meet him everywhere abroad  he translates your bill into english for you calls ten centimes a penny calculates twelve francs to the pound and presses a handful of sous affectionately upon you as change for a napoleon  the cheating waiter is common to all countries though in italy and belgium he flourishes perhaps more than elsewhere  but the british waiter when detected becomes surlydoes not take it nicely  the foreign waiter is amiable about itbears no malice  he is grieved maybe at your language but that is because he is thinking of youthe possible effect of it upon your future  to try and stop you he offers you another four sous  the story is told of a frenchman who not knowing the legal fare adopted the plan of doling out pennies to a london cabman one at a time continuing until the man looked satisfied  myself i doubt the story  from what i know of the london cabman i can see him leaning down still with outstretched hand the horse between the shafts long since dead the cab chockfull of coppers and yet no expression of satiety upon his face  but the story would appear to have crossed the channel and to have commended itself to the foreign waiterespecially to the railway refreshmentroom waiter  he doles out sous to the traveller one at a time with the air of a man who is giving away the savings of a lifetime if after five minutes or so you still appear discontented he goes away quite suddenly  you think he has gone to open another chest of halfpence but when a quarter of an hour has passed and he does not reappear you inquire about him amongst the other waiters  a gloom at once falls upon them  you have spoken of the very thing that has been troubling them  he used to be a waiter here onceone might almost say until quite recently  as to what has become of himah there you have them  if in the course of their chequered career they ever come across him they will mention to him that you are waiting for him meanwhile a stentorianvoiced official is shouting that your train is on the point of leaving  you console yourself with the reflection that it might have been more  it always might have been more sometimes it is    his little mistakes   a waiter at the gare du nord in brussels on one occasion pressed upon me a fivefranc piece a small turkish coin the value of which was unknown to me and remains so to this day a distinctly bad two francs and from a quarter of a pound to six ounces of centimes as change for a twentyfranc note after deducting the price of a cup of coffee  he put it down with the air of one subscribing to a charity  we looked at one another  i suppose i must have conveyed to him the impression of being discontented  he drew a purse from his pocket  the action suggested that for the purpose of satisfying my inordinate demands he would be compelled to draw upon his private resources but it did not move me abstracting reluctantly a fiftycentime piece he added it to the heap upon the table  i suggested his taking a seat as at this rate it seemed likely we should be doing business together for some time  i think he gathered i was not a fool  hitherto he had been judging i suppose purely from appearances  but he was not in the least offended  ah he cried with a cheery laugh monsieur comprend  he swept the whole nonsense back into his bag and gave me the right change  i slipped my arm through his and insisted upon the pleasure of his society until i had examined each and every coin  he went away chuckling and told another waiter all about it  they both of them bowed to me as i went out and wished me a pleasant journey  i left them still chuckling  a british waiter would have been sulky all the afternoon  the waiter who insists upon mistaking you for the heir of all the rothschilds used to cost me dear when i was younger  i find the best plan is to take him in hand at the beginning and disillusion him sweep aside his talk of 84 perrier jouet followed by a 79 chateau lafite and ask him as man to man if he can conscientiously recommend the saint julien at twoandsix  after that he settles down to his work and talks sense  the fatherly waiter is sometimes a comfort  you feel that he knows best your instinct is to address him as uncle  but you remember yourself in time  when you are dining a lady however and wish to appear important he is apt to be in the way  it seems somehow to be his dinner  you have a sense almost of being de trop  the greatest insult you can offer a waiter is to mistake him for your waiter  you think he is your waiterthere is the bald head the black sidewhiskers the roman nose  but your waiter had blue eyes this man soft hazel  you had forgotten to notice the eyes  you bar his progress and ask him for the red pepper  the haughty contempt with which he regards you is painful to bear  it is as if you had insulted a lady  he appears to be saying the same thing  i think you have made a mistake  you are possibly confusing me with somebody else i have not the honour of your acquaintance    how to insult him   i do not wish it to be understood that i am in the habit of insulting ladies but occasionally i have made an innocent mistake and have met with some such response  the wrong waiter conveys to me precisely the same feeling of humiliation  i will send your waiter to you he answers  his tone implies that there are waiters and waiters some may not mind what class of person they serve others though poor have their selfrespect  it is clear to you now why your waiter is keeping away from you the man is ashamed of being your waiter  he is watching probably for an opportunity to approach you when nobody is looking  the other waiter finds him for you he was hiding behind a screen  table fortytwo wants you the other tells him  the tone of voice adds  if you like to encourage this class of customer that is your business but dont ask me to have anything to do with him  even the waiter has his feelings     chapter xi   the everlasting newness of woman   an oriental visitor was returning from our shores to his native land  well asked the youthful diplomatist who had been told off to show him round as on the deck of the steamer they shook hands what do you now think of england  too much woman answered the grave orientalist and descended to his cabin  the young diplomatist returned to the shore thoughtful and later in the day a few of us discussed the matter in a faroff dimlylighted corner of the club smokingroom  has the pendulum swung too far the other way  could there be truth in our oriental friends terse commentary  the eternal feminine  the western world has been handed over to her  the stranger from mars or jupiter would describe us as a hive of women the soberclad male being retained apparently on condition of its doing all the hard work and making itself generally useful  formerly it was the man who wore the fine clothes who went to the shows  today it is the woman gorgeously clad for whom the shows are organized  the man dressed in a serviceable and unostentatious not to say depressing suit of black accompanies her for the purpose of carrying her cloak and calling her carriage  among the working classes life of necessity remains primitive the law of the cave is still with slight modification the law of the slum  but in upper and middleclass circles the man is now the womans servant  i remember being present while a mother of my acquaintance was instilling into the mind of her little son the advantages of being born a man  a little girl cousin was about to spend a week with him  it was impressed upon him that if she showed a liking for any of his toys he was at once to give them up to her  but why mamma he demanded evidently surprised  because my dear you are a little man  should she break them he was not to smack her head or kick heras his instinct might prompt him to do  he was just to say  oh it is of no consequence at all and to look as if he meant it    doctor says she is not to be bothered   she was always to choose the gameto have the biggest apple  there was much more of a similar nature  it was all because he was a little man and she was a little woman  at the end he looked up puzzled  but dont she do anything cos shes a little girl  it was explained to him that she didnt  by right of being born a little girl she was exempt from all duty  woman nowadays is not taking any duty  she objects to housekeeping she calls it domestic slavery and feels she was intended for higher things what higher things she does not condescend to explain  one or two wives of my acquaintance have persuaded their husbands that these higher things are allimportant  the home has been given up  in company with other strivers after higher things they live now in dismal barracks differing but little from a glorified bloomsbury lodginghouse  but they call them mansions or courts and seem proud of the address  they are not bothered with servantswith housekeeping  the idea of the modern woman is that she is not to be bothered with anything  i remember the words with which one of these ladies announced her departure from her bothering home  oh well im tired of trouble she confided to another lady so ive made up my mind not to have any more of it  artemus ward tells us of a man who had been in prison for twenty years suddenly a bright idea occurred to him he opened the window and got out here have we poor foolish mortals been imprisoned in this troublesome world for lord knows how many millions of years  we have got so used to trouble we thought there was no help for it  we have told ourselves that man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards  we imagined the only thing to be done was to bear it philosophically  why did not this bright young creature come along beforeshow us the way out  all we had to do was to give up the bothering home and the bothering servants and go into a mansion or a court  it seems that you leave trouble outsidein charge of the hallporter one supposes  he ties it up for you as the commissionaire of the army and navy stores ties up your dog  if you want it again you ask for it as you come out  small wonder that the court and mansion are growing in popularity every day    that higher life   they have nothing to do now all day long these soaring wives of whom i am speaking  they would scorn to sew on a shirtbutton even  are there not other womenof an inferior breedspecially fashioned by providence for the doing of such slavish tasks  they have no more bothers of any kind  they are free to lead the higher life  what i am waiting for is a glimpse of the higher life  one of them it is true has taken up the violin  another of them is devoting her emancipation to poker work  a third is learning skirtdancing  are these the higher things for which women are claiming freedom from all duty  and if so is there not danger that the closing of our homes may lead to the crowding up of the world with too much higher things  may there not by the time all bothers have been removed from womans path be too many amateur violinists in the world too many skirtdancers too much poker work  if not what are they these higher things for which so many women are demanding twentyfour hours a day leisure  i want to know  one lady of my acquaintance is a poor law guardian and secretary to a labour bureau  but then she runs a house with two servants four children and a husband and appears to be so used to bothers that she would feel herself lost without them  you can do this kind of work apparently even when you are bothered with a home  it is the skirtdancing and the poker work that cannot brook rivalry  the modern woman has begun to find children a nuisance they interfere with her development  the mere man who has written his poems painted his pictures composed his melodies fashioned his philosophies in the midst of lifes troubles and bothers grows nervous thinking what this new woman must be whose mind is so tremendous that the whole world must be shut up so to speak sent to do its business out of her sight and hearing lest her attention should be distracted  an optimistic friend of mine tells me not to worry myself tells me that it is going to come out all right in the end  woman just now he contends is passing through her college period  the school life of strict surveillance is for ever done with  she is now the young freshwoman  the bothering lessons are over the bothering schoolmaster she has said goodbye to  she has her latchkey and is on her own there are still some bothering rules about being in at twelve oclock and so many attendances each term at chapel  she is indignant  this interferes with her idea that life is to be one long orgie of selfindulgence of pleasure  the college period will passis passing woman will go out into the world take her place there discover that bothers were not left behind in the old schoolhouse will learn that life has duties responsibilities will take up her burden side by side with man will accomplish her destiny    is there anything left for her to learn   meanwhile however she is having a good timesome people think too good a time  she wants the best of both  she demands the joys of independence together with freedom from all workslavery she calls it the servants are not to be allowed to bother her the children are not to be allowed to bother her her husband is not to be allowed to bother her she is to be free to lead the higher life  my dear lady we all want to lead the higher life  i dont want to write these articles  i want somebody else to bother about my rates and taxes my childrens boots while i sit in an easychair and dream about the wonderful books i am going to write if only a stupid public would let me  tommy smith of brixton feels that he was intended for higher things  he does not want to be wasting his time in an office from nine to six adding up figures his proper place in life is that of prime minister or field marshal he feels it  do you think the man has no yearning for higher things  do you think we like the office the shop the factory  we ought to be writing poetry painting pictures the whole world admiring us  you seem to imagine your man goes off every morning to a sort of city picnic has eight hours funwhich he calls workand then comes home to annoy you with chatter about dinner  it is the old fable reversed man said woman had nothing to do all day but to enjoy herself  making a potato pie  what sort of work was that making a potato pie was a lark anybody could make a potato pie  so the woman said try it and took the mans spade and went out into the field and left him at home to make that pie  the man discovered that potato pies took a bit more making than he had reckonedfound that running the house and looking after the children was not quite the merry pastime he had argued  man was a fool  now it is the woman who talks without thinking  how did she like hoeing the potato patch  hard work was it not my dear lady  made your back ache  it came on to rain and you got wet  i dont see that it very much matters which of you hoes the potato patch which of you makes the potato pie  maybe the hoeing of the patch demands more muscleis more suited to the man  maybe the making of the pie may be more in your department  but as i have said i cannot see that this matter is of importance  the patch has to be hoed the pie to be cooked the one cannot do the both  settle it between you and having settled it agree to do each your own work free from this everlasting nagging  i know personally three ladies who have exchanged the womans work for the mans  one was deserted by her husband and left with two young children  she hired a capable woman to look after the house and joined a ladies orchestra as pianist at two pounds a week  she now earns four and works twelve hours a day  the husband of the second fell ill  she set him to write letters and run errands which was light work that he could do and started a dressmakers business  the third was left a widow without means  she sent her three children to boardingschool and opened a tearoom  i dont know how they talked before but i know that they do not talk now as though earning the income was a sort of round game    when they have tried it the other way round   on the continent they have gone deliberately to work one would imagine to reverse matters  abroad woman is always where man ought to be and man where most ladies would prefer to meet with women  the ladies garde robe is superintended by a superannuated sergeant of artillery  when i want to curl my moustache say i have to make application to a superb goldenhaired creature who stands by and watches me with an interested smile  i would be much happier waited on by the superannuated sergeant and my wife tells me she could very well spare him  but it is the law of the land  i remember the first time i travelled with my daughter on the continent  in the morning i was awakened by a piercing scream from her room  i struggled into my pyjamas and rushed to her assistance  i could not see her  i could see nothing but a muscularlooking man in a blue blouse with a can of hot water in one hand and a pair of boots in the other  he appeared to be equally bewildered with myself at the sight of the empty bed  from a cupboard in the corner came a wail of distress  oh do send that horrid man away  whats he doing in my room  i explained to her afterwards that the chambermaid abroad is always an active and willing young man  the foreign girl fills in her time bricklaying and grooming down the horses  it is a young and charming lady who serves you when you enter the tobacconists  she doesnt understand tobacco is unsympathetic with mr frederic harrison regards smoking as a degrading and unclean habit cannot see herself any difference between shag and mayblossom seeing that they are both the same price thinks you fussy  the corset shop is run by a most presentable young man in a vandyck beard  the wife runs the restaurant the man does the cooking and yet the woman has not reached freedom from bother    a brutal suggestion   it sounds brutal but perhaps woman was not intended to live free from all bothers  perhaps even the higher lifethe skirtdancing and the poker workhas its bothers  perhaps woman was intended to take her share of the worlds workof the worlds bothers     chapter xii   why i hate heroes   when i was younger reading the popular novel used to make me sad  i find it vexes others also  i was talking to a bright young girl upon the subject not so very long ago  i just hate the girl in the novel she confessed  she makes me feel real bad  if i dont think of her i feel pleased with myself and good but when i read about herwell im crazy  i would not mind her being smart sometimes  we can all of us say the right thing now and then this girl says them straight away all the time  she dont have to dig for them even they come crowding out of her  there never happens a time when she stands there feeling like a fool and knowing that she looks it as for her hair pon my word there are days when i believe it is a wig id like to get behind her and give it just one pull  it curls of its own accord  she dont seem to have any trouble with it  look at this mop of mine  ive been working at it for threequarters of an hour this morning and now i would not laugh not if you were to tell me the funniest thing youd ever heard for fear it would come down again  as for her clothes they make me tired  she dont possess a frock that does not fit her to perfection she doesnt have to think about them  you would imagine she went into the garden and picked them off a tree  she just slips it on and comes down and thenmy stars  all the other women in the room may just as well go to bed and get a good nights rest for all the chance theyve got  it isnt that shes beautiful  from what they tell you about her you might fancy her a freak  looks dont appear to matter to her she gets there anyhow  i tell you she just makes me boil  allowing for the difference between the masculine and feminine outlook this is precisely how i used to feel when reading of the hero  he was not always good sometimes he hit the villain harder than he had intended and then he was sorrywhen it was too late blamed himself severely and subscribed towards the wreath  like the rest of us he made mistakes occasionally married the wrong girl  but how well he did everythingdoes still for the matter of that i believe  take it that he condescends to play cricket  he never scores less than a hundreddoes not know how to score less than a hundred wonders how it could be done supposing for example you had an appointment and wanted to catch an early train  i used to play cricket myself but i could always stop at ten or twenty  there have been times when i have stopped at even less  it is the same with everything he puts his hand to  either he does not care for boating at all or as a matter of course he pulls stroke in the university boatrace and then takes the train on to henley and wins the diamond sculls so easily that it hardly seems worth while for the other fellow to have started  were i living in novelland and had i entered for the diamond sculls i should put it to my opponent before the word was given to us to go  one minute i should have called out to him  are you the hero of this novel or like myself only one of the minor characters  because if you are the hero you go on dont you wait for me  i shall just pull as far as the boathouse and get myself a cup of tea    because it always seems to be his day   there is no sense of happy medium about the hero of the popular novel  he cannot get astride a horse without its going off and winning a steeplechase against the favourite  the crowd in novelland appears to have no power of observation  it worries itself about the odds discusses records reads the nonsense published by the sporting papers were i to find myself on a racecourse in novelland i should not trouble about the unessential i should go up to the bookie who looked as if he had the most money and should say to him  dont shout so loud you are making yourself hoarse  just listen to me whos the hero of this novel  oh thats he is it  the heavylooking man on the little brown horse that keeps coughing and is suffering apparently from bone spavin  well what are the odds against his winning by ten lengths  a thousand to one  very well  have you got a baggood  heres twentyseven pounds in gold and eighteen shillings in silver  coat and waistcoat say another ten shillings  shirt and trousersits all right ive got my pyjamas on underneathsay seven and six  bootswe wont quarrelmake it five bob  thats twentynine pounds and sixpence isnt it  in addition heres a mortgage on the family estate which ive had made out in blank an i o u for fourteen pounds which has been owing to me now for some time and this bundle of securities which strictly speaking belong to my aunt jane  you keep that little lot till after the race and we will call it in round figures five hundred pounds  that single afternoon would thus bring me in five hundred thousand poundsprovided the bookie did not blow his brains out  backers in novelland do not seem to me to know their way about  if the hero of the popular novel swims at all it is not like an ordinary human being that he does it  you never meet him in a swimmingbath he never pays ninepence like the rest of us for a machine  he goes out at uncanny hours generally accompanied by a lady friend with whom the while swimming he talks poetry and cracks jokes  some of us when we try to talk in the sea fill ourselves up with salt water  this chap lies on his back and carols and the wild waves seeing him go round the other way  at billiards he can give the average sharper forty in a hundred  he does not really want to play he does it to teach these bad men a lesson he has not handled a cue for years  he picked up the game when a young man in australia and it seems to have lingered with him  he does not have to get up early and worry dumbbells in his nightshirt he just lies on a sofa in an elegant attitude and muscle comes to him  if his horse declines to jump a hedge he slips down off the animals back and throws the poor thing over it saves argument  if he gets cross and puts his shoulder to the massive oaken door we know there is going to be work next morning for the carpenter  maybe he is a party belonging to the middle ages  then when he reluctantly challenges the crack fencer of europe to a duel our instinct is to call out and warn his opponent  you silly fool one feels one wants to say why it is the hero of the novel  you take a friends advice while you are still alive and get out of it anywayanyhow  apologizehire a horse and cart do something youre not going to fight a duel youre going to commit suicide  if the hero is a modern young man and has not got a father or has only something not worth calling a father then he comes across a libraryanybodys library does for him  he passes sir walter scott and the arabian nights and makes a beeline for plato it seems to be an instinct with him  by help of a dictionary he worries it out in the original greek  this gives him a passion for greek  when he has romped through the greek classics he plays about among the latins  he spends most of his spare time in that library and forgets to go to tea    because he always gets there without any trouble   that is the sort of boy he is  how i used to hate him  if he has a proper sort of father then he goes to college  he does no work there is no need for him to work everything seems to come to him  that was another grievance of mine against him  i always had to work a good deal and very little came of it  he fools around doing things that other men would be sent down for but in his case the professors love him for it all the more  he is the sort of man who cant do wrong  a fortnight before the examination he ties a wet towel round his head  that is all we hear about it  it seems to be the towel that does it  maybe if the towel is not quite up to its work he will help things on by drinking gallons of strong tea  the tea and the towel combined are irresistible the result is always the senior wranglership  i used to believe in that wet towel and that strong tea  lord the things i used to believe when i was young  they would make an encyclopaedia of useless knowledge  i wonder if the author of the popular novel has ever tried working with a wet towel round his or her head i have  it is difficult enough to move a yard balancing a dry towel  a heathen turk may have it in his blood to do so the ordinary christian has not got the trick of it  to carry about a wet towel twisted round ones head needs a trained acrobat  every few minutes the wretched thing works loose  in darkness and in misery you struggle to get your head out of a clammy towel that clings to you almost with passion  brain power is wasted in inventing names for that towelnames expressive of your feelings with regard to it  further time is taken up before the glass fixing the thing afresh  you return to your books in the wrong temper the water trickles down your nose runs in rivulets down your back  until you have finally flung the towel out of the window and rubbed yourself dry work is impossible the strong tea always gave me indigestion and made me sleepy  until i had got over the effects of the tea attempts at study were useless    because hes so damned clever   but the thing that still irritates me most against the hero of the popular novel is the ease with which he learns a modern foreign language were he a german waiter a swiss barber or a polish photographer i would not envy him these people do not have to learn a language  my idea is that they boil down a dictionary and take two tablespoonsful each night before going to bed  by the time the bottle is finished they have the language well into their system  but he is not  he is just an ordinary anglosaxon and i dont believe in him  i walk about for years with dictionaries in my pocket  weirdlooking ladies and gentlemen gesticulate and rave at me for months  i hide myself in lonely places repeating idioms to myself out loud in the hope that by this means they will come readily to me if ever i want them which i never do  and after all this i dont seem to know very much  this irritating ass who has never left his native suburb suddenly makes up his mind to travel on the continent  i find him in the next chapter engaged in complicated psychological argument with french or german savants  it appearsthe author had forgotten to mention it beforethat one summer a french or german or italian refugee as the case may happen to be came to live in the heros street thus it is that the hero is able to talk fluently in the native language of that unhappy refugee  i remember a melodrama visiting a country town where i was staying  the heroine and child were sleeping peacefully in the customary attic  for some reason not quite clear to me the villain had set fire to the house he had been complaining through the three preceding acts of the heroines coldness maybe it was with some idea of warming her  escape by way of the staircase was impossible  each time the poor girl opened the door a flame came in and nearly burned her hair off  it seemed to have been waiting for her  thank god said the lady hastily wrapping the child in a sheet that i was brought up a wire walker  without a moments hesitation she opened the attic window and took the nearest telegraph wire to the opposite side of the street  in the same way apparently the hero of the popular novel finding himself stranded in a foreign land suddenly recollects that once upon a time he met a refugee and at once begins to talk  i have met refugees myself  the only thing they have ever taught me is not to leave my brandy flask about    and finally because i dont believe hes true   i dont believe in these heroes and heroines that cannot keep quiet in a foreign language they have taught themselves in an oldworld library  my fixed idea is that they muddle along like the rest of us surprised that so few people understand them begging everyone they meet not to talk so quickly  these brilliant conversations with foreign philosophers  these passionate interviews with foreign countesses  they fancy they have had them  i crossed once with an english lady from boulogne to folkestone  at folkestone a little french girlanxious about her trainasked us a simple question  my companion replied to it with an ease that astonished herself  the little french girl vanished my companion sighed  its so odd said my companion but i seem to know quite a lot of french the moment i get back to england     chapter xiii   how to be healthy and unhappy   they do say remarked mrs wilkins as she took the cover off the dish and gave a finishing polish to my plate with the cleanest corner of her apron that addicks leastways in may aint strictly speaking the safest of food  but then if you listen to all they say it seems to me wed have to give up victuals altogether  the haddock mrs wilkins i replied is a savoury and nourishing dish the poor mans steak i believe it is commonly called  when i was younger mrs wilkins they were cheaper  for twopence one could secure a small specimen for fourpence one of generous proportions  in the halcyon days of youth when ones lexicon contained not the word failure it has crept into later editions mrs wilkins the word it was found was occasionally needful the haddock was of much comfort and support to me a very present help in time of trouble  in those days a kind friend without intending it nearly brought about my death by slow starvation  i had left my umbrella in an omnibus and the season was rainy  the kind rich friend gave me a new umbrella it was a rich mans umbrella we made an illassorted pair  its handle was of ivory imposing in appearance ornamented with a golden snake    the unsympathetic umbrella   following my own judgment i should have pawned that umbrella purchased one more suited to my state in life and blued the difference  but i was fearful of offending my one respectable acquaintance and for weeks struggled on hampered by this plutocratic appendage  the humble haddock was denied to me  tied to this imposing umbrella how could i haggle with fishmongers for haddocks  at first sight of meor rather of my umbrellathey flew to icy cellars brought up for my inspection soles at eighteenpence a pound recommended me prime parts of salmon which my landlady would have fried in a pan reeking with the mixed remains of pork chops rashers of bacon and cheese  it was closed to me the humble coffee shop where for threepence i could have strengthened my soul with half a pint of cocoa and four doorstepssatisfactory slices of bread smeared with a yellow grease that before the days of county council inspectors they called butter  you know of them mrs wilkins  at sight of such nowadays i should turn up my jaded nose  but those were the days of my youth mrs wilkins  the scent of a thousand hopes was in my nostrils so they smelt good to me  the fourpenny beefsteak pie satisfying to the verge of repletion the succulent saveloy were not for the owner of the ivoryhandled umbrella  on mondays and tuesdays perhaps i could enjoy life at the rate of five hundred a yearclean serviette a penny extra and twopence to the waiter whose income must have been at least four times my own  but from wednesday to saturday i had to wander in the wilderness of back streets and silent squares dinnerless where there were not even to be found locusts and wild honey  it was as i have said a rainy season and an umbrella of some sort was a necessity  fortunatelyor i might not be sitting here mrs wilkins talking to you nowmy one respectable acquaintance was called away to foreign lands and that umbrella i promptly put up the spout  you understand me  mrs wilkins admitted she did but was of opinion that twentyfive per cent to say nothing of the halfpenny for the ticket every time was a wicked imposition  it did not trouble me mrs wilkins i replied in this particular instance  it was my determination never to see that umbrella again  the young man behind the counter seemed suspicious and asked where i got it from  i told him that a friend had given it to me  did he know that he had given it to you demanded the young man  upon which i gave him a piece of my mind concerning the character of those who think evil of others and he gave me five and six and said he should know me again and i purchased an umbrella suited to my rank and station and as fine a haddock as i have ever tasted with the balance which was sevenpence for i was feeling hungry  the haddock is an excellent fish mrs wilkins i said and if as you observe we listened to all that was said wed be hungrier at forty with a balance to our credit at the bank than ever we were at twenty with no effects beyond a sound digestion    a martyr to health   there was a gent in middle temple lane said mrs wilkins as i used to do for  its my belief as e killed imself worrying twentyfour hours a day over what e called is ygiene  leastways es dead and buried now which must be a comfort to imself feeling as at last es out of danger  all is time e spent taking care of imselfdidnt seem to ave a leisure moment in which to live  for alf an hour every morning ed lie on is back on the floor which is a draughty place i always old at the best of times with nothing on but is pyjamas waving is arms and legs about and twisting imself into shapes unnatural to a christian  then e found out that everything ed been doing on is back was just all wrong so e turned over and did tricks on is stomachbegging your pardon for using the wordthat youd ave thought more fit and proper to a worm than to a man  then all that was discovered to be a mistake  there dont seem nothing certain in these matters  thats the awkward part of it so it seems to me  e got imself a machine by means of which ed ang imself up to the wall and behave for all the world like a beetle with a pin stuck through im poor thing  it used to give me the shudders to catch sight of im through the alfopen door  for that was part of the game you ad to ave a current of air through the room the result of which was that for six months out of the year ed be coughing and blowing is nose from morning to night  it was the new treatment so ed explain to me  you got yourself accustomed to draughts so that they didnt urt you and if you died in the process that only proved that you never ought to ave been born  then there came in this new japanese business and ed ire a little smiling eathen to chuck im about is room for alf an hour every morning after breakfast  it got on my nerves after a while earing im being bumped on the floor every minute or flung with is ead into the fireplace  but e always said it was doing im good  ed argue that it freshened up is liver  it was is liver that e seemed to live fordidnt appear to ave any other interest in life  it was the same with is food  one year it would be nothing but meat and next door to raw at that  one of them medical papers ad suddenly discovered that we were intended to be a sort of wild beast  the wonder to me is that e didnt go out unting chickens with a club and bring em ome and eat em on the mat without any further fuss  for drink it would be boiling water that burnt my fingers merely andling the glass  then some other crank came out with the information that every other crank was wrongwhich taken by itself sounds natural enoughthat meat was fatal to the uman system  upon that e becomes all at once a raging tearing vegetarian and trouble enough i ad learning twenty different ways of cooking beans which didnt make so far as i could ever see the slightest differencebeans they were and beans they tasted like whether you called them ragout a la maison or cutlets a la pompadour  but it seemed to please im    he was never pigheaded   then vegetarianism turned out to be the mistake of our lives  it seemed we made an error giving up monkeys food  that was our natural victuals nuts with occasional bananas  as i used to tell im if that was so then for all we ad got out of it we might just as well have stopped up a treesaved rent and shoe leather  but e was one of that sort that dont seem able to elp believing everything they read in print  if one of those papers ad told im to live on the shells and throw away the nuts ed have made a conscientious endeavour to do so contending that is failure to digest them was merely the result of vicious trainingdidnt seem to ave any likes or dislikes of is own  you might ave thought e was just a bit of public property made to be experimented upon  one of the daily papers interviewed an old gent as said e was a undred and i will say from is picture as anyow e looked it  e said it was all the result of never aving swallowed anything ot upon which my gentleman for a week lives on cold porridge if youll believe me although myself id rather ave died at fifty and got it over  then another paper dug up from somewhere a sort of animated corpse that said was a undred and two and attributed the unfortunate fact to is always aving ad is food as ot as e could swallow it  a bit of sense did begin to dawn upon im then but too late in the day i take it  ed played about with imself too long  e died at thirtytwo looking to all appearance sixty and you cant say as ow it was the result of not taking advice    only just in time   on this subject of health we are much too ready to follow advice i agreed  a cousin of mine mrs wilkins had a wife who suffered occasionally from headache  no medicine relieved her of themnot altogether  and one day by chance she met a friend who said come straight with me to dr blank who happened to be a specialist famous for having invented a new disease that nobody until the year before had ever heard of  she accompanied her friend to dr blank and in less than ten minutes he had persuaded her that she had got this new disease and got it badly and that her only chance was to let him cut her open and have it out  she was a tolerably healthy woman with the exception of these occasional headaches but from what that specialist said it was doubtful whether she would get home alive unless she let him operate on her then and there and her friend who appeared delighted urged her not to commit suicide as it were by missing her turn  the result was she consented and afterwards went home in a fourwheeled cab and put herself to bed  her husband when he returned in the evening and was told was furious  he said it was all humbug and by this time she was ready to agree with him  he put on his hat and started to give that specialist a bit of his mind  the specialist was out and he had to bottle up his rage until the morning  by then his wife now really ill for the first time in her life his indignation had reached boiling point  he was at that specialists door at halfpast nine oclock  at halfpast eleven he came back also in a fourwheeled cab and day and night nurses for both of them were wired for  he also it appeared had arrived at that specialists door only just in time  theres this appendywhatever they call it commented mrs wilkins why a dozen years ago one poor creature out of ten thousand may possibly ave ad something wrong with is innards  today you aint ardly considered respectable unless youve got it or ave ad it  i ave no patience with their talk  to listen to some of them youd think as nature adnt made a mannot yet would never understand the principle of the thing till some of these young chaps ad shown er ow to do it    how to avoid everything   they have now discovered mrs wilkins i said the germ of old age they are going to inoculate us for it in early youth with the result that the only chance of ever getting rid of our friends will be to give them a motorcar  and maybe it will not do to trust to that for long they will discover that some mens tendency towards getting themselves into trouble is due to some sort of a germ  the man of the future mrs wilkins will be inoculated against all chance of gas explosions storms at sea bad oysters and thin ice  science may eventually discover the germ prompting to illassorted marriages proneness to invest in the wrong stock uncontrollable desire to recite poetry at evening parties religion politics educationall these things are so much wasted energy  to live happy and good for ever and ever all we have to do is to hunt out these various germs and wring their necks for themor whatever the proper treatment may be  heaven i gather from medical science is merely a place that is free from germs  we talk a lot about it thought mrs wilkins but it does not seem to me that we are very much better off than before we took to worrying ourselves for twentyfour ours a day about ow we are going to live lord to read the advertisements in the papers you would think as ow flesh and blood was never intended to ave any natural ills  do you ever ave a pain in your back because if so theres a picture of a kind gent whos willing for one and sixpence halfpenny to take it quite away from youmake you look forward to scrubbing floors and standing over the washtub six ours at a stretch like to a beanfeast  do you ever feel as though you dont want to get out of bed in the morning thats all to be cured by a bottle of their stuffor two at the outside four children to keep and a sick usband on your ands used to get me over it when i was younger  i used to fancy it was just because i was tired    the one cureall   theres some of them seem to think continued mrs wilkins that if you dont get all you want out of this world and aint so appy as youve persuaded yourself you ought to be that its all because you aint taking the right medicine  appears to me theres only one doctor as can do for you all the others talk as though they could and e only comes to each of us once and then e makes no charge     chapter xiv   europe and the bright american girl   how does she do it  that is what the european girl wants to know  the american girl  she comes over here and as a british matron reduced to slang by force of indignation once exclaimed to me youd think the whole blessed show belonged to her  the european girl is hampered by her relatives  she has to account for her father to explain away if possible her grandfather  the american girl sweeps them aside  dont you worry about them she says to the lord chamberlain  its awfully good of you but dont you fuss yourself  im looking after my old people  thats my department  what i want you to do is just to listen to what i am saying and then hustle around  i can fill up your time all right by myself  her father may be a soapboiler her grandmother may have gone out charing  thats all right she says to her ambassador theyre not coming  you just take my card and tell the king that when hes got a few minutes to spare ill be pleased to see him  and the extraordinary thing is that a day or two afterwards the invitation arrives  a modern writer has said that im murrican is the civis romanus sum of the presentday womans world  the late king of saxony did i believe on one occasion make a feeble protest at being asked to receive the daughter of a retail bootmaker  the young lady nonplussed for the moment telegraphed to her father in detroit  the answer came back next morning cant call it sellingpractically giving them away  see advertisement  the lady was presented as the daughter of an eminent philanthropist  it is due to her to admit that taking her as a class the american girl is a distinct gain to european society  her influence is against convention and in favour of simplicity  one of her greatest charms in the eyes of the european man is that she listens to him  i cannot say whether it does her any good  maybe she does not remember it all but while you are talking she does give you her attention  the english woman does not always  she greets you pleasantly enough  ive so often wanted to meet you she says must you really go  it strikes you as sudden you had no intention of going for hours  but the hint is too plain to be ignored  you are preparing to agree that you really must when looking round you gather that the last remark was not addressed to you but to another gentleman who is shaking hands with her  now perhaps we shall be able to talk for five minutes she says  ive so often wanted to say that i shall never forgive you  you have been simply horrid  again you are confused until you jump to the conclusion that the latter portion of the speech is probably intended for quite another party with whom at the moment her back towards you she is engaged in a whispered conversation  when he is gone she turns again to you  but the varied expressions that pass across her face while you are discussing with her the disadvantages of protection bewilder you  when explaining your own difficulty in arriving at a conclusion you remark that great britain is an island she roguishly shakes her head  it is not that she has forgotten her geography it is that she is conducting a conversation by signs with a lady at the other end of the room  when you observe that the working classes must be fed she smiles archly while murmuring  oh do you really think so  you are about to say something strong on the subject of dumping apparently she has disappeared  you find that she is reaching round behind you to tap a new arrival with her fan    she has the art of listening   now the american girl looks at you and just listens to you with her eyes fixed on you all the time  you gather that as far as she is concerned the rest of the company are passing shadows  she wants to hear what you have to say about bimetallism her trouble is lest she may miss a word of it  from a talk with an american girl one comes away with the conviction that one is a brilliant conversationalist who can hold a charming woman spellbound  this may not be good for one but while it lasts the sensation is pleasant  even the american girl cannot on all occasions sweep from her path the cobwebs of oldworld etiquette  two american ladies told me a sad tale of things that had happened to them not long ago in dresden  an officer of rank and standing invited them to breakfast with him on the ice  dames and nobles of the plus haut ton would be there  it is a social function that occurs every sunday morning in dresden during the skating season  the great lake in the grosser garten is covered with all sorts and conditions of people  prince and commoner circle and recircle round one another  but they do not mix  the girls were pleased  they secured the services of an elderly lady the widow of an analytical chemist unfortunately she could not skate  they wrapped her up and put her in a sledge  while they were in the garde robe putting on their skates a german gentleman came up and bowed to them  he was a nice young man of prepossessing appearance and amiable manners they could not call to mind his name but remembered having met him somewhere and on more than one occasion  the american girl is always sociable they bowed and smiled and said it was a fine day  he replied with volubility and helped them down on to the ice  he was really most attentive  they saw their friend the officer of noble family and with the assistance of the german gentleman skated towards him  he glided past them  they thought that maybe he did not know enough to stop so they turned and skated after him  they chased him three times round the pond and then feeling tired eased up and took counsel together  im sure he must have seen us said the younger girl  what does he mean by it  well i have not come down here to play forfeits said the other added to which i want my breakfast  you wait here a minute ill go and have it out with him  he was standing only a dozen yards away  alone though not a good performer on the ice she contrived to cover half the distance dividing them  the officer perceiving her came to her assistance and greeted her with effusion    the republican idea in practice   oh said the lady who was feeling indignant i thought maybe you had left your glasses at home  i am sorry said the officer but it is impossible  whats impossible demanded the lady  that i can be seen speaking to you declared the officer while you are in company with thatthat person  what person  she thought maybe he was alluding to the lady in the sledge  the chaperon was not showy but what is better she was good and anyhow it was the best the girls had been able to do  so far as they were concerned they had no use for a chaperon  the idea had been a thoughtful concession to european prejudice  the person in knickerbockers explained the officer  oh that exclaimed the lady relieved he just came up and made himself agreeable while we were putting on our skates  we have met him somewhere but i cant exactly fix him for the moment  you have met him possibly at wiesmans in the pragerstrasse he is one of the attendants there said the officer  the american girl is republican in her ideas but she draws the line at hairdressers  in theory it is absurd the hairdresser is a man and a brother but we are none of us logical all the way  it made her mad the thought that she had been seen by all dresden society skating with a hairdresser  well she said i do call that impudence  why they wouldnt do that even in chicago  and she returned to where the hairdresser was illustrating to her friend the dutch roll determined to explain to him as politely as possible that although the free and enlightened westerner has abolished social distinctions he has not yet abolished them to that extent  had he been a commonplace german hairdresser he would have understood english and all might have been easy  but to the classy german hairdresser english is not so necessary and the american ladies had reached as regards their german only the improving stage  in her excitement she confused the subjunctive and the imperative and told him that he might go  he had no wish to go he assured themso they gatheredthat his intention was to devote the morning to their service he must have been a stupid man but it is a type occasionally encountered  two pretty women had greeted his advances with apparent delight  they were americans and the american girl was notoriously unconventional  he knew himself to be a goodlooking young fellow  it did not occur to him that in expressing willingness to dispense with his attendance they could be in earnest  there was nothing for it so it seemed to the girls but to request the assistance of the officer who continued to skate round and round them at a distance of about ten yards  so again the elder young lady seizing her opportunity made appeal    what the soldier dared not do   i cannot persisted the officer who having been looking forward to a morning with two of the prettiest girls in dresden was also feeling mad i dare not be seen speaking to a hairdresser  you must get rid of him  but we cant said the girl  we do not know enough german and he cant or he wont understand us  for goodness sake come and help us well be spending the whole morning with him if you dont  the german officer said he was desolate  steps would be takenlater in the weekthe result of which would probably be to render that young hairdresser prematurely bald  but meanwhile beyond skating round and round them for which they did not even feel they wanted to thank him the german officer could do nothing for them  they tried being rude to the hairdresser he mistook it for american chic  they tried joining hands and running away from him but they were not good skaters and he thought they were trying to show him the cake walk  they both fell down and hurt themselves and it is difficult to be angry with a man even a hairdresser when he is doing his best to pick you up and comfort you  the chaperon was worse than useless  she was very old  she had been promised her breakfast but saw no signs of it  she could not speak german and remembered somewhat late in the day that two young ladies had no business to accept breakfast at the hands of german officers and if they did at least they might see that they got it  she appeared to be willing to talk about decadence of modern manners to almost any extent but the subject of the hairdresser and how to get rid of him only bored her  their first stroke of luck occurred when the hairdresser showing them the dropped three fell down and temporarily stunned himself  it was not kind of them but they were desperate  they flew for the bank just anyhow and scrambling over the grass gained the restaurant  the officer overtaking them at the door led them to the table that had been reserved for them then hastened back to hunt for the chaperon  the girls thought their trouble was over  had they glanced behind them their joy would have been shorterlived than even was the case  the hairdresser had recovered consciousness in time to see them waddling over the grass  he thought they were running to fetch him brandy  when the officer returned with the chaperon he found the hairdresser sitting opposite to them explaining that he really was not hurt and suggesting that as they were there perhaps they would like something to eat and drink  the girls made one last frantic appeal to the man of buckram and pipeclay but the etiquette of the saxon army was inexorable  it transpired that he might kill the hairdresser but nothing else he must not speak to himnot even explain to the poor devil why it was that he was being killed    her path of usefulness   it did not seem quite worth it  they had some sandwiches and coffee at the hairdressers expense and went home in a cab while the chaperon had breakfast with the officer of noble family  the american girl has succeeded in freeing european social intercourse from many of its hidebound conventions  there is still much work for her to do  but i have faith in her     chapter xv   music and the savage   i never visit a musichall without reflecting concerning the great future there must be before the human race  how young we are how very young  and think of all we have done  man is still a mere boy  he has only just within the last halfcentury been put into trousers  two thousand years ago he wore long clothesthe grecian robe the roman toga  then followed the little lord fauntleroy period when he went about dressed in a velvet suit with lace collar and cuffs and had his hair curled for him  the late lamented queen victoria put him into trousers  what a wonderful little man he will be when he is grown up  a clergyman friend of mine told me of a german kurhaus to which he was sent for his sins and his health  it was a resort for some reason specially patronized by the more elderly section of the higher english middle class  bishops were there suffering from fatty degeneration of the heart caused by too close application to study ancient spinsters of good family subject to spasms gouty retired generals  can anybody tell me how many men in the british army go to a general  somebody once assured me it was five thousand but that is absurd on the face of it the british army in that case would have to be counted by millions there are a goodish few american colonels still knocking about  the american colonel is still to be met with here and there by the curious traveller but compared with the retired british general he is an extinct species  in cheltenham and brighton and other favoured towns there are streets of nothing but retired british generalssquares of retired british generalswhole crescents of british generals  abroad there are pensions with a special scale of charges for british generals  in switzerland there has even been talk of reserving railway compartments for british generals only  in germany when you do not say distinctly and emphatically on being introduced that you are not a british general you are assumed as a matter of course to be a british general  during the boer war when i was residing in a small garrison town on the rhine german military men would draw me aside and ask of me my own private personal views as to the conduct of the campaign  i would give them my views freely explain to them how i would finish the whole thing in a week  but how in the face of the enemys tactics one of them would begin  bother the enemys tactics i would reply  who cares for tactics  but surely a british general they would persist  whos a british general i would retort i am talking to you merely as a plain commonsense man with a head on my shoulders  they would apologize for their mistake  but this is leading me away from that german kurhaus    recreation for the higher clergy   my clergyman friend found life there dull  the generals and the spinsters left to themselves might have played cards but they thought of the poor bishops who would have had to look on envious  the bishops and the spinsters might have sung ballads but the british general after dinner does not care for ballads and had mentioned it  the bishops and the generals might have told each other stories but could not before the ladies  my clergyman friend stood the awful solemnity of three evenings then cautiously felt his way towards revelry  he started with an intellectual game called quotations  you write down quotations on a piece of paper and the players have to add the authors name  it roped in four old ladies and the youngest bishop  one or two generals tried a round but not being familiar with quotations voted the game slow  the next night my friend tried consequences  saucy miss a met the gay general b inmost unlikely places  he said  really it was fortunate that general b remained too engrossed in the day before yesterdays standard to overhear or miss a could never have again faced him  and she replied  the suppressed giggles excited the curiosity of the nonplayers  most of the bishops and half the generals asked to be allowed to join  the giggles grew into roars  those standing out found that they could not read their papers in comfort  from consequences the descent was easy  the tables and chairs were pushed against the walls the bishops and the spinsters and the generals would sit in a ring upon the floor playing hunt the slipper  musical chairs made the two hours between bed and dinner the time of the day they all looked forward to the steady trot with every nerve alert the ear listening for the sudden stoppage of the music the eye seeking with artfulness the likeliest chair the volcanic silence the mad scramble  the generals felt themselves fighting their battles over again the spinsters blushed and preened themselves the bishops took interest in proving that even the church could be prompt of decision and swift of movement  before the week was out they were playing pussinthecorner ladies feeling young again were archly beckoning to stout deans to whom were returning all the sensations of a curate  the swiftness with which the gouty generals found they could still hobble surprised even themselves    why are we so young   but it is in the musichall as i have said that i am most impressed with the youthfulness of man  how delighted we are when the long man in the little boys hat having asked his short brother a riddle and before he can find time to answer it hits him over the stomach with an umbrella  how we clap our hands and shout with glee  it isnt really his stomach it is a bolster tied round his waistwe know that but seeing the long man whack at that bolster with an umbrella gives us almost as much joy as if the bolster were not there  i laugh at the knockabout brothers i confess so long as they are on the stage but they do not convince me  reflecting on the performance afterwards my dramatic sense revolts against the plot  i cannot accept the theory of their being brothers  the difference in size alone is a strain upon my imagination  it is not probable that of two children of the same parents one should measure six foot six and the other five foot four  even allowing for a freak of nature and accepting the fact that they might be brothers i do not believe they would remain so inseparable  the short brother would have succeeded before now in losing the long brother  those continual bangings over the head and stomach would have weakened whatever affection the short brother might originally have felt towards his long relation  at least he would insist upon the umbrella being left at home  i will go for a walk with you he might say i will stand stock still with you in trafalgar square in the midst of the traffic while you ask me silly riddles but not if you persist in bringing with you that absurd umbrella  you are too handy with it  put it back in the rack before we start or go out by yourself  besides my sense of justice is outraged  why should the short brother be banged and thumped without reason  the greek dramatist would have explained to us that the shorter brother had committed a crime against the gods  aristophanes would have made the longer brother the instrument of the furies  the riddles he asked would have had bearing upon the shorter brothers sin  in this way the spectator would have enjoyed amusement combined with the satisfactory sense that nemesis is ever present in human affairs  i present the idea for what it may be worth to the concoctors of knockabout turns    where brotherly and sisterly love reigns supreme   the family tie is always strong on the musichall stage  the acrobatic troupe is always a family pa ma eight brothers and sisters and the baby  a more affectionate family one rarely sees  pa and ma are a trifle stout but still active  baby dear little fellow is full of humour  ladies do not care to go on the musichall stage unless they can take their sister with them  i have seen a performance given by eleven sisters all the same size and apparently all the same age  she must have been a wonderful womanthe mother  they all had golden hair and all wore precisely similar frocksa charming but decolletee arrangementin claretcoloured velvet over blue silk stockings  so far as i could gather they all had the same young man  no doubt he found it difficult amongst them to make up his mind  arrange it among yourselves he no doubt had said it is quite immaterial to me  you are so much alike it is impossible that a fellow loving one should not love the lot of you  so long as i marry into the family i really dont care  when a performer appears alone on the musichall stage it is easy to understand why  his or her domestic life has been a failure  i listened one evening to six songs in succession  the first two were sung by a gentleman  he entered with his clothes hanging upon him in shreds  he explained that he had just come from an argument with his wife  he showed us the brick with which she had hit him and the bump at the back of his head that had resulted  the funny mans marriage is never a success  but really this seems to be his own fault  she was such a lovely girl he tells us with a facewell youd hardly call it a face it was more like a gas explosion  then she had those wonderful sort of eyes that you can see two ways at once with one of them looks down the street while the other one is watching round the corner  can see you coming any way  and her mouth  it appears that if she stands anywhere near the curb and smiles careless people mistake her for a pillarbox and drop letters into her  and such a voice  we are told it is a perfect imitation of a motor car  when she laughs people spring into doorways to escape being run over  if he will marry that sort of woman what can he expect  the man is asking for it  the lady who followed him also told us a sad story of misplaced trust she also was comicso the programme assured us  the humorist appears to have no luck  she had lent her lover money to buy the ring and the licence and to furnish the flat  he did buy the ring and he furnished the flat but it was for another lady  the audience roared  i have heard it so often asked what is humour  from observation i should describe it as other peoples troubles  a male performer followed her  he came on dressed in a nightshirt carrying a baby  his wife it seemed had gone out for the evening with the lodger  that was his joke  it was the most successful song of the whole six    the one sure joke   a philosopher has put it on record that he always felt sad when he reflected on the sorrows of humanity  but when he reflected on its amusements he felt sadder still  why was it so funny that the baby had the lodgers nose  we laughed for a full minute by the clock  why do i love to see a flabbyfaced man go behind curtains and emerging in a wig and a false beard say that he is now bismarck or mr chamberlain  i have felt resentment against the lightning impersonator ever since the days of queen victorias diamond jubilee  during that summer every lightning impersonator ended his show by shouting while the band played the national anthem queen victoria  he was not a bit like queen victoria  he did not even to my thinking look a lady but at once i had to stand up in my place and sing god save the queen  it was a time of enthusiastic loyalty if you did not spring up quickly some patriotic old fool from the back would reach across and hit you over the head with the first thing he could lay his hands upon  other musichall performers caught at the idea  by ending up with god save the queen any performer however poor could retire in a whirlwind of applause  niggers having bored us with tiresome songs about coons and honeys and swanee rivers would as a last resource strike up god save the queen on the banjo  the whole house would have to rise and cheer  elderly sisters trippet having failed to arouse our enthusiasm by allowing us a brief glimpse of an ankle would put aside all frivolity and tell us of a hero lover named george who had fought somebody somewhere for his queen and country  he fellbang from the big drum and blue limelight  in a recumbent position he appears to have immediately started singing god save the queen    how anarchists are made   sleepy members of the audience would be hastily awakened by their friends  we would stagger to our feet  the sisters trippet with eyes fixed on the chandelier would lead us to the best of our ability we would sing god save the queen  there have been evenings when i have sung god save the queen six times another season of it and i should have become a republican  the singer of patriotic songs is generally a stout and puffy man  the perspiration pours from his face as the result of the violent gesticulations with which he tells us how he stormed the fort  he must have reached it very hot  there were ten to one agin us boys  we feel that this was a miscalculation on the enemys part  ten to one agin such wildly gesticulating britishers was inviting defeat  it seems to have been a terrible battle notwithstanding  he shows us with a real sword how it was done  nothing could have lived within a dozen yards of that sword  the conductor of the orchestra looks nervous our fear is lest he will end by cutting off his own head  his recollections are carrying him away  then follows victory  the gas men and the programme sellers cheer wildly  we conclude with the inevitable god save the king     chapter xvi   the ghost and the blind children   ghosts are in the air  it is difficult at this moment to avoid talking of ghosts  the first question you are asked on being introduced this season is  do you believe in ghosts  i would be so glad to believe in ghosts  this world is much too small for me  up to a century or two ago the intellectual young man found it sufficient for his purposes  it still contained the unknownthe possiblewithin its boundaries  new continents were still to be discovered we dreamt of giants liliputians desertfenced utopias  we set our sail and wonderland lay ever just beyond our horizon  today the world is small the light railway runs through the desert the coasting steamer calls at the islands of the blessed the last mystery has been unveiled the fairies are dead the talking birds are silent our baffled curiosity turns for relief outwards  we call upon the dead to rescue us from our monotony  the first authentic ghost will be welcomed as the saviour of humanity  but he must be a living ghosta ghost we can respect a ghost we can listen to  the poor spiritless addleheaded ghost that has hitherto haunted our blue chambers is of no use to us  i remember a thoughtful man once remarking during argument that if he believed in ghoststhe silly childish spooks about which we had been telling anecdotesdeath would possess for him an added fear the idea that his next dwellingplace would be among such a pack of dismal idiots would sadden his departing hours  what was he to talk to them about  apparently their only interest lay in recalling their earthly troubles  the ghost of the lady unhappily married who had been poisoned or had her throat cut who every night for the last five hundred years had visited the chamber where it happened for no other purpose than to scream about it what a tiresome person she would be to meet  all her conversation during the long days would be around her earthly wrongs  the other ghosts in all probability would have heard about that husband of hers what he said and what he did till they were sick of the subject  a newcomer would be seized upon with avidity  a lady of repute writes to a magazine that she once occupied for a season a wainscotted room in an old manor house  on several occasions she awoke in the night each time to witness the same ghostly performance  four gentlemen sat round a table playing cards  suddenly one of them sprang to his feet and plunged a dagger into the back of his partner  the lady does not say so one presumes it was his partner  i have myself when playing bridge seen an expression on my partners face that said quite plainly  i would like to murder you  i have not the memory for bridge  i forget who it was that last trick but seven played the two of clubs  i thought it was he my partner  i thought it meant that i was to take an early opportunity of forcing trumps  i dont know why i thought so i try to explain why i thought so  it sounds a silly argument even to myself i feel i have not got it quite right  added to which it was not my partner who played the two of clubs it was dummy  if i had only remembered this and had concluded from itas i ought to have donethat my partner had the ace of diamondsas otherwise why did he pass my knavewe might have saved the odd trick  i have not the head for bridge  it is only an ordinary headmine  i have no business to play bridge    why not occasionally a cheerful ghost   but to return to our ghosts  these four gentlemen must now and again during their earthly existence have sat down to a merry game of cards there must have been evenings when nobody was stabbed  why choose an unpleasant occasion to harp exclusively upon it  why do ghosts never give a cheerful show  the lady who was poisoned there must have been other evenings in her life  why does she not show us the first meeting when he gave her the violets and said they were like her eyes he wasnt always poisoning her  there must have been a period before he ever thought of poisoning her  cannot these ghosts do something occasionally in what is termed the lighter vein  if they haunt a forest glade it is to perform a duel to the death or an assassination why cannot they for a change give us an oldtime picnic or the hawking party which in elizabethan costume should make a pretty picture  ghostland would appear to be obsessed by the spirit of the scandinavian drama murders suicides ruined fortunes and broken hearts are the only material made use of  why is not a dead humorist allowed now and then to write the sketch  there must be plenty of dead comic lovers why are they never allowed to give a performance    where are the dead humorists   a cheerful person contemplates death with alarm  what is he to do in this land of ghosts there is no place for him  imagine the commonplace liver of a humdrum existence being received into ghostland  he enters nervous shy feeling again the new boy at school  the old ghosts gather round him  how do you come heremurdered  no at least i dont think so  suicide  nocant remember the name of it now  began with a chill on the liver i think  the ghosts are disappointed  but a happy suggestion is made  perhaps he was the murderer that would be even better  let him think carefully can he recollect ever having committed a murder  he racks his brains in vain not a single murder comes to his recollection  he never forged a will  doesnt even know where anything is hid  of what use will he be in ghostland  one pictures him passing the centuries among a moody crowd of uninteresting mediocrities brooding perpetually over their wasted lives  only the ghosts of ladies and gentlemen mixed up in crime have any show in ghostland    the spirit does not shine as a conversationalist   i feel an equal dissatisfaction with the spirits who are supposed to return to us and communicate with us through the medium of threelegged tables  i do not deny the possibility that spirits exist  i am even willing to allow them their threelegged tables  it must be confessed it is a clumsy method  one cannot help regretting that during all the ages they have not evolved a more dignified system  one feels that the three legged table must hamper them  one can imagine an impatient spirit getting tired of spelling out a lengthy story on a threelegged table but as i have said i am willing to assume that for some spiritual reason unfathomable to my mere human intelligence that threelegged table is essential  i am willing also to accept the human medium  she is generally an unprepossessing lady running somewhat to bulk  if a gentleman he so often has dirty fingernails and smells of stale beer i think myself it would be so much simpler if the spirit would talk to me direct we could get on quicker  but there is that about the medium i am told which appeals to a spirit  well it is his affair not mine and i waive the argument  my real stumblingblock is the spirit himselfthe sort of conversation that when he does talk he indulges in  i cannot help feeling that his conversation is not worth the paraphernalia  i can talk better than that myself  the late professor huxley who took some trouble over this matter attended some halfdozen seances and then determined to attend no more  i have he said for my sins to submit occasionally to the society of live bores  i refuse to go out of my way to spend an evening in the dark with dead bores  the spiritualists themselves admit that their tablerapping spooks are precious dull dogs it would be difficult in face of the communications recorded for them to deny it  they explain to us that they have not yet achieved communication with the higher spiritual intelligences  the more intelligent spiritsfor some reason that the spiritualists themselves are unable to explaindo not want to talk to them appear to have something else to do  at presentso i am told and can believeit is only the spirits of lower intelligence that care to turn up on these evenings  the spiritualists argue that by continuing the higherclass spirits will later on be induced to come in  i fail to follow the argument  it seems to me that we are frightening them away  anyhow myself i shall wait awhile  when the spirit comes along that can talk sense that can tell me something i dont know i shall be glad to meet him  the class of spirit that we are getting just at present does not appeal to me  the thought of himthe reflection that i shall die and spend the rest of eternity in his companydoes not comfort me    she is now a believer   a lady of my acquaintance tells me it is marvellous how much these spirits seem to know  on her very first visit the spirit through the voice of the mediuman elderly gentleman residing obscurely in clerkenwellinformed her without a moments hesitation that she possessed a relative with the christian name of george  i am not making this upit is real  this gave her at first the idea that spiritualism was a fraud  she had no relative named georgeat least so she thought but a morning or two later her husband received a letter from australia by jove he exclaimed as he glanced at the last page i had forgotten all about the poor old beggar  whom is it from she asked  oh nobody you knowhavent seen him myself for twenty yearsa third or fourth cousin of minegeorge  she never heard the surname she was too excited  the spirit had been right from the beginning she had a relative named george  her faith in spiritualism is now as a rock  there are thousands of folk who believe in old moores almanac  my difficulty would be not to believe in the old gentleman  i see that for the month of january last he foretold us that the government would meet with determined and persistent opposition  he warned us that there would be much sickness about and that rheumatism would discover its old victims  how does he know these things  is it that the stars really do communicate with him or does he feel it in his bones as the saying is up north  during february he mentioned the weather would be unsettled  he concluded  the word taxation will have a terrible significance for both government and people this month  really it is quite uncanny  in march  theatres will do badly during the month  there seems to be no keeping anything from old moore  in april much dissatisfaction will be expressed among post office employees  that sounds probable on the face of it  in any event i will answer for our local postman  in may a wealthy magnate is going to die  in june there is going to be a fire  in july old moore has reason to fear there will be trouble  i do hope he may be wrong and yet somehow i feel a conviction that he wont be  anyhow one is glad it has been put off till july  in august one in high authority will be in danger of demise  in september zeal on the part of persons mentioned will outstrip discretion  in october old moore is afraid again  he cannot avoid a haunting suspicion that certain people will be victimized by extensive fraudulent proceedings  in november the public press will have its columns full of important news  the weather will be adverse and a death will occur in high circles  this makes the second in one year  i am glad i do not belong to the higher circles    how does he do it   in december old moore again foresees trouble just when i was hoping it was all over  frauds will come to light and death will find its victims  and all this information is given to us for a penny  the palmist examines our hand  you will go a journey he tells us  it is marvellous  how could he have known that only the night before we had been discussing the advisability of taking the children to margate for the holidays  there is trouble in store for you he tells us regretfully but you will get over it  we feel that the future has no secret hidden from him  we have presentiments that people we love who are climbing mountains who are fond of ballooning are in danger  the sister of a friend of mine who went out to the south african war as a volunteer had three presentiments of his death  he came home safe and sound but admitted that on three distinct occasions he had been in imminent danger  it seemed to the dear lady a proof of everything she had ever read  another friend of mine was waked in the middle of the night by his wife who insisted that he should dress himself and walk three miles across a moor because she had had a dream that something terrible was happening to a bosom friend of hers  the bosom friend and her husband were rather indignant at being waked at two oclock in the morning but their indignation was mild compared with that of the dreamer on learning that nothing was the matter  from that day forward a coldness sprang up between the two families  i would give much to believe in ghosts  the interest of life would be multiplied by its own square power could we communicate with the myriad dead watching us from their mountain summits  mr zangwill in a poem that should live draws for us a pathetic picture of blind children playing in a garden laughing romping  all their lives they have lived in darkness they are content  but the wonder of it could their eyes by some miracle be opened    blind children playing in a world of darkness   may not we be but blind children suggests the poet living in a world of darknesslaughing weeping loving dyingknowing nothing of the wonder round us  the ghosts about us with their godlike faces it might be good to look at them  but these poor palefaced spooks these dullwitted tablethumping spirits it would be sad to think that of such was the kingdom of the dead     chapter xvii   parents and their teachers   my heart has been much torn of late reading of the wrongs of children it has lately been discovered that children are being hampered and harassed in their career by certain brutal and ignorant persons called for want of a better name parents  the parent is a selfish wretch who out of pure devilment and without consulting the child itself upon the subject lures innocent children into the world apparently for the purpose merely of annoying them  the parent does not understand the child when he has got it he does not understand anything not much  the only person who understands the child is the young gentleman fresh from college and the elderly maiden lady who between them produce most of the literature that explains to us the child  the parent does not even know how to dress the child  the parent will persist in dressing the child in a long and trailing garment that prevents the child from kicking  the young gentleman fresh from college grows almost poetical in his contempt  it appears that the one thing essential for the health of a young child is that it should have perfect freedom to kick  later on the parent dresses the child in short clothes and leaves bits of its leg bare  the elderly maiden understander of children quoting medical opinion denounces us as criminals for leaving any portion of that precious leg uncovered  it appears that the partially uncovered leg of childhood is responsible for most of the disease that flesh is heir to  then we put it into boots  we crush its delicately fashioned feet into hideous leather instruments of torture  that is the sort of phrase that is hurled at us  the picture conjured up is that of some fiend in human shape calling itself a father seizing some helpless cherub by the hair and while drowning its pathetic wails for mercy beneath roars of demon laughter proceeding to bind about its tender bones some ancient curiosity dug from the dungeons of the inquisition  if the young gentleman fresh from college or the maiden lady understander could be if only for a month or two a father  if only he or she could guess how gladly the father of limited income would reply  my dear you are wrong in saying that the children must have boots  that is an exploded theory  the children must not have boots  i refuse to be a party to crushing their delicately fashioned feet into hideous leather instruments of torture  the young gentleman fresh from college and the elderly maiden understander have decided that the children must not have boots  do not let me hear again that outofdate wordboots  if there were only one young gentleman fresh from college one maiden lady understander teaching us our duty life would be simpler  but there are so many young gentlemen from college so many maiden lady understanders on the jobif i may be permitted a vulgarism and as yet they are not all agreed  it is distracting for the parent anxious to do right  we put the little dears into sandals and then at once other young gentlemen from college other maiden lady understanders point to us as wouldbe murderers  long clothes are fatal short clothes are deadly boots are instruments of torture to allow children to go about with bare feet shows that we regard them as incumbrances and with low cunning are seeking to be rid of them    their first attempt   i knew a pair of parents  i am convinced in spite of all that can be said to the contrary they were fond of their child it was their first they were anxious to do the right thing  they read with avidity all books and articles written on the subject of children  they read that a child should always sleep lying on its back and took it in turns to sit awake o nights to make sure that the child was always right side up  but another magazine told them that children allowed to sleep lying on their backs grew up to be idiots  they were sad they had not read of this before and started the child on its right side  the child on the contrary appeared to have a predilection for the left the result being that neither the parents nor the baby itself for the next three weeks got any sleep worth speaking of  later on by good fortune they came across a treatise that said a child should always be allowed to choose its own position while sleeping and their friends persuaded them to stop at thattold them they would never strike a better article if they searched the whole british museum library  it troubled them to find that child sometimes sleeping curled up with its toe in its mouth and sometimes flat on its stomach with its head underneath the pillow  but its health and temper were decidedly improved    the parent can do no right   there is nothing the parent can do right  you would think that now and then he might if only by mere accident blunder into sense  but no there seems to be a law against it  he brings home woolly rabbits and indiarubber elephants and expects the child to be contented forsooth with suchlike aids to its education  as a matter of fact the child is content it bangs its own head with the woolly rabbit and does itself no harm it tries to swallow the indiarubber elephant it does not succeed but continues to hope  with that woolly rabbit and that indiarubber elephant it would be as happy as the day is long if only the young gentleman from cambridge would leave it alone and not put new ideas into its head  but the gentleman from cambridge and the maiden lady understander are convinced that the future of the race depends upon leaving the child untrammelled to select its own amusements  a friend of mine during his wifes absence once on a visit to her mother tried the experiment  the child selected a fryingpan  how it got the fryingpan remains to this day a mystery  the cook said fryingpans dont walk upstairs  the nurse said she should be sorry to call anyone a liar but that there was commonsense in everything  the scullerymaid said that if everybody did their own work other people would not be driven beyond the limits of human endurance and the housekeeper said that she was sick and tired of life  my friend said it did not matter  the child clung to the frying pan with passion  the book my friend was reading said that was how the human mind was formed the childs instinct prompted it to seize upon objects tending to develop its brain faculty  what the parent had got to do was to stand aside and watch events  the child proceeded to black everything about the nursery with the bottom of the fryingpan  it then set to work to lick the fryingpan clean  the nurse a woman of narrow ideas had a presentiment that later on it would be ill  my friend explained to her the error the world had hitherto committed it had imagined that the parent knew a thing or two that the child didnt  in future the children were to do their bringing up themselves  in the house of the future the parents would be allotted the attics where they would be out of the way  they might occasionally be allowed down to dinner say on sundays  the child having exhausted all the nourishment the fryingpan contained sought to develop its brain faculty by thumping itself over the head with the flat of the thing  with the selfishness of the average parentthinking chiefly of what the coroner might say and indifferent to the future of humanity my friend insisted upon changing the game    his foolish talk   the parent does not even know how to talk to his own child  the child is yearning to acquire a correct and dignified mode of expression  the parent says did ums  did naughty table hurt ickle tootsie pootsies baby say oo naughty table  me no love oo  the child despairs of ever learning english  what should we think ourselves were we to join a french class and were the instructor to commence talking to us french of this description  what the child according to the gentleman from cambridge says to itself is  oh for one hours intelligent conversation with a human being who can talk the language  will not the young gentleman from cambridge descend to detail  will he not give us a specimen dialogue  a celebrated lady writer who has made herself the mouthpiece of feminine indignation against male stupidity took up the cudgels a little while ago on behalf of mrs caudle  she admitted mrs caudle appeared to be a somewhat foolish lady  but what had caudle ever done to improve mrs caudles mind  had he ever sought with intelligent illuminating conversation to direct her thoughts towards other topics than lent umbrellas and redheaded minxes  it is my complaint against so many of our teachers  they scold us for what we do but so rarely tell us what we ought to do  tell me how to talk to my baby and i am willing to try  it is not as if i took a personal pride in the phrase did ums  i did not even invent it  i found it so to speak when i got here and my experience is that it soothes the child  when he is howling and i say did ums with sympathetic intonation he stops crying  possibly enough it is astonishment at the ineptitude of the remark that silences him  maybe it is that minor troubles are lost sight of face to face with the reflection that this is the sort of father with which fate has provided him  but may not even this be useful to him  he has got to meet with stupid people in the world  let him begin by contemplating me  it will make things easier for him later on  i put forward the idea in the hope of comforting the young gentleman from cambridge  we injure the health of the child by enforcing on it silence  we have a stupid formula that children should be seen and not heard  we deny it exercise to its lungs  we discourage its natural and laudable curiosity by telling it not to worry usnot to ask so many questions  wont somebody lend the young gentleman from cambridge a small and healthy child just for a week or so and let the bargain be that he lives with it all the time  the young gentleman from cambridge thinks when we call up the stairs to say that if we hear another sound from the nursery during the next two hours we will come up and do things to that child the mere thought of which should appal it that is silencing the child  it does not occur to him that two minutes later that child is yelling again at the top of its voice having forgotten all we ever said    the child of fiction   i know the sort of child the weeper over childrens wrongs has in his mind  it has deep soulful yearning eyes  it moves about the house softly shedding an atmosphere of patient resignation  it says yes dear papa  no dear mamma  it has but one ambitionto be good and useful  it has beautiful thoughts about the stars  you dont know whether it is in the house or isnt you find it with its little face pressed close against the windowpane watching the golden sunset  nobody understands it  it blesses the old people and dies  one of these days the young gentleman from cambridge will one hopes have a baby of his owna real child and serve him darnwell right  at present he is labouring under a wrong conception of the article  he says we overeducate it  we clog its wonderful brain with a mass of uninteresting facts and foolish formulas that we call knowledge  he does not know that all this time the child is alive and kicking  he is under the delusion that the child is taking all this lying down  we tell the child it has got to be quiet or else we will wring its neck  the gentleman from cambridge pictures the child as from that moment a silent spirit moving voiceless towards the grave  we catch the child in the morning and clean it up and put a little satchel on its back and pack it off to school and the maiden lady understander pictures that child wasting the all too brief period of youth crowding itself up with knowledge  my dear madam you take it from me that your tears are being wasted  you wipe your eyes and cheer up  the dear child is not going to be overworked he is seeing to that  as a matter of the fact the child of the present day is having if anything too good a time  i shall be considered a brute for saying this but i am thinking of its future and my opinion is that we are giving it swelled head  the argument just now in the air is that the parent exists merely for the children  the parent doesnt count  it is as if a gardener were to say  bother the flowers let them rot  the sooner they are out of the way the better  the seed is the only thing that interests me  you cant produce respectable seed but from carefully cultivated flowers the philosopher clamouring for improved children will later grasp the fact that the parent is of importance  then he will change his tactics and address the children and we shall have our time  he will impress on them how necessary it is for their own sakes that they should be careful of us  we shall have books written about misunderstood fathers who were worried into early graves    the misunderstood father   fresh air funds will be started for sending parents away to the seaside on visits to kind bachelors living in detached houses miles away from children  books will be specially written for us picturing a world where school fees are never demanded and babies never howl o nights  societies for the prevention of cruelty to parents will arise  little girls who get their hair entangled and mislay all their clothes just before they are starting for the partylittle boys who kick holes in their best shoes will be spanked at the public expense     chapter xviii   marriage and the joke of it   marriages are made in heavenbut solely it has been added by a cynical writer for export  there is nothing more remarkable in human sociology than our attitude towards the institution of marriage  so it came home to me the other evening as i sat on a cane chair in the ill lighted schoolroom of a small country town  the occasion was a penny reading  we had listened to the usual overture from zampa played by the lady professor and the eldest daughter of the brewer to phil bloods leap recited by the curate to the violin solo by the pretty widow about whom gossip is whisperedone hopes it is not true  then a palefaced gentleman with a drooping black moustache walked on to the platform  it was the local tenor  he sang to us a song of love misunderstandings had arisen bitter words regretted as soon as uttered had pierced the all too sensitive spirit  parting had followed  the brokenhearted one had died believing his affection unrequited  but the angels had since told him he knew she loved him nowthe accent on the now  i glanced around me  we were the usual crowd of mixed humanitytinkers tailors soldiers sailors with our cousins and our sisters and our wives  so many of our eyes were wet with tears  miss butcher could hardly repress her sobs  young mr tinker his face hidden behind his programme pretended to be blowing his nose  mrs apothecarys large bosom heaved with heartfelt sighs  the retired colonel sniffed audibly sadness rested on our souls  it might have been so different but for those foolish hasty words  there need have been no funeral  instead the church might have been decked with bridal flowers  how sweet she would have looked beneath her orange wreath  how proudly gladly he might have responded i will take her for his wedded wife to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death did them part  and thereto he might have plighted his troth  in the silence which reigned after the applause had subsided the beautiful words of the marriage service seemed to be stealing through the room that they might ever remain in perfect love and peace together  thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine  thy children like the olive branches round about thy table  lo thus shall a man be blessed  so shall men love their wives as their own bodies and be not bitter against them giving honour unto them as unto the weaker vessel  let the wife see that she reverence her husband wearing the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit    love and the satyr   all the stories sung by the sweet singers of all time were echoing in our earsstories of true love that would not run smoothly until the last chapter of gallant lovers strong and brave against fate of tender sweethearts waiting trusting till loves golden crown was won so they married and lived happy ever after  then stepped briskly on the platform a stout baldheaded man  we greeted him with enthusiasmit was the local low comedian  the piano tinkled saucily  the selfconfident man winked and opened wide his mouth  it was a funny song how we roared with laughter  the last line of each verse was the same  and thats what its like when youre married  before it was duckie and darling and dear  now its take your cold feet away brute cant you hear  once they walked hand in hand me loves ickle oo  now he strides on ahead imitation with aid of umbrella much appreciated the baldheaded man in his enthusiasm and owing to the smallness of the platform sweeping the lady accompanist off her stool bawling come along do  the baldheaded man interspersed sidesplitting patter  the husband comes home late the wife is waiting for him at the top of the stairs with a broom  he kisses the servantgirl  she retaliates by discovering a cousin in the guards  the comic man retired to an enthusiastic demand for an encore  i looked around me at the laughing faces  miss butcher had been compelled to stuff her handkerchief into her mouth  mr tinker was wiping his eyes he was not ashamed this time they were tears of merriment  mrs apothecarys motherly bosom was shaking like a jelly  the colonel was grinning from ear to ear  later on as i noticed in the programme the schoolmistress an unmarried lady was down to sing darby and joan  she has a sympathetic voice her darby and joan is always popular  the comic man would also again appear in the second part and would oblige with by request his mother inlaw  so the quaint comedy continues tonight we will enjoy romeo and juliet for tomorrow we have seats booked for the pink domino    what the gipsy did not mention   wont the pretty lady let the poor old gipsy tell her fortune  blushes giggles protestations  gallant gentleman friend insists  a dark man is in love with pretty lady  gipsy sees a marriage not so very far ahead pretty lady says what nonsense but looks serious  pretty ladys pretty friends must of course be teasing  gallant gentleman friend by curious coincidence happens to be dark  gipsy grins and passes on  is that all the gipsy knows of pretty ladys future  the rheumy cunning eyes  they were bonny and black many years ago when the parchment skin was smooth and fair  they have seen so many a passing showdo they see in pretty ladys hand nothing further  what would the wicked old eyes foresee did it pay them to speakpretty lady crying tears into a pillow  pretty lady growing ugly spite and anger spoiling pretty features  dark young man no longer loving  dark young man hurling bitter words at pretty ladyhurling maybe things more heavy  dark young man and pretty lady listening approvingly to comic singer having both discovered thats what its like when youre married  my friend h g wells wrote a book the island of dr moreau  i read it in ms one winter evening in a lonely country house upon the hills wind screaming to wind in the dark without  the story has haunted me ever since  i hear the winds shrill laughter  the doctor had taken the beasts of the forest apes tigers strange creatures from the deep had fashioned them with hideous cruelty into the shapes of men had given them souls had taught to them the law  in all things else were they human but their original instincts their creators skill had failed to eliminate  all their lives were one long torture  the law said we are men and women this we shall do this we shall not do  but the ape and tiger still cried aloud within them  civilization lays her laws upon us they are the laws of godsof the men that one day perhaps shall come  but the primeval creature of the cave still cries within us    a few rules for married happiness   the wonder is that not being godsbeing mere men and womenmarriage works out as well as it does  we take two creatures with the instincts of the ape still stirring within them two creatures fashioned on the law of selfishness two selfcentred creatures of opposite appetites of desires opposed to one another of differing moods and fancies two creatures not yet taught the lesson of selfcontrol of selfrenunciation and bind them together for life in an union so close that one cannot snore onights without disturbing the others rest that one cannot without risk to happiness have a single taste unshared by the other that neither without danger of upsetting the whole applecart so to speak can have an opinion with which the other does not heartedly agree  could two angels exist together on such terms without ever quarrelling  i doubt it  to make marriage the ideal we love to picture it in romance the elimination of human nature is the first essential  supreme unselfishness perfect patience changeless amiability we should have to start with and continue with until the end    the real darby and joan   i do not believe in the darby and joan of the song  they belong to songland  to accept them i need a piano a sympathetic contralto voice a firelight effect and that sentimental mood in myself the foundation of which is a good dinner well digested  but there are darbys and joans of real flesh and blood to be met withgod bless them and send more for our examplewholesome living men and women brave struggling souls with commonsense  ah yes they have quarrelled had their dark house of bitterness of hate when he wished to heaven he had never met her and told her so  how could he have guessed those sweet lips could utter such cruel words those tender eyes he loved to kiss flash with scorn and anger  and she had she known what lay behind those days when he knelt before her swore that his only dream was to save her from all pain  passion lies dead it is a flame that burns out quickly  the most beautiful face in the world grows indifferent to us when we have sat opposite it every morning at breakfast every evening at supper for a brief year or two passion is the seed  love grows from it a tender sapling beautiful to look upon but wondrous frail easily broken easily trampled on during those first years of wedded life  only by much nursing by long caring for watered with tears shall it grow into a sturdy tree defiant of the winds neath which darby and joan shall sit sheltered in old age  they had commonsense brave hearts  darby had expected too much  darby had not made allowance for human nature which he ought to have done seeing how much he had of it himself  joan knows he did not mean it joan has a nasty temper she admits it  joan will try darby will try they kiss again with tears  it is a workaday world darby and joan will take it as it is will do their best  a little kindness a little clasping of the hands before night comes    many ways of love   youth deems it heresy but i sometimes wonder if our english speaking way is quite the best  i discussed the subject once with an old french lady the english reader forms his idea of french life from the french novel it leads to mistaken notions  there are french darbys french joans many thousands of them  believe me said my old french friend your english way is wrong our way is not perfect but it is the better i am sure  you leave it entirely to the young people  what do they know of life of themselves even  he falls in love with a pretty face  shehe danced so well he was so agreeable that day of the picnic  if marriage were only for a month or so could be ended without harm when the passion was burnt out ah yes then perhaps you would be right  i loved at eighteen madlynearly broke my heart  i meet him occasionally now  my dearher hair was silvery white and i was only thirtyfive she always called me my dear it is pleasant at thirtyfive to be talked to as a child  he was a perfect brute handsome he had been yes but all that was changed he was as stupid as an ox  i never see his poor frightenedlooking wife without shuddering thinking of what i have escaped  they told me all that but i looked only at his face and did not believe them  they forced me into marriage with the kindest man that ever lived  i did not love him then but i loved him for thirty years was it not better  but my dear friend i answered that poor frightenedlooking wife of your first love  her marriage also was i take it the result of parental choosing  the love marriage i admit as often as not turns out sadly  the children choose ill  parents also choose ill  i fear there is no sure receipt for the happy marriage  you are arguing from bad examples answered my silverhaired friend it is the system that i am defending  a young girl is no judge of character  she is easily deceived is wishful to be deceived  as i have said she does not even know herself  she imagines the mood of the moment will remain with her  only those who have watched over her with loving insight from her infancy know her real temperament  the young man is blinded by his passion  nature knows nothing of marriage of companionship  she has only one aim  that accomplished she is indifferent to the future of those she has joined together  i would have parents think only of their childrens happiness giving to worldly considerations their true value but nothing beyond choosing for their children with loving care with sense of their great responsibility    which is it   i fear our young people would not be contented with our choosing i suggested  are they so contented with their own the honeymoon over she responded with a smile  we agreed it was a difficult problem viewed from any point  but i still think it would be better were we to heap less ridicule upon the institution  matrimony cannot be holy and ridiculous at the same time  we have been familiar with it long enough to make up our minds in which light to regard it     chapter xix   man and his tailor   whats wrong with the madeup tie  i gather from the fashionable novelist that no man can wear a madeup tie and be a gentleman  he may be a worthy man clever welltodo eligible from every other point of view but she the refined heroine can never get over the fact that he wears a madeup tie  it causes a shudder down her highbred spine whenever she thinks of it  there is nothing else to be said against him there is nothing worse about him than thishe wears a madeup tie  it is all sufficient  no true woman could ever care for him no really classy society ever open its doors to him  i am worried about this thing because to confess the horrid truth i wear a madeup tie myself  on foggy afternoons i steal out of the house disguised  they ask me where i am going in a hat that comes down over my ears and why i am wearing blue spectacles and a false beard but i will not tell them  i creep along the wall till i find a common hosiers shop and then in an assumed voice i tell the man what it is i want they come to fourpence halfpenny each by taking the halfdozen i get them for a trifle less  they are put on in a moment and to my vulgar eye look neat and tasteful  of course i know i am not a gentleman  i have given up hopes of ever being one  years ago when life presented possibilities i thought that with pains and intelligence i might become one  i never succeeded  it all depends on being able to tie a bow  round the bedpost or the neck of the waterjug i could tie the wretched thing to perfection  if only the bedpost or the waterjug could have taken my place and gone to the party instead of me life would have been simpler  the bedpost and the waterjug in its neat white bow looked like a gentlemanthe fashionable novelists idea of a gentleman  upon myself the result was otherwise suggesting always a feeble attempt at suicide by strangulation  i could never understand how it was done  there were moments when it flashed across me that the secret lay in being able to turn ones self inside out coming up with ones arms and legs the other way round  standing on ones head might have surmounted the difficulty but the higher gymnastics nature has denied to me  the boneless wonder or the man serpent could i felt be a gentleman so easily  to one to whom has been given only the common ordinary joints gentlemanliness is apparently an impossible ideal  it is not only the tie  i never read the fashionable novel without misgiving  some hopeless bounder is being described  if you want to know what he is like says the peer of the realm throwing himself back in his deep easychair and puffing lazily at his cigar of delicate aroma he is the sort of man that wears three studs in his shirt    the difficulty of being a gentleman   merciful heavens  i myself wear three studs in my shirt  i also am a hopeless bounder and i never knew it  it comes upon me like a thunderbolt  i thought three studs were fashionable  the idiot at the shop told me three studs were all the rage and i ordered two dozen  i cant afford to throw them away  till these two dozen shirts are worn out i shall have to remain a hopeless bounder  why have we not a minister of the fine arts  why does not a paternal government fix notices at the street corners telling the wouldbe gentleman how many studs he ought to wear what style of necktie now distinguishes the nobleminded man from the basehearted  they are prompt enough with their police regulations their vaccination ordersthe higher things of life they neglect  i select at random another masterpiece of english literature  my dear says lady montresor with her light aristocratic laugh you surely cannot seriously think of marrying a man who wears socks with yellow spots  lady emmelina sighs  he is very nice she murmurs but i suppose you are right  i suppose that sort of man does get on your nerves after a time  my dear child says lady montresor he is impossible  in a cold sweat i rush upstairs into my bedroom  i thought so i am always wrong  all my best socks have yellow spots  i rather fancied them  they were expensive too now i come to think of it  what am i to do  if i sacrifice them and get red spots then red spots for all i know may be wrong  i have no instinct  the fashionable novelist never helps one  he tells us what is wrong but he does not tell us what is right  it is creative criticism that i feel the need of why does not the lady montresor go on  tell me what sort of socks the ideal lover ought to wear  there are so many varieties of socks  what is a wouldbegentleman to do  would it be of any use writing to the fashionable novelist    how we might all of us be gentlemen   dear mr fashionable novelist or should it be missbefore going to my tailor i venture to write to you on a subject of some importance  i am fairly well educated of good family and address and so my friends tell me of passable appearance  i yearn to become a gentleman  if it is not troubling you too much would you mind telling me how to set about the business  what socks and ties ought i to wear  do i wear a flower in my buttonhole or is that a sign of a coarse mind  how many buttons on a morning coat show a beautiful nature  does a standup collar with a tennis shirt prove that you are of noble descent or on the contrary stamp you as a parvenu  if answering these questions imposes too great a tax on your time perhaps you would not mind telling me how you yourself know these things  who is your authority and when is he at home  i should apologize for writing to you but that i feel you will sympathize with my appeal  it seems a pity there should be so many vulgar illbred people in the world when a little knowledge on these trivial points would enable us all to become gentlemen  thanking you in anticipation i remain      would he or she tell us  or would the fashionable novelist reply as i once overheard a harassed mother retort upon one of her inquiring children  most of the afternoon she had been rushing out into the garden where games were in progress to tell the children what they must not dotommy you know you must not do that  havent you got any sense at all  johnny you wicked boy how dare you do that how many more times do you want me to tell you  jane if you do that again you will go straight to bed my girl and so on  at length the door was opened from without and a little face peeped in mother  now what is it cant i ever get a moments peace  mother please would you mind telling us something we might do  the lady almost fell back on the floor in her astonishment  the idea had never occurred to her  what may you do  dont ask me  i am tired enough of telling you what not to do    things a gentleman should never do   i remember when a young man wishful to conform to the rules of good society i bought a book of etiquette for gentlemen  its fault was just this  it told me through many pages what not to do  beyond that it seemed to have no idea  i made a list of things it said a gentleman should never do it was a lengthy list  determined to do the job completely while i was about it i bought other books of etiquette and added on their list of nevers  what one book left out another supplied  there did not seem much left for a gentleman to do  i concluded by the time i had come to the end of my books that to be a true gentleman my safest course would be to stop in bed for the rest of my life  by this means only could i hope to avoid every possible faux pas every solecism  i should have lived and died a gentleman  i could have had it engraved upon my tombstone  he never in his life committed a single act unbecoming to a gentleman  to be a gentleman is not so easy perhaps as a fashionable novelist imagines  one is forced to the conclusion that it is not a question entirely for the outfitter  my attention was attracted once by a notice in the window of a westend emporium gentlemen supplied  it is to such like universal providers that the fashionable novelist goes for his gentleman  the gentleman is supplied to him complete in every detail  if the reader be not satisfied that is the readers fault  he is one of those tiresome discontented customers who does not know a good article when he has got it  i was told the other day of the writer of a musical farce or is it comedy who was most desirous that his leading character should be a perfect gentleman  during the dress rehearsal the actor representing the part had to open his cigarette case and request another perfect gentleman to help himself  the actor drew forth his case  it caught the critical eye of the author  good heavens he cried what do you call that  a cigarette case answered the actor  but my dear boy exclaimed the author surely it is silver  i know admitted the actor it does perhaps suggest that i am living beyond my means but the truth is i picked it up cheap  the author turned to the manager  this wont do he explained a real gentleman always carries a gold cigarette case  he must be a gentleman or theres no point in the plot  dont let us endanger any point the plot may happen to possess for goodness sake agreed the manager let him by all means have a gold cigarette case    how one may know the perfect gentleman   so regardless of expense a gold cigarette case was obtained and put down to expenses  and yet on the first night of that musical play when that leading personage smashed a tray over a waiters head and after a row with the police came home drunk to his wife even that gold cigarette case failed to convince one that the man was a gentleman beyond all doubt  the old writers appear to have been singularly unaware of the importance attaching to these socks and ties and cigarettecases  they told us merely what the man felt and thought  what reliance can we place upon them  how could they possibly have known what sort of man he was underneath his clothes  tweed or broadcloth is not transparent  even could they have got rid of his clothes there would have remained his flesh and bones  it was pure guesswork  they did not observe  the modern writer goes to work scientifically  he tells us that the creature wore a madeup tie  from that we know he was not a gentleman it follows as the night the day  the fashionable novelist notices the young mans socks  it reveals to us whether the marriage would have been successful or a failure  it is necessary to convince us that the hero is a perfect gentleman the author gives him a gold cigarette case  a wellknown dramatist has left it on record that comedy cannot exist nowadays for the simple reason that gentlemen have given up taking snuff and wearing swords  how can one have comedy in company with frockcoatswithout its las and its odds bobs  the sword may have been helpful  i have been told that at levees city men unaccustomed to the thing have with its help provided comedy for the rest of the company  but i take it this is not the comedy our dramatist had in mind    why not an exhibition of gentlemen   it seems a pity that comedy should disappear from among us  if it depend entirely on swords and snuffboxes would it not be worth the while of the society of authors to keep a few gentlemen specially trained  maybe some sympathetic theatrical manager would lend us costumes of the eighteenth century  we might provide them with swords and snuffboxes they might meet say once a week in a queen anne drawingroom especially prepared by gillow and go through their tricks  authors seeking highclass comedy might be admitted to a gallery  perhaps this explains why oldfashioned readers complain that we do not give them human nature  how can we  ladies and gentlemen nowadays dont wear the proper clothes  evidently it all depends upon the clothes     chapter xx   woman and her behaviour   should women smoke  the question in fourinch letters exhibited on a placard outside a small newsvendors shop caught recently my eye  the wanderer through london streets is familiar with suchlike appeals to his decision should short men marry tall wives  ought we to cut our hair  should second cousins kiss  lifes problems appear to be endless  personally i am not worrying myself whether women should smoke or not it seems to me a question for the individual woman to decide for herself i like women who smoke i can see no objection to their smoking  smoking soothes the nerves  womens nerves occasionally want soothing  the tiresome idiot who argues that smoking is unwomanly denounces the drinking of tea as unmanly  he is a woodenheaded person who derives all his ideas from cheap fiction  the manly man of cheap fiction smokes a pipe and drinks whisky  that is how we know he is a man  the womanly womanwell i always feel i could make a better woman myself out of an old clothes shop and a hairdressers block  but as i have said the question does not impress me as one demanding my particular attention  i also like the woman who does not smoke  i have met in my time some very charming women who do not smoke  it may be a sign of degeneracy but i am prepared to abdicate my position of womans god leaving her free to lead her own life    womans god   candidly the responsibility of feeling myself answerable for all a woman does or does not do would weigh upon me  there are men who are willing to take this burden upon themselves and a large number of women are still anxious that they should continue to bear it  i spoke quite seriously to a young lady not long ago on the subject of tight lacing undoubtedly she was injuring her health  she admitted it herself  i know all you can say she wailed i daresay a lot of it is true those awful pictures where one seeswell all the things one does not want to think about  if they are correct it must be bad squeezing it all up together  then why continue to do so i argued  oh its easy enough to talk she explained a few old fogies like youi had been speaking very plainly to her and she was cross with memay pretend you dont like small waists but the average man does  poor girl  she was quite prepared to injure herself for life to damage her childrens future to be uncomfortable for fifteen hours a day all to oblige the average man  it is a compliment to our sex  what man would suffer injury and torture to please the average woman  this frenzied desire of woman to conform to our ideals is touching  a few daring spirits of late years have exhibited a tendency to seek for other godsfor ideals of their own  we call them the unsexed women  the womanly women lift up their hands in horror of such blasphemy  when i was a boy no womanly woman rode a bicycletricycles were permitted  on three wheels you could still be womanly but on two you were a creature  the womanly woman seeing her approach would draw down the parlour blind with a jerk lest the children looking out might catch a glimpse of her and their young souls be smirched for all eternity  no womanly woman rode inside a hansom or outside a bus  i remember the day my own dear mother climbed outside a bus for the first time in her life  she was excited and cried a little but nobodyheaven be praisedsaw usthat is nobody of importance  and afterwards she confessed the air was pleasant  be not the first by whom the new is tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside is a safe rule for those who would always retain the good opinion of that allpowerful but somewhat unintelligent incubus the average person but the pioneer the guide is necessary  that is if the world is to move forward  the freedomloving girl of today who can enjoy a walk by herself without losing her reputation who can ride down the street on her bike without being hooted at who can play a mixed double at tennis without being compelled by public opinion to marry her partner who can in short lead a human creatures life and not that of a lapdog led about at the end of a string might pause to think what she owes to the unsexed creatures who fought her battle for her fifty years ago    those unsexed creatures   can the working woman of today who may earn her own living if she will without loss of the elementary rights of womanhood think of the bachelor girl of a short generation ago without admiration of her pluck there were ladies in those day too unwomanly to remain helpless burdens on overworked fathers and mothers too unsexed to marry the first man that came along for the sake of their bread and butter  they fought their way into journalism into the office into the shop  the reformer is not always the pleasantest man to invite to a teaparty  maybe these women who went forward with the flag were not the most charming of their sex  the dora copperfield type will for some time remain the young mans ideal the model the young girl puts before herself  myself i think dora copperfield charming but a world of dora copperfields  the working woman is a new development in sociology  she has many lessons to learn but one has hopes of her  it is said that she is unfitting herself to be a wife and mother  if the ideal helpmeet for a man be an animated dresden china shepherdesssomething that looks pretty on the table something to be shown round to ones friends something that can be locked up safely in a cupboard that asks no questions and therefore need be told no liesthen a woman who has learnt something of the world who has formed ideas of her own will not be the ideal wife    references givenand required   maybe the average man will not be her ideal husband  each michaelmas at a little town in the thames valley with which i am acquainted there is held a hiring fair  a farmer one year laid his hand on a livelylooking lad and asked him if he wanted a job  it was what the boy was looking for  got a character asked the farmer  the boy replied that he had for the last two years been working for mr muggs the ironmongerfelt sure that mr muggs would give him a good character  well go and ask mr muggs to come across and speak to me i will wait here directed the wouldbe employer  five minutes went byten minutes  no mr muggs appeared  later in the afternoon the farmer met the boy again  mr muggs never came near me with that character of yours said the farmer  no sir answered the boy i didnt ask him to  why not inquired the farmer  well i told him who it was that wanted itthe boy hesitated  well demanded the farmer impatiently  well then he told me yours explained the boy  maybe the working woman looking for a husband and not merely a livelihood may end by formulating standards of her own  she may end by demanding the manly man and moving about the world knowing something of life may arrive at the conclusion that something more is needed than the smoking of pipes and the drinking of whiskies and sodas  we must be prepared for this  the sheltered woman who learnt her life from fairy stories is a dream of the past  woman has escaped from her sheltershe is on the loose  for the future we men have got to accept the emancipated woman as an accomplished fact    the ideal world   many of us are worried about her  what is going to become of the home  i admit there is a more ideal existence where the working woman would find no place it is in a world that exists only on the comic opera stage there every picturesque village contains an equal number of ladies and gentlemen nearly all the same height and weight to all appearance of the same age  each jack has his jill and does not want anybody elses there are no complications one presumes they draw lots and fall in love the moment they unscrew the paper  they dance for awhile on grass which is never damp and then into the conveniently situated ivycovered church they troop in pairs and are wedded off hand by a whitehaired clergyman who is a married man himself  ah if the world were but a comic opera stage there would be no need for working women  as a matter of fact so far as one can judge from the front of the house there are no working men either  but outside the opera house in the muddy street jack goes home to his third floor back or his chambers in the albany according to his caste and wonders when the time will come when he will be able to support a wife  and jill climbs on a penny bus or steps into the family brougham and dreams with regret of a lost garden where there was just one man and just one woman and clothes grew on a fig tree  with the progress of civilizationutterly opposed as it is to all natures intentionsthe number of working women will increase  with some friends the other day i was discussing motorcars and one gentleman with sorrow in his voicehe is the type of conservative who would have regretted the passing away of the glacial periodopined that motorcars had come to stay  you mean said another they have come to go  the working woman however much we may regret it has come to go and she is going it  we shall have to accept her and see what can be done with her  one thing is certain we shall not solve the problem of the twentieth century by regretting the simple sociology of the stone age    a lovers view   speaking as a lover i welcome the openings that are being given to women to earn their own livelihood  i can conceive of no more degrading profession for a womanno profession more calculated to unfit her for being that wife and mother we talk so much about than the profession that up to a few years ago was the only one open to herthe profession of husbandhunting  as a man i object to being regarded as womans last refuge her one and only alternative to the workhouse  i cannot myself see why the woman who has faced the difficulties of existence learnt the lesson of life should not make as good a wife and mother as the ignorant girl taken direct one might almost say from the nursery and without the slightest preparation put in a position of responsibility that to a thinking person must be almost appalling  it has been said that the difference between men and women is this that the man goes about the world making it ready for the children that the woman stops at home making the children ready for the world  will not she do it much better for knowing something of the world for knowing something of the temptations the difficulties her own children will have to face for having learnt by her own experience to sympathize with the struggles the sordid heartbreaking cares that man has daily to contend with  civilization is ever undergoing transformation but human nature remains the bachelor girl in her bedsitting room in her studio in her flat will still see in the shadows the vision of the home will still hear in the silence the sound of childrens voices will still dream of the lovers kiss that is to open up new life to her  she is not quite so unsexed as you may think my dear womanly madame  a male friend of mine was telling me of a catastrophe that once occurred at a station in the east indies    no time to think of husbands   a fire broke out at night and everybody was in terror lest it should reach the magazine  the women and children were being hurried to the ships and two ladies were hastening past my friend  one of them paused and clasping her hands demanded of him if he knew what had become of her husband  her companion was indignant  for goodness sake dont dawdle maria she cried this is no time to think of husbands  there is no reason to fear that the working woman will ever cease to think of husbands  maybe as i have said she will demand a better article than the mere husbandhunter has been able to stand out for maybe she herself will have something more to give maybe she will bring to him broader sympathies higher ideals  the woman who has herself been down among the people who has faced life in the open will know that the home is but one cell of the vast hive  we shall perhaps hear less of the woman who has her own home and children to think ofreally takes no interest in these mattersthese matters of right and wrong these matters that spell the happiness or misery of millions    the wife of the future   maybe the bridegroom of the future will not say i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come but i have married a wife we will both come
