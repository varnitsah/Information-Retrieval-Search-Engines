180    adjusting the folds of his blanket to a greater dignity      216     the sea lady     chapter the first  the coming of the sea lady   i  such previous landings of mermaids as have left a record have all a flavour of doubt even the very circumstantial account of that bruges sea lady who was so clever at fancy work gives occasion to the sceptic i must confess that i was absolutely incredulous of such things until a year ago but now face to face with indisputable facts in my own immediate neighbourhood and with my own second cousin melville of seaton carew as the chief witness to the story i see these old legends in a very different light yet so many people concerned themselves with the hushing up of this affair that but for my sedulous enquiries i am certain it would have become as doubtful as those older legends in a couple of score of years even now to many minds  the difficulties in the way of the hushingup process were no doubt exceptionally great in this case and that they did contrive to do so much seems to show just how strong are the motives for secrecy in all such cases there is certainly no remoteness nor obscurity about the scene of these events they began upon the beach just east of sandgate castle towards folkestone and they ended on the beach near folkestone pier not two miles away the beginning was in broad daylight on a bright blue day in august and in full sight of the windows of half a dozen houses at first sight this alone is sufficient to make the popular want of information almost incredible but of that you may think differently later  mrs randolph buntings two charming daughters were bathing at the time in company with their guest miss mabel glendower it is from the latter lady chiefly and from mrs bunting that i have pieced together the precise circumstances of the sea ladys arrival from miss glendower the elder of two glendower girls for all that she is a principal in almost all that follows i have obtained and have sought to obtain no information whatever there is the question of the ladys feelingsand in this case i gather they are of a peculiarly complex sort quite naturally they would be at any rate the natural ruthlessness of the literary calling has failed me i have not ventured to touch them  the villa residences to the east of sandgate castle you must understand are particularly lucky in having gardens that run right down to the beach there is no intervening esplanade or road or path such as cuts off ninetynine out of the hundred of houses that face the sea as you look down on them from the western end of the leas you see them crowding the very margin and as a great number of high groins stand out from the shore along this piece of coast the beach is practically cut off and made private except at very low water when people can get around the ends of the groins these houses are consequently highly desirable during the bathing season and it is the custom of many of their occupiers to let them furnished during the summer to persons of fashion and affluence  the randolph buntings were such personsindisputably it is true of course that they were not aristocrats or indeed what an unpaid herald would freely call gentle they had no right to any sort of arms but then as mrs bunting would sometimes remark they made no pretence of that sort they were quite free as indeed everybody is nowadays from snobbery they were simple homely buntingsrandolph buntingsgood people as the saying isof a widely diffused hampshire stock addicted to brewing and whether a suitably remunerated herald could or could not have proved them gentle there can be no doubt that mrs bunting was quite justified in taking in the gentlewoman and that mr bunting and fred were sedulous gentlemen and that all their ways and thoughts were delicate and nice and they had staying with them the two miss glendowers to whom mrs bunting had been something of a mother ever since mrs glendowers death  the two miss glendowers were half sisters and gentle beyond dispute a county family race that had only for a generation stooped to trade and risen at once antæuslike refreshed and enriched the elder adeline was the rich onethe heiress with the commercial blood in her veins she was really very rich and she had dark hair and grey eyes and serious views and when her father died which he did a little before her stepmother she had only the later portion of her later youth left to her she was nearly sevenandtwenty she had sacrificed her earlier youth to her fathers infirmity of temper in a way that had always reminded her of the girlhood of elizabeth barrett browning but after his departure for a sphere where his temper has no doubt a wider scopefor what is this world for if it is not for the formation of charactershe had come out strongly it became evident she had always had a mind and a very active and capable one an accumulated fund of energy and much ambition she had bloomed into a clear and critical socialism and she had blossomed at public meetings and now she was engaged to that really very brilliant and promising but rather extravagant and romantic person harry chatteris the nephew of an earl and the hero of a scandal and quite a possible liberal candidate for the hythe division of kent at least this last matter was under discussion and he was about and miss glendower liked to feel she was supporting him by being about too and that was chiefly why the buntings had taken a house in sandgate for the summer sometimes he would come and stay a night or so with them sometimes he would be off upon affairs for he was known to be a very versatile brilliant firstclass political young manand hythe very lucky to have a bid for him all things considered and fred bunting was engaged to miss glendowers less distinguished much less wealthy seventeenyear old and possibly altogether more ordinary halfsister mabel glendower who had discerned long since when they were at school together that it wasnt any good trying to be clear when adeline was about  the buntings did not bathe mixed a thing indeed that was still only very doubtfully decent in 1898 but mr randolph bunting and his son fred came down to the beach with them frankly instead of hiding away or going for a walk according to the older fashion this notwithstanding that miss mabel glendower freds fiancée to boot was of the bathing party they formed a little procession down under the evergreen oaks in the garden and down the ladder and so to the seas margin  mrs bunting went first looking as it were for peeping tom with her glasses and miss glendower who never bathed because it made her feel undignified went with herwearing one of those simple costly art morning costumes socialists affect behind this protecting van came one by one the three girls in their beautiful parisian bathing dresses and headdressesthough these were of course completely muffled up in huge hooded gowns of towellingand wearing of course stockings and shoesthey bathed in stockings and shoes then came mrs buntings maid and the second housemaid and the maid the glendower girls had brought carrying towels and then at a little interval the two men carrying ropes and things mrs bunting always put a rope around each of her daughters before ever they put a foot in the water and held it until they were safely out again but mabel glendower would not have a rope  where the garden ends and the beach begins miss glendower turned aside and sat down on the green iron seat under the evergreen oak and having found her place in sir george tressadya book of which she was naturally enough at that time inordinately fondsat watching the others go on down the beach there they were a very bright and very pleasant group of prosperous animated people upon the sunlit beach and beyond them in streaks of grey and purple and altogether calm save for a pattern of dainty little wavelets was that ancient mother of surprises the sea  as soon as they reached the highwater mark where it is no longer indecent to be clad merely in a bathing dress each of the young ladies handed her attendant her wrap and after a little fun and laughter mrs bunting looked carefully to see if there were any jelly fish and then they went in and after a minute or so it seems betty the elder miss bunting stopped splashing and looked and then they all looked and there about thirty yards away was the sea ladys head as if she were swimming back to land  naturally they concluded that she must be a neighbour from one of the adjacent houses they were a little surprised not to have noticed her going down into the water but beyond that her apparition had no shadow of wonder for them they made the furtive penetrating observations usual in such cases they could see that she was swimming very gracefully and that she had a lovely face and very beautiful arms but they could not see her wonderful golden hair because all that was hidden in a fashionable phrygian bathing cap picked upas she afterwards admitted to my second cousinsome nights before upon a norman plage nor could they see her lovely shoulders because of the red costume she wore  they were just on the point of feeling their inspection had reached the limit of really nice manners and mabel was pretending to go on splashing again and saying to betty shes wearing a red dress i wish i could see when something very terrible happened  the swimmer gave a queer sort of flop in the water threw up her arms andvanished  it was the sort of thing that seems for an instant to freeze everybody just one of those things that everyone has read of and imagined and very few people have seen  for a space no one did anything one two three seconds passed and then for an instant a bare arm flashed in the air and vanished again  mabel tells me she was quite paralysed with horror she did nothing all the time but the two miss buntings recovering a little screamed out oh shes drowning and hastened to get out of the sea at once a proceeding accelerated by mrs bunting who with great presence of mind pulled at the ropes with all her weight and turned about and continued to pull long after they were many yards from the waters edge and indeed cowering in a heap at the foot of the sea wall miss glendower became aware of a crisis and descended the steps sir george tressady in one hand and the other shading her eyes crying in her clear resolute voice she must be saved the maids of course were screamingas became thembut the two men appear to have acted with the greatest presence of mind fred nexdoors ledder said mr randolph buntingfor the nextdoor neighbour instead of having convenient stone steps had a high wall and a long wooden ladder and it had often been pointed out by mr bunting if ever an accident should happen to anyone there was that in a moment it seems they had both flung off jacket and vest collar tie and shoes and were running the neighbours ladder out into the water  where did she go ded said fred  right out hea said mr bunting and to confirm his word there flashed again an arm and something darksomething which in the light of all that subsequently happened i am inclined to suppose was an unintentional exposure of the ladys tail  neither of the two gentlemen are expert swimmersindeed so far as i can gather mr bunting in the excitement of the occasion forgot almost everything he had ever known of swimmingbut they waded out valiantly one on each side of the ladder thrust it out before them and committed themselves to the deep in a manner casting no discredit upon our nation and race  yet on the whole i think it is a matter for general congratulation that they were not engaged in the rescue of a genuinely drowning person at the time of my enquiries whatever soreness of argument that may once have obtained between them had passed and it is fairly clear that while fred bunting was engaged in swimming hard against the long side of the ladder and so causing it to rotate slowly on its axis mr bunting had already swallowed a very considerable amount of seawater and was kicking fred in the chest with aimless vigour this he did as he explains to get my legs down you know something about that ladder you know and they would go up  and then quite unexpectedly the sea lady appeared beside them one lovely arm supported mr bunting about the waist and the other was over the ladder she did not appear at all pale or frightened or out of breath fred told me when i crossexamined him though at the time he was too violently excited to note a detail of that sort indeed she smiled and spoke in an easy pleasant voice  cramp she said i have cramp both the men were convinced of that  mr bunting was on the point of telling her to hold tight and she would be quite safe when a little wave went almost entirely into his mouth and reduced him to wild splutterings  well get you in said fred or something of that sort and so they all hung bobbing in the water to the tune of mr buntings trouble  they seem to have rocked so for some time fred says the sea lady looked calm but a little puzzled and that she seemed to measure the distance shoreward you mean to save me she asked him  he was trying to think what could be done before his father drowned were saving you now he said  youll take me ashore  as she seemed so cool he thought he would explain his plan of operations trying to getend of ladderkick with my legs only a few yards out of our depthif we could only  minuteget my breathmoufu seawater said mr bunting splash wuff  and then it seemed to fred that a little miracle happened there was a swirl of the water like the swirl about a screw propeller and he gripped the sea lady and the ladder just in time as it seemed to him to prevent his being washed far out into the channel his father vanished from his sight with an expression of astonishment just forming on his face and reappeared beside him so far as back and legs are concerned holding on to the ladder with a sort of death grip and then behold they had shifted a dozen yards inshore and they were in less than five feet of water and fred could feel the ground  at its touch his amazement and dismay immediately gave way to the purest heroism he thrust ladder and sea lady before him abandoned the ladder and his now quite disordered parent caught her tightly in his arms and bore her up out of the water the young ladies cried saved the maids cried saved distant voices echoed saved hooray everybody in fact cried saved except mrs bunting who was she says under the impression that mr bunting was in a fit and mr bunting who seems to have been under an impression that all those laws of nature by which under providence we are permitted to float and swim were in suspense and that the best thing to do was to kick very hard and fast until the end should come but in a dozen seconds or so his head was up again and his feet were on the ground and he was making whale and walrus noises and noises like a horse and like an angry cat and like sawing and was wiping the water from his eyes and mrs bunting except that now and then she really had to turn and say randolph could give her attention to the beautiful burthen that clung about her son  and it is a curious thing that the sea lady was at least a minute out of the water before anyone discovered that she was in any way different fromother ladies i suppose they were all crowding close to her and looking at her beautiful face or perhaps they imagined that she was wearing some indiscreet but novel form of dark riding habit or something of that sort anyhow not one of them noticed it although it must have been before their eyes as plain as day certainly it must have blended with the costume and there they stood imagining that fred had rescued a lovely lady of indisputable fashion who had been bathing from some neighbouring house and wondering why on earth there was nobody on the beach to claim her and she clung to fred and as miss mabel glendower subsequently remarked in the course of conversation with him fred clung to her  i had cramp said the sea lady with her lips against freds cheek and one eye on mrs bunting i am sure it was cramp ive got it still  i dont see anybody began mrs bunting  please carry me in said the sea lady closing her eyes as if she were illthough her cheek was flushed and warm carry me in  where gasped fred  carry me into the house she whispered to him  which house  mrs bunting came nearer  your house said the sea lady and shut her eyes for good and became oblivious to all further remarks  she but i dont understand said mrs bunting addressing everybody  and then it was they saw it nettie the younger miss bunting saw it first she pointed she says before she could find words to speak then they all saw it miss glendower i believe was the person who was last to see it at any rate it would have been like her if she had been  mother said nettie giving words to the general horror mother she has a tail  and then the three maids and mabel glendower screamed one after the other look they cried a tail  of all said mrs bunting and words failed her  oh said miss glendower and put her hand to her heart  and then one of the maids gave it a name its a mermaid screamed the maid and then everyone screamed its a mermaid  except the mermaid herself she remained quite passive pretending to be insensible partly on freds shoulder and altogether in his arms   ii  that you know is the tableau so far as i have been able to piece it together again you must imagine this little knot of people upon the beach and mr bunting i figure a little apart just wading out of the water and very wet and incredulous and half drowned and the neighbours ladder was drifting quietly out to sea  of course it was one of those positions that have an air of being conspicuous  indeed it was conspicuous it was some way below high water and the group stood out perhaps thirty yards down the beach nobody as mrs bunting told my cousin melville knew a bit what to do and they all had even an exaggerated share of the national hatred of being seen in a puzzle the mermaid seemed content to remain a beautiful problem clinging to fred and by all accounts she was a reasonable burthen for a man it seems that the very large family of people who were stopping at the house called koot hoomi had appeared in force and they were all staring and gesticulating they were just the sort of people the buntings did not want to knowtradespeople very probably presently one of the menthe particularly vulgar man who used to shoot at the gullsbegan putting down their ladder as if he intended to offer advice and mrs bunting also became aware of the black glare of the field glasses of a still more horrid man to the west  moreover the popular author who lived next door an irascible dark squareheaded little man in spectacles suddenly turned up and began bawling from his inaccessible wall top something foolish about his ladder nobody thought of his silly ladder or took any trouble about it naturally he was quite stupidly excited to judge by his tone and gestures he was using dreadful language and seemed disposed every moment to jump down to the beach and come to them  and then to crown the situation over the westward groin appeared low excursionists  first of all their heads came and then their remarks then they began to clamber the breakwater with joyful shouts  pip pip said the low excursionists as they climbedit was the year of pip pipand what ho she bumps and then less generally whats up ere  and the voices of other low excursionists still invisible answered pip pip  it was evidently a large party  anything wrong shouted one of the low excursionists at a venture  my dear said mrs bunting to mabel what are we to do and in her description of the affair to my cousin melville she used always to make that the clou of the story my dear what are we to do  i believe that in her desperation she even glanced at the water but of course to have put the mermaid back then would have involved the most terrible explanations  it was evident there was only one thing to be done mrs bunting said as much the only thing said she is to carry her indoors  and carry her indoors they did  one can figure the little procession in front fred wet and astonished but still clinging and clung to and altogether too out of breath for words and in his arms the sea lady she had a beautiful figure i understand until that horrible tail began and the fin of it mrs bunting told my cousin in a whispered confidence went up and down and with pointed corners for all the world like a mackerels it flopped and dripped along the pathi imagine she was wearing a very nice and very longskirted dress of red material trimmed with coarse white lace and she had mabel told me a gilet though that would scarcely show as they went up the garden and that phrygian cap hid all her golden hair and showed the white low level forehead over her seablue eyes from all that followed i imagine her at the moment scanning the veranda and windows of the house with a certain eagerness of scrutiny  behind this staggering group of two i believe mrs bunting came then mr bunting dreadfully wet and broken down mr bunting must have been by then and from one or two things i have noticed since i cant help imagining him as pursuing his wife with of course my dear i couldnt tell you know  and then in a dismayed yet curious bunch the girls in their wraps of towelling and the maids carrying the ropes and things and as if inadvertently as became them most of mr and fred buntings clothes  and then miss glendower for once at least in no sort of pose whatever clutching sir george tressady and perplexed and disturbed beyond measure  and then as it were pursuing them all pip pip and the hat and raised eyebrows of a low excursionist still anxious to know whats up from the garden end  so it was or at least in some such way and to the accompaniment of the wildest ravings about some ladder or other heard all too distinctly over the garden walloverdressed snobbs take my rare old english adjective ladderthat they carried the sea lady who appeared serenely insensible to everything up through the house and laid her down upon the couch in mrs buntings room  and just as miss glendower was suggesting that the very best thing they could do would be to send for a doctor the sea lady with a beautiful naturalness sighed and came to     chapter the second  some first impressions   i  there with as much verisimilitude as i can give it is how the folkestone mermaid really came to land there can be no doubt that the whole affair was a deliberately planned intrusion upon her part she never had cramp she couldnt have cramp and as for drowning nobody was near drowning for a moment except mr bunting whose valuable life she very nearly sacrificed at the outset of her adventure and her next proceeding was to demand an interview with mrs bunting and to presume upon her youthful and glowing appearance to gain the support sympathy and assistance of that goodhearted lady who as a matter of fact was a thing of yesterday a mere chicken in comparison with her own immemorial years in her extraordinary raid upon humanity  her treatment of mrs bunting would be incredible if we did not know that in spite of many disadvantages the sea lady was an extremely well read person she admitted as much in several later conversations with my cousin melville for a time there was a friendly intimacyso melville always preferred to present itbetween these two and my cousin who has a fairly considerable amount of curiosity learnt many very interesting details about the life out there or down therefor the sea lady used either expression at first the sea lady was exceedingly reticent under the gentle insistence of his curiosity but after a time i gather she gave way to bursts of cheerful confidence it is clear says my cousin that the old ideas of the submarine life as a sort of perpetual game of whohoop through groves of coral diversified by moonlight haircombings on rocky strands need very extensive modification in this matter of literature for example they have practically all that we have and unlimited leisure to read it in melville is very insistent upon and rather envious of that unlimited leisure a picture of a mermaid swinging in a hammock of woven seaweed with what bishops call a latterday novel in one hand and a sixteen candlepower phosphorescent fish in the other may jar upon ones preconceptions but it is certainly far more in accordance with the picture of the abyss she printed on his mind everywhere change works her will on things everywhere and even among the immortals modernity spreads even on olympus i suppose there is a progressive party and a new phaeton agitating to supersede the horses of his father by some solar motor of his own i suggested as much to melville and he said horrible horrible and stared hard at my study fire dear old melville she gave him no end of facts about deep sea reading  of course they do not print books out there for the printers ink under water would not so much run as flyshe made that very plain but in one way or another nearly the whole of terrestrial literature says melville has come to them we know she said they form indeed a distinct reading public and additions to their vast submerged library that circulates forever with the tides are now pretty systematically sought the sources are various and in some cases a little odd many books have been found in sunken ships indeed said melville there is always a dropping and blowing overboard of novels and magazines from most passengercarrying vesselssometimes but these are not as a rule valuable additionsa deliberate shying overboard but sometimes books of an exceptional sort are thrown over when they are quite finished melville is a dainty irritable reader and no doubt he understood that from the sea beaches of holiday resorts moreover the lighter sorts of literature are occasionally getting blown out to sea and so soon as the booms of our great popular novelists are over melville assured me the libraries find it convenient to cast such surplus copies of their current works as the hospitals and prisons cannot take below highwater mark  thats not generally known said i  they know it said melville  in other ways the beaches yield young couples who begin to sit heapy the sea lady told my cousin as often as not will leave excellent modern fiction behind them when at last they return to their proper place there is a particularly fine collection of english work it seems in the deep water of the english channel practically the whole of the tauchnitz library is there thrown overboard at the last moment by conscientious or timid travellers returning from the continent and there was for a time a similar source of supply of american reprints in the mersey but that has fallen off in recent years and the deep sea mission for fishermen has now for some years been raining down tracts and giving a particularly elevated tone of thought to the extensive shallows of the north sea the sea lady was very precise on these points  when one considers the conditions of its accumulation one is not surprised to hear that the element of fiction is as dominant in this deep sea library as it is upon the counters of messrs mudie but my cousin learnt that the various illustrated magazines and particularly the fashion papers are valued even more highly than novels are looked for far more eagerly and perused with envious emotion indeed on that point my cousin got a sudden glimpse of one of the motives that had brought this daring young lady into the air he made some sort of suggestion we should have taken to dressing long ago she said and added with a vague quality of laughter in her tone it isnt that were unfeminine mr melville onlyas i was explaining to mrs bunting one must consider ones circumstanceshow can one hope to keep anything nice under water imagine lace  soaked said my cousin melville  drenched said the sea lady  ruined said my cousin melville  and then you know said the sea lady very gravely ones hair  of course said melville whyyou can never get it dry  thats precisely it said she  my cousin melville had a new light on an old topic and thats whyin the old time  exactly she cried exactly before there were so many excursionists and sailors and low people about one came out one sat and brushed it in the sun and then of course it really was possible to do it up but now  she made a petulant gesture and looked gravely at melville biting her lip the while my cousin made a sympathetic noise the horrid modern spirit he saidalmost automatically  but though fiction and fashion appear to be so regrettably dominant in the nourishment of the mermind it must not be supposed that the most serious side of our reading never reaches the bottom of the sea there was for example a case quite recently the sea lady said of the captain of a sailing ship whose mind had become unhinged by the huckstering uproar of the times and daily mail and who had not only bought a secondhand copy of the times reprint of the encyclopædia britannica but also that dense collection of literary snacks and samples that allliterature sausage which has been compressed under the weighty editing of doctor richard garnett it has long been notorious that even the greatest minds of the past were far too copious and confusing in theiras the word goeslubrications doctor garnett it is alleged has seized the gist and presented it so compactly that almost any business man now may take hold of it without hindrance to his more serious occupations the unfortunate and misguided seaman seems to have carried the entire collection aboard with him with the pretty evident intention of coming to land in sydney the wisest man alivea hindoominded thing to do the result might have been anticipated the mass shifted in the night threw the whole weight of the science of the middle nineteenth century and the literature of all time in a virulently concentrated state on one side of his little vessel and capsized it instantly  the ship the sea lady said dropped into the abyss as if it were loaded with lead and its crew and other movables did not follow it down until much later in the day the captain was the first to arrive said the sea lady and it is a curious fact due probably to some preliminary dippings into his purchase that he came head first instead of feet down and limbs expanded in the customary way  however such exceptional windfalls avail little against the rain of light literature that is constantly going on the novel and the newspaper remain the worlds reading even at the bottom of the sea as subsequent events would seem to show it must have been from the common latterday novel and the newspaper that the sea lady derived her ideas of human life and sentiment and the inspiration of her visit and if at times she seemed to underestimate the nobler tendencies of the human spirit if at times she seemed disposed to treat adeline glendower and many of the deeper things of life with a certain sceptical levity if she did at last indisputably subordinate reason and right feeling to passion it is only just to her and to those deeper issues that we should ascribe her aberrations to their proper cause   ii  my cousin melville i was saying did at one time or another get a vague a very vague conception of what that deepsea world was like but whether his conception has any quality of truth in it is more than i dare say he gives me an impression of a very strange world indeed a green luminous fluidity in which these beings float a world lit by great shining monsters that drift athwart it and by waving forests of nebulous luminosity amidst which the little fishes drift like netted stars it is a world with neither sitting nor standing nor going nor coming through which its inhabitants float and drift as one floats and drifts in dreams and the way they live there my dear man said melville it must be like a painted ceiling  i do not even feel certain that it is in the sea particularly that this world of the sea lady is to be found but about those saturated books and drowned scraps of paper you say things are not always what they seem and she told him all of that we must reflect one laughing afternoon  she could appear at times he says as real as you or i and again came mystery all about her there were times when it seemed to him you might have hurt her or killed her as you can hurt and kill anyonewith a penknife for exampleand there were times when it seemed to him you could have destroyed the whole material universe and left her smiling still but of this ambiguous element in the lady more is to be told later there are wider seas than ever keel sailed upon and deeps that no lead of human casting will ever plumb when it is all summed up i have to admit i do not know i cannot tell i fall back upon melville and my poor array of collected facts at first there was amazingly little strangeness about her for any who had to deal with her there she was palpably solid and material a lady out of the sea  this modern world is a world where the wonderful is utterly commonplace we are bred to show a quiet freedom from amazement and why should we boggle at material mermaids with dewars solidifying all sorts of impalpable things and marconi waves spreading everywhere to the buntings she was as matter of fact as much a matter of authentic and reasonable motives and of sound solid sentimentality as everything else in the bunting world so she was for them in the beginning and so up to this day with them her memory remains   iii  the way in which the sea lady talked to mrs bunting on that memorable morning when she lay all wet and still visibly fishy on the couch in mrs buntings dressingroom i am also able to give with some little fulness because mrs bunting repeated it all several times acting the more dramatic speeches in it to my cousin melville in several of those good long talks that both of them in those happy daysand particularly mrs buntingalways enjoyed so much and with her very first speech it seems the sea lady took her line straight to mrs buntings generous managing heart she sat up on the couch drew the antimacassar modestly over her deformity and sometimes looking sweetly down and sometimes openly and trustfully into mrs buntings face and speaking in a soft clear grammatical manner that stamped her at once as no mere mermaid but a finished fine sea lady she made a clean breast of it as mrs bunting said and fully and frankly placed herself in mrs buntings hands  mrs bunting said mrs bunting to my cousin melville in a dramatic rendering of the sea ladys manner do permit me to apologise for this intrusion for i know it is an intrusion but indeed it has almost been forced upon me and if you will only listen to my story mrs bunting i think you will findwell if not a complete excuse for mefor i can understand how exacting your standards must beat any rate some excuse for what i have donefor what i must call mrs bunting my deceitful conduct towards you deceitful it was mrs bunting for i never had cramp but then mrs buntingand here mrs bunting would insert a long impressive pausei never had a mother  and then and there said mrs bunting when she told the story to my cousin melville the poor child burst into tears and confessed she had been born ages and ages ago in some dreadful miraculous way in some terrible place near cyprus and had no more right to a surname well there said mrs bunting telling the story to my cousin melville and making the characteristic gesture with which she always passed over and disowned any indelicacy to which her thoughts might have tended and all the while speaking with such a nice accent and moving in such a ladylike way  of course said my cousin melville there are classes of people in whom one excuses one must weigh  precisely said mrs bunting and you see it seems she deliberately chose me as the very sort of person she had always wanted to appeal to it wasnt as if she came to us haphazardshe picked us out she had been swimming round the coast watching people day after day she said for quite a long time and she said when she saw my face watching the girls batheyou know how funny girls are said mrs bunting with a little deprecatory laugh and all the while with a moisture of emotion in her kindly eyes she took quite a violent fancy to me from the very first  i can quite believe that at any rate said my cousin melville with unction i know he did although he always leaves it out of the story when he tells it to me but then he forgets that i have had the occasional privilege of making a third party in these good long talks  you know its most extraordinary and exactly like the german story said mrs bunting oomwhat is it  undine  exactlyyes and it really seems these poor creatures are immortal mr melvilleat least within limitscreatures born of the elements and resolved into the elements againand just as it is in the storytheres always a somethingthey have no souls no souls at all nothing and the poor child feels it she feels it dreadfully but in order to get souls mr melville you know they have to come into the world of men at least so they believe down there and so she has come to folkestone to get a soul of course thats her great object mr melville but shes not at all fanatical or silly about it any more than we are of course wepeople who feel deeply  of course said my cousin melville with i know a momentary expression of profound gravity drooping eyelids and a hushed voice for my cousin does a good deal with his soul one way and another  and she feels that if she comes to earth at all said mrs bunting she must come among nice people and in a nice way one can understand her feeling like that but imagine her difficulties to be a mere cause of public excitement and silly paragraphs in the silly season to be made a sort of show of in factshe doesnt want any of it added mrs bunting with the emphasis of both hands  what does she want asked my cousin melville  she wants to be treated exactly like a human being to be a human being just like you or me and she asks to stay with us to be one of our family and to learn how we live she has asked me to advise her what books to read that are really nice and where she can get a dressmaker and how she can find a clergyman to sit under who would really be likely to understand her case and everything she wants me to advise her about it all she wants to put herself altogether in my hands and she asked it all so nicely and sweetly she wants me to advise her about it all  um said my cousin melville  you should have heard her cried mrs bunting  practically its another daughter he reflected  yes said mrs bunting and even that did not frighten me she admitted as much  still  he took a step  she has means he inquired abruptly  ample she told me there was a box she said it was moored at the end of a groin and accordingly dear randolph watched all through luncheon and afterwards when they could wade out and reach the end of the rope that tied it he and fred pulled it in and helped fitch and the coachman carry it up its a curious little box for a lady to have well made of course but of wood with a ship painted on the top and the name of tom cut in it roughly with a knife but as she says leather simply will not last down there and one has to put up with what one can get and the great thing is its full perfectly full of gold coins and things yes goldand diamonds mr melville you know randolph understands something yes well he says that boxoh i couldnt tell you how much it isnt worth and all the gold things with just a sort of faint reddy touch but anyhow she is rich as well as charming and beautiful and really you know mr melville altogether well im going to help her just as much as ever i can practically shes to be our paying guest as you knowits no great secret between usadeline yes shell be the same and i shall bring her out and introduce her to people and so forth it will be a great help and for everyone except just a few intimate friends she is to be just a human being who happens to be an invalidtemporarily an invalidand we are going to engage a good trustworthy womanthe sort of woman who isnt astonished at anything you knowtheyre a little expensive but theyre to be got even nowadayswho will be her maidand make her dresses her skirts at any rateand we shall dress her in long skirtsand throw something over it you know  over  the tail you know  my cousin melville said precisely with his head and eyebrows but that was the point that hadnt been clear to him so far and it took his breath away positivelya tail all sorts of incorrect theories went by the board somehow he felt this was a topic not to be too urgently pursued but he and mrs bunting were old friends  and she really has  a tail he asked  like the tail of a big mackerel said mrs bunting and he asked no more  its a most extraordinary situation he said  but what else could i do asked mrs bunting  of course the things a tremendous experiment said my cousin melville and repeated quite inadvertently a tail  clear and vivid before his eyes obstructing absolutely the advance of his thoughts were the shiny clear lines the oily black the green and purple and silver and the easy expansiveness of a mackerels termination  but really you know said my cousin melville protesting in the name of reason and the nineteenth centurya tail  i patted it said mrs bunting   iv  certain supplementary aspects of the sea ladys first conversation with mrs bunting i got from that lady herself afterwards  the sea lady had made one queer mistake your four charming daughters she said and your two sons  my dear cried mrs buntingthey had got through their preliminaries by thenive only two daughters and one son  the young man who carriedwho rescued me  yes and the other two girls are friends you know visitors who are staying with me on land one has visitors  i know so i made a mistake  oh yes  and the other young man  you dont mean mr bunting  who is mr bunting  the other gentleman who  no  there was no one  but several mornings ago  could it have been mr melville i know you mean mr chatteris i remember he came down with us one morning a tall young man with fairrather curlyish you might sayhair wasnt it and a rather thoughtful face he was dressed all in white linen and he sat on the beach  i fancy he did said the sea lady  hes not my son heshes a friend hes engaged to adeline to the elder miss glendower he was stopping here for a night or so i daresay hell come again on his way back from paris dear me fancy my having a son like that  the sea lady was not quite prompt in replying  what a stupid mistake for me to make she said slowly and then with more animation of course now i think hes much too old to be your son  well hes thirtytwo said mrs bunting with a smile  its preposterous  i wont say that  but i saw him only at a distance you know said the sea lady and then and so he is engaged to miss glendower and miss glendower  is the young lady in the purple robe who  who carried a book  yes said mrs bunting thats the one theyve been engaged three months  dear me said the sea lady she seemed and is he very much in love with her  of course said mrs bunting  very much  ohof course if he wasnt he wouldnt  of course said the sea lady thoughtfully  and its such an excellent match in every way adelines just in the very position to help him  and mrs bunting it would seem briefly but clearly supplied an indication of the precise position of mr chatteris not omitting even that he was the nephew of an earl as indeed why should she omit itand the splendid prospects of his alliance with miss glendowers plebeian but extensive wealth the sea lady listened gravely he is young he is able he may still be anythinganything and she is so earnest so clever herselfalways reading she even reads blue booksgovernment blue books i meandreadful statistical schedulely things and the condition of the poor and all those things she knows more about the condition of the poor than any one ive ever met what they earn and what they eat and how many of them live in a room so dreadfully crowded you knowperfectly shocking she is just the helper he needs so dignifiedso capable of giving political parties and influencing people so earnest and you know she can talk to workmen and take an interest in trades unions and in quite astonishing things i always think shes just marcella come to life  and from that the good lady embarked upon an illustrative but involved anecdote of miss glendowers marvellous bluebookishness  hell come here again soon the sea lady asked quite carelessly in the midst of it  the query was carried away and lost in the anecdote so that later the sea lady repeated her question even more carelessly  but mrs bunting did not know whether the sea lady sighed at all or not she thinks not she was so busy telling her all about everything that i dont think she troubled very much to see how her information was received  what mind she had left over from her own discourse was probably centred on the tail   v  even to mrs buntings sensesshe is one of those persons who take everything except of course impertinence or impropriety quite calmlyit must i think have been a little astonishing to find herself sitting in her boudoir politely taking tea with a real live legendary creature they were having tea in the boudoir because of callers and quite quietly because in spite of the sea ladys smiling assurances mrs bunting would have it she must be tired and unequal to the exertions of social intercourse after such a journey said mrs bunting there were just the three adeline glendower being the third and fred and the three other girls i understand hung about in a general sort of way up and down the staircase to the great annoyance of the servants who were thus kept out of it altogether confirming one anothers views of the tail arguing on the theory of mermaids revisiting the garden and beach and trying to invent an excuse for seeing the invalid again they were forbidden to intrude and pledged to secrecy by mrs bunting and they must have been as altogether unsettled and miserable as young people can be for a time they played croquet in a halfhearted way each no doubt with an eye on the boudoir window  and as for mr bunting he was in bed  i gather that the three ladies sat and talked as any three ladies all quite resolved to be pleasant to one another would talk mrs bunting and miss glendower were far too well trained in the observances of good society which is as every one knows even the best of it now extremely mixed to make too searching enquiries into the sea ladys status and way of life or precisely where she lived when she was at home or whom she knew or didnt know though in their several ways they wanted to know badly enough the sea lady volunteered no information contenting herself with an entertaining superficiality of touch and go in the most ladylike way she professed herself greatly delighted with the sensation of being in air and superficially quite dry and was particularly charmed with tea  and dont you have tea cried miss glendower startled  how can we  but do you really mean  ive never tasted tea before how do you think we can boil a kettle  what a strangewhat a wonderful world it must be cried adeline and mrs bunting said i can hardly imagine it without tea its worse than i mean it reminds meof abroad  mrs bunting was in the act of refilling the sea ladys cup i suppose she said suddenly as youre not used to it it wont affect your diges she glanced at adeline and hesitated but its china tea  and she filled the cup  its an inconceivable world to me said adeline quite  her dark eyes rested thoughtfully on the sea lady for a space inconceivable she repeated for in that unaccountable way in which a whisper will attract attention that a turmoil fails to arouse the tea had opened her eyes far more than the tail  the sea lady looked at her with sudden frankness and think how wonderful all this must seem to me she remarked  but adelines imagination was aroused for the moment and she was not to be put aside by the sea ladys terrestrial impressions she piercedfor a moment or sothe ladylike serenity the assumption of a terrestrial fashion of mind that was imposing so successfully upon mrs bunting it must be she said the strangest world and she stopped invitingly  she could not go beyond that and the sea lady would not help her  there was a pause a silent eager search for topics apropos of the niphetos roses on the table they talked of flowers and miss glendower ventured you have your anemones too how beautiful they must be amidst the rocks  and the sea lady said they were very prettyespecially the cultivated sorts  and the fishes said mrs bunting how wonderful it must be to see the fishes  some of them volunteered the sea lady will come and feed out of ones hand  mrs bunting made a little coo of approval she was reminded of chrysanthemum shows and the outside of the royal academy exhibition and she was one of those people to whom only the familiar is really satisfying she had a momentary vision of the abyss as a sort of diverticulum of piccadilly and the temple a place unexpectedly rational and comfortable there was a kink for a time about a little matter of illumination but it recurred to mrs bunting only long after the sea lady had turned from miss glendowers interrogative gravity of expression to the sunlight  the sunlight seems so golden here said the sea lady is it always golden  you have that beautiful greeneryblue shimmer i suppose said miss glendower that one catches sometimes ever so faintly in aquaria  one lives deeper than that said the sea lady everything is phosphorescent you know a mile or so down and its likei hardly know as towns look at nightonly brighter like piers and things like that  really said mrs bunting with the strand after the theatres in her head quite bright  oh quite said the sea lady  but struggled adeline is it never put out  its so different said the sea lady  thats why it is so interesting said adeline  there are no nights and days you know no time nor anything of that sort  now thats very queer said mrs bunting with miss glendowers teacup in her handthey were both drinking quite a lot of tea absentmindedly in their interest in the sea lady but how do you tell when its sunday  we dont began the sea lady at least not exactly and thenof course one hears the beautiful hymns that are sung on the passenger ships  of course said mrs bunting having sung so in her youth and quite forgetting something elusive that she had previously seemed to catch  but afterwards there came a glimpse of some more serious divergencea glimpse merely miss glendower hazarded a supposition that the sea people also had their problems and then it would seem the natural earnestness of her disposition overcame her proper attitude of ladylike superficiality and she began to ask questions there can be no doubt that the sea lady was evasive and miss glendower perceiving that she had been a trifle urgent tried to cover her error by expressing a general impression  i cant see it she said with a gesture that asked for sympathy one wants to see it one wants to be it one needs to be born a merchild  a merchild asked the sea lady  yes dont you call your little ones  what little ones asked the sea lady  she regarded them for a moment with a frank wonder the undying wonder of the immortals at that perpetual decay and death and replacement which is the gist of human life then at the expression of their faces she seemed to recollect of course she said and then with a transition that made pursuit difficult she agreed with adeline it is different she said it is wonderful one feels so alike you know and so different thats just where it is so wonderful do i look and yet you know i have never had my hair up nor worn a dressing gown before today  what do you wear asked miss glendower very charming things i suppose  its a different costume altogether said the sea lady brushing away a crumb  just for a moment mrs bunting regarded her visitor fixedly she had i fancy in that moment an indistinct imperfect glimpse of pagan possibilities but there you know was the sea lady in her wrapper so palpably a lady with her pretty hair brought up to date and such a frank innocence in her eyes that mrs buntings suspicions vanished as they came  but i am not so sure of adeline     chapter the third  the episode of the various journalists   i  the remarkable thing is that the buntings really carried out the programme mrs bunting laid down for a time at least they positively succeeded in converting the sea lady into a credible human invalid in spite of the galaxy of witnesses to the ladys landing and in spite of the severe internal dissensions that presently broke out in spite moreover of the fact that one of the maidsthey found out which only long aftertold the whole story under vows to her very superior young man who told it next sunday to a rising journalist who was sitting about on the leas maturing a descriptive article the rising journalist was incredulous but he went about enquiring in the end he thought it good enough to go upon he found in several quarters a vague but sufficient rumour of a something for the maids young man was a conversationalist when he had anything to say  finally the rising journalist went and sounded the people on the two chief folkestone papers and found the thing had just got to them they were inclined to pretend they hadnt heard of it after the fashion of local papers when confronted by the abnormal but the atmosphere of enterprise that surrounded the rising journalist woke them up he perceived he had done so and that he had no time to lose so while they engaged in inventing representatives to enquire he went off and telephoned to the daily gunfire and the new paper when they answered he was positive and earnest he staked his reputationthe reputation of a rising journalist  i swear theres something up he said get in firstthats all  he had some reputation i sayand he had staked it the daily gunfire was sceptical but precise and the new paper sprang a headline a mermaid at last  you might well have thought the thing was out after that but it wasnt there are things one doesnt believe even if they are printed in a halfpenny paper to find the reporters hammering at their doors so to speak and fended off only for a time by a proposal that they should call again to see their incredible secret glaringly in print did indeed for a moment seem a hopeless exposure to both the buntings and the sea lady already they could see the story spreading could imagine the imminent rush of intimate enquiries the tripod strides of a multitude of cameras the crowds watching the windows the horrors of a great publicity all the buntings and mabel were aghast simply aghast adeline was not so much aghast as excessively annoyed at this imminent and so far as she was concerned absolutely irrelevant publicity they will never dare she said and consider how it affects harry and at the earliest opportunity she retired to her own room the others with a certain disregard of her offence sat around the sea ladys couchshe had scarcely touched her breakfastand canvassed the coming terror  they will put our photographs in the papers said the elder miss bunting  well they wont put mine in said her sister its horrid i shall go right off now and have it taken again  theyll interview the ded  no no said mr bunting terrified your mother  its your place my dear said mrs bunting  but the ded said fred  i couldnt said mr bunting  well some onell have to tell em anyhow said mrs bunting you know they will  but it isnt at all what i wanted wailed the sea lady with the daily gunfire in her hand cant it be stopped  you dont know our journalists said fred  the tact of my cousin melville saved the situation he had dabbled in journalism and talked with literary fellows like myself and literary fellows like myself are apt at times to be very free and outspoken about the press he heard of the buntings shrinking terror of publicity as soon as he arrived a perfect clamouran almost exultant clamour indeed of shrinking terror and he caught the sea ladys eye and took his line there and then  its not an occasion for sticking at trifles mrs bunting he said but i think we can save the situation all the same youre too hopeless we must put our foot down at once thats all let me see these reporter fellows and write to the london dailies i think i can take a line that will settle them  eh said fred  i can take a line that will stop it trust me  what altogether  altogether  how said fred and mrs bunting youre not going to bribe them  bribe said mr bunting were not in france you cant bribe a british paper  a sort of subdued cheer went around from the assembled buntings  you leave it to me said melville in his element  and with earnestly expressed but not very confident wishes for his success they did  he managed the thing admirably  whats this about a mermaid he demanded of the local journalists when they returned they travelled together for company being so to speak emergency journalists compositors in their milder moments and unaccustomed to these higher aspects of journalism whats this about a mermaid repeated my cousin while they waived precedence dumbly one to another  i believe some ones been letting you in said my cousin melville just imaginea mermaid  thats what we thought said the younger of the two emergency journalists we knew it was some sort of hoax you know only the new paper giving it a headline  im amazed even banghurst said my cousin melville  its in the daily gunfire as well said the older of the two emergency journalists  whats one more or less of these hapenny fever rags cried my cousin with a ringing scorn surely youre not going to take your folkestone news from mere london papers  but how did the story come about began the older emergency journalist  thats not my affair  the younger emergency journalist had an inspiration he produced a note book from his breast pocket perhaps sir you wouldnt mind suggesting to us something we might say  my cousin melville complied   ii  the rising young journalist who had first got wind of the businesswho must not for a moment be confused with the two emergency journalists heretofore describedcame to banghurst next night in a state of strange exultation ive been through with it and ive seen her he panted i waited about outside and saw her taken into the carriage ive talked to one of the maidsi got into the house under pretence of being a telephone man to see their telephonei spotted the wireand its a fact a positive factshes a mermaid with a taila proper mermaids tail ive got here  he displayed sheets  whaddyer talking about said banghurst from his littered desk eyeing the sheets with apprehensive animosity  the mermaidthere really is a mermaid at folkestone  banghurst turned away from him and pawed at his pen tray whad if there is he said after a pause  but its proved that note you printed  that note i printed was a mistake if theres anything of that sort going young man banghurst remained an obstinate expansion of back  how  we dont deal in mermaids here  but youre not going to let it drop  i am  but there she is  illustration stuff that the public wont believe arent facts  let her be he turned on the rising young journalist and his massive face was unusually massive and his voice fine and full and fruity do you think were going to make our public believe anything simply because its true they know perfectly well what they are going to believe and what they arent going to believe and they arent going to believe anything about mermaidsyou bet your hat i dont care if the whole damned beach was littered with mermaidsnot the whole damned beach weve got our reputation to keep up see look hereyou dont learn journalism as i hoped youd do it was you what brought in all that stuff about a discovery in chemistry  its true  ugh  i had it from a fellow of the royal society  i dont care if you had it fromanybody stuff that the public wont believe arent facts being true only makes em worse they buy our paper to swallow it and its got to go down easy when i printed you that note and headline i thought you was up to a lark i thought you was on to a mixed bathing scandal or something of that sortwith juice in it the sort of thing that all understand you know when you went down to folkestone you were going to describe what salisbury and all the rest of them wear upon the leas and start a discussion on the acclimatisation of the café and all that and then you get on to this unprintable epithet nonsense  but lord salisburyhe doesnt go to folkestone  banghurst shrugged his shoulders over a hopeless case what the deuce he said addressing his inkpot in plaintive tones does that matter  the young man reflected he addressed banghursts back after a pause his voice had flattened a little i might go over this and do it up as a lark perhaps make it a comic dialogue sketch with a man who really believed in itor something like that its a beastly lot of copy to get slumped you know  nohow said banghurst not in any shape no why theyd think it clever theyd think you was making game of them they hate things they think are clever  the young man made as if to reply but banghursts back expressed quite clearly that the interview was at an end  nohow repeated banghurst just when it seemed he had finished altogether  i may take it to the gunfire then  banghurst suggested an alternative  very well said the young man heated the gunfire it is  but in that he was reckoning without the editor of the gunfire   iii  it must have been quite soon after that that i myself heard the first mention of the mermaid little recking that at last it would fall to me to write her history i was on one of my rare visits to london and micklethwaite was giving me lunch at the penwiper club certainly one of the best dozen literary clubs in london i noted the rising young journalist at a table near the door lunching alone all about him tables were vacant though the other parts of the room were crowded he sat with his face towards the door and he kept looking up whenever any one came in as if he expected some one who never came once distinctly i saw him beckon to a man but the man did not respond  look here micklethwaite i said why is everybody avoiding that man over there i noticed just now in the smokingroom that he seemed to be trying to get into conversation with some one and that a kind of taboo  micklethwaite stared over his fork rather he said  but whats he done  hes a fool said micklethwaite with his mouth full evidently annoyed ugh he said as soon as he was free to do so  i waited a little while  whats he done i ventured  micklethwaite did not answer for a moment and crammed things into his mouth vindictively bread and all sorts of things then leaning towards me in a confidential manner he made indignant noises which i could not clearly distinguish as words  oh i said when he had done  yes said micklethwaite he swallowed and then poured himself winesplashing the tablecloth  he had me for an hour very nearly the other day  yes i said  silly fool said micklethwaite  i was afraid it was all over but luckily he gave me an opening again after gulping down his wine  he leads you on to argue he said  that  that he cant prove it  yes  and then he shows you he can just showing off how damned ingenious he is  i was a little confused prove what i asked  havent i been telling you said micklethwaite growing very red about this confounded mermaid of his at folkestone  he says there is one  yes he does said micklethwaite going purple and staring at me very hard he seemed to ask mutely whether i of all people proposed to turn on him and back up this infamous scoundrel i thought for a moment he would have apoplexy but happily he remembered his duty as my host so he turned very suddenly on a meditative waiter for not removing our plates  had any golf lately i said to micklethwaite when the plates and the remains of the waiter had gone away golf always does micklethwaite good except when he is actually playing then i am told if i were mrs bunting i should break off and raise my eyebrows and both hands at this point to indicate how golf acts on micklethwaite when he is playing  i turned my mind to feigning an interest in golfa game that in truth i despise and hate as i despise and hate nothing else in this world imagine a great fat creature like micklethwaite a creature who ought to wear a turban and a long black robe to hide his grossness whacking a little white ball for miles and miles with a perfect surgery of instruments whacking it either with a babyish solemnity or a childish rage as luck may have decided whacking away while his country goes to the devil and incidentally training an innocenteyed little boy to swear and be a tiphunting loafer thats golf however i controlled my all too facile sneer and talked of golf and the relative merits of golf links as i might talk to a child about buns or distract a puppy with the whisper of rats and when at last i could look at the rising young journalist again our lunch had come to an end  i saw that he was talking with a greater air of freedom than it is usual to display to club waiters to the man who held his coat the man looked incredulous but respectful and was answering shortly but politely  when we went out this little conversation was still going on the waiter was holding the rising young journalists soft felt hat and the rising young journalist was fumbling in his coat pocket with a thick mass of papers  its tremendous ive got most of it here he was saying as we went by i dont know if youd care  i get very little time for reading sir the waiter was replying     chapter the fourth  the quality of parker   i  so far i have been very full i know and verisimilitude has been my watchword rather than the true affidavit style but if i have made it clear to the reader just how the sea lady landed and just how it was possible for her to land and become a member of human society without any considerable excitement on the part of that society such poor pains as i have taken to tint and shadow and embellish the facts at my disposal will not have been taken in vain she positively and quietly settled down with the buntings within a fortnight she had really settled down so thoroughly that save for her exceptional beauty and charm and the occasional faint touches of something a little indefinable in her smile she had become a quite passable and credible human being she was a cripple indeed and her lower limb was most pathetically swathed and put in a sort of case but it was quite generally understoodi am afraid at mrs buntings initiativethat presently theymrs bunting said they which was certainly almost as far or even a little farther than legitimate prevarication may gowould be as well as ever  illustration she positively and quietly settled down with the buntings  of course said mrs bunting she will never be able to bicycle again  that was the sort of glamour she threw about it   ii  in parker it is indisputable that the sea lady foundor at least had found for her by mrs buntinga treasure of the richest sort parker was still fallaciously young but she had been maid to a lady from india who had been in a case and had experienced and overcome crossexamination she had also been deceived by a young man whom she had fancied greatly only to find him walking out with anothercontrary to her inflexible sense of correctnessin the presence of which all other things are altogether vain life she had resolved should have no further surprises for her she looked out on its largely improper pageant with an expression of alert impartiality in her hazel eyes calm doing her specific duty and entirely declining to participate further she always kept her elbows down by her side and her hands always just in contact and it was impossible for the most powerful imagination to conceive her under any circumstances as being anything but absolutely straight and clean and neat and her voice was always under all circumstances low and wonderfully distinctjust to an infinitesimal degree indeed mincing  mrs bunting had been a little nervous when it came to the point it was mrs bunting of course who engaged her because the sea lady was so entirely without experience but certainly mrs buntings nervousness was thrown away  you understand said mrs bunting taking a plunge at it thatthat she is an invalid  i didnt mem replied parker respectfully and evidently quite willing to understand anything as part of her duty in this world  in fact said mrs bunting rubbing the edge of the tablecloth daintily with her gloved finger and watching the operation with interest as a matter of fact she has a mermaids tail  mermaids tail indeed mem and is it painful at all  oh dear no it involves no inconveniencenothing exceptyou understand there is a need ofdiscretion  of course mem said parker as who should say there always is  we particularly dont want the servants  the lower servants no mem  you understand and mrs bunting looked up again and regarded parker calmly  precisely mem said parker with a face unmoved and so they came to the question of terms it all passed off most satisfactorily said mrs bunting taking a deep breath at the mere memory of that moment and it is clear that parker was quite of her opinion  she was not only discreet but really clever and handy from the very outset she grasped the situation unostentatiously but very firmly it was parker who contrived the sort of violin case for it and who made the tea gown extension that covered the cases arid contours it was parker who suggested an invalids chair for use indoors and in the garden and a carrying chair for the staircase hitherto fred bunting had been on hand at last even in excessive abundance whenever the sea lady lay in need of masculine arms but parker made it clear at once that that was not at all in accordance with her ideas and so earned the lifelong gratitude of mabel glendower and parker too spoke out for drives and suggested with an air of rightness that left nothing else to be done the hire of a carriage and pair for the seasonto the equal delight of the buntings and the sea lady it was parker who dictated the daily drive up to the eastern end of the leas and the sea ladys transfer and the manner of the sea ladys transfer to the bath chair in which she promenaded the leas there seemed to be nowhere that it was pleasant and proper for the sea lady to go that parker did not swiftly and correctly indicate it and the way to get to it and there seems to have been nothing that it was really undesirable the sea lady should do and anywhere that it was really undesirable that she should go that parker did not at once invisibly but effectively interpose a bar it was parker who released the sea lady from being a sort of private and peculiar property in the bunting household and carried her off to a becoming position in the world when the crisis came in little things as in great she failed not it was she who made it luminous that the sea ladys card plate was not yet engraved and printed miss doris thalassia waters was the pleasant and appropriate name with which the sea lady came primed and who replaced the box of the presumably dank and drowned and dripping tom by a jewel case a dressing bag and the first of the sea ladys trunks  on a thousand little occasions this parker showed a sense of propriety that was penetratingly fine for example in the shop one day when things of an intimate sort were being purchased she suddenly intervened  there are stockings mem she said in a discreet undertone behind but not too vulgarly behind a fluttering straight hand  stockings cried mrs bunting but  i think mem she should have stockings said parker quietly but very firmly  and come to think of it why should an unavoidable deficiency in a lady excuse one that can be avoided its there we touch the very quintessence and central principle of the proper life  but mrs bunting you know would never have seen it like that   iii  let me add here regretfully but with infinite respect one other thing about parker and then she shall drop into her proper place  i must confess with a slight tinge of humiliation that i pursued this young woman to her present situation at highton towersmaid she is to that eminent religious and social propagandist the lady jane glanville there were certain details of which i stood in need certain scenes and conversations of which my passion for verisimilitude had scarcely a crumb to go upon and from first to last what she must have seen and learnt and inferred would amount practically to everything  i put this to her frankly she made no pretence of not understanding me nor of ignorance of certain hidden things when i had finished she regarded me with a level regard  i couldnt think of it sir she said it wouldnt be at all according to my ideas  butit surely couldnt possibly hurt you now to tell me  im afraid i couldnt sir  it couldnt hurt anyone  it isnt that sir  i should see you didnt lose by it you know  she looked at me politely having said what she intended to say  and in spite of what became at last very fine and handsome inducements that remained the inflexible parkers reply even after i had come to an end with my finesse and attempted to bribe her in the grossest manner she displayed nothing but a becoming respect for my impregnable social superiority  i couldnt think of it sir she repeated it wouldnt be at all according to my ideas  and if in the end you should find this story to any extent vague or incomplete i trust you will remember how the inflexible severity of parkers ideas stood in my way     chapter the fifth  the absence and return of mr harry chatteris   i  these digressions about parker and the journalists have certainly led me astray from the story a little you will however understand that while the rising young journalist was still in pursuit of information hope and banghurst and parker merely a budding perfection the carriage not even thought of things were already developing in that bright little establishment beneath the evergreen oaks on the folkestone riviera so soon as the minds of the buntings ceased to be altogether focused upon this new and amazing social addition theyof all peoplehad most indisputably discovered it became at first faintly and then very clearly evident that their own simple pleasure in the possession of a guest so beautiful as miss waters so solidly wealthy andin a mannerso distinguished was not entirely shared by the two young ladies who were to have been their principal guests for the season  this little rift was perceptible the very first time mrs bunting had an opportunity of talking over her new arrangements with miss glendower  and is she really going to stay with you all the summer said adeline  surely dear you dont mind  it takes me a little by surprise  shes asked me my dear  im thinking of harry if the general election comes on in septemberand every one seems to think it will you promised you would let us inundate you with electioneering  but do you think she  she will be dreadfully in the way  she added after an interval she stops my working  but my dear  shes out of harmony said adeline  mrs bunting looked out of her window at the tamarisk and the sea im sure i wouldnt do anything to hurt harrys prospects you know how enthusiastic we all are randolph would do anything but are you sure she will be in the way  what else can she be  she might help even  oh help  she might canvass shes very attractive you know dear  not to me said miss glendower i dont trust her  but to some people and as harry says at election times every one who can do anything must be let do it cut themdo anything afterwards but at the timeyou know he talked of it when mr fison and he were here if you left electioneering only to the really nice people  it was mr fison said that not harry and besides she wouldnt help  i think you misjudge her there dear she has been asking  to help  yes and all about it said mrs bunting with a transient pink she keeps asking questions about why we are having the election and what it is all about and why harry is a candidate and all that she wants to go into it quite deeply i cant answer half the things she asks  and thats why she keeps up those long conversations with mr melville i suppose and why fred goes about neglecting mabel  my dear said mrs bunting  i wouldnt have her canvassing with us for anything said miss glendower shed spoil everything she is frivolous and satirical she looks at you with incredulous eyes she seems to blight all ones earnestness i dont think you quite understand dear mrs bunting what this election and my studies mean to meand harry she comes across all thatlike a contradiction  surely my dear ive never heard her contradict  oh she doesnt contradict but she there is something about her one feels that things that are most important and vital are nothing to her dont you feel it she comes from another world to us  mrs bunting remained judicial adeline dropped to a lower key again i think she said anyhow that were taking her very easily how do we know what she is down there out there she may be anything she may have had excellent reasons for coming to land  my dear cried mrs bunting is that charity  how do they live  if she hadnt lived nicely im sure she couldnt behave so nicely  besidescoming here she had no invitation  ive invited her now said mrs bunting gently  you could hardly help yourself i only hope your kindness  its not a kindness said mrs bunting its a duty if she were only half as charming as she is you seem to forgether voice droppedwhat it is she comes for  thats what i want to know  im sure in these days with so much materialism about and such wickedness everywhere when everybody who has a soul seems trying to lose it to find any one who hadnt a soul and who is trying to find one  but is she trying to get one  mr flange comes twice every week he would come oftener as you know if there wasnt so much confirmation about  and when he comes he sits and touches her hand if he can and he talks in his lowest voice and she sits and smilesshe almost laughs outright at the things he says  because he has to win his way with her surely mr flange may do what he can to make religion attractive  i dont believe she believes she will get a soul i dont believe she wants one a bit  she turned towards the door as if she had done  mrs buntings pink was now permanent she had brought up a son and two daughters and besides she had brought down a husband to my dear how was i to know and when it was necessary to be firmeven with adeline glendowershe knew how to be firm just as well as anybody  my dear she began in her very firmest quiet manner i am positive you misjudge miss waters trivial she may beon the surface at any rate perhaps she laughs and makes fun a little there are different ways of looking at things but i am sure that at bottom she is just as serious just as grave asany one you judge her hastily i am sure if you knew her betteras i do  mrs bunting left an eloquent pause  miss glendower had two little pink flushes in her cheeks she turned with her hand on the door  at any rate she said i am sure that harry will agree with me that she can be no help to our cause we have our work to do and it is something more than just vulgar electioneering we have to develop and establish ideas harry has views that are new and widereaching we want to put our whole strength into this work now especially and her presence  she paused for a moment it is a digression she divides things she puts it all wrong she has a way of concentrating attention about herself she alters the values of things she prevents my being singleminded she will prevent harry being singleminded  i think my dear that you might trust my judgment a little said mrs bunting and paused  miss glendower opened her mouth and shut it again without speaking it became evident finality was attained nothing remained to be said but the regrettable  the door opened and closed smartly and mrs bunting was alone  within an hour they all met at the luncheon table and adelines behaviour to the sea lady and to mrs bunting was as pleasant and alert as any highly earnest and intellectual young ladys could be and all that mrs bunting said and did tended with what people call infinite tactwhich really you know means a great deal more tact than is comfortableto develop and expose the more serious aspect of the sea ladys mind mr bunting was unusually talkative and told them all about a glorious project he had just heard of to cut out the rather shrubby and weedy front of the leas and stick in something between a wine vault and the crystal palace as a winter gardenwhich seemed to him a very excellent idea indeed   ii  it is time now to give some impression of the imminent chatteris who for all his late appearance is really the chief human being in my cousin melvilles story it happens that i met him with some frequency in my university days and afterwards ever and again i came upon him he was rather a brilliant man at the university smart without being vulgar and clever for all that he was remarkably goodlooking from the very onset of his manhood and without being in any way a showy spendthrift was quite magnificently extravagant there was trouble in his last year something hushed up about a girl or woman in london but his family had it all over with him and his uncle the earl of beechcroft settled some of his bills not allfor the family is commendably free from sentimental excessesbut enough to make him comfortable again the family is not a rich one and it further abounds in an extraordinary quantity of rather frowsy loosetongued auntsi never knew a family quite so rich in old aunts but chatteris was so goodlooking easymannered and clever that they seemed to agree almost without discussion to pull him through they hunted about for something that would be really remunerative without being laborious or too commercial and meanwhileafter the extraordinary craving of his aunt lady poynting mallow to see him acting had been overcome by the united efforts of the more religious section of his auntschatteris set himself seriously to the higher journalismthat is to say the journalism that dines anywhere gets political tips after dinner and is always acceptableif only to avoid thirteen articlesin a halfcrown review in addition he wrote some very passable verse and edited jane austen for the only publisher who had not already reprinted the works of that classic lady  his verse like himself was shapely and handsome and like his face it suggested to the penetrating eye certain reservations and indecisions there was just that touch of refinement that is weakness in the public man but as yet he was not a public man he was known to be energetic and his work was gathering attention as always capable and occasionally brilliant his aunts declared he was ripening that any defect in vigour he displayed was the incompleteness of the process and decided he should go to america where vigour and vigorous opportunities abound and there i gather he came upon something like a failure something happened indeed quite a lot happened he came back unmarriedand viâ the south seas australasia and india and lady poynting mallow publicly told him he was a fool when he got back  what happened in america even if one does not consult contemporary american papers is still very difficult to determine there appear to have been the daughter of a millionaire and something like an engagement in the story according to the new york yell one of the smartest crispest and altogether most representative papers in america there was also the daughter of some one else whom the yell interviewed or professed to interview under the heading                     an aristocratic britisher                           trifles with                       a pure american girl                    interview with the victim                              of his                         heartless levity   but this some one else was i am inclined to think in spite of her excellently executed portrait merely a brilliant stroke of modern journalism the yell having got wind of the sudden retreat of chatteris and inventing a reason in preference to discovering one wensleydale tells me the true impetus to bolt was the merest trifle the daughter of the millionaire being a bright and spirited girl had undergone interviewing on the subject of her approaching marriage on marriage in general on social questions of various sorts and on the relations of the british and american peoples and he seems to have found the thing in his morning paper it took him suddenly and he lost his head and once he started he seems to have lacked the power of mind to turn about and come back the affair was a mess the family paid some more of his bills and shirked others and chatteris turned up in london again after a time with somewhat diminished glory and a series of letters on imperial affairs each headed with the quotation what do they know of england who only england know  of course people of england learnt nothing of the real circumstances of the case but it was fairly obvious that he had gone to america and come back emptyhanded  and that was how in the course of some years he came to adeline glendower of whose special gifts as his helper and inspiration you have already heard from mrs bunting when he became engaged to her the family which had long craved to forgive himlady poynting mallow as a matter of fact had done sobrightened wonderfully and after considerable obscure activities he declared himself a philanthropic liberal with open spaces in his platform and in a position and ready as a beginning to try the quality of the conservative south  he was away making certain decisive arrangements in paris and elsewhere at the time of the landing of the sea lady before the matter was finally settled it was necessary that something should be said to a certain great public character and then he was to return and tell adeline and every one was expecting him daily including it is now indisputable the sea lady   iii  the meeting of miss glendower and her affianced lover on his return from paris was one of those scenes in this story for which i have scarcely an inkling of the true details he came to folkestone and stopped at the métropole the bunting house being full and the métropole being the nearest hotel to sandgate and he walked down in the afternoon and asked for adeline which was pretty rather than correct i gather that they met in the drawingroom and as chatteris closed the door behind him i imagine there was something in the nature of a caress  i must confess i envy the freedom of the novelist who can take you behind such a locked door as this and give you all that such persons say and do but with the strongest will in the world to blend the little scraps of fact i have into a continuous sequence of events i falter at this occasion after all i never saw adeline at all until after all these things were over and what is she now a rather tall a rather restless and active woman very keen and obvious in public affairswith something gone out of her melville once saw a gleam of that but for the most part melville never liked her she had a wider grasp of things than he and he was a little afraid of her she was in some inexplicable way neither a pretty woman nor a dear lady nor a grande dame nor totally insignificant and a heretic therefore in melvilles scheme of things he gives me small material for that earlier adeline she posed he says she was political and she was always reading mrs humphry ward  the last melville regarded as the most heinous offence it is not the least of my cousins weaknesses that he regards this great novelist as an extremely corrupting influence for intelligent girls she makes them good and serious in the wrong way he says adeline he asserts was absolutely built on her she was always attempting to be the incarnation of marcella it was he who had perverted mrs buntings mind to adopt this fancy but i dont believe for a moment in this idea of girls building themselves on heroines in fiction these are matters of elective affinity and unless some bullying critic or preacher sends us astray we take each to our own novelist as the souls in the swedenborgian system take to their hells adeline took to the imaginary marcella there was melville says the strongest likeness in their mental atmosphere they had the same defects a bias for superiorityto use his expressive phrasethe same disposition towards arrogant benevolence that same obtuseness to little shades of feeling that leads people to speak habitually of the lower classes and to think in the vein of that phrase they certainly had the same virtues a conscious and conscientious integrity a hard nobility without one touch of magic an industrious thoroughness more than in anything else adeline delighted in her novelists thoroughness her freedom from impressionism the patient resolution with which she went into the corners and swept under the mat of every incident and it would be easy to argue from that that adeline behaved as mrs wards most characteristic heroine behaved on an analogous occasion  marcella we knowat least after her heart was changedwould have clung to him there would have been a moment of high emotion in which thoughtsof the highest classmingled with the natural ambition of two people in the prime of life and power then she would have receded with a quick movement and listened with her beautiful hand pensive against her cheek while chatteris began to sum up the forces against himto speculate on the action of this group and that something infinitely tender and maternal would have spoken in her pledging her to the utmost help that love and a woman can give she would have produced in chatteris that exquisite mingled impression of grace passion selfyielding which in all its infinite variations and repetitions made up for him the constant poem of her beauty  but that is the dream and not the reality so adeline might have dreamt of behaving butshe was not marcella and only wanting to be and he was not only not maxwell but he had no intention of being maxwell anyhow if he had had an opportunity of becoming maxwell he would probably have rejected it with extreme incivility so they met like two unheroic human beings with shy and clumsy movements and i suppose fairly honest eyes something there was in the nature of a caress i believe and then i incline to fancy she said well and i think he must have answered its all right after that and rather allusively with a backward jerk of the head at intervals as it were towards the great personage chatteris must have told her particulars he must have told her that he was going to contest hythe and that the little difficulty with the glasgow commission agent who wanted to run the radical ticket as a man of kent had been settled without injury to the party such as it is assuredly they talked politics because soon after when they came into the garden side by side to where mrs bunting and the sea lady sat watching the girls play croquet adeline was in full possession of all these facts i fancy that for such a couple as they were such intimation of success such earnest topics replaced to a certain extent at any rate the vain repetition of vulgar endearments  the sea lady appears to have been the first to see them here he is she said abruptly  whom said mrs bunting glancing up at eyes that were suddenly eager and then following their glance towards chatteris  your other son said the sea lady jesting unheeded  its harry and adeline cried mrs bunting dont they make a handsome couple  but the sea lady made no reply and leaned back scrutinising their advance certainly they made a handsome pair coming out of the veranda into the blaze of the sun and across the trim lawn towards the shadow of the ilex trees they were lit as it were with a more glorious limelight and displayed like actors on a stage more spacious than the stage of any theatre the figure of chatteris must have come out tall and fair and broad a little sunburnt and i gather even then a little preoccupied as indeed he always seemed to be in those latter days and beside him adeline glancing now up at him and now towards the audience under the trees dark and a little flushed rather tallthough not so tall as marcella seems to have beenand you know without any instructions from any novelwriter in the world glad  chatteris did not discover that there was any one but buntings under the tree until he was close at hand then the abrupt discovery of this stranger seems to have checked whatever he was prepared to say for his début and adeline took the centre of the stage mrs bunting was standing up and all the croquet playersexcept mabel who was winningconverged on chatteris with cries of welcome mabel remained in the midst of what i understand is called a teaparty loudly demanding that they should see her play it out no doubt if everything had gone well she would have given a most edifying exhibition of what croquet can sometimes be  adeline swam forward to mrs bunting and cried with a note of triumph in her voice it is all settled everything is settled he has won them all and he is to contest hythe  quite involuntarily her eyes must have met the sea ladys  it is of course quite impossible to say what she found thereor indeed what there was to find there then for a moment they faced riddles and then the sea lady turned her eyes with a long deferred scrutiny to the mans face which she probably saw now closely for the first time one wonders whether it is just possible that there may have been something if it were no more than a gleam of surprise and enquiry in that meeting of their eyes just for a moment she held his regard and then it shifted enquiringly to mrs bunting  that lady intervened effusively with an oh i forgot and introduced them i think they went through that without another meeting of the foils of their regard  you back said fred to chatteris touching his arm and chatteris confirmed this happy guess  the bunting girls seemed to welcome adelines enviable situation rather than chatteris as an individual and mabels voice could be heard approaching oughtnt they to see me play it out mr chatteris  hullo harry my boy cried mr bunting who was cultivating a bluff manner hows paris  hows the fishing said harry  and so they came into a vague circle about this lively person who had won them allexcept parker of course who remained in her own proper place and was i am certain never to be won by anybody  there was a handing and shifting of garden chairs  no one seemed to take the slightest notice of adelines dramatic announcement the buntings were not good at thinking of things to say she stood in the midst of the group like a leading lady when the other actors have forgotten their parts then every one woke up to this as it were and they went off in a volley so its really all settled said mrs bunting and betty bunting said there is to be an election then and nettie said what fun mr bunting remarked with a knowing air so you saw him then and fred flung hooray into the tangle of sounds  the sea lady of course said nothing  well give em a jolly good fight for it anyhow said mr bunting  well i hope we shall do that said chatteris  we shall do more than that said adeline  oh yes said betty bunting we shall  i knew they would let him said adeline  if they had any sense said mr bunting  then came a pause and mr bunting was emboldened to lift up his voice and utter politics they are getting sense he said they are learning that a party must have men men of birth and training money and the mobtheyve tried to keep things going by playing to fads and class jealousies and the irish and theyve had their lesson how whyweve stood aside weve left em to faddists and fomentersand the irish and here they are its a revolution in the party weve let it down now we must pick it up again  he made a gesture with his fat little hand one of those fat pink little hands that appear to have neither flesh nor bones inside them but only sawdust or horsehair mrs bunting leaned back in her chair and smiled at him indulgently  it is no common election said mr bunting it is a great issue  the sea lady had been regarding him thoughtfully what is a great issue she asked i dont quite understand  mr bunting spread himself to explain to her this he said to begin with adeline listened with a mingling of interest and impatience attempting ever and again to suppress him and to involve chatteris by a tactful interposition but chatteris appeared disinclined to be involved he seemed indeed quite interested in mr buntings view of the case  presently the croquet quartette went backat mabels suggestionto their game and the others continued their political talk it became more personal at last dealing soon quite specifically with all that chatteris was doing and more particularly all that chatteris was to do mrs bunting suddenly suppressed mr bunting as he was offering advice and adeline took the burden of the talk again she indicated vast purposes this election is merely the opening of a door she said when chatteris made modest disavowals she smiled with a proud and happy consciousness of what she meant to make of him  and mrs bunting supplied footnotes to make it all clear to the sea lady hes so modest she said at one point and chatteris pretended not to hear and went rather pink ever and again he attempted to deflect the talk towards the sea lady and away from himself but he was hampered by his ignorance of her position  and the sea lady said scarcely anything but watched chatteris and adeline and more particularly chatteris in relation to adeline     chapter the sixth  symptomatic   i  my cousin melville is never very clear about his dates now this is greatly to be regretted because it would be very illuminating indeed if one could tell just how many days elapsed before he came upon chatteris in intimate conversation with the sea lady he was going along the front of the leas with some books from the public library that miss glendower had suddenly wished to consult and which she with that entire ignorance of his lack of admiration for her which was part of her want of charm for him had bidden him bring her it was in one of those sheltered paths just under the brow which give such a pleasant and characteristic charm to folkestone that he came upon a little group about the sea ladys bath chair chatteris was seated in one of the wooden seats that are embedded in the bank and was leaning forward and looking into the sea ladys face and she was speaking with a smile that struck melville even at the time as being a little special in its qualityand she seems to have been capable of many charming smiles parker was a little distance away where a sort of bastion projects and gives a wide view of the pier and harbour and the coast of france regarding it all with a qualified disfavour and the bath chairman was crumpled up against the bank lost in that wistful melancholy that the constant perambulation of broken humanity necessarily engenders  illustration a little group about the sea ladys bath chair  my cousin slackened his pace a little and came up and joined them the conversation hung at his approach chatteris sat back a little but there seemed no resentment and he sought a topic for the three to discuss in the books melville carried  books he said  for miss glendower said melville  oh said chatteris  what are they about asked the sea lady  land tenure said melville  thats hardly my subject said the sea lady and chatteris joined in her smile as if he saw a jest  there was a little pause  you are contesting hythe said melville  fate points that way said chatteris  they threaten a dissolution for september  it will come in a month said chatteris with the inimitable tone of one who knows  in that case we shall soon be busy  and i may canvass said the sea lady i never have  miss waters explained chatteris has been telling me she means to help us he met melvilles eye frankly  its rough work miss waters said melville  i dont mind that its fun and i want to help i really do want to helpmr chatteris  you know thats encouraging  i could go around with you in my bath chair  it would be a picnic said chatteris  i mean to help anyhow said the sea lady  you know the case for the plaintiff asked melville  she looked at him  youve got your arguments  i shall ask them to vote for mr chatteris and afterwards when i see them i shall remember them and smile and wave my hand what else is there  nothing said chatteris and shut the lid on melville i wish i had an argument as good  what sort of people are they here asked melville isnt there a smuggling interest to conciliate  i havent asked that said chatteris smuggling is over and past you know forty years ago it always has been forty years ago they trotted out the last of the smugglersinteresting old man full of reminiscenceswhen there was a count of the saxon shore he remembered smugglingforty years ago really i doubt if there ever was any smuggling the existing coast guard is a sacrifice to a vain superstition  why cried the sea lady only about five weeks ago i saw quite near here  she stopped abruptly and caught melvilles eye he grasped her difficulty  in a paper he suggested  yes in a paper she said seizing the rope he threw her  well asked chatteris  there is smuggling still said the sea lady with an air of some one who decides not to tell an anecdote that is suddenly found to be half forgotten  theres no doubt it happens said chatteris missing it all but it doesnt appear in the electioneering i certainly shant agitate for a faster revenue cutter however things may be in that respect i take the line that they are very well as they are thats my line of course and he looked out to sea the eyes of melville and the sea lady had an intimate moment  there you know is just a specimen of the sort of thing we do said chatteris are you prepared to be as intricate as that  quite said the sea lady  my cousin was reminded of an anecdote  the talk degenerated into anecdotes of canvassing and ran shallow my cousin was just gathering that mrs bunting and miss bunting had been with the sea lady and had gone into the town to a shop when they returned chatteris rose to greet them and explainedwhat had been by no means apparent beforethat he was on his way to adeline and after a few further trivialities he and melville went on together  a brief silence fell between them  who is that miss waters asked chatteris  friend of mrs bunting prevaricated melville  so i gather she seems a very charming person  she is  shes interesting her illness seems to throw her up it makes a passive thing of her like a picture or something thatsimaginary imaginedanyhow she sits there and smiles and responds her eyeshave something intimate and yet  my cousin offered no assistance  where did mrs bunting find her  my cousin had to gather himself together for a second or so  theres something he said deliberately that mrs bunting doesnt seem disposed  what can it be  its bound to be all right said melville rather weakly  its strange too mrs bunting is usually so disposed  melville left that to itself  thats what one feels said chatteris  what  mystery  my cousin shares with me a profound detestation of that high mystic method of treating women he likes women to be finiteand nice in fact he likes everything to be finiteand nice so he merely grunted  but chatteris was not to be stopped by that he passed to a critical note no doubt its all illusion all women are impressionists a patch a light you get an effect and that is all you are meant to get i suppose she gets an effect but howthats the mystery its not merely beauty theres plenty of beauty in the world but not of these effects the eyes i fancy  he dwelt on that for a moment  theres really nothing in eyes you know chatteris said my cousin melville borrowing an alien argument and a tone of analytical cynicism from me have you ever looked at eyes through a hole in a sheet  oh i dont know said chatteris i dont mean the mere physical eye perhaps its the look of healthand the bath chair a bold discord you dont know whats the matter melville  how  i gather from bunting its a disablementnot a deformity  he ought to know  im not so sure of that you dont happen to know the nature of her disablement  i cant tell at all said melville in a speculative tone it struck him he was getting to prevaricate better  the subject seemed exhausted they spoke of a common friend whom the sight of the métropole suggested then they did not talk at all for a time until the stir and interest of the band stand was passed then chatteris threw out a thought  complex businessfeminine motives he remarked  how  this canvassing she cant be interested in philanthropic liberalism  theres a difference in the type and besides its a personal matter  not necessarily is it surely theres not such an intellectual gap between the sexes if you can get interested  oh i know  besides its not a question of principles its the fun of electioneering  fun  theres no knowing what wont interest the feminine mind said melville and added or what will  chatteris did not answer  its the district visiting instinct i suppose said melville they all have it its the canvassing all women like to go into houses that dont belong to them  very likely said chatteris shortly and failing a reply from melville he gave way to secret meditations it would seem still of a fairly agreeable sort  the twelve oclock gun thudded from shornecliffe camp  by jove said chatteris and quickened his steps                                                they found adeline busy amidst her papers as they entered she pointed reproachfully yet with the protrusion of a certain marcellalike undertone of sweetness at the clock the apologies of chatteris were effusive and winning and involved no mention of the sea lady on the leas  melville delivered his books and left them already wading deeply into the details of the district organisation that the local liberal organiser had submitted   ii  a little while after the return of chatteris my cousin melville and the sea lady were under the ilex at the end of the sea garden anddisregarding parker as every one was accustomed to do who was in a garden chair doing some afternoon work at a proper distancethere was nobody with them at all fred and the girls were out cyclingfred had gone with them at the sea ladys requestand miss glendower and mrs bunting were at hythe calling diplomatically on some rather horrid local people who might be serviceable to harry in his electioneering  mr bunting was out fishing he was not fond of fishing but he was in many respects an exceptionally resolute little man and he had taken to fishing every day in the afternoon after luncheon in order to break himself of what mrs bunting called his ridiculous habit of getting seasick whenever he went out in a boat he said that if fishing from a boat with pieces of mussels for bait after luncheon would not break the habit nothing would and certainly it seemed at times as if it were going to break everything that was in him but the habit escaped this however is a digression  these two i say were sitting in the ample shade under the evergreen oak and melville i imagine was in those fine faintly patterned flannels that in the year 1899 combined correctness with ease he was no doubt looking at the shaded face of the sea lady framed in a frame of sunlit yellowgreen lawn and blackgreen ilex leavesat least so my impulse for verisimilitude conceives itand she at first was pensive and downcast that afternoon and afterwards she was interested and looked into his eyes either she must have suggested that he might smoke or else he asked anyhow his cigarettes were produced she looked at them with an arrested gesture and he hung for a moment doubtful on her gesture  i suppose you he said  i never learned  he glanced at parker and then met the sea ladys regard  its one of the things i came for she said  he took the only course  she accepted a cigarette and examined it thoughtfully down there she said its just one of the things you will understand we get nothing but saturated tobacco some of the mermen theres something they have picked up from the sailors quids i think they call it but thats too horrid for words  she dismissed the unpleasant topic by a movement and lapsed into thought  my cousin clicked his matchbox  she had a momentary doubt and glanced towards the house mrs bunting she asked several times i understand she asked the same thing  she wouldnt mind said melville and stopped  she wont think it improper he amplified if nobody else thinks it improper  theres nobody else said the sea lady glancing at parker and my cousin lit the match  my cousin has an indirect habit of mind with all general and all personal things his desperation to get at them obliquely amounts almost to a passion he could no more go straight to a crisis than a cat could to a stranger he came off at a tangent now as he was sitting forward and scrutinising her first very creditable efforts to draw i just wonder he said exactly what it was you did come for  she smiled at him over a little jet of smoke why this she said  and hairdressing  and dressing  she smiled again after a momentary hesitation and all this sort of thing she said as if she felt she had answered him perhaps a little below his deserts her gesture indicated the house and the lawn andmy cousin melville wondered just exactly how much else  am i doing it right asked the sea lady  beautifully said my cousin with a faint sigh in his voice what do you think of it  it was worth coming for said the sea lady smiling into his eyes  but did you really just come  she filled in his gap to see what life was like on land here isnt that enough  melvilles cigarette had failed to light he regarded its blighted career pensively  life he said isnt allthis sort of thing  this sort of thing  sunlight cigarette smoking talk looking nice  but its made up  not altogether  for example  oh you know  what  you know said melville and would not look at her  i decline to know she said after a little pause  besides he said  yes  you told mrs bunting it occurred to him that he was telling tales but that scruple came too late  well  something about a soul  she made no immediate answer he looked up and her eyes were smiling mr melville she said innocently what is a soul  well said my cousin readily and then paused for a space a soul said he and knocked an imaginary ash from his extinct cigarette  a soul he repeated and glanced at parker  a soul you know he said again and looked at the sea lady with the air of a man who is handling a difficult matter with skilful care  come to think of it he said its a rather complicated matter to explain  to a being without one  to any one said my cousin melville suddenly admitting his difficulty  he meditated upon her eyes for a moment  besides he said you know what a soul is perfectly well  no she answered i dont  you know as well as i do  ah that may be different  you came to get a soul  perhaps i dont want one whyif one hasnt one  ah there and my cousin shrugged his shoulders but really you know its just the generality of it that makes it hard to define  everybody has a soul  every one  except me  im not certain of that  mrs bunting  certainly  and mr bunting  every one  has miss glendower  lots  the sea lady mused she went off at a tangent abruptly  mr melville she said what is a union of souls  melville flicked his extinct cigarette suddenly into an elbow shape and then threw it away the phrase may have awakened some reminiscence its an extra he said its a sort of flourish and sometimes its like leaving cards by footmena substitute for the real presence  there came a gap he remained downcast trying to find a way towards whatever it was that was in his mind to say conceivably he did not clearly know what that might be until he came to it the sea lady abandoned an attempt to understand him in favour of a more urgent topic  do you think miss glendower and mr chatteris  melville looked up at her he noticed she had hung on the latter name decidedly he said its just what they would do  then he spoke again chatteris he said  yes said she  i thought so said melville  the sea lady regarded him gravely they scrutinised each other with an unprecedented intimacy melville was suddenly direct it was a discovery that it seemed he ought to have made all along he felt quite unaccountably bitter he spoke with a twitch of the mouth and his voice had a note of accusation you want to talk about him  she noddedstill grave  well i dont he changed his note but i will if you wish it  i thought you would  oh you know said melville discovering his extinct cigarette was within reach of a vindictive heel  she said nothing  well said melville  i saw him first she apologised some years ago  where  in the south seasnear tonga  and that is really what you came for  this time her manner was convincing she admitted yes  melville was carefully impartial hes sightly he admitted and wellbuilt and a decent chapa decent chap but i dont see why you  he went off at a tangent he didnt see you  oh no  melvilles pose and tone suggested a mind of extreme liberality i dont see why you came he said nor what you mean to do you seewith an air of noting a trifling but valid obstacletheres miss glendower  is there she said  well isnt there  thats just it she said  and besides after all you know why should you  i admit its unreasonable she said but why reason about it its a matter of the imagination  for him  how should i know how it takes him that is what i want to know  melville looked her in the eyes again you know youre not playing fair he said  to her  to any one  why  because you are immortaland unincumbered because you can do everything you want to doand we cannot i dont know why we cannot but we cannot here we are with our short lives and our little souls to save or lose fussing for our little concerns and you out of the elements come and beckon  the elements have their rights she said and then the elements are the elements you know that is what you forget  imagination  certainly thats the element those elements of your chemists  yes  are all imagination there isnt any other she went on and all the elements of your life the life you imagine you are living the little things you must do the little cares the extraordinary little duties the day by day the hypnotic limitationsall these things are a fancy that has taken hold of you too strongly for you to shake off you darent you mustnt you cant to us who watch you  you watch us  oh yes we watch you and sometimes we envy you not only for the dry air and the sunlight and the shadows of trees and the feeling of morning and the pleasantness of many such things but because your lives begin and endbecause you look towards an end  she reverted to her former topic but you are so limited so tied the little time you have you use so poorly you begin and you end and all the time between it is as if you were enchanted you are afraid to do this that would be delightful to do you must do that though you know all the time it is stupid and disagreeable just think of the thingseven the little thingsyou mustnt do up there on the leas in this hot weather all the people are sitting in stuffy ugly clothesever so much too much clothes hot tight boots you know when they have the most lovely pink feet some of themwe seeand they are all with little to talk about and nothing to look at and bound not to do all sorts of natural things and bound to do all sorts of preposterous things why are they bound why are they letting life slip by them just as if they wouldnt all of them presently be dead suppose you were to go up there in a bathing dress and a white cotton hat  it wouldnt be proper cried melville  why not  it would be outrageous  but any one may see you like that on the beach  thats different  it isnt different you dream its different and in just the same way you dream all the other things are proper or improper or good or bad to do because you are in a dream a fantastic unwholesome little dream so small so infinitely small i saw you the other day dreadfully worried by a spot of ink on your sleevealmost the whole afternoon  illustration why not  my cousin looked distressed she abandoned the inkspot  your life i tell you is a dreama dream and you cant wake out of it  and if so why do you tell me  she made no answer for a space  why do you tell me he insisted  he heard the rustle of her movement as she bent towards him  she came warmly close to him she spoke in gently confidential undertone as one who imparts a secret that is not to be too lightly given because she said there are better dreams   iii  for a moment it seemed to melville that he had been addressed by something quite other than the pleasant lady in the bath chair before him but how he began and stopped he remained silent with a perplexed face she leaned back and glanced away from him and when at last she turned and spoke again specific realities closed in on him once more  why shouldnt i she asked if i want to  shouldnt what  if i fancy chatteris  one might think of obstacles he reflected  hes not hers she said  in a way hes trying to be said melville  trying to be he has to be what he is nothing can make him hers if you werent dreaming you would see that my cousin was silent shes not real she went on shes a mass of fancies and vanities she gets everything out of books she gets herself out of a book you can see her doing it here what is she seeking what is she trying to do all this work all this political stuff of hers she talks of the condition of the poor what is the condition of the poor a dreary tossing on the bed of existence a perpetual fear of consequences that perpetually distresses them lives of anxiety they lead because they do not know what a dream the whole thing is suppose they were not anxious and afraid and what does she care for the condition of the poor after all it is only a point of departure in her dream in her heart she does not want their dreams to be happier in her heart she has no passion for them only her dream is that she should be prominently doing good asserting herself controlling their affairs amidst thanks and praise and blessings her dream of serious thingsa rout of phantoms pursuing a phantom ignis fatuusthe afterglow of a mirage vanity of vanities  its real enough to her  as real as she can make it you know but she isnt real herself she begins badly  and he you know  he doesnt believe in it  im not so sure  i amnow  hes a complicated being  he will ravel out said the sea lady  i think you misjudge him about that work of his anyhow said melville hes a man rather divided against himself he added abruptly we all are he recovered himself from the generality its vague i admit a sort of vague wish to do something decent you know that he has  a sort of vague wish she conceded but  he means well said melville clinging to his proposition  he means nothing only very dimly he suspects  yes  what you too are beginning to suspect that other things may be conceivable even if they are not possible that this life of yours is not everything that it is not to be taken too seriously because  there are better dreams  the song of the sirens was in her voice my cousin would not look at her face i know nothing of any other dreams he said one has oneself and this life and that is enough to manage what other dreams can there be anyhow we are in the dreamwe have to accept it besides you know thats going off the question we were talking of chatteris and why you have come for him why should you come why should any one outside comeinto this world  because we are permitted to comewe immortals and why if we choose to do so and taste this life that passes and continues as rain that falls to the ground why should we not do it why should we abstain  and chatteris  if he pleases me  he roused himself to a titanic effort against an oppression that was coming over him he tried to get the thing down to a definite small case an incident an affair of considerations but look here you know he said what precisely do you mean to do if you get him you dont seriously intend to keep up the game to that extent you dont meanpositively in our terrestrial fashion you knowto marry him  the sea lady laughed at his recovery of the practical tone well why not she asked  and go about in a bath chair and no thats not it what is it  he looked up into her eyes and it was like looking into deep water down in that deep there stirred impalpable things she smiled at him  no she said i shant marry him and go about in a bath chair and grow old as all earthly women must its the dust i think and the dryness of the air and the way you begin and end you burn too fast you flare and sink and die this life of yoursthe illnesses and the growing old when the skin wears shabby and the light is out of the hair and the teeth not even for love would i face it no but then you know her voice sank to a low whisper there are better dreams  what dreams rebelled melville what do you mean what are you what do you mean by coming into this lifeyou who pretend to be a womanand whispering whispering  to us who are in it to us who have no escape  but there is an escape said the sea lady  how  for some there is an escape when the whole life rushes to a moment and then she stopped now there is clearly no sense in this sentence to my mind even from a lady of an essentially imaginary sort who comes out of the sea how can a whole life rush to a moment but whatever it was she really did say there is no doubt she left it half unsaid  he glanced up at her abrupt pause and she was looking at the house                                                do  ris do  ris are you there it was mrs buntings voice floating athwart the lawn the voice of the ascendant present of invincibly sensible things the world grew real again to melville he seemed to wake up to start back from some delusive trance that crept upon him  he looked at the sea lady as if he were already incredulous of the things they had said as if he had been asleep and dreamed the talk some light seemed to go out some fancy faded his eye rested upon the inscription flamps bath chair proprietor just visible under her arm  weve got perhaps a little more serious than he said doubtfully and then what you have been sayingdid you exactly mean  the rustle of mrs buntings advance became audible and parker moved and coughed  he was quite sure they had been more serious than  another time perhaps  had all these things really been said or was he under some fantastic hallucination  he had a sudden thought wheres your cigarette he asked  but her cigarette had ended long ago  and what have you been talking about so long sang mrs bunting with an almost motherly hand on the back of melvilles chair  oh said melville at a loss for once and suddenly rising from his chair to face her and then to the sea lady with an artificially easy smile what have we been talking about  all sorts of things i dare say said mrs bunting in what might almost be called an arch manner and she honoured melville with a special smileone of those smiles that are morally almost winks  illustration the waiter retires amazed  my cousin caught all the archness full in the face and for four seconds he stared at mrs bunting in amazement he wanted breath then they all laughed together and mrs bunting sat down pleasantly and remarked quite audibly to herself as if i couldnt guess   iv  i gather that after this talk melville fell into an extraordinary net of doubting in the first place and what was most distressing he doubted whether this conversation could possibly have happened at all and if it had whether his memory had not played him some trick in modifying and intensifying the import of it all my cousin occasionally dreams conversations of so sober and probable a sort as to mingle quite perplexingly with his real experiences was this one of these occasions he found himself taking up and scrutinising as it were first this remembered sentence and then that had she really said this thing and quite in this way his memory of their conversation was never quite the same for two days together had she really and deliberately foreshadowed for chatteris some obscure and mystical submergence  what intensified and complicated his doubts most was the sea ladys subsequent serene freedom from allusion to anything that might or might not have passed she behaved just as she had always behaved neither an added intimacy nor that distance that follows indiscreet confidences appeared in her manner  and amidst this crop of questions arose presently quite a new set of doubts as if he were not already sufficiently equipped the sea lady alleged she had come to the world that lives on land for chatteris  and then  he had not hitherto looked ahead to see precisely what would happen to chatteris to miss glendower to the buntings or any one when as seemed highly probable chatteris was got there were other dreams there was another existence an elsewhereand chatteris was to go there so she said but it came into melvilles mind with a quite disproportionate force and vividness that once long ago he had seen a picture of a man and a mermaid rushing downward through deep water could it possibly be that sort of thing in the year eighteen hundred and ninetynine conceivably if she had said these things did she mean them and if she meant them and this definite campaign of capture was in hand what was an orderly saneliving welldressed bachelor of the world to do  look onuntil things ended in a catastrophe  one figures his face almost aged he appears to have hovered about the house on the sandgate riviera to a scandalous extent failing always to get a sufficiently long and intimate têteàtête with the sea lady to settle once for all his doubts as to what really had been said and what he had dreamed or fancied in their talk never had he been so exceedingly disturbed as he was by the twist this talk had taken never had his habitual pose of humorous acquiescence in life been quite so difficult to keep up he became positively absentminded you know if its like that its serious was the burden of his private mutterings his condition was palpable even to mrs bunting but she misunderstood his nature she said something finally and quite abruptly he set off to london in a state of frantic determination to get out of it all the sea lady wished him goodbye in mrs buntings presence as if there had never been anything unusual between them  i suppose one may contrive to understand something of his disturbance he had made quite considerable sacrifices to the world he had at great pains found his place and his way in it he had imagined he had really got the hang of it as people say and was having an interesting time and then you know to encounter a voice that subsequently insists upon haunting you with there are better dreams to hear a tale that threatens complications disasters broken hearts and not to have the faintest idea of the proper thing to do  but i do not think he would have bolted from sandgate until he had really got some more definite answer to the question what better dreams until he had surprised or forced some clearer illumination from the passive invalid if mrs bunting one morning had not very tactfully dropped a hint  you know mrs bunting and you can imagine what she tactfully hinted just at that time what with her own girls and the glendower girls her imagination was positively inflamed for matrimony she was a matrimonial fanatic she would have married anybody to anything just for the fun of doing it and the idea of pairing off poor melville to this mysterious immortal with a scaly tail seems to have appeared to her the most natural thing in the world  apropos of nothing whatever i fancy she remarked your opportunity is now mr melville  my opportunity cried melville trying madly not to understand in the face of her pink resolution  youve a monopoly now she cried but when we go back to london with her there will be ever so many people running after her  i fancy melville said something about carrying the thing too far he doesnt remember what he did say i dont think he even knew at the time  however he fled back to london in august and was there so miserably at loose ends that he had not the will to get out of the place on this passage in the story he does not dwell and such verisimilitude as may be must be supplied by my imagination i imagine him in his charmingly appointed flata flat that is light without being trivial and artistic with no want of dignity or sincerityfinding a loss of interest in his books a loss of beauty in the silver he not too vehemently collects i imagine him wandering into that dainty little bedroom of his and around into the dressingroom and there rapt in a blank contemplation of the sevenandtwenty pairs of trousers all creasing neatly in their proper stretchers that are necessary to his conception of a wise and happy man for every occasion he has learnt in a natural easy progress to knowledge the exquisitely appropriate pair of trousers the permissible upper garment the becoming gesture and word he was a man who had mastered his world and then you know the whisper  there are better dreams  what dreams i imagine him asking with a defensive note whatever transparence the world might have had whatever suggestion of something beyond there in the sea garden at sandgate i fancy that in melvilles apartments in london it was indisputably opaque  and damn it he cried if these dreams are for chatteris why should she tell me suppose i had the chance of them whatever they are  he reflected with a terrible sincerity in the nature of his will  no and then again no  and if one mustnt have em why should one know about em and be worried by them if she comes to do mischief why shouldnt she do mischief without making me an accomplice  he walks up and down and stops at last and stares out of his window on the jaded summer traffic going haymarket way  he sees nothing of that traffic he sees the little sea garden at sandgate and that little group of people very small and bright and somethingsomething hanging over them it isnt fair on themor meor anybody  then you know quite suddenly i imagine him swearing  i imagine him at his luncheon a meal he usually treats with a becoming gravity i imagine the waiter marking the kindly selfindulgence of his cleanshaven face and advancing with that air of intimate participation the good waiter shows to such as he esteems i figure the respectful pause the respectful enquiry  oh anything cries melville and the waiter retires amazed   v  to add to melvilles distress as petty discomforts do add to all genuine trouble his clubhouse was undergoing an operation and was full of builders and decorators they had gouged out its windows and gagged its hall with scaffolding and he and his like were guests of a stranger club that had several members who blew they seemed never to do anything but blow and sigh and rustle papers and go to sleep about the place they were like blightspots on the handsome plant of this hostclub and it counted for little with melville in the state he was in that all the fidgety breathers were persons of eminent position but it was this temporary dislocation of his world that brought him unexpectedly into a quasi confidential talk with chatteris one afternoon for chatteris was one of the less eminent and amorphous members of this club that was sheltering melvilles club  illustration they seemed never to do anything but blow and sigh and rustle papers  melville had taken up punchhe was in that mood when a man takes up anythingand was reading he did not know exactly what presently he sighed looked up and discovered chatteris entering the room  he was surprised to see chatteris startled and just faintly alarmed and chatteris it was evident was surprised and disconcerted to see him chatteris stood in as awkward an attitude as he was capable of staring unfavourably and for a moment or so he gave no sign of recognition then he nodded and came forward reluctantly his every movement suggested the will without the wit to escape you here he said  what are you doing away from hythe at this time asked melville  i came here to write a letter said chatteris  he looked about him rather helplessly then he sat down beside melville and demanded a cigarette suddenly he plunged into intimacy  it is doubtful whether i shall contest hythe he remarked  yes  yes  he lit his cigarette  would you he asked  not a bit of it said melville but then its not my line  is it mine  isnt it a little late in the day to drop it said melville youve been put up for it now every ones at work miss glendower  i know said chatteris  well  i dont seem to want to go on  my dear man  its a bit of overwork perhaps im off colour things have gone flat thats why im up here  he did a very absurd thing he threw away a quartersmoked cigarette and almost immediately demanded another  youve been a little immoderate with your statistics said melville  chatteris said something that struck melville as having somehow been said before election progress good of humanity public spirit none of these things interest me really he said at least not just now  melville waited  one gets brought up in an atmosphere in which its always being whispered that one should go for a career you learn it at your mothers knee they never give you time to find out what you really want they keep on shoving you at that they form your character they rule your mind they rush you into it  they didnt rush me said melville  they rushed me anyhow and here i am  you dont want a career  well look what it is  oh if you look at what things are  first of all the messing about to get into the house these confounded parties mean nothingabsolutely nothing they arent even decent factions you blither to damned committees of damned tradesmen whose sole idea for this world is to get overpaid for their selfrespect you whisper and hobnob with local solicitors and get yourself seen about with them you ask about the charities and institutions and lunch and chatter and chum with every conceivable form of human conceit and pushfulness and trickery  he broke off it isnt as if they were up to anything theyre working in their way just as you are working in your way its the same game with all of them they chase a phantom gratification they toil and quarrel and envy night and day in the perpetual attempt to persuade themselves in spite of everything that they are real and a success  he stopped and smoked  melville was spiteful yes he admitted but i thought your little movement was to be something more than party politics and selfadvancement  he left his sentence interrogatively incomplete  the condition of the poor he said  well said chatteris regarding him with a sort of stony admission in his blue eyes  melville dodged the look at sandgate he said there was you know a certain atmosphere of belief  i know said chatteris for the second time  thats the devil of it said chatteris after a pause  if i dont believe in the game im playing if im left high and dry on this shoal with the tide of belief gone past me it isnt my planning anyhow i know the decent thing i ought to do i mean to do it in the end i mean to do it im talking in this way to relieve my mind ive started the game and i must see it out ive put my hand to the plough and i mustnt go back thats why i came to londonto get it over with myself it was running up against you set me off you caught me at the crisis  ah said melville  but for all that the thing is as i saidnone of these things interest me really it wont alter the fact that i am committed to fight a phantom election about nothing in particular for a party thats been dead ten years and if the ghosts win go into the parliament as a constituent spectre there it isas a mental phenomenon  he reiterated his cardinal article the interest is dead he said the will has no soul  he became more critical he bent a little closer to melvilles ear it isnt really that i dont believe when i say i dont believe in these things i go too far i do i know the electioneering the intriguing is a means to an end there is work to be done sound work and important work only  melville turned an eye on him over his cigarette end  chatteris met it seemed for a moment to cling to it he became absurdly confidential he was evidently in the direst need of a confidential ear  i dont want to do it when i sit down to it square myself down in the chair you know and say now for the rest of my life this is itthis is your life chatteris there comes a sort of terror melville  hm said melville and turned away then he turned on chatteris with the air of a family physician and tapped his shoulder three times as he spoke youve had too much statistics chatteris he said  he let that soak in then he turned about towards his interlocutor and toyed with a club ash tray its every day has overtaken you he said you cant see the wood for the trees you forget the spacious design you are engaged upon in the heavy details of the moment you are like a painter who has been working hard upon something very small and exacting in a corner you want to step back and look at the whole thing  no said chatteris that isnt quite it  melville indicated that he knew better  i keep on stepping back and looking at it said chatteris just lately ive scarcely done anything else ill admit its a spacious and noble thingpolitical work done wellonly i admire it but it doesnt grip my imagination thats where the trouble comes in  what does grip your imagination asked melville he was absolutely certain the sea lady had been talking this paralysis into chatteris and he wanted to see just how far she had gone for example he tested are thereby any chanceother dreams  chatteris gave no sign at the phrase melville dismissed his suspicion what do you meanother dreams asked chatteris  is there conceivably another wayanother sort of lifesome other aspect  its out of the question said chatteris he added rather remarkably adelines awfully good  my cousin melville acquiesced silently in adelines goodness  all this you know is a mood my life is made for meand its a very good life its better than i deserve  heaps said melville  much said chatteris defiantly  ever so much endorsed melville  lets talk of other things said chatteris its what even the street boys call mawbid nowadays to doubt for a moment the absolute final allthisandnothingelseintheworldishness of whatever you happen to be doing  my cousin melville however could think of no other sufficiently interesting topic you left them all right at sandgate he asked after a pause  except little bunting  seedy  been fishing  of course breezes and the spring tides and miss waters  chatteris shot a suspicious glance at him he affected the offhand style shes quite well he said looks just as charming as ever  she really means that canvassing  shes spoken of it again  shell do a lot for you said melville and left a fine wide pause  chatteris assumed the tone of a man who gossips  who is this miss waters he asked  a very charming person said melville and said no more  chatteris waited and his pretence of airy gossip vanished he became very much in earnest  look here he said who is this miss waters  how should i know prevaricated melville  well you do know and the others know who is she  melville met his eyes wont they tell you he asked  thats just it said chatteris  why do you want to know  why shouldnt i know  theres a sort of promise to keep it dark  keep what dark  my cousin gestured  it cant be anything wrong my cousin made no sign  she may have had experiences  my cousin reflected a moment on the possibilities of the deepsea life she has had them he said  i dont care if she has  there came a pause  look here melville said chatteris i want to know this unless its a thing to be specially kept from me i dont like being among a lot of people who treat me as an outsider what is this something about miss waters  what does miss glendower say  vague things she doesnt like her and she wont say why and mrs bunting goes about with discretion written all over her and she herself looks at you and that maid of hers looks the things worrying me  why dont you ask the lady herself  how can i till i know what it is confound it im asking you plainly enough  well said melville and at the moment he had really decided to tell chatteris but he hung upon the manner of presentation he thought in the moment to say the truth is she is a mermaid then as instantly he perceived how incredible this would be he always suspected chatteris of a capacity for being continental and romantic the man might fly out at him for saying such a thing of a lady  a dreadful doubt fell upon melville as you know he had never seen that tail with his own eyes in these surroundings there came to him such an incredulity of the sea lady as he had not felt even when first mrs bunting told him of her all about him was an atmosphere of solid reality such as one can breathe only in a firstclass london club everywhere ponderous armchairs met the eye there were massive tables in abundance and matchboxes of solid rock the matches were of some specially large heavy sort on a ponderous elephantlegged green baize table near at hand were several copies of the times the current punch an inkpot of solid brass and a paper weight of lead there are other dreams it seemed impossible the breathing of an eminent person in a chair in the far corner became very distinct in that interval it was heavy and resolute like the sound of a stonemasons saw it insisted upon itself as the touchstone of reality it seemed to say that at the first whisper of a thing so utterly improbable as a mermaid it would snort and choke  you wouldnt believe me if i told you said melville  well tell meanyhow  my cousin looked at an empty chair beside him it was evidently stuffed with the very best horsehair that money could procure stuffed with infinite skill and an almost religious care it preached in the open invitation of its expanded arms that man does not live by bread aloneinasmuch as afterwards he needs a nap an utterly dreamless chair  mermaids  he felt that he was after all quite possibly the victim of a foolish delusion hypnotised by mrs buntings beliefs was there not some more plausible interpretation some phrase that would lie out bridgeways from the plausible to the truth  its no good he groaned at last  chatteris had been watching him furtively  oh i dont care a hang he said and shied his second cigarette into the massively decorated fireplace its no affair of mine  then quite abruptly he sprang to his feet and gesticulated with an ineffectual hand  you neednt he said and seemed to intend to say many regrettable things meanwhile until his intention ripened he sawed the air with his ineffectual hand i fancy he ended by failing to find a thing sufficiently regrettable to express the pungency of the moment he flung about and went towards the door  dont he said to the back of the newspaper of the breathing member  if you dont want to he said to the respectful waiter at the door  the hallporter heard that he didnt carehe was damned if he did  he might be one of these here guests said the hallporter greatly shocked thats what comes of lettin em in so young   vi  melville overcame an impulse to follow him  confound the fellow said he  and then as the whole outburst came into focus he said with still more emphasis confound the fellow  he stood up and became aware that the member who had been asleep was now regarding him with malevolent eyes he perceived it was a hard and invincible malevolence and that no petty apologetics of demeanour could avail against it he turned about and went towards the door  the interview had done my cousin good his misery and distress had lifted he was presently bathed in a profound moral indignation and that is the very antithesis of doubt and unhappiness the more he thought it over the more his indignation with chatteris grew that sudden unreasonable outbreak altered all the perspectives of the case he wished very much that he could meet chatteris again and discuss the whole matter from a new footing  think of it he thought so vividly and so verbally that he was nearly talking to himself as he went along it shaped itself into an outspoken discourse in his mind  was there ever a more ungracious ungrateful unreasonable creature than this same chatteris he was the spoiled child of fortune things came to him things were given to him his very blunders brought more to him than other mens successes out of every thousand men nine hundred and ninetynine might well find food for envy in this way luck had served him many a one has toiled all his life and taken at last gratefully the merest fraction of all that had thrust itself upon this insatiable thankless young man even i thought my cousin might envy himin several ways and then at the mere first onset of duty nayat the mere first whisper of restraint this insubordination this protest and flight  think urged my cousin of the common lot of men think of the many who suffer from hunger  it was a painful socialistic sort of line to take but in his mood of moral indignation my cousin pursued it relentlessly  think of many who suffer from hunger who lead lives of unremitting toil who go fearful who go squalid and withal strive in a sort of dumb resolute way their utmost to do their duty or at any rate what they think to be their duty think of the chaste poor women in the world think again of the many honest souls who aspire to the service of their kind and are so hemmed about and preoccupied that they may not give it and then this pitiful creature comes with his mental gifts his gifts of position and opportunity the stimulus of great ideas and a fiancée who is not only rich and beautifulshe is beautifulbut also the best of all possible helpers for him and he turns away it isnt good enough it takes no hold upon his imagination if you please it isnt beautiful enough for him and thats the plain truth of the matter what does the man want what does he expect  my cousins moral indignation took him the whole length of piccadilly and along by rotten row and along the flowery garden walks almost into kensington high street and so around by the serpentine to his home and it gave him such an appetite for dinner as he had not had for many days life was bright for him all that evening and he sat down at last at two oclock in the morning before a needlessly lit delightfully fusillading fire in his flat to smoke one sound cigar before he went to bed  no he said suddenly i am not mawbid either i take the gifts the gods will give me i try to make myself happy and a few other people happy too to do a few little duties decently and that is enough for me i dont look too deeply into things and i dont look too widely about things a few old simple ideals  hm  chatteris is a dreamer with an impossible extravagant discontent what does he dream of three parts he is a dreamer and the fourth partspoiled child  dreamer  other dreams  what other dreams could she mean  my cousin fell into profound musings then he started looked about him saw the time by his rathbone clock got up suddenly and went to bed     chapter the seventh  the crisis   i  the crisis came about a week from that timei say about because of melvilles conscientious inexactness in these matters and so far as the crisis goes i seem to get melville at his best he was keenly interested keenly observant and his more than average memory took some excellent impressions to my mind at any rate two at least of these people come out fuller and more convincingly than anywhere else in this painfully disinterred story he has given me here an adeline i seem to believe in and something much more like chatteris than any of the broken fragments i have had to go upon and amplify and fudge together so far and for all such transient lucidities in this mysterious story the reader no doubt will echo my heaven be thanked  melville was called down to participate in the crisis at sandgate by a telegram from mrs bunting and his first exponent of the situation was fred bunting  come down urgent please was the irresistible message from mrs bunting my cousin took the early train and arrived at sandgate in the forenoon  he was told that mrs bunting was upstairs with miss glendower and that she implored him to wait until she could leave her charge miss glendower not well then said melville no sir not at all well said the housemaid evidently awaiting a further question where are the others he asked casually the three younger young ladies had gone to hythe said the housemaid with a marked omission of the sea lady melville has an intense dislike of questioning servants on points at issue so he asked nothing at all concerning miss waters this general absence of people from the room of familiar occupation conveyed the same suggested warning of crisis as the telegram the housemaid waited an instant longer and withdrew  he stood for a moment in the drawingroom and then walked out upon the veranda he perceived a richly caparisoned figure advancing towards him it was fred bunting he had been taking advantage of the general desertion of home to bathe from the house he was wearing an umbrageous white cotton hat and a striped blanket and a more aggressively manly pipe than any fully adult male would ever dream of smoking hung from the corner of his mouth  hello he said the mater sent for you  melville admitted the truth of this theory  theres ructions said fred and removed the pipe the act offered conversation  wheres miss waters  gone  back  lord no catch her shes gone to lummidges hotel with her maid took a suite  why  the mater made a row with her  whatever for  harry  my cousin stared at the situation  it broke out said fred  what broke out  the row harrys gone daft on her addy says  on miss waters  rather mooney didnt care for his electioneeringdidnt care for his ordinary nourishment loose ends didnt mention it to adeline but she began to see it asked questions next day went off london she asked what was up three days silence thenwrote to her  fred intensified all this by raising his eyebrows pulling down the corners of his mouth and nodding portentously eh he said and then to make things clearer wrote a letter  he didnt write to her about miss waters  dont know what he wrote about dont suppose he mentioned her name but i dare say he made it clear enough all i know is that everything in the house felt like elastic pulled tighter than it ought to be for two whole dayseverybody in a sort of complicated twistand then there was a snap all that time addy was writing letters to him and tearing em up and no one could quite make it out everyone looked blue except the sea lady she kept her own lovely pink and at the end of that time the mater began asking things adeline chucked writing gave the mater half a hint mater took it all in in an instant and the thing burst  miss glendower didnt  no the mater did put it pretty straight tooas the mater can she didnt deny it said she couldnt help herself and that he was as much hers as adelines i heard that said fred shamelessly pretty thick ehconsidering hes engaged and the mater gave it her pretty straight said ive been very much deceived in you miss watersvery much indeed i heard her  and then  asked her to go said shed requited us ill for taking her up when nobody but a fisherman would have looked at her  she said that  well words to that effect  and miss waters went  in a firstclass cab maid and boxes in another all complete perfect lady couldnt have believed if i hadnt seen itthe tail i mean  and miss glendower  addy oh shes been going it comes downstairs and does the palefaced heroine and goes upstairs and does the brokenhearted part i know its all very well you never had sisters you know  fred held his pipe elaborately out of the way and protruded his face to a confidential nearness  i believe they half like it said fred in a confidential half whisper such a go you know mabel pretty near as bad and the girls all making the very most they can of it me i think chatteris was the only man alive to hear em i couldnt get up emotion as they do if my feet were being flayed cheerful home eh for holidays  wheresthe principal gentleman asked melville a little grimly in london  unprincipled gentleman i call him said fred hes stopping down here at the métropole stuck  down here stuck  rather stuck and set about  my cousin tried for sidelights whats his attitude he asked  slump said fred with intensity  this little blowoff has rather astonished him he explained when he wrote to say that the election didnt interest him for a bit but he hoped to pull around  you said you didnt know what he wrote  i do that much said fred he no more thought theyd have spotted that it meant miss waters than a baby but women are so thundering sharp you know theyre born spotters how itll all end  but why has he come to the métropole  middle of the stage i suppose said fred  whats his attitude  says hes going to see adeline and explain everythingand doesnt do it puts it off and adeline as far as i can gather says that if he doesnt come down soon shes hanged if shell see him much as her heart may be broken and all that if she doesnt you know  naturally said melville rather inconsecutively and he doesnt  doesnt stir  does he seethe other lady  we dont know we cant watch him but if he does hes clever  why  theres about a hundred blessed relatives of his in the placecame like crows for a corpse i never saw such a lot talk about a man of good old familyits decaying i never saw such a high old family in my life aunts they are chiefly  aunts  aunts say theyve rallied round him how they got hold of it i dont know like vultures unless the mater but theyre here theyre all at himusing their influence with him threatening to cut off legacies and all that theres one old girl at bates lady poynting mallowleast bit horsey but about as all right as any of emwhos been down here twice seems a trifle disappointed in adeline and theres two aunts at wampachsyou know the sort that stop at wampachsregular hothouse flowersa wateringpotful of real icy cold water would kill both of em and theres one come over from the continent short hair short skirtsregular terrorshes at the pavilion theyre all chasing round saying where is this womanfish sort of thing let me peek  does that constitute the hundred relatives  practically the wampachers are sending for a bishop who used to be his schoolmaster  no stone unturned eh  none  and has he found out yet  that shes a mermaid i dont believe he has the pater went up to tell him of course he was a bit out of breath and embarrassed and chatteris cut him down at least let me hear nothing against her he said and the pater took that and came away good old pater eh  and the aunts  theyre taking it in mainly they grasp the fact that hes going to jilt adeline just as he jilted the american girl the mermaid side they seem to boggle at old people like that dont take to a new idea all at once the wampach ones are shockedbut curious they dont believe for a moment she really is a mermaid but they want to know all about it and the one down at the pavilion simply said bosh how can she breathe under water tell me that mrs bunting shes some sort of person you have picked up i dont know how but mermaid she cannot be theyd be all tremendously down on the mater i think for picking her up if it wasnt that they cant do without her help to bring addy round again pretty mess all round eh  i suppose the aunts will tell him  what  about the tail  i suppose they will  and what then  heaven knows just as likely they wont  my cousin meditated on the veranda tiles for a space  it amuses me said fred bunting  look here said my cousin melville what am i supposed to do why have i been asked to come  i dont know stir it up a bit i expect everybody do a bitlike the christmas pudding  but said melville  illustration adjusting the folds of his blanket to a greater dignity  ive been bathing said fred nobody asked me to take a hand and i didnt it wont be a good pudding without me but there you are theres only one thing i can see to do  it might be the right thing what is it  punch chatteriss head  i dont see how that would help matters  oh it wouldnt help matters said fred adding with an air of conclusiveness there it is then adjusting the folds of his blanket to a greater dignity and replacing his long extinct large pipe between his teeth he went on his way the tail of his blanket followed him reluctantly through the door his bare feet padded across the hall and became inaudible on the carpet of the stairs  fred said melville going doorward with a sudden afterthought for fuller particulars  but fred had gone  instead mrs bunting appeared   ii  she appeared with traces of recent emotion i telegraphed she said we are in dreadful trouble  miss waters i gather  shes gone  she went towards the bell and stopped theyll get luncheon as usual she said you will be wanting your luncheon  she came towards him with rising hands you can not imagine she said that poor child  you must tell me said melville  i simply do not know what to do i dont know where to turn she came nearer to him she protested all that i did mr melville i did for the best i saw there was trouble i could see that i had been deceived and i stood it as long as i could i had to speak at last  my cousin by leading questions and interrogative silences developed her story a little  and every one she said blames me every one  everybody blames everybody who does anything in affairs of this sort said melville you mustnt mind that  ill try not to she said bravely you know mr melville  he laid his hand on her shoulder for a moment yes he said very impressively and i think mrs bunting felt better  we all look to you she said i dont know what i should do without you  thats it said melville how do things stand what am i to do  go to him said mrs bunting and put it all right  but suppose began melville doubtfully  go to her make her see what it would mean for him and all of us  he tried to get more definite instructions dont make difficulties implored mrs bunting think of that poor girl upstairs think of us all  exactly said melville thinking of chatteris and staring despondently out of the window  bunting i gather  it is you or no one said mrs bunting sailing over his unspoken words fred is too young and randolph hes not diplomatic hehe hectors  does he exclaimed melville  you should see him abroad oftenmany times i have had to interfere no it is you you know harry so well he trusts you you can say things to himno one else could say  that reminds me does he know  we dont know how can we know we know he is infatuated that is all he is up there in folkestone and she is in folkestone and they may be meeting  my cousin sought counsel with himself  say you will go said mrs bunting with a hand upon his arm  ill go said melville but i dont see what i can do  and mrs bunting clasped his hand in both of her own plump shapely hands and said she knew all along that he would and that for coming down so promptly to her telegram she would be grateful to him so long as she had a breath to draw and then she added as if it were part of the same remark that he must want his luncheon  he accepted the luncheon proposition in an incidental manner and reverted to the question in hand  do you know what his attitude  he has written only to addy  it isnt as if he had brought about this crisis  it was addy he went away and something in his manner made her write and ask him the reason why so soon as she had his letter saying he wanted to rest from politics for a little that somehow he didnt seem to find the interest in life he thought it deserved she divined everything  everything yes but just what is everything  that she had led him on  miss waters  yes  my cousin reflected so that was what they considered to be everything i wish i knew just where he stood he said at last and followed mrs bunting luncheonward in the course of that meal which was têteàtête it became almost unsatisfactorily evident what a great relief melvilles consent to interview chatteris was to mrs bunting indeed she seemed to consider herself relieved from the greater portion of her responsibility in the matter since melville was bearing her burden she sketched out her defence against the accusations that had no doubt been levelled at her explicitly and implicitly  how was i to know she asked and she told over again the story of that memorable landing but with new extenuating details it was adeline herself who had cried first she must be saved mrs bunting made a special point of that and what else was there for me to do she asked  and as she talked the problem before my cousin assumed graver and yet graver proportions he perceived more and more clearly the complexity of the situation with which he was entrusted in the first place it was not at all clear that miss glendower was willing to receive back her lover except upon terms and the sea lady he was quite sure did not mean to release him from any grip she had upon him they were preparing to treat an elemental struggle as if it were an individual case it grew more and more evident to him how entirely mrs bunting overlooked the essentially abnormal nature of the sea lady how absolutely she regarded the business as a mere everyday vacillation a commonplace outbreak of that jilting spirit which dwells covered deep perhaps but never entirely eradicated in the heart of man and how confidently she expected him with a little tactful remonstrance and pressure to restore the status quo ante  as for chatterismelville shook his head at the cheese and answered mrs bunting abstractedly   iii  she wants to speak to you said mrs bunting and melville with a certain trepidation went upstairs he went up to the big landing with the seats to save adeline the trouble of coming down she appeared dressed in a black and violet tea gown with much lace and her dark hair was done with a simple carefulness that suited it she was pale and her eyes showed traces of tears but she had a certain dignity that differed from her usual bearing in being quite unconscious  she gave him a limp hand and spoke in an exhausted voice  you knowall she asked  all the outline anyhow  why has he done this to me  melville looked profoundly sympathetic through a pause  i feel she said that it isnt coarseness  certainly not said melville  it is some mystery of the imagination that i cannot understand i should have thoughthis career at any ratewould have appealed she shook her head and regarded a pot of ferns fixedly for a space  he has written to you asked melville  three times she said looking up  melville hesitated to ask the extent of that correspondence but she left no need for that  i had to ask him she said he kept it all from me and i had to force it from him before he would tell  tell said melville what  what he felt for her and what he felt for me  but did he  he has made it clearer but still even now no i dont understand  she turned slowly and watched melvilles face as she spoke you know mr melville that this has been an enormous shock to me i suppose i never really knew him i suppose iidealised him i thought he cared forour work at any rate he did care for our work he believed in it surely he believed in it  he does said melville  and then but how can he  he ishe is a man with rather a strong imagination  or a weak will  relativelyyes  it is so strange she sighed it is so inconsistent it is like a child catching at a new toy do you know mr melvilleshe hesitatedall this has made me feel old i feel very much older very much wiser than he is i cannot help it i am afraid it is for all women  to feel that sometimes  she reflected profoundly for all women the child man i see now just what sarah grand meant by that  she smiled a wan smile i feel just as if he had been a naughty child and ii worshipped him mr melville she said and her voice quivered  my cousin coughed and turned about to stare hard out of the window he was he perceived much more shockingly inadequate even than he had expected to be  if i thought she could make him happy she said presently leaving a hiatus of generous selfsacrifice  the case iscomplicated said melville  her voice went on clear and a little high resigned impenetrably assured  but she would not all his better side all his serious side she would miss it and ruin it all  does he began melville and repented of the temerity of his question  yes she said  does heask to be released  no he wants to come back to me  and you  he doesnt come  but do youdo you want him back  how can i say mr melville he does not say certainly even that he wants to come back  my cousin melville looked perplexed he lived on the superficies of emotion and these complexities in matters he had always assumed were simple put him out  there are times she said when it seems to me that my love for him is altogether dead think of the disillusionmentthe shockthe discovery of such weakness  my cousin lifted his eyebrows and shook his head in agreement  his feetto find his feet were of clay  there came a pause  it seems as if i have never loved him and thenand then i think of all the things that still might be  her voice made him look up and he saw that her mouth was set hard and tears were running down her cheeks  it occurred to my cousin he says that he would touch her hand in a sympathetic manner and then it occurred to him that he wouldnt her words rang in his thoughts for a space and then he said somewhat tardily he may still be all those things  i suppose he may she said slowly and without colour the weeping moment had passed  what is she she changed abruptly what is this being who has come between him and all the realities of life what is there about her and why should i have to compete with her because hebecause he doesnt know his own mind  for a man said melville to know his own mind isto have exhausted one of the chief interests in life after that a cultivated extinct volcanoif ever it was a volcano  he reflected egotistically for a space then with a secret start he came back to consider her  what is there she said with that deliberate attempt at clearness which was one of her antipathetic qualities for melvillewhat is there that she has that she offers that i  melville winced at this deliberate proposal of appalling comparisons all the catlike quality in his soul came to his aid he began to edge away and walk obliquely and generally to shirk the issue my dear miss glendower he said and tried to make that seem an adequate reply  what is the difference she insisted  there are impalpable things waived melville they are above reason and beyond describing  but you she urged you take an attitude you must have an impression why dont you dont you see mr melville this is veryher voice caught for a momentvery vital for me it isnt kind of you if you have impressions im sorry mr melville if i seem to be trying to get too much from you ii want to know  it came into melvilles head for a moment that this girl had something in her perhaps that was just a little beyond his former judgments  i must admit i have a sort of impression he said  you are a man you know him you know all sorts of thingsall sorts of ways of looking at things i dont know if you could go so faras to be frank  well said melville and stopped  she hung over him as it were as a tense silence  there is a difference he admitted and still went unhelped  how can i put it i think in certain ways you contrast with her in a way that makes things easier for her he hasi know the thing sounds like cant only you know he doesnt plead it in defencehe has a temperament to which she sometimes appeals more than you do  yes i know but how  well  tell me  you are austere you are restrained lifefor a man like chatterisis schooling he has somethingsomething perhaps more worth having than most of us havebut i think at timesit makes life harder for him than it is for a lot of us life comes at him with limitations and regulations he knows his duty well enough and you you mustnt mind what i say too much miss glendoweri may be wrong  go on she said go on  you are too muchthe agent general of his duty  but surelywhat else  i talked to him in london and then i thought he was quite in the wrong since that ive thought all sorts of thingseven that you might be in the wrong in certain minor things  dont mind my vanity now she cried tell me  you see you have defined thingsvery clearly you have made it clear to him what you expect him to be and what you expect him to do it is like having built a house in which he is to live for him to go to her is like going out of a house a very fine and dignified house i admit into something larger something adventurous and incalculable she isshe has an air of beingnatural she is as lax and lawless as the sunset she is as free and familiar as the wind she doesntif i may put it in this wayshe doesnt love and respect him when he is this and disapprove of him highly when he is that she takes him altogether she has the quality of the open sky of the flight of birds of deep tangled places she has the quality of the high sea that i think is what she is for him she is the great outside youyou have the quality  he hesitated  go on she insisted let us get the meaning  of an edifice i dont sympathise with him said melville i am a tame cat and i should scratch and mew at the door directly i got outside of things i dont want to go out the thought scares me but he is different  yes she said he is different  for a time it seemed that melvilles interpretation had hold of her she stood thoughtful slowly other aspects of the thing came into his mind  of course she said thinking as she looked at him yes yes that is the impression that is the quality but in reality there are other things in the world beside effects and impressions after all that isan analogy it is pleasant to go out of houses and dwellings into the open air but most of us nearly all of us must live in houses  decidedly said melville  he cannot what can he do with her how can he live with her what life could they have in common  its a case of attraction said melville and not of plans  after all she said he must come backif i let him come back he may spoil everything now he may lose his election and be forced to start again lower and less hopefully he may tear his heart to pieces  she stopped at a sob  miss glendower said melville abruptly  i dont think you quite understand  understand what  you think he cannot marry thisthis being who has come among us  how could he  nohe couldnt you think his imagination has wandered away from youto something impossible that generally in an aimless way he has cut himself up for nothing and made an inordinate fool of himself and that its simply a business of putting everything back into place again  he paused and she said nothing but her face was attentive what you do not understand he went on what no one seems to understand is that she comes  out of the sea  out of some other world she comes whispering that this life is a phantom life unreal flimsy limited casting upon everything a spell of disillusionment  so that he  yes and then she whispers there are better dreams  the girl regarded him in frank perplexity  she hints of these vague better dreams she whispers of a way  what way  i do not know what way but it is somethingsomething that tears at the very fabric of this daily life  you mean  she is a mermaid she is a thing of dreams and desires a siren a whisper and a seduction she will lure him with her  he stopped  where she whispered  into the deeps  the deeps  they hung upon a long pause melville sought vagueness with infinite solicitude and could not find it he blurted out at last there can be but one way out of this dream we are all dreaming you know  and that way  that way began melville and dared not say it  you mean she said with a pale face half awakened to a new thought the way is  melville shirked the word he met her eyes and nodded weakly  but how she asked  at any ratehe said hastily seeking some palliative phraseat any rate if she gets him this little world of yours there will be no coming back for him you know  no coming back she said  no coming back said melville  but are you sure she doubted  sure  that it is so  that desire is desire and the deep the deepyes  i never thought she began and stopped  mr melville she said you know i dont understand i thoughti scarcely know what i thought i thought he was trivial and foolish to let his thoughts go wandering i agreedi see your pointas to the difference in our effect upon him but thisthis suggestion that for him she may be something determining and final after all she  she is nothing he said she is the hand that takes hold of him the shape that stands for things unseen  what things unseen  my cousin shrugged his shoulders something we never find in life he said something we are always seeking  but what she asked  melville made no reply she scrutinised his face for a time and then looked out at the sunlight again  do you want him back he said  i dont know  do you want him back  i feel as if i had never wanted him before  and now  yes butif he will not come back  he will not come back said melville for the work  i know  he will not come back for his selfrespector any of those things  no  those things you know are only fainter dreams all the palace you have made for him is a dream but  yes  he might come back he said and looked at her and stopped he tells me he had some vague intention of startling her rousing her wounding her to some display of romantic force some insurgence of passion that might yet win chatteris back and then in that moment and like a blow it came to him how foolish such a fancy had been there she stood impenetrably herself limitedly intelligent wellmeaning imitative and powerless her pose her face suggested nothing but a clear and reasonable objection to all that had come to her a critical antagonism a steady opposition and then amazingly she changed she looked up and suddenly held out both her hands and there was something in her eyes that he had never seen before  melville took her hands mechanically and for a second or so they stood looking with a sort of discovery into each others eyes  tell him she said with an astounding perfection of simplicity to come back to me there can be no other thing than what i am tell him to come back to me  and  tell him that  forgiveness  no tell him i want him if he will not come for that he will not come at all if he will not come back for thatshe halted for a momenti do not want him no i do not want him he is not mine and he may go  his passive hold of her hands became a pressure then they dropped apart again  you are very good to help us she said as he turned to go  he looked at her you are very good to help me she said and then tell him whatever you like if only he will come back to me no tell him what i have said he saw she had something more to say and stopped you know mr melville all this is like a book newly opened to me are you sure  sure  sure of what you saysure of what she is to himsure that if he goes on he will she stopped  he nodded  it means she said and stopped again  no adventure no incident but a going out from all that this life has to offer  you mean she insisted you mean  death said melville starkly and for a space both stood without a word  she winced and remained looking into his eyes then she spoke again  mr melville tell him to come back to me  and  tell him to come back to me ora sudden note of passion rang in her voiceif i have no hold upon him let him go his way  but said melville  i know she cried with her face set i know but if he is mine he will come to me and if he is not let him dream his dream  her clenched hand tightened as she spoke he saw in her face she would say no more that she wanted urgently to leave it there he turned again towards the staircase he glanced at her and went down  as he looked up from the bend of the stairs she was still standing in the light  he was moved to proclaim himself in some manner her adherent but he could think of nothing better than whatever i can do i will and so after a curious pause he departed rather stumblingly from her sight   iv  after this interview it was right and proper that melville should have gone at once to chatteris but the course of events in the world does occasionally display a lamentable disregard for what is right and proper points of view were destined to crowd upon him that dayfor the most part entirely unsympathetic points of view he found mrs bunting in the company of a boldly trimmed bonnet in the hall waiting it became clear to intercept him  as he descended in a state of extreme preoccupation the boldly trimmed bonnet revealed beneath it a whitefaced resolute person in a duster and sensible boots this stranger mrs bunting made apparent was lady poynting mallow one of the more representative of the chatteris aunts her ladyship made a few enquiries about adeline with an eye that took melvilles measure and then after agreeing to a number of the suggestions mrs bunting had to advance proposed that he should escort her back to her hotel he was much too exercised with adeline to discuss the proposal i walk she said and we go along the lower road  he found himself walking  she remarked as the bunting door closed behind them that it was always a comfort to have to do with a man and there was a silence for a space  i dont think at that time melville completely grasped the fact that he had a companion but presently his meditations were disturbed by her voice he started  i beg your pardon he said  that bunting woman is a fool repeated lady poynting mallow  there was a slight interval for consideration  shes an old friend of mine said melville  quite possibly said lady poynting mallow  the position seemed a little awkward to melville for a moment he flicked a fragment of orange peel into the road i want to get to the bottom of all this said lady poynting mallow who is this other woman  what other woman  tertium quid said lady poynting mallow with a luminous incorrectness  mermaid i gather said melville  whats the objection to her  tail  fin and all  complete  youre sure of it  certain  how do you know  im certain repeated melville with a quite unusual testiness  the lady reflected  well there are worse things in the world than a fishy tail she said at last  melville saw no necessity for a reply hm said lady poynting mallow apparently by way of comment on his silence and for a space they went on  that glendower girl is a fool too she added after a pause  my cousin opened his mouth and shut it again how can one answer when ladies talk in this way but if he did not answer at any rate his preoccupation was gone he was now acutely aware of the determined person at his side  she has means she asked abruptly  miss glendower  no i know all about her the other  the mermaid  yes the mermaid why not  oh shevery considerable means galleons phoenician treasure ships wrecked frigates submarine reefs  well thats all right and now will you tell me mr melville why shouldnt harry have her what if she is a mermaid its no worse than an american silver mine and not nearly so raw and illbred  in the first place theres his engagement  oh that  and in the next theres the sea lady  but i thought she  shes a mermaid  its no objection so far as i can see shed make an excellent wife for him and as a matter of fact down here shed be able to help him in just the right way the member herehell be fightingthis sassoon manmakes a lot of capital out of deepsea cables couldnt be better harry could dish him easily thats all right why shouldnt he have her  she stuck her hands deeply into the pockets of her dustcoat and a chinablue eye regarded melville from under the brim of the boldly trimmed bonnet  you understand clearly she is a properly constituted mermaid with a real physical tail  well said lady poynting mallow  apart from any question of miss glendower  thats understood  i think that such a marriage would be impossible  why  my cousin played round the question shes an immortal for example with a past  simply makes her more interesting  melville tried to enter into her point of view you think he said she would go to london for him and marry at st georges hanover square and pay for a mansion in park lane and visit just anywhere he liked  thats precisely what she would do just now with a court that is waking up  its precisely what she wont do said melville  but any woman would do it who had the chance  shes a mermaid  shes a fool said lady poynting mallow  she doesnt even mean to marry him it doesnt enter into her code  the hussy what does she mean  my cousin made a gesture seaward that he said shes a mermaid  what  out there  where  there  lady poynting mallow scanned the sea as if it were some curious new object its an amphibious outlook for the family she said after reflection but even thenif she doesnt care for society and it makes harry happyand perhaps after they are tired ofrusticating  i dont think you fully realise that she is a mermaid said melville and chatteris you know breathes air  that is a difficulty admitted lady poynting mallow and studied the sunlit offing for a space  i dont see why it shouldnt be managed for all that she considered after a pause  it cant be said melville with arid emphasis  she cares for him  shes come to fetch him  if she wants him badly he might make terms in these affairs its always one or other has to do the buying shed have to marryanyhow  my cousin regarded her impenetrably satisfied face  he could have a yacht and a diving bell she suggested if she wanted him to visit her people  they are pagan demigods i believe and live in some mythological way in the mediterranean  dear harrys a pagan himselfso that doesnt matter and as for being mythologicalall good families are he could even wear a diving dress if one could be found to suit him  i dont think that anything of the sort is possible for a moment  simply because youve never been a woman in love said lady poynting mallow with an air of vast experience  she continued the conversation if its sea water she wants it would be quite easy to fit up a tank wherever they lived and she could easily have a bath chair like a sitz bath on wheels really mr milvain  melville  mr melville i dont see where your impossible comes in  have you seen the lady  do you think ive been in folkestone two days doing nothing  you dont mean youve called on her  dear no its harrys place to settle that but ive seen her in her bath chair on the leas and im certain ive never seen any one who looked so worthy of dear harry never  well well said melville apart from any other considerations you know theres miss glendower  ive never regarded her as a suitable wife for harry  possibly not stillshe exists  so many people do said lady poynting mallow  she evidently regarded that branch of the subject as dismissed  they pursued their way in silence  what i wanted to ask you mr milvain  melville  mr melville is just precisely where you come into this business  im a friend of miss glendower  who wants him back  franklyyes  isnt she devoted to him  i presume as shes engaged  she ought to be devoted to himyes well why cant she see that she ought to release him for his own good  she doesnt see its for his good nor do i  simply an oldfashioned prejudice because the womans got a tail those old frumps at wampachs are quite of your opinion  melville shrugged his shoulders  and so i suppose youre going to bully and threaten on account of miss glendower youll do no good  may i ask what you are going to do  what a good aunt always does  and that  let him do what he likes  suppose he wants to drown himself  my dear mr milvain harry isnt a fool  ive told you shes a mermaid  ten times  a constrained silence fell between them  it became apparent they were near the folkestone lift  youll do no good said lady poynting mallow  melvilles escort concluded at the lift station there the lady turned upon him  im greatly obliged to you for coming mr milvain she said and very glad to hear your views of this matter its a peculiar business but i hope were sensible people you think over what i have said as a friend of harrys you are a friend of harrys  weve known each other some years  i feel sure you will come round to my point of view sooner or later it is so obviously the best thing for him  theres miss glendower  if miss glendower is a womanly woman she will be ready to make any sacrifice for his good  and with that they parted  in the course of another minute melville found himself on the side of the road opposite the lift station regarding the ascending car the boldly trimmed bonnet vivid erect assertive went gliding upward a perfect embodiment of sound common sense his mind was lapsing once again into disorder he was stunned as it were by the vigour of her ladyships view could any one not absolutely right be quite so clear and emphatic and if so what became of all that oppression of foreboding that sinister promise of an escape that whisper of other dreams that had dominated his mind only a short halfhour before  he turned his face back to sandgate his mind a theatre of warring doubts quite vividly he could see the sea lady as lady poynting mallow saw her as something pink and solid and smart and wealthy and indeed quite abominably vulgar and yet quite as vividly he recalled her as she had talked to him in the garden her face full of shadows her eyes of deep mystery and the whisper that made all the world about him no more than a flimsy thin curtain before vague and wonderful and hitherto quite unsuspected things   v  chatteris was leaning against the railings he started violently at melvilles hand upon his shoulder they made awkward greetings  the fact is said melville ii have been asked to talk to you  dont apologise said chatteris im glad to have it out with some one  there was a brief silence  they stood side by sidelooking down upon the harbour behind the evening band played remotely and the black little promenaders went to and fro under the tall electric lights i think chatteris decided to be very selfpossessed at firsta man of the world  its a gorgeous night he said  glorious said melville playing up to the key set  he clicked his cutter on a cigar there was something you wanted me to tell you  i know all that said chatteris with the shoulder towards melville becoming obtrusive i know everything  you have seen and talked to her  several times  there was perhaps a minutes pause  what are you going to do asked melville  chatteris made no answer and melville did not repeat his question  presently chatteris turned about lets walk he said and they paced westward side by side  he made a little speech im sorry to give everybody all this trouble he said with an air of having prepared his sentences i suppose there is no question that i have behaved like an ass i am profoundly sorry largely it is my own fault but you knowso far as the overt kickup goesthere is a certain amount of blame attaches to our outspoken friend mrs bunting  im afraid there is melville admitted  you know there are times when one is under the necessity of having moods it doesnt help them to drag them into general discussion  the mischiefs done  you know adeline seems to have objected to the presence ofthis sea lady at a very early stage mrs bunting overruled her afterwards when there was trouble she seems to have tried to make up for it  i didnt know miss glendower had objected  she did she seems to have seenahead  chatteris reflected of course all that doesnt excuse me in the least but its a sort of excuse for your being dragged into this bother  he said something less distinctly about a stupid bother and private affairs  they found themselves drawing near the band and already on the outskirts of its territory of votaries its cheerful rhythms became insistent the canopy of the stand was a focus of bright light musicstands and instruments sent out beams of reflected brilliance and a luminous red conductor in the midst of the lantern guided the ratatootat ratatootat of a popular air voices detached fragments of conversation came to our talkers and mingled impertinently with their thoughts  i wouldnt ave no truck with im not after that said a young person to her friend  lets get out of this said chatteris abruptly  they turned aside from the high path of the leas to the head of some steps that led down the declivity in a few moments it was as if those imposing fronts of stucco those manywindowed hotels the electric lights on the tall masts the bandstand and miscellaneous holiday british public had never existed it is one of folkestones best effects that black quietness under the very feet of a crowd they no longer heard the band even only a remote suggestion of music filtered to them over the brow the blacktreed slopes fell from them to the surf below and out at sea were the lights of many ships away to the westward like a swarm of fireflies hung the lights of hythe the two men sat down on a vacant seat in the dimness for a time neither spoke chatteris impressed melville with an air of being on the defensive he murmured in a meditative undertone i wouldnt ave no truck with im not after that  i will admit by every standard he said aloud that i have been flappy and feeble and wrong very in these things there is a prescribed and definite course to hesitate to have two points of view is condemned by all rightthinking people stillone has the two points of view you have come up from sandgate  yes  did you see miss glendower  yes  talked to her i suppose what do you think of her  his cigar glowed into an expectant brightness while melville hesitated at his answer and showed his eyes thoughtful upon melvilles face  ive never thought her melville sought more diplomatic phrasing ive never found her exceptionally attractive before handsome you know but notwinning but this time she seemed  rather splendid  she is said chatteris she is  he sat forward and began flicking imaginary ash from the end of his cigar  she is splendid he admitted youonly begin to imagine you dont my dear man know that girl she is notquitein your line she is i assure you the straightest and cleanest and clearest human being i have ever met she believes so firmly she does right so simply there is a sort of queenly benevolence a sort of integrity of benevolence  he left the sentence unfinished as if unfinished it completely expressed his thought  she wants you to go back to her said melville bluntly  i know said chatteris and flicked again at that ghostly ash she has written that thats just where her complete magnificence comes in she doesnt fence and fool about as the shewomen do she doesnt squawk and say youve insulted me and everythings at an end and she doesnt squawk and say for gods sake come back to me she doesnt say she wont ave no truck with me not after this she writesstraight i dont believe melville i half knew her until all this business came up she comes out before that it was as you said and i quite perceivei perceived all alonga little toostatistical  he became meditative and his cigar glow waned and presently vanished altogether  you are going back  by jove yes  melville stirred slightly and then they both sat rigidly quiet for a space then abruptly chatteris flung away his extinct cigar he seemed to fling many other things away with that dim gesture of course he said i shall go back  it is not my fault he insisted that this trouble this separation has ever arisen i was moody i was preoccupied i knowthings had got into my head but if id been left alone  i have been forced into this position he summarised  you understand said melville thatthough i think matters are indefined and distressing just nowi dont attach blameanywhere  youre openminded said chatteris thats just your way and i can imagine how all this upset and discomfort distresses you youre awfully good to keep so openminded and not to consider me an utter outcast an illregulated disturber of the order of the world  its a distressing state of affairs said melville but perhaps i understand the forces pulling at youbetter than you imagine  theyre very simple i suppose  very  and yet  well  he seemed to hesitate at a dangerous topic the other he said  melvilles silence bade him go on  he plunged from his prepared attitude what is it why shouldthis beingcome into my life as she has done if it is so simple what is there about her or me that has pulled me so astray she has you know here we are at sixes and sevens its not the situation its the mental conflict why am i pulled about she has got into my imagination how i havent the remotest idea  shes beautiful meditated melville  shes beautiful certainly but so is miss glendower  shes very beautiful im not blind chatteris shes beautiful in a different way  yes but thats only the name for the effect why is she very beautiful  melville shrugged his shoulders  shes not beautiful to every one  you mean  bunting keeps calm  ohhe  and other people dont seem to see itas i do  some people seem to see no beauty at all as we do with emotion that is  why do we  we seefiner  do we is it finer why should it be finer to see beauty where it is fatal to us to see it why unless we are to believe there is no reason in things why should thisimpossibility be beautiful to any one anyhow put it as a matter of reason melville why should her smile be so sweet to me why should her voice move me why hers and not adelines adeline has straight eyes and clear eyes and fine eyes and all the difference there can be what is it an infinitesimal curving of the lid an infinitesimal difference in the lashesand it shatters everythingin this way who could measure the difference who could tell the quality that makes me swim in the sound of her voice the difference after all its a visible thing its a material thing its in my eyes by jove he laughed abruptly imagine old helmholtz trying to gauge it with a battery of resonators or spencer in the light of evolution and the environment explaining it away  these things are beyond measurement said melville  not if you measure them by their effect said chatteris and anyhow why do they take us that is the question i cant get away from just now  my cousin meditated no doubt with his hands deep in his trousers pockets it is illusion he said it is a sort of glamour after all look at it squarely what is she what can she give you she promises you vague somethings she is a snare she is deception she is the beautiful mask of death  yes said chatteris i know  and then again i know  there is nothing for me to learn about that he said but whywhy should the mask of death be beautiful after all we get our duty by good hard reasoning why should reason and justice carry everything perhaps after all there are things beyond our reason perhaps after all desire has a claim on us  he stopped interrogatively and melville was profound i think said my cousin at last desire has a claim on us beauty at any rate  i mean he explained we are human beings we are matter with minds growing out of ourselves we reach downward into the beautiful wonderland of matter and upward to something he stopped from sheer dissatisfaction with the image in another direction anyhow he tried feebly he jumped at something that was not quite his meaning man is a sort of halfway househe must compromise  as you do  well yes i try to strike a balance  a few old engravingsgood i supposea little luxury in furniture and flowers a few things that come within your means artin moderation and a few kindly acts of the pleasanter sort a certain respect for truth dutyalso in moderation eh its just that even balance that i cannot contrive i cannot sit down to the oatmeal of this daily life and wash it down with a temperate draught of beauty and water art i suppose im voracious im one of the unfitfor the civilised stage ive sat down once ive sat down twice to perfectly sane secure and reasonable things its not my way  he repeated its not my way  melville i think said nothing to that he was distracted from the immediate topic by the discussion of his own way of living he was lost in egotistical comparisons no doubt he was on the verge of saying as most of us would have been under the circumstances i dont think you quite understand my position  but after all what is the good of talking in this way exclaimed chatteris abruptly i am simply trying to elevate the whole business by dragging in these wider questions its justification when i didnt mean to justify i have to choose between life with adeline and this woman out of the sea  who is death  how do i know she is death  but you said you had made your choice  i have  he seemed to recollect  i have he corroborated i told you i am going back to see miss glendower tomorrow  yes he recalled further portions of what i believe was some prepared and readyphrased decisionsome decision from which the conversation had drifted the need of my life is discipline the habit of persistence of ignoring side issues and wandering thoughts discipline  and work  work if you like to put it so its the same thing the trouble so far has been i havent worked hard enough ive stopped to speak to the woman by the wayside ive paltered with compromise and the other thing has caught me ive got to renounce it that is all  it isnt that your work is contemptible  by jove no itsarduous it has its dusty moments there are places to climb that are not only steep but muddy  the world wants leaders it gives a man of your class a great deal leisure honour training and high traditions  and it expects something back i know i am wronghave been wrong anyhow this dream has taken me wonderfully and i must renounce it after all it is not so muchto renounce a dream its no more than deciding to live there are big things in the world for men to do  melville produced an elaborate conceit if there is no venus anadyomene he said there is michael and his sword  the stern angel in armour but then he had a good palpable dragon to slash and not his own desires and our way nowadays is to do a deal with the dragons somehow raise the minimum wage and get a better housing for the working classes by hook or by crook  melville does not think that was a fair treatment of his suggestion  no said chatteris ive no doubt about the choice im going to fall inwith the species im going to take my place in the ranks in that great battle for the future which is the meaning of life i want a moral cold bath and i mean to take one this lax dalliance with dreams and desires must end i will make a time table for my hours and a rule for my life i will entangle my honour in controversies i will give myself to service as a man should do cleanhanded work struggle and performance  and there is miss glendower you know  rather said chatteris with a faint touch of insincerity tall and straighteyed and capable by jove if theres to be no venus anadyomene at any rate there will be a pallas athene it is she who plays the reconciler  and then he said these words it wont be so bad you know  melville restrained a movement of impatience he tells me at that  then chatteris he says broke into a sort of speech the case is tried he said the judgment has been given i am that i am ive been through it all and worked it out i am a man and i must go a mans way there is desire the light and guide of the world a beacon on a headland blazing out let it burn let it burn the road runs near it and by itand past ive made my choice ive got to be a man ive got to live a man and die a man and carry the burden of my class and time there it is ive had the dream but you see i keep hold of reason here with the flame burning i renounce it i make my choice renunciation alwaysrenunciation that is life for all of us we have desires only to deny them senses that we all must starve we can live only as a part of ourselves why should i be exempt for me she is evil for me she is death only why have i seen her face why have i heard her voice   vi  they walked out of the shadows and up a long sloping path until sandgate as a little line of lights came into view below presently they came out upon the brow and walked together the band playing with a remote and sweetening indistinctness far away behind them towards the cliff at the end they stood for a little while in silence looking down melville made a guess at his companions thoughts  why not come down tonight he asked  on a night like this chatteris turned about suddenly and regarded the moonlight and the sea he stood quite still for a space and that cold white radiance gave an illusory strength and decision to his face no he said at last and the word was almost a sigh  go down to the girl below there end the thing she will be there thinking of you  no said chatteris no  its not ten yet melville tried again  chatteris thought no he answered not tonight tomorrow in the light of everyday  i want a good gray honest day he said with a southwest wind these still soft nights how can you expect me to do anything of that sort tonight  and then he murmured as if he found the word a satisfying word to repeat renunciation  by jove he said with the most astonishing transition but this is a night out of fairyland look at the lights of those windows below there and then upup into this enormous blue of sky and there as if it were fainting with moonlightshines one star     chapter the eighth  moonshine triumphant   i  just precisely what happened after that has been the most impossible thing to disinter i have given all the things that melville remembered were said i have linked them into a conversation and checked them by my cousins afterthoughts and finally i have read the whole thing over to him it is of course no verbatim rendering but it is he says closely after the manner of their talk the gist was that and things of that sort were said and when he left chatteris he fully believed that the final and conclusive thing was said and then he says it came into his head that apart from and outside this settlement there still remained a tangible reality capable of action the sea lady what was she going to do the thought toppled him back into a web of perplexities again it carried him back into a state of inconclusive interrogation past lummidges hotel  the two men had gone back to the métropole and had parted with a firm handclasp outside the glare of the big doorway chatteris went straight in melville fancies but he is not sure i understand melville had some private thinking to do on his own account and i conceive him walking away in a state of profound preoccupation afterwards the fact that the sea lady was not to be abolished by renunciations cropped up in his mind and he passed back along the leas as i have said his inconclusive interrogations elicited at the utmost that lummidges private and family hotel is singularly like any other hotel of its class its windows tell no secrets and there melvilles narrative ends  with that my circumstantial record necessarily comes to an end also there are sources of course and glimpses parker refuses unhappilyas i explained the chief of these sources are first gooch the valet employed by chatteris and secondly the hallporter of lummidges private and family hotel  the valets evidence is precise but has an air of being irrelevant he witnesses that at a quarter past eleven he went up to ask chatteris if there was anything more to do that night and found him seated in an armchair before the open window with his chin upon his hands staring at nothingwhich indeed as schopenhauer observes in his crowning passage is the whole of human life  more to do said chatteris  yessir said the valet  nothing said chatteris absolutely nothing and the valet finding this answer quite satisfactory wished him goodnight and departed  probably chatteris remained in this attitude for a considerable timehalf an hour perhaps or more slowly it would seem his mood underwent a change at some definite moment it must have been that his lethargic meditation gave way to a strange activity to a sort of hysterical reaction against all his resolves and renunciations his first action seems to me grotesqueand grotesquely pathetic he went into his dressingroom and in the morning his cloes said the valet was shied about as though ed lost a ticket this poor worshipper of beauty and the dream shaved he shaved and washed and he brushed his hair and his valet testifies one of the brushes got shied behind the bed even this throwing about of brushes seems to me to have done little or nothing to palliate his poor human preoccupation with the toilette he changed his gray flannelswhich suited him very wellfor his white ones which suited him extremely he must deliberately and conscientiously have made himself quite lovely as a schoolgirl would have put it  and having capped his great renunciation by these proceedings he seems to have gone straight to lummidges private and family hotel and demanded to see the sea lady  she had retired  this came from parker and was delivered in a chilling manner by the hallporter  chatteris swore at the hallporter tell her im here he said  shes retired said the hallporter with official severity  will you tell her im here said chatteris suddenly white  what name sir said the hallporter in order as he explains to avoid a frackass  chatteris tell her i must see her now do you hear now  the hallporter went to parker and came halfway back he wished to goodness he was not a hallporter the manager had gone outit was a stagnant hour he decided to try parker again he raised his voice  the sea lady called to parker from the inner room there was an interval of tension  i gather that the sea lady put on a loose wrap and the faithful parker either carried her or sufficiently helped her from her bedroom to the couch in the little sittingroom in the meanwhile the hallporter hovered on the stairs praying for the managerprayers that went unansweredand chatteris fumed below then we have a glimpse of the sea lady  i see her just in the crack of the door said the porter as that maid of hers opened it she was raised up on her hands and turned so towards the door looking exactly like this  and the hallporter who has an irish type of face a short nose long upper lip and all the rest of it and who has also neglected his dentist projected his face suddenly opened his eyes very wide and slowly curved his mouth into a fixed smile and so remained until he judged the effect on me was complete  parker a little flushed but resolutely flattening everything to the quality of the commonplace emerged upon him suddenly miss waters could see mr chatteris for a few minutes she was emphatic with the miss waters the more emphatic for all the insurgent stress of the goddess protestingly emphatic and chatteris went up white and resolved to that smiling expectant presence no one witnessed their meeting but parkerassuredly parker could not resist seeing that but parker is silentparker preserves a silence that rubies could not break  all i know is this much from the porter  when i said she was up there and would see him he says the way he rooshed up was outrageous this is a private family hotel of course one sees things at times even here but  i couldnt find the manager to tell im said the hallporter and what was i authorised to do  for a bit they talked with the door open and then it was shut that maid of hers did iti lay  i asked an ignoble question  couldnt ketch a word said the hallporter dropped to whispersinstanter   ii  and afterwards  it was within ten minutes of one that parker conferring an amount of decorum on the request beyond the power of any other living being descended to demandof all conceivable thingsthe bath chair  i got it said the hallporter with inimitable profundity  and then having let me realise the fulness of that he said they never used it  no  no he carried her down in his arms  and out  and out  he was difficult to follow in his description of the sea lady she wore her wrap it seems and she was like a statuewhatever he may have meant by that certainly not that she was impassive only said the porter she was alive one arm was bare i know and her hair was down a tossing mass of gold  he looked you know like a man whos screwed himself up  she had one hand holding his hairyes holding his hair with her fingers in among it  and when she see my face she threw her head back laughing at me  as much as to say got im  laughed at me she did bubblin over  i stood for a moment conceiving this extraordinary picture then a question occurred to me  did he laugh i asked  gord bless you sir laugh no   iii  the definite story ends in the warm light outside lummidges private and family hotel one sees that bright solitude of the leas stretching white and blankdeserted as only a seaside front in the small hours can be desertedand all its electric light ablaze and then the dark line of the edge where the cliff drops down to the undercliff and sea and beyond moonlit the channel and its incessant ships outside the front of the hotel which is one of a great array of pallid white facades stands this little black figure of a hallporter staring stupidly into the warm and luminous mystery of the night that has swallowed sea lady and chatteris together and he is the sole living thing in the picture  there is a little shelter set in the brow of the leas wherein during the winter season a string band plays close by there are steps that go down precipitously to the lower road below down these it must have been they went together hastening downward out of this life of ours to unknown and inconceivable things so it is i seem to see them and surely though he was not in a laughing mood there was now no doubt nor resignation in his face assuredly now he had found himself for a time at least he was sure of himself and that at least cannot be misery though it lead straight through a few swift strides to death  they went down through the soft moonlight tall and white and splendid interlocked with his arms about her his brow to her white shoulder and her hair about his face and she i suppose smiled above him and caressed him and whispered to him for a moment they must have glowed under the warm light of the lamp that is halfway down the steps there and then the shadows closed about them he must have crossed the road with her through the laced moonlight of the tree shadows and through the shrubs and bushes of the undercliff into the shadeless moon glare of the beach there was no one to see that last descent to tell whether for a moment he looked back before he waded into the phosphorescence and for a little swam with her and presently swam no longer and so was no more to be seen by any one in this gray world of men  did he look back i wonder they swam together for a little while the man and the sea goddess who had come for him with the sky above them and the water about them all warmly filled with the moonlight and set with shining stars it was no time for him to think of truth nor of the honest duties he had left behind him as they swam together into the unknown and of the end i can only guess and dream did there come a sudden horror upon him at the last a sudden perception of infinite error and was he drawn down swiftly and terribly a bubbling repentance into those unknown deeps or was she tender and wonderful to the last and did she wrap her arms about him and draw him down down until the soft waters closed above him into a gentle ecstasy of death  into these things we cannot pry or follow and on the margin of the softly breathing water the story of chatteris must end for the tailpiece to that let us put that policeman who in the small hours before dawn came upon the wrap the sea lady had been wearing just as the tide overtook it it was not the sort of garment low people sometimes throw awayit was a soft and costly wrap i seem to see him perplexed and dubious wrap in charge over his arm and lantern in hand scanning first the white beach and black bushes behind him and then staring out to sea it was the inexplicable abandonment of a thoroughly comfortable and desirable thing  what were people up to one figures him asking this simple citizen of a plain and observed world what do such things mean  to throw away such an excellent wrap  in all the southward heaven there were only a planet and the sinking moon and from his feet a path of quivering light must have started and run up to the extreme dark edge before him of the sky ever and again the darkness east and west of that glory would be lit by a momentary gleam of phosphorescence and far out the lights of ships were shining bright and yellow across its shimmer a black fishing smack was gliding out of mystery into mystery dungeness shone from the west a pinpoint of red light and in the east the tireless glare of that great beacon on grisnez wheeled athwart the sky and vanished and came again  i picture the interrogation of his lantern going out for a little way a stain of faint pink curiosity upon the mysterious vast serenity of night   the end
