51201152	fighting the flames by rm ballantyne   this is one of the books by ballantyne in which he describes one of the main institutions of british lifethe fire brigade  of course he wraps a good story into this description but you come away with a good idea of how the fire brigade functioned in those days  bear in mind that there were no motorsthe fireengines were drawn by galloping horses there were no telephones and the alarm was raised by someone running to the fire station  more than that there was a system for alerting any adjacent fire stations so that better cover could be given to the district as a whole  the power for the pumps was from men and to rescue anyone the fireman had to ascend a ladder hunt for the person and carry him or her back down the ladder all done with unsophisticated gear  injuries to firemen or even their death were frequent  we are also introduced to the floating fire engine that could attend a fire by the riverside usually in one of the very vulnerable ware houses   fighting the flames by rm ballantyne    chapter one  how the fight began  ones own fireside is to all wellregulated minds a pleasant subject of contemplation when one is absent and a source of deep gratification when present  especially may this be said to be the case in a cold raw night in november when mankind has a tendency to become chronically cross out of doors and nature generally looks lugubrious for just in proportion as the exterior world grows miserably chill the world at home with its blazing gas its drawn curtains its crackling fires and its beaming smiles becomes doubly comfortable and cosy  even james auberly pompous stern and ungenial though he was appeared to entertain some such thoughts as he sat by his own fireside one such night in his elegant mansion in beverly square euston road london and smiled grimly over the top of the times newspaper at the fire  mr auberly always smiledwhen he condescended to smilegrimly  he seldom laughed when he did so he did it grimly too  in fact he was a grim man altogether a gaunt cadaverous tall careworn middleaged manalso a great one  there could be no question as to that for besides being possessed of wealth which in the opinion of some minds constitutes greatness he was chairman of a railway company and might have changed situations with the charwoman who attended the head office of the same without much difference being felt  he was also a director of several other companies which fortunately for them did not appear to require much direction in the conduct of their affairs  mr auberly was also leader of the fashion in his own circle and an oracle among his own parasites but strange to say he was nobody whatever in any other sphere  cabmen it is true appeared to have an immense respect for him on first acquaintance for his gold rings and chains bespoke wealth and he was a man of commanding presence but their respect never outlived a first engagement  cabmen seldom touched their hats to mr auberly on receiving their fare they often parted from him with a smile as grim as his own and once a peculiarly daring member of the fraternity was heard blandly to request him to step again into the cab and he would drive him the nine hundred and ninetyninth part of an inch that was still doo on the odd sixpence  that generous man even went further and when his fare walked away without making a reply he shouted after him that if hed only do im the honour to come back hed throw in a inch an a half extra for nothink  but mr auberly was inexorable  louisa dear said mr auberly recovering from the grim smile which had indicated his appreciation of his own fireside pour me out another cup of coffee and then you had better run away to bed  it is getting late  yes papa replied a little darkeyed darkhaired girl laying down her book and jumping up to obey the command  it may be added that she was also darkdressed for mr auberly had become a widower and his child motherless only six months before  while louisa was pouring out the coffee her father rose and turned his back to the fire  it was really interesting almost aweinspiring to behold mr auberly rise he was so very tall and so exceedingly straight  so remarkably perpendicular was he so rigidly upright that a hearty but somewhat rude seacaptain with whom he once had business transactions said to his mate on one occasion that he believed mr auberly must have been born with a handspike lashed to his backbone  yes he was wonderfully upright and it would have been downright madness to have doubted the uprightness of the spirit which dwelt in such a body so nobody did doubt it of course except a few jaundiced and sceptical folk who never could be got to believe anything  goodnight my love said mr auberly as the child placed the coffee beside his chair and then advanced somewhat timidly and held up her cheek to be kissed  the upright man stooped and there was a shade less of grimness in his smile as his lips touched his daughters pale cheek  louisa or to use the name by which she was better known in the house loo had clasped her hands tightly together while she was in the act of receiving this tribute of parental affection as if she were struggling to crush down some feeling but the feeling whatever it was would not be crushed down it rose up and asserted itself by causing loo to burst into a passionate flood of tears throw her arms round her fathers neck and hold him tight there while she kissed his cheek all over  tut tut child exclaimed mr auberly endeavouring to rearrange the stiff collar and cravat which had been sadly disordered you must really try to get over thesethere dont be cast down he added in a kinder tone patting loos head  goodnight dear run away to bed now and be a good girl  loo smiled faintly through her tears as she looked up at her father who had again become upright said goodnight and ran from the room with a degree of energy that might have been the result of exuberant spirits though possibly it was caused by some other feeling  mr auberly sat for some time dividing his attentions pretty equally between the paper the fire and the coffee until he recollected having received a letter that day which he had forgotten to answer whereupon he rose and sat down before his writingtable to reply  the letter was from a poor widow a sisterinlaw of his own who had disgraced herself for everat least in mr auberlys eyesby having married a waterman  mr auberly shut his eyes obstinately to the fact that the said waterman had by the sheer force of intelligence good conduct courage and perseverance raised himself to the command of an east indiaman  it is astonishing how firmly some people can shut their eyessew them up as it were and plaster them overto some things and how easily they can open them to others  mr auberlys eyes were open only to the fact that his sisterinlaw had married a waterman and that that was an unpardonable sin for which she was for ever banished from the sunshine of his presence  the widows letter set forth that since her husbands death she had been in somewhat poor circumstancesthough not in absolute povertyfor which she expressed herself thankful that she did not write to ask for money but that she had a young sona boy of about twelvewhom she was very anxious to get into a mercantile house of some sort and knowing his great influence etcetera etcetera she hoped that forgetting if not forgiving the past now that her husband was dead he would kindly do what he could etcetera etcetera  to this mr auberly replied that it was impossible to forgive the past but he would do his best to forget it and also to procure a situation for her son though certainly not in his own office on one consideration namely that she the widow should forget the past alsoincluding his own mr auberlys existence as she had once before promised to do and that she should never inform her son or any other member of her familyif there happened to be any others members of itof the relationship existing between them nor apply to him by visit or by letter for any further favours  in the event of her agreeing to this arrangement she might send her son to his residence in beverly square on thursday next between eleven and twelve  just as he concluded this letter a footman entered softly and laid a threecornered note on the table  stay hopkins i want you said mr auberly as he opened the note and ran his eye over it  hopkins who was clad in blue velvet and white stockings stood like a mute beside his masters chair  he was very tall and very thin and very red in the nose  is the young woman waiting hopkins  yes sir shes in the lobby  send her up  in a few seconds hopkins reopened the door and looked down with majestic condescension on a smart young girl whom he ushered into the room  that will do you may gostay post this letter  come here young woman  the young woman who was evidently a respectable servantgirl approached with some timidity  your name is matty merryon i understand yes sir at least so your late mistress miss tippet informs me  pray what does matty stand for  martha sir  well martha miss tippet gives you a very good characterwhich is well because i intend you to be servant to my childher maid but miss tippet qualifies her remarks by saying that you are a little careless in some things  what things are you careless in  la sir  you must not say la my girl interrupted mr auberly with a frown nor use exclamations of any kind in my presence what are the some things referred to  sure i dont know sir said the abashed matty  i spose theres amany things i aint very good at but please sir i dont mean to do nothin wrong sir i dont indeed an ill try to serve you well sir if it wor only to plaaze my missis as im leavin against my will for i love my  there that will do said mr auberly somewhat sternly as the girl appeared to be getting excited  ring that bell now go downstairs and hopkins will introduce you to my housekeeper who will explain your duties to you  hopkins entered and solemnly marched martha merryon to the regions below  mr auberly locked away his papers pulled out his watch wound it up and then lighting a bedroom candle proceeded with much gravity upstairs  he was a very statelylooking man and strikingly dignified as he walked upstairs to his bedroomslowly and deliberately as though he were marching at his own funeral to the tune of something even deader than the dead march in saul  it is almost a violation of propriety to think of mr auberly doing such a very undignified thing as going to bed  yet truth requires us to tell that he did it that he undressed himself as other mortals do that he clothed himself in the wonted ghostly garment and that when his head was last seenin the act of closing the curtains around him there was a conical white cap on it tied with a string below the chin and ornamented on the top with a little tassel which waggled as though it were bidding a triumphant and final adieu to human dignity  half an hour later mrs rose the housekeeper a matronly goodlooking woman with very red cheeks was busy in the study explaining to matty merryon her duties  she had already shown her all over the house and was now at the concluding lesson  look here now merryon began the housekeeper  oh please dont call me merryoni aint used to it  call me matty do now  very well matty continued mrs rose with a smile ive no objection you irish are a strange race  now look here  this is masters study and mind hes very partikler dreadful partikler  she paused and looked at her pupil as if desirous of impressing this point deeply on her memory  he dont like his papers or books touched not even dusted  so youll be careful not to dust em nor to touch em even so much as with your little finger for he likes to find em in the mornin just as he left em at night  yes mrs rose said matty who was evidently giving up her whole soul to the instruction that was being imparted  now continued the housekeeper the arranging of this room will be your last piece of work at night  youll just come in rake out the grate carry off the ashes lay the noo fire put the matches handy on the chimneypiece look round to see that alls right and then turn off the gas  the master is a early riser and lights the fire hisself of a mornin  yes m said matty with a courtesy  now go and do it said mrs rose that i may see you understand it begin with the grate an the ashes  matty who was in truth an experienced maidofallwork began with alacrity to discharge the duties of her new station  she carried off the ashes and returned with the materials for next days fire in a shovel  here she gave a slight indication of her socalled carelessness awkwardness would have been more appropriate by letting two or three pieces of stick and a bit of coal fall on the carpet in her passage across the room  be careful matty said mrs rose gently  its all owin to haste take your time an you wont do such things  matty apologised picked up the materials and laid the fire  then she took her apron and approached the writingtable evidently with the intention of taking the dust off the corners but not by any means intending to touch the books or papers  stop cried mrs rose sternly  matty stopped with a guilty look  not a touch said mrs rose  not even the edges nor the legs inquired the pupil  neither edges nor legs said the instructor  sure it could do no harm  matty said mrs rose solemnly the great thing that your countrywomen have to learn is obedience  thank ee m said matty who being overawed by the housekeepers solemnity felt confused and was uncertain whether the reference to her countrywomen was complimentary or the reverse  now continued mrs rose the matches  matty placed the box of matches on the chimneypiece  very well now youve got to look round to see that alls right  matty looked round on the dark portraits that covered the walls supposed to be ancestors on the shelves of books great and small new and old supposed to be read on the vases statuettes chairs tables desks curtains papers etcetera etcetera and being utterly ignorant of what constituted right and what wrong in reference to such things finally turned her eyes on mrs rose with an innocent smile  dont you see that the shutters are neither shut nor barred matty  she had not seen this but she at once went and closed and barred them in which operation she learned first that the bars refused to receive their respective catches with unyielding obstinacy for some time and second that they suddenly gave in without rhyme or reason and pinched her fingers severely  now then what next inquired mrs rose  put out the gas suggested matty  and leave yourself in the dark said the housekeeper in a tone of playful irony  ah sure didnt i forgit the candle  in order to rectify this oversight matty laid the unlighted candle which she had brought with her to the room on the writingtable and going to the chimneypiece returned with the matchbox  be careful now matty said mrs rose earnestly  theres nothink ive such a fear of as fire  you cant be too careful  this remark made matty who was of an anxious temperament extremely nervous  she struck the match hesitatingly and lighted the candle shakily  of course it would not light candles never do on such occasions and a long redhot end of burnt wood projected from the point of the match  dont let the burnt end drop into the wastepaper basket exclaimed mrs rose in an unfortunate moment  where exclaimed matty with a start that sent the redhot end into the centre of a mass of papers  there just at your feet dont be so nervous girl cried mrs rose  matty in her anxiety not to drop the match at once dropped it into the wastepaper basket which was instantly alight  a stamp of the foot might have extinguished it but this did not occur to either of the domestics  the housekeeper who was a courageous woman seized the basket in both hands and rushed with it to the fireplace thereby fanning the flame into a blaze and endangering her dress and curls  she succeeded however in cramming the basket and its contents into the grate then the two with the aid of poker tongs and shovel crushed and beat out the fire  there  i said youd do it gasped mrs rose as she flung herself panting into mr auberlys easychair this comes of bein in a hurry  i was always unfortnit sighed matty still holding the shovel and keeping her eye on the grate as if ready to make a furious attack on the smallest spark that should venture to show itself  come now well go to bed said mrs rose rising but first look well round to see that all is safe  a thorough and most careful investigation was made of the basket the grate and the carpet surrounding the fireplace but nothing beyond the smell of the burnt papers could be discovered so the instructor and pupil put out the gas shut the door and retired to the servantshall where hopkins the cook the housemaid and a small maidofallwork awaited their arrivalsupper being already on the table  here mrs rose entertained the company with a graphicnot to say exaggeratedaccount of the small fire in the study and wound up with an eloquent appeal to all to beware of fire and an assurance that there was nothing on the face of the whole earth that she had a greater horror of  meanwhile the little spark among the papersforgotten in the excitement of the succeeding blaze of the wastepaper basketcontinued to do its slow but certain work  having fallen on the cloth between two bundles it smouldered until it reached a cotton penwiper which received it rather greedily in its embrace  this penwiper lay in contact with some old letters which were dry and tindery in their nature and being piled closely together in a heap afforded enlarged accommodation for the spark which in about half an hour became quite worthy of being termed a swell  after that things went on likelike a house on fireif we may venture to use that too often misapplied expression in reference to the elegant mansion in beverly square on that raw november night    chapter two  another little spark  whistling is a fine free manly description of music which costs little and expresses much  in all its phases whistling is an interesting subject of study whether we regard its aptitude for expressing personal independence recklessness and jollity its antiquityhaving begun no doubt with adamor its modes of production as when created grandly by the whistling gale or exasperatingly by the locomotive or gushingly by the lark or sweetly by the little birds that warble in the flowering thorn  the peculiar phase of this timehonoured music to which we wish to draw the readers attention at present is that which was exemplified one november night the same november night of which mention has been made in the previous chapter by a small boy who in his progress through the streets of london was arrested suddenly under the shadow of st pauls by the bright glare and the tempting fare of a pastrycooks window  being hungry the small boy thrusting his cold hands deep into his empty trouserpockets turned his fat little face and round blue eyes full on the window and stared at the tarts and pies like a famishing owl  being poorso poor that he possessed not the smallest coin of the realmhe stared in vain and being light of heart as well as stout of limb he relieved his feelings by whistling at the food with inexpressible energy  the air selected by the young musician was jim crowa sable melody high in public favour at that timethe familiar strains of which he delivered with shrill and tuneful precision which intensified as he continued to gaze until they rose above the din of cabs vans and busses above the housetops above the walls of the great cathedral and finally awakened the echoes of its roof which coming out from the crevices and cornices where they usually slept went dancing upwards on the dome and played around the golden cross that glimmered like a ghost in the dark wintry sky  the music also awakened the interest of a tall policeman whose beat that night chanced to be st pauls churchyard  that sedate guardian of the night observing that the small boy slightly impeded the thoroughfare sauntered up to him and just as he reached that point in the chorus where mr crow is supposed to wheel and turn himself about spun him round and gave him a gentle rap on the head with his knuckles at the same time advising him to move on  oh exclaimed the small boy looking up with an expression of deep concern on his countenance as he backed off the pavement i hope i didnt hurt you bobby i really didnt mean to but accidents will happen you know an if you wont keep your knuckles out of a fellers way why  come muttered the policeman shut up your potatotrap for fear you catch cold  your mother wants you shes got some pap ready for you  ha exclaimed the small boy with his head a little on one side as though he were critically inspecting the portrait of some curious animal a prophet it isa bluecoated prophet in brass buttons all but choked with a leather stockif not conceit  a horacle six fut two in its stockins  i say bobby whoever brought you up carried you up much too high both in body and notions  wot wouldnt they give for im in the guards or the hossmarines if he was only eight inches wider across the shoulders  seeing that the policeman passed slowly and gravely on without condescending to take further notice of him the small boy bade him an affectionate farewell said that he would not forget to mention him favourably at headquarters and then continued his progress through the crowded streets at a smart pace whistling jim crow at the top of his shrill pipe  the small boy had a long walk before him but neither his limbs spirits nor lips grew weary by the way  indeed his energies seemed to increase with every step if one might judge from the easy swagger of his gait and the various little touches of pleasantry in which he indulged from time to time such as pulling the caps over the eyes of boys smaller than himself winking at those who were bigger uttering indian warwhoops down alleys and lanes that looked as if they could echo and chaffing all who appeared to be worthy of his attentions those eccentricities of humour however did not divert his active mind from the frequent and earnest study of the industrial arts as these were exhibited and exemplified in shopwindows  jolly stuff that aint it observed another small boy in a coat much too long for him as they met and stopped in front of a chocolateshop at the top of holborn hill where a steamengine was perpetually grinding up such quantities of rich brown chocolate that it seemed quite unreasonable selfish and doginthemangerish of the young man behind the counter to stand there and neither eat it himself nor let anyone else touch it  yes its very jolly stuff replied the first small boy regarding his questioner sternly  i know youd like some wouldnt you  go in now an buy two penorth and ill buy the half from you wen you come out  walker replied the boy in the long coat  just so and id advise you to become a walker too retorted the other run away now your masters bin askin after you for half an hour i know and more  without waiting for a reply the small boy our small boy swaggered away whistling louder than ever  passing along holborn he continued his way into oxford street where the printshop windows proved irresistibly attractive  they seemed also to have the effect of stimulating his intellectual and conceptive faculties insomuch that he struck out several new and to himself highly entertaining pieces of pleasantry one of which consisted of asking a taciturn cabman in the meekest of voices  please sir you couldnt tell me wots oclock could you  the cabman observed a twinkle in the boys eye saw through him in a metaphorical sense and treated him with silent contempt  oh i beg pardon sir continued the small boy in the same meek tone as he turned to move humbly away i forgot to remember that cabbies dont carry no watches no nor change neither theyre much too wide awake for that  a sudden motion of the taciturn cabman caused the small boy to dart suddenly to the other side of the crowded street where he resumed his easy independent air and his interrupted tune  can you direct me to nottin hill gate missus he inquired of an applewoman on reaching the neighbourhood of tottenham court road  straight on as you go boy answered the woman who was busying herself about her stall  very good indeed said the small boy with a patronising air quite correctly answered  youve learnt geography i see  what say inquired the woman who was apparently a little deaf  i was askin the price o your oranges missus  one penny apiece said the woman taking up one  they aint biled to make em puff out are they  to this the woman vouchsafed no reply  come missus dont be cross wots the price o yer apples now  dyou want one asked the woman testily  of course i does  well then theyre two a penny  two a penny cried the small boy with a look of surprise why id a said they was a penny apiece  good evenin missus i never buys cheap fruitcheap and nastyno no good evenin  it seemed as if the current of the small boys thoughts had been diverted by this conversation for he walked for some time with his eyes cast on the ground and without whistling but whatever the feelings were that might have been working in his mind they were speedily put to flight by a facetious butcher who pulled his hat over his eyes as he passed him  now then pigsticker what dye mean by that he shouted but as the butcher walked on without deigning to reply he let off his indignation by yelling in at the open door of a tobaccoshop and making off at a brisk run  from this point in his progress he became still more hilarious and daring in his freaks and turned aside once or twice into narrow streets where sounds of shouting or of music promised him fresh excitement  on turning the corner of one of those streets he passed a wide doorway by the side of which was a knob with the word fire in conspicuous letters above it and the word bell below it  the small boy paused caught his breath as if a sudden thought had struck him and glanced round  the street was comparatively quiet his heart beat high he seized the bell with both hands pulled it full out and bolted  now it chanced that one of the firemen of the station happened to be standing close to the door inside at the time  he guessing the meaning of the ring at once darted out and gave chase  the small boy fled on the wings of terror with his blue eyes starting from their sockets  the fireman was tall and heavy but he was also strong and in his prime so that a short run brought him up with the fugitive whom he seized with a grip of iron  now then young bottleimp what did you mean by that  oh please sir gasped the small boy with a beseeching look i couldnt help it  there was such a tone of truthfulness in this couldnt that it tickled the fireman  his mouth relaxed in a quiet smile and releasing his intended victim he returned to the station while the small boy darted away in the direction of oxford street  he had scarcely reached the end of the street however when a man turned the corner at full speed and ran him downran him down so completely that he sent him headoverheels into the kennel and passing on darted at the firebell of the station which he began to pull violently  the man was tall and dishevelled partially clad in blue velvet with stockings which had once been white but were now covered from garter to toe with mud  one shoe clung to his left foot the other was fixed by the heel in a grating over a cellarwindow in tottenham court road without hat or coat with his shirtsleeves torn by those unfortunates into whose arms he had wildly rushed with his hair streaming backwards his eyes bloodshot his face pale as marble and perspiration running down his cheeks not even his own most intimate friends would have recognised hopkinsthe staid softspoken polite and gentle hopkins had they seen him that night pulling like a maniac at the firebell  and without doubt hopkins was a maniac that nightat least he was afflicted with temporary insanity    chapter three  fire  hallo thatll do man cried the same stalwart fireman who had seized the small boy stepping out and laying his hand on hopkinss shoulder whereabouts is it  hopkins heard him not  one idea had burnt itself into the poor mans brain and that was the duty that lay on him to ring the alarmbell seeing this the fireman seized him and dragged him forciblyalmost lifted himinto the station round the door of which an eager crowd had already begun to collect  calm yourself said the stalwart fireman quietly as he thrust hopkins down into a chair  consider now  youll make us too late if you dont speak  where is it  bbfire yelled hopkins gasping and glaring round him on the men who were quietly putting on their helmets  hopkins suddenly burst from the grasp of his captor and rushing out seized the bellhandle which he began to pull more furiously than ever  get her out jim said the fireman in a low tone to one of his comrades her being the engine at the same time he went to the door and again seizing hopkins brought him back and forced him into a chair while he said firmly  now then out with it man wheres the fire  yes yes screamed hopkins fire fire thats it  b  bbeverly blazessquarenumberfire  thatll do said the fireman at once releasing the temporary maniac and going to a book where he calmly made an entry of the name of the square the hour of the night and the nature of the call  two lines sufficed  then he rose put on his helmet and thrust a small hatchet into his belt just as the engine was dragged to the door of the station  there was something absolutely magnificent in this scene which no pen can describe because more than half its force was conveyed only by the eye and the ear  the strong contrast between human excitement and madness coupled with imbecility and human calmness and selfpossession coupled with vigorous promptitude was perfect  just before poor hopkins rang his first note of alarm the station had been wrapt in profound silencethe small boys interruption having been but a momentary affair  george dale the fireman in charge was seated at a desk in the watchroom known among firemen as the lobby making an entry in a diary  all the other menabout thirteen in numberhad gone to their respective homes and beds in the immediate neighbourhood with the exception of the two whose turn it was to remain on duty all night  these two named baxmore and corney with their coats belts boots and caps on had just lain down on two low tressel couches and were courting sleep  the helmets of their comrades hung on the walls round the room with belts and hatchets underneath them  several pairs of boots also graced the walls and a small clock whose gentle tick was the only sound that broke the silence of the night  in an outer room the dim form of a spare engine could be seen through the doorway  the instant that the bell rang however this state of quietude was put to flight  the two men rose from their couches and dale stepped to the door  there was no starting up no haste in their movements yet there was prompt rapidity  the men having been sailors had been trained in the midst of alarms  the questions which were put to hopkins as above described were rapidly uttered  before they were answered the two men were ready and at dales order get her out they both vanished  one ran round the corner to the enginehouse and knocked up the driver in passing  the other ran from door to door of the firemens abodes which were close at hand and with a loud doublering summoned the sleepers  before he got back to help the first with the engine one and another and another door opened and a man darted out buttoning braces or coat as he ran  each went into the station seized his helmet belt and axe from his own peg and in another moment all were armed capapie  at the same instant that the engine appeared at the door a pair of horses were trotted up  two men held them two others fastened the traces the driver sprang to his seat the others leaped to their respective places  each knew what to do and did it at once  there was no hurry no loss of time no excitement some of the men even while acting with the utmost vigour and promptitude were yawning away their drowsiness and in less than ten minutes from the moment the bell first rang the whip cracked and the fireengine dashed away from the station amid the cheers of the crowd  it may be as well to remark here in passing that the london fire brigade had at the time of which we write reached a high state of efficiency although it could not stand comparison with the perfection of system and unity of plan which mark the organisation and conduct of the brigade of the present day  mr braidwood the able superintendent had for many years been training his men on a system the original of which he had begun and proved in edinburgh  modifying his system to suit the peculiarities of the larger field to which he had been translated he had brought the fire engine establishment which belonged at that time to several insurance companies to a state of efficiency which rendered it a model and a trainingschool for the rest of the world and although he had not the advantage of the telegraph or the powerful aid of the land steam fireengine of the present day he had men of the same metal as those which compose the force now  the metropolitan fire brigade as it then existed under the control of the metropolitan board of works had been carried by its chief captain eyre massey shaw to a condition of efficiency little if at all short of perfection its only fault being if we may humbly venture a remark that it was too small both in numbers of engines and men  now good reader if you have never seen a london fireengine go to a fire you have no conception of what it is and even if you have seen it but have not gone with it still you have no idea of what it is  to those accustomed to it no doubt it may be tame enoughwe cannot tell but to those who mount an engine for the first time and drive through the crowded thoroughfares of london at a wild tearing gallop it is probably the most exciting drive conceivable  it beats steeplechasing  it feels like driving to destructionso wild and so reckless is it  and yet it is not reckless in the strict sense of that word for there is a stern needbe in the case  every moment not to mention minutes or hours is of the utmost importance in the progress of a fire  fire smoulders and creeps at first it may be but when it has got the mastery and bursts into flames it flashes to its work and completes it quickly  at such times one moment of time lost may involve thousands of poundsay and many human lives  this is well known to those whose profession it is to fight the flames  hence the union of apparent mad desperation with cool quiet selfpossession in their proceedings  when firemen can work in silence they do so  no unnecessary word is uttered no voice is needlessly raised  like the movements of some beautiful steamengine which with oiled pistons cranks and levers does its unobtrusive work in its own little chamber in comparative stillness yet with a power that would tear and rend to pieces buildings and machinery so the firemen sometimes bend to their work quietly though with mind and muscles strung to the utmost point of tension  at other times like the roaring locomotive crashing through a tunnel or past a station their course is a tumultuous rush amid a storm of shouting and gesticulation  so was it on the present occasion  had the fire been distant they would have had to commence their gallop somewhat leisurely for fear of breaking down the horses but it was not far offnot much more than a couple of milesso they dashed round the corner of their own street at a brisk trot and swept into oxford street  here they broke into a gallop and here the noise of their progress began for the great thoroughfare was crowded with vehicles and pedestrians many of whom were retiring from the theatres and musichalls and other places of entertainment  to pass through such a crowd without coming into collision with anything required not only the most dexterous driving but rendered it necessary that some of the men on the engine should stand up and shout or rather roar incessantly as they whirled along clearing everything out of their way and narrowly escaping innumerable crashes by a mere hairbreadth  the men as we said before having been sailors seemed to shout with the memory of the boatswain strong upon them for their tones were pitched in the deepest and gruffest basskey  sometimes there was a lull for a moment as a comparatively clear space of a hundred yards or so lay before them then their voices rose like the roaring of the gale as a stupid or deaf cabman got in their way or a plethoric bus threatened to interrupt their furious passage  the cross streets were the points where the chief difficulties met them there the cab and van drivers turned into or crossed the great thoroughfare all ignorant of the thunderbolt that was rushing on like a fiery meteor with its lamps casting a glare of light before and the helmets of its stern charioteers flashing back the rays of streetlamps and windows for late though the hour was all the ginpalaces and tobacconists shops and many of the restaurants were still open and brightly illuminated  at the corner of wells street the crowd of cabs and other vehicles was so great that the driver of the engine began to tighten his reins and jim baxmore and joe corney raised their voices to a fierce shout  cabs busses and pedestrians scattered right and left in a marvellous manner the driver slackened his reins cracked his whip and the horses stretched out again  in passing berners street a hansom cab swept round the corner its dashing driver smoking a cigar in sublime selfsatisfaction and looking carelessly right and left for a fare  this exquisite almost ran into the engine  there was a terrific howl from all the firemen the cabby turned his smart horse with a bound to one side and lost his cigar in the actin reference to which misfortune he was heartily congratulated by a small member of the shoeblack brigadewhile the engine went steadily and sternly on its way  there it shows a light observed one of the firemen to dale as he pointed to a luminous appearance in the sky away to the northeast  dale was already looking in that direction and made no reply  as they reached tottenham court road the driver again checked the pace a little yet even at the reduced speed they passed everything like a whirlwind  the traffic here was so great that it behoved them to be more cautious  of course the more need that there was for caution the more necessity was there for shouting and the duty of baxmore and corneystanding as they did in front of their comrades beside the driverbecame severe but they had good lungs both of them  at the point where tottenham court road cuts oxford street the accumulation of vehicles of all sorts from a handbarrow to a furniturevan is usually very great  to one unaccustomed to the powers of london drivers it would have seemed nothing short of madness to drive full tilt into the mass that blocked the streets at this point but the firemen did it  they reined up a little it is true just as a hunter does in gathering his horse together for a rush at a stone wall but there was nothing like an approach to stopping  hi  hi  hi roared the firemen baxmore and corney high above the rest  a bus lumbered to the left just in time a hansom sprang to the right not a moment too soon a luggagevan bolted into crown street the pedestrians scattered right and left and the way was clearno not quite clear  the engine had to turn at a right angle here into tottenham court road  round it went on the two offwheels and came full swing on a marketgardener and a hotcoffee woman who were wheeling their respective barrows leisurely side by side and chatting as they went  the roar that burst from the firemen was terrific  the driver attempted both to pull up and to turn aside  the marketgardener dropt his barrow and fled  the hotcoffee woman being of a resolute nature thrust her barrow by main force on the footpath and so saved her goods and herself by a hairbreadth while the barrow of her friend was knocked in pieces but the effort of the enginedriver to avoid this had wellnigh resulted in serious consequences  in endeavouring to clear the marketgardener he drew so near to the footpath that in another moment a lamppost would have been carried away and the wheels of the engine in all probability knocked off had not joe corney observed the danger  with a truly irish yell joe seized the rein next him and pulled the horses round almost at a right angle  the nave of the hindwheel just shaved the post as it flew by  the whole thing passed so swiftly that before the marketgardener recovered from his consternation the engine was only discernible in the distance by the sparks that flew from its wheels as it held on in its furious way  all along its course a momentary disturbance of london equanimity was created  families not yet abed rushed to their front windows and looking out exclaimed ha the firemen  tipplers in ginpalaces ran to the doors and said there they go thats your sort hurrah my hearties or go it ye cripples according to the different stages of inebriation at which they had arrived and belated men of business stopped to gaze and then resumed their way with thoughts and speculations on fire and fire insurance more or less deep and serious according to temperament  but the disturbance was only temporary  the families retired to their suppers or beds the tipplers returned to their tipple the belated speculators to their dreams and in a few minutes no doubt forgot what they had seen and forgot perchance that they had any personal interest in fire raising or fire extinction or fire prevention or fire in any dangerous shape or form whatever or indulged in the comforting belief mayhap that whatever disasters might attend the rest of the london community they and their houses being endued with the properties of the salamander nothing in the shape of fire might could would or should kindle upon them  so true is it that all men think all men mortal but themselves  do you doubt this reader  if so go poll your acquaintance and tell us how many of them have got ropeladders or even ropes to escape from their houses should they take fire how many of them have got handpumps or even buckets placed so as to be handy in case of fire and how many of them have got their houses and furniture insured against fire  meanwhile the fireengine held on its way until it turned into beverly square and pulled short up in front of the blazing mansion of james auberly esquire  another engine was already at work there  it had come from a nearer station of the existence of which hopkins had been ignorant when he set out on his wild race for help  the men of this engine were already doing their work quietly but with perceptible effect pouring incessant streams of water in at the blazing windows and watching for the slightest lull in the ferocity of the smoke and flame to attack the enemy at closer quarters    chapter four  a fierce fight with the flames  when the small boywhose name it may be as well to mention was william alias willie willderssaw the fireengine start as has been already described his whole soul yearned to follow it for in the course of his short life he had never succeeded in being at the beginning of a fire although he had often been at the middle and end of onenot a very difficult thing in london by the way seeing that there are on the average between four and five fires every twentyfour hours  willie willders was of an enquiring disposition  he wanted to know how things were managed at a fire from the beginning to the end and he found that the course of true inquiry like another course we wot of never did run smooth  poor willies heart was with that engine but his legs were not  they did their best but they failed strong and active though they were to keep up with the horses  so willie heaved a bursting sigh and slackened his speedas he had often done before in similar circumstances resolving to keep it in sight as long as he could and trust to his eyesight and to the flames showing a light for the rest  just as he came to this magnanimous resolve a strapping young gentleman called a passing cab leaped in ordered the driver to follow the engine and offered double fare if he should keep it in view up to the fire  willie being sharp as a needle at once stepped forward and made as though he would open the door for the gentleman  the youth was already in and the door shut but he smiled as he shouted to the driver all right and tossed a copper to willie with the remark there you scamp  the copper fell in the mud and there willie left it as he doubled nimbly behind the vehicle and laid hold of it  the cabman did his best to earn his double fare and thus it came to pass that willie was in time to see the firemen commencing work  as the young man leaped from the cab he uttered a cry of surprise and alarm and rushed towards the crowd of firemen nearest to the burning house without paying his fare  willie was a little astonished at this but losing sight of the youth in the crowd and seeing nothing more of him at that time he became engrossed in other matters  there were so many men on the ground howeverfor just then a third engine dashed up to the scene of conflagrationthat it was difficult for the excited boy to appreciate fully what he saw  he got as close to the engine however as the policemen would allow him and observed that a fireplug had been already opened and over it had been placed a canvas cistern of about a yard long by eighteen inches broad stretched on an iron frame  the cistern was filled with water to overflowing and the first engine had placed its suctionpipe in it while from the front of the engine extended the leathern hose that conveyed the water to the burning house  willie was deeply interested in this and was endeavouring to solve certain knotty points in his own mind when they were suddenly solved for him by a communicative dustman who stood in the crowd close by and thus expounded the matter to his inquisitive son  you see tommy the use o the cistern is hobvious  see heres ow it lies  if an ingin comes up an screwges its suction on to the plug all the other ingins as comes after it has to stan by an do nuffin  but by puttin the cistern over the plug an lettin it fill another ingin or mabbe two more can ram in its suction and drink away till its fit to burst dye see  willie drank in the information with avidity and then turned his attention to the front of the engine to which several lengths of hose each forty feet long had been attached  baxmore and corney were at the extreme end screwing on the branch or nozzle by which the stream of water is directed and dale was tumbling a halfdrunk and riotous navvy headoverheels into the crowd in order to convince him that his services to pump were not wanteda sufficient number having been procured  a couple of policemen walked this navvy quietly from the scene as dale called out  down with her boys  pump away lads said one of the firemen interpreting  the volunteers bent their backs and the white clouds of steam that issued from the burning house showed that the second engine was doing its work well  immediately after dale and his men with the exception of those required to attend the engine and the branch were ordered to get out the ladders  he who gave this order was a tall sinewy man middleaged apparently and of grave demeanour  his dress was similar to that of the other firemen but there was an air of quiet unobtrusive authority about him which showed that he was a leader  we might get on the roof now mr braidwood suggested dale touching his helmet as he addressed the wellknown chief of the london fireengine establishment  not yet dale not yet said braidwood get inside and see if you can touch the fire through the drawingroom floor  its just fallen in  dale and his men at once entered the front door of the building dragging the branch and hose along with them and were lost in smoke  previous to the arrival of the fireengines however a scene had been enacted which willie willders had not witnessed  a fireescape was first to reach the burning house  this was then and still is usually the case owing to the fact that escapes are far more numerous in london than engines so that the former being always close at hand often accomplish their great work of saving life before the engines make their appearance  the escape in the immediate neighbourhood of beverly square was under the charge of conductor samuel forest a man who although young had already saved many lives in the service of the society for the protection of life from fire  when forest reached the field of action mr james auberly was seen at an upper window in a state of undignified dishabille shouting for help and half suffocated with smoke with mrs rose hanging round his neck on one side and matty merryon at the other  poor auberly having tried the staircase on the first alarm was driven back by smoke and rushed wildly to the window where the two domestics descending in terror from their attic clung to him and rendered him powerless  forest at once pitched his escapewhich was just a huge scientificallyconstructed ladder set on wheels  the head of it reached to the windows of the second floor  by pulling a rope attached to a lever he raised a second ladder of smaller size which was fitted to the head of the large one  the top of this second ladder was nearly sixty feet from the ground and it reached the window at which mr auberly was still shouting  forest at once sprang up  leave me save the women gasped auberly as a man entered the room but the dense smoke overpowered him as he spoke and he fell forward the women also sank to the ground  forest instantly seized mrs rose in his powerful arms and hurrying down the ladder to the top of the escape put her into the canvas trough or sack which was suspended below the ladder all the way  down this she slid somewhat violently but safely to the ground while forest ran up again and rescued matty in the same way  mr auberly was more difficult to manage being a heavy man and his rescuer was almost overpowered by the thick smoke in the midst of which all this was done  he succeeded however but fainted on reaching the ground  it was at this point that the first engine arrived and only a few minutes elapsed when the second made its appearance followed by the cab from which the young man leapt with the exclamation of surprise and alarm that had astonished willie willders  pushing his way to the place where mr auberly and the others lay the youth fell on his knees  my father he exclaimed wildly  hes all right lad said mr braidwood coming up at that moment and laying his hand kindly on the youths shoulder hes only choked with smoke and will be better in a minute  any more in the house he added quickly  young auberly leaped up with a shout  my sister is she not saved  are all here  he waited not for a reply but in another moment was on the fireescape  after him two of you said braidwood turning to his men  two at once obeyed  in fact they had leaped forward almost before the brief command was uttered  one of these firemen was conspicuous for his height and strength  he was first up the ladder  close upon him followed baxmore with a lantern  nothing but smoke had yet reached the room into which young auberly entered so that he instantly found himself in impenetrable darkness and was almost choked as well as blinded  have a care frank the floor must be about gone by this time said baxmore as he ran after his tall comrade  the man whom he called frank knew this  he also knew that it was not likely any one had been left in the room from which the master of the house had been rescued and he thought it probable that his daughter would occupy a room on the same floor with her father  acting on this supposition and taking for granted that the room they were about to enter was mr auberlys bedroom the tall fireman dashed at once through the smoke and tumbled over the prostrate form of young auberly  look after him baxmore he gasped as he seized the lamp from his comrades hand and darted across the room and out into the passage where he went crash against a door and burst it open  here the smoke was not so dense so that he could breathe though with difficulty  one glance showed him where the bed was  he felt it  a female form was lying on it  the light weight and the long hair which swept across his face as he raised it gently but swiftly on his shoulder told him that it was that of a girl  at that moment he heard a loud shout from the crowd which was followed by a crash  dashing once more across the passage he saw that a lurid flame was piercing the smoke in the other room  the staircase he knew was impassable probably gone by that time but he had not time to think so he drew the blanket over the girls head and bounded towards the window  there was a feeling of softness under his feet as if the floor were made of pasteboard  he felt it sinking beneath him  down it went just as he laid hold of the head of the fireescape from which he hung suspended in the midst of the smoke and sparks that rose from the falling ruin  strong though the young fireman was he could not raise himself by one arm while the other was twined round louisa auberly  at that moment baxmore having carried young auberly down in safety again ascended and appeared at the window  he seized frank by the hair of the head  let go my hair and catch the girl shouted frank  all right said baxmore seizing loo and lifting her over the window sill  frank being thus relieved swung himself easily on the sill and grasping loo once more descended to the street where he was met by mr auberly who had recovered from his state of partial suffocation and who seized his child and hurried with her into a neighbouring house thither he was followed by mrs rose and matty who had also recovered  during these episodes the firemen had continued at their work with cool and undistracted attention  and here the value of organisation was strikingly and beautifully brought out for while the crowd swayed to and fro now breathless with anxiety lest the efforts of the bold conductor of the fireescape should fail anon wild with excitement and loud in cheers when he succeeded each fireman paid devoted and exclusive attention to his own prescribed piece of duty as if nothing else were going on around him and did it with all his mightwell knowing that every other piece of work was done or point of danger guarded by a comrade while the eagle eyes of mr braidwood and his not less watchful foremen superintended all observed and guided as it were the field of battle  and truly good generalship was required for the foe was fierce and furious  the devouring element rushed onward like a torrent  the house was large and filled with rich furniture which was luxurious food for the flames as they swept over the walls twined round the balustrades swallowed the paintings devoured the woodwork and melted the metal in their dread progress  but the foe that met them was on this occasion more than a match for the flames  it was a handtohand encounter  the men followed them foot by foot inch by inchsometimes almost singeing their beards or being wellnigh choked and blinded by dense volumes of smoke but if driven back always returning to the charge  the heat at times beat on their helmets so fiercely that they were forced to turn their faces aside and halfturn their backs on the foe but they always kept their weaponsthe branchesto the front and continued to discharge upon him tons and tons of aqueous artillery  get up to the windows now use the escape said mr braidwood and as he said this he passed through the doorway of the burning house  some of the men rushed up the escape and let down a line to which one of the branches was made fast  avast pumpin number two shouted baxmore from the midst of clouds of smoke that were bursting out from the window  number two engine was stopped  its branch was pulled up and pointed inside straight at the fire the signal given down with number two and a hiss was followed by volumes of steam  the work of extinction had at last begun in real earnest  as long as they could only stand in the street and throw water in through the windows at haphazard they might or might not hit the fireand at all events they could not attack its strong points but now baxmore at one window and one of the men of the first engine at another played pointblank into the flames and wherever the water hit they were extinguished  presently they got inside and began to be able to see through the smoke a blue glimmer became visible the branch was pointed and it was gone  by this time the second floor had partly given way and fire was creeping down the rafters to the eaves of the house  baxmore observed this and pointed the branch straight up  the fire at that part was put out and a heavy shower of water fell back on the fireman drenching him to the skin  the attack had now become general  the firemen swarmed in at the doors and windows the moment that it was possible for a human being to breathe the smoke and live  one of the engines attached two additional lengths of hose dragged the branch through the first floor to the back of the house got upon an outhouse in at a back window and attacked the foe in rear  on the roof frank and dale were plying their hatchets their tall figures sharply defined against the wintry sky and looking more gigantic than usual  the enemy saved them the trouble of cutting through however for it suddenly burst upwards and part of the roof fell in  it would certainly have taken frank prisoner had not dale caught him by the collar and dragged him out of danger  instantly a branch was pointed downwards and the foe was beaten back from above below before and behind it was now met with deluges of water which fell on the shoulders of the men in the lower floor in a continuous hot shower while they stood ankledeep in hot water  in ten minutes after this the fire was effectually subdued the lower floor having been saved although its contents were severely damaged by water  it was only necessary now that one of the engines should remain for a time to make good the victory  the others rolled up their hose and prepared to depart  the king street engine was the first to quit the field of battle  while the men were getting ready mr auberly muffled in a long cloak stepped from the crowd and touched frank the tall fireman on the shoulder  sir said he in a low voice you saved my child  i would show my sense of gratitude  will you accept of this purse  frank shook his head and a smile played on his smokebegrimed countenance as he said  no mr auberly  i am obliged to you but i cannot accept of it  i do not want it and besides the men of the brigade are not allowed to take money  but you will let me do something for you urged mr auberly  is there nothing that i can do  nothing sir said frank  he paused for a moment and then resumedwell there is something that perhaps you could do sir  i have a little brother out of employment if you could get him a situation sir  i will said mr auberly with emotion  send him to me on thursday forenoon  he will find me living next door to myto my late home  i shall stay with a friend there for some time  goodnight  men of king street engine get up cried dale  staywhat is your name said mr auberly turning round  but frank was gone  he had leaped to his place on the engine and was off at a rattling pace through the now silent and deserted streets of the sleeping city  although they drove on at great speed there was no shouting now for neither bus cab nor footpassenger blocked up the way and the men begrimed with smoke and charcoal wet and weary with two hours of almost uninterrupted labour of a severe as well as dangerous character sat or stood in their places in perfect silence  on reaching the firestation they leaped to the ground and all went quickly and silently to their neighbouring homes and beds except the two men on duty  these changing their coats and boots lay down on the trestles and at once fell fast asleepthe engine and horses having been previously housedand then dale sat down to make an entry of the event in his daybook  the whole thing might have been only a vivid dream so silent was the room and so devoid of any evidence of recent excitement while the reigning tranquillity was enhanced rather than decreased by the soft breathing of the sleepers the ticking of the clock and the scratching of dales pen as he briefly recorded the facts of the fire that night in beverly square    chapter five  willie willders in difficulties  during the progress of the fire small willie willders was in a state of the wildest we might almost say hilarious excitement he regarded not the loss of property the fire never struck him in that light  his little body and big spirit rejoiced in the whole affair as a magnificent display of fireworks and heroism  when the fire burst through the library windows he shouted when sam forest the conductor of the fireescape saved mr auberly and the women he hurrahed when the tall fireman and baxmore rescued louisa auberly he cheered and cheered again until his shrill voice rose high above the shouting of the crowd  when the floors gave way he screamed with delight and when the roof fell in he shrieked with ecstasy  sundry and persevering were the efforts he made to break through the police by fair means and foul but in his energy he overreached himself for he made himself so conspicuous that the police paid special attention to him and wherever he appeared he was snubbed and thrust back so that his great desire to get close to the men while they were at work was frustrated  willie had a brother who was a fireman and he wished earnestly that he might recognise him if present but he knew that being attached to the southern district of the city he was not likely to be there and even if he were the men were all so much alike in their uniform that it was impossible at a distance to distinguish one from another  true it is that his brother was uncommonly tall and very strong but as the london firemen were all picked men many of them were very tall and all of them were strong  not until the last engine left the ground did willie willders think it advisable to tear himself away and hasten to his home in notting hill where he found his mother sitting up for him in a state of considerable anxiety  she forebore to question him that night however  when willie appeared next morningor rather the same morning for it was nearly four oclock when he went to bedhe found his mother sitting by the fire knitting a sock  mrs willders was a widow and was usually to be found seated by the fire knitting a sock or darning one or mending some portion of male attire  so you were at a fire last night willie said the widow  yes i was replied the boy going up to his mother and giving her what he styled a roystering kiss which she appeared to like although she was scarcely able to bear it being thin and delicately formed and somewhat weak from bad health  no lives lost i hope willie  no there aint often lives lost when sam forest the fireescapeman is there  you know forest mother the man that weve heard so much of ah it was sitch fun  youve no notion  it would have made you split your sides wi laughin if youd seen sam come out o the smoke carryin the master o the house on his shoulder in his shirt and drawers with only one sock on an his nightcap tied so tight under his chin that they had to cut it offhim in a swound too hangin as limp as a dead eel on sams shoulder with his head down one side an his legs down the other  oh it was a lark  the boy recalled the lark to his own mind so vividly that he had to stop at this point in order to give vent to an uproarious fit of laughter  was frank there inquired the widow when the fit subsided  not that i know of mother i looked hard for him but didnt see him there was lots o men big enough to be him but i couldnt get near enough to see for the bobbies  i wonder what them bobbies were made for continued willie with a look of indignation as he seated himself at the table and began to eat a hearty breakfast the long lampposts that are always in the way when nobody wants em  i do believe they was invented for nothin else than to aggravate small boys and snub their inquiring minds  where was the fire willie  in beverly square  i say mother if that there grocer dont send us better stuff than this here bacon in future illill have to give him up  i cant afford to get better dear said the widow meekly  i know that mother but he could afford to give better  however its down now so it dont much matter  did you hear whose house was burned willie  a mr oberly or somethin like that  auberly exclaimed the widow with a start  well praps it is auberly but whichever it is hes got a pretty kettle o fish to look after this mornin  you seem to have heard of him before mother  yes willie ii know him aat least i have met with him often  you see i was better off once and used to mingle withbut i need not trouble you with that  on the strength of our former acquaintance i thought i would write and ask him to get you a situation in an office and i have got a letter from him just before you came down to breakfast saying that he will do what he can and bidding me send you to him between eleven and twelve tomorrow  whew whistled willie an he burnt out o house and home without a coat to his back or a shoe to his foot  it strikes me ill have to try to get him a situation  he wont be found at the house now i dare say my son so well have to wait a little but the burning of his house and furniture wont affect him much for hes rich  humph praps not said willie but the burnin of his little girl might have  you said that no lives were lost cried mrs willders turning pale  no more there was mother but if it hadnt bin for one o the firemen that jumped in at a blazin winder an brought her out through fire an smoke shed have bin a cinder by this time an money wouldnt have bought the rich man another daughter i know  true my son observed mrs willders resting her forehead on her hand then as if suddenly recollecting something she looked up and said willie i want you to go down to the city with these socks to frank  this is his birthday and i sat late last night on purpose to get them finished  his station is a long way off i know but youve nothing else to do so  nothin else to do mother exclaimed willie with an offended look havent i got to converse in a friendly way with all the crossinsweepers an shoeblacks an stallwomen as i go along an chaff the cabbies an look in at all the shopwindows and insult the bobbies  i always insult the bobbies  it does me good  i hurt em mentally as much as i can an id hurt em bodily if i could  but every dog has his day  when i grow up wont i pitch into em  he struck the table with his fist and shaking back his curly hair lifted his blue eyes to his mothers face with a stern expression which gradually relaxed into a smile  ah you neednt grin mother an tell me that the policemen are a fine set of men and quite as brave and useful in their way as the firemen  i know all you respectable sort of people think that but i dont  theyre my natural enemies and i hate em  come mother give me the socks and let me be off  soon the vigorous urchin was on his way to the city whistling as usual with all his might  as he passed the corner of the british museum a hand touched him on the shoulder and its owner said  how much are ye paid a week lad for kicking up such a row  willie looked round and his eyes encountered the brass buckle of the waistbelt of a tall strapping fellow in a blue uniform  glancing upwards he beheld the handsome countenance of his brother frank looking down at him with a quiet smile  he wore no helmet for except when attending a fire the firemen wear a sailorlike blue cloth cap  hallo blazes is that you cried the boy  just so willie goin down to watling street to attend drill  willie who had styled his brother blazes ever since he joined the fire brigade observed that he happened to be going in the same direction to deliver a message from his mother to a relation which he would not speak about however just then as he wished to tell him of a fire he had been at last night  a fire lad was it a big one  ay that it was a case o burninout almost and there were lives saved said the boy with a look of triumph and thats more than you can say youve seen though you are a fireman  well you know i have not been long in the brigade willie and as the escapes often do their work before the engines come up ive not had much chance yet of seeing lives saved  how was it done  with glowing eyes and flushed cheeks willie at once launched out into a vivid description of the scene he had so recently witnessed and dwelt particularly on the brave deeds of conductor forest and the tall fireman  suddenly he looked up at his brother  why what are you chucklin at blazes  nothing lad  was the fireman very tall  that he certainly wasuncommon tall  something like me said frank  a gleam of intelligence shot across the boys face as he stopped and caught his brother by the sleeve saying earnestly  it wasnt you frank was it  it was willie and right glad am i to have been in such good luck as to save miss auberly  willie grasped his brothers hand and shook it heartily  youre a brick blazes said he and this is your birthday an i wish you luck an long life my boy  youll do me credit yet if you go on as youve begun  now ill go right away back an tell mother wont she be fit to bust  but what about your message to the relation in the city inquired frank  that relation is yourself and heres the message in the shape of a pair o socks from mother knitted with her own hands and by the way that reminds mehow came you to be at the fire last night  its a long way from your station  ive been changed recently said frank poor grove was badly hurt about the loins at a fire in new bond street last week and i have been sent to take his place so im at the king street station now  but i have something more to tell you before you go lad so walk with me a bit farther  willie consented and frank related to him his conversation with mr auberly in reference to himself  i thought of asking leave and running out this afternoon to tell you so its as well we have met as it willwhy what are you chuckling at willie  this question was put in consequence of the boys eyes twinkling and his cheeks reddening with suppressed merriment  never mind blazes  i havent time to tell you just now  ill tell you some other time  so old auberly wants to see me tomorrow forenoon  thats what he said to me returned frank  very good ill go  adoo blazesfarewell  so saying willie willders turned round and went off at a run chuckling violently  he attempted to whistle once or twice but his mouth refused to retain the necessary formation so he contented himself with chuckling instead  and it is worthy of record that that small boy was so much engrossed with his own thoughts on this particular occasion that he did not make one observation bad good or indifferent to any one during his walk home  he even received a question from a boy smaller than himself as to whether his mother knew he was out without making any reply and passed innumerable policemen without even a thought of vengeance  let me see said he muttering to himself as he paused beside the marble arch at hyde park and leaned his head against the railings of that structure mr auberly has been an ordered two boys to be sent to him tomorrow forenoonha he sk  the chuckling got the better of him herevery good  an my mother has ordered one o the boys to go while a tall fireman has ordered the other  now the question is which o the two boys am ithe one or the totherha sk ho  well of course both o the boys will go they cant help it theres no gittin over that but then which of em will git the situation theres a scruncher for you mr auberly  youll have to fill your house with tar an turpentine an set fire to it over again afore youll throw light on that pint  spose i should go in for both situations  it might be managed  the first boy could take a wellpaid situation as a clerk an the second boy might go in for nightwatchman at a bank  chuckling again interrupted the flow of thought praps the two situations might be got in the same place o business that would be handy  oh if one o the boys could only be a girl what a lark that wouldsk ha ha  he was interrupted at this point by a shoeblack who remarked to his companion  i say bob eres a lark  eres a feller bin an got out o bedlam a larfin at nothink fit to burst hisself  so willie resumed his walk with a chuckle that fully confirmed the member of the black brigade in his opinion  he went home chuckling and went to bed chuckling without informing his mother of the cause of his mirth  chuckling he arose on the following morning and chuckling still went at noon to beverly square where he discovered mr auberly standing gaunt and forlorn in the midst of the ruins of his once elegant mansion    chapter six  when one is another who is which  well boy what do you want  have you anything to say to me  mr auberly turned sharp round on willie whose gaze had gone beyond the length of simple curiosity  in fact he was awestruck at the sight of such a very tall and very dignified man standing so grimly in the midst of such dreadful devastation  please sir i was sent to you sir by  oh youre the boy the son ofthat is to say you were sent to me by your mother said mr auberly with a frown  well sir replied willie hesitating iiwas sent byby  ah i see interrupted mr auberly with a smile that was meant to be gracious you were sent by a fireman you are not thethei mean youre the other boy  poor willie being of a powerfully risible nature found it hard to contain himself on hearing his own words of the previous evening reechoed thus unexpectedly  his face became red and he took refuge in blowing his nose during which processhaving observed the smile on mr auberlys facehe resolved to be the other boy  yes sir he said looking up modestly i was sent by a fireman i am the other boy  mr auberly smiled again grimly and said that the fireman was a brave fellow and that he had saved his daughters life and that he was very glad to do anything that lay in his power for him and that he understood that willie was the firemans brother to which the boy replied that he was  well then come this way continued mr auberly leading willie into the library of the adjoining house which his friend had put at his disposal and seating himself at a writingtable  you want a situation of some sorta clerkship i suppose  willie admitted that his ambition soared to that tremendous height  let me see muttered mr auberly taking up a pen and beginning to write yes she will be able to help me  what is your name boy  willie sir  just so william and your surnameyour other name  willders sir  mr auberly started and looked willie full in the eyes  willie feeling that he was playing a sort of double part without being able to avoid it grew red in the face  what did you say boy  willders replied willie stoutly  then youre not the other boy said mr auberly laying down his pen and regarding willie with a frown  please sir replied willie with a look of meekness which was mingled with a feeling of desperation for his desire to laugh was strong upon him please sir i dont rightly know which boy i am  mr auberly paused for a moment  boy youre a fool  thank ee sir said willie  this reply went a long way in mr auberlys mind to prove the truth of his assertion  answer me boy said mr auberly with an impressive look and tone were you sent here by a fireman  yes sir replied willie  what is his name  same as mine sirwillders  of course of course said mr auberly a little confused at having put such an unnecessary question  does your mother know youre here  this brought the slang phrase does your mother know youre out so forcibly to the boys mind that he felt himself swell internally and had recourse again to his pockethandkerchief as a safetyvalve  yes sir said he on recovering his composure arter i saw blazes frank i mean thats my brother siri goes right away home to bed  i stops with my mother sir an she saw me come off here this mornin sir  she knows i was comin here  of course yes yes i see muttered mr auberly again taking up his pen  i see yes yes same namestrange coincidence though but after all there are many of that name in london  i suppose the other boy will be here shortly  very odd very odd indeed  please sir observed willie in a gentle tone you said i was the other boy sir  mr auberly seemed a little annoyed at his muttered words being thus replied to yet he condescended to explain that there was another boy of the same name whom he expected to see that morning  oh then theres another other boy sir said willie with a look of interest  hold your tongue said mr auberly in a sharp voice youre a fool and youre much too fond of speaking  i advise you to keep your tongue quieter if you wish to get on in life  willie once more sought relief in his pockethandkerchief while his patron indited and sealed an epistle which he addressed to miss tippet number 6 poorthing lane beverly square  here boy take this to the lady to whom it is addressedthe lane is at the opposite corner of the squareand wait an answer  am i to bring the answer back to you sir asked willie with much humility  no the answer is for yourself said mr auberly testily and hark ee boy you need not trouble me again  that note will get you all you desire  thank you sir said willie making a bow and preparing to retire but please sir i dont very well know that is to sayahem  well boy said the patron sternly  excuse me sir i cant help it you know but please sir i wish to explain about that other boyno thats me but the other other boy you know  begone boy cried mr auberly in a voice so stern that willie found himself next moment in the street along which he ran chuckling worse than ever  a little reflection might have opened mr auberlys eyes to the truth in regard to willie but a poor relation was to him a disagreeable subject of contemplation and he possessed the faculty in an eminent degree of dismissing it altogether from his mind  having care enough on his mind at that time poor man he deliberately cast the confusion of the two boys out of his thoughts and gave himself up to matters more interesting and personal  we may add here that mrs willders was faithful to her promise and never more addressed her brotherinlaw by word or letter  when willie afterwards told her and frank of the absurdity of his interview and of the violent manner in which mr auberly had dismissed him when he was going to explain about the other boy his mother thought it best to let things rest as they stood yet she often wondered in her own quiet way what mr auberly would think of her and of the nonappearance of the other boy and she felt convinced that if he only put things together he must come to understand that willie and frank were her sons  but mrs willders did not know of the beforementioned happy facility which her kinsman possessed of forgetting poor relations so after wondering on for a time she ceased to wonder or to think about it at all    chapter seven  thoughts in regard to men  miss emelina tippet was a maiden lady of pleasing countenance and exceedingly uncertain age  she was a poor member of a poor branch of an aristocratic family and feeling an unconquerable desire to breathe if not the pure unadulterated atmosphere of beverly square at least as much of it as was compatible with a very moderate income she rented a small house in a very dark and dismal lane leading out of that great centre of refinement  it is true that beverly square was not exactly the west end but there are many degrees of westendiness so to speak in the western neighbourhood of london and this square was in the opinion of miss tippet the westendiest place she knew because there dwelt in it not only a very genteel and uncommonly rich portion of the community but several of her own aristocratic though distant relations among whom was mr auberly  the precise distance of the relationship between them had never been defined and all records bearing on it having been lost in the mists of antiquity it could not now be ascertained but miss tippet laid claim to the relationship and as she was an obliging goodhumoured chatty and musical lady mr auberly admitted the claim  miss tippets only weaknessfor she was indeed a most estimable woman was a tendency to allow rank and position to weigh too much in her esteem  she had also a sensitive abhorrence of everything low and vulgar which would have been of course a very proper feeling had she not fallen into the mistake of considering humble birth lowness and want of polish vulgaritya mistake which is often sometimes even wilfully made by persons who consider themselves much wiser than miss tippet but who are not wise enough to see a distinct shade of true vulgarity in their own sentiments  the dark dismal lane named poorthing lane besides forming an asylum for decayed and wouldbe aristocrats and a vestibule as it were to beverly square was a convenient retreat for sundry greengrocers and publichouse keepers and small tradespeople who supplied the denselypeopled surrounding district and even some of the inhabitants of beverly square itself with the necessaries of life  it was also a thoroughfare for the gay equipages of the square which passed through it daily on their way to and from the adjoining stables thereby endangering the lives of precocious babies who could crawl but could not walk away from home as well as affording food for criticism and scandal not to mention the leaving behind of a species of secondhand odour of gentility such as coachmen and footmen can give forth  miss tippets means being small she rented a proportionately small residence consisting of two floors which were the upper portion of a house whose ground floor was a toyshop  the owner of the toyshop david boone was miss tippets landlord but not the owner of the tenement  he rented the whole and sublet the upper portion  miss tippets parlour windows commanded a near view of the lodging opposite into every corner and crevice of which she could have seen had not the windows been encrusted with impenetrable dirt  her own domestic arrangements were concealed from view by small green venetian blinds which rose from below and met the large venetians which descended from above  the good ladys bedroom windows in the upper floor commanded a near viewmuch too nearof a stack of chimneys between which and another stack farther over she had a glimpse of part of the gable end of a house and the topmost bough of a tree in beverly square  it was this prospect into paradise terrestrially speaking that influenced miss tippet in the choice of her abode  when william willders reached the small door of number 6 poorthing lane and raised his hand to knock the said door opened as if it had been trained to admit visitors of its own accord and miss matty merryon issued forth followed by a bright blueeyed girl of about twelve years of age  well boy was ye comin here inquired matty as the lad stepped aside to let them pass  yes i was  does miss tippet live here  she does boy what dye want with her  i want to see her young ooman so youd better cut away up an tell her a genlmn requests a few words private conversation with her  the little girl laughed at this speech and matty addressing willie as a dirty spalpeen said he had better go with her to a shop first and shed then take him back and introduce him to miss tippet  you see i cant let ye in all be yer lone cushla for what would the neighbours say you know  im only goin to the toyshop an wont kape ye a minit for miss emma dont take long to her bargains  willie might probably have demurred to this delay but on hearing that the blueeyed girl wanted to make purchases he at once agreed to the proposal and followed them into the toyshop  david boone who stepped out of the backshop to serve them was if we may say so very unlike his trade  a grave tall longlegged longnosed rawboned melancholylooking creature such as he might have been an undertaker or a mute or a sexton or a policeman or a horseguardsman or even a lawyer but it was the height of impropriety to have made him a toyshopman and whoever did it had no notion whatever of the fitness of things  one could not resist the idea that his clumsy legs would certainly upset the slender wooden toys with which the floor and counters were covered and his fingers seemed made to break things  the figure of punch which hung from the ceiling appeared inclined to hit him as he passed to and fro and the pretty little dolls with the sweet pink faces and very flaxen hair and cerulean eyes were evidently laughing at him  nevertheless david boone was a kindhearted man very fond of children and extremely unlike in some respects what people imagined him at first sight to be  well miss ward what can i supply you with today said he blandly  please mr boone i want a slate and a piece of slatepencil  emma looked up with a sweet smile at the tall shopman who looked down upon her with grave benignity as he produced the articles required  dyou kape turpentine said matty as they were about to quit the shop  boone started and said almost testily no i dont  why do you ask  sure theres no sin in askin replied matty in surprise at the mans changed manner  of courseof course not rejoined boone with a slight look of confusion as he made a sudden assault with his pockethandkerchief on the cat which was sleeping innocently in the window git out o that you brute youre always agoin in the winder capsizin things  there youve been an sat on the face o that ere wax doll till youve amost melted it  out o that with you  no miss merryon he added turning to the girl with his wonted urbanity i dont keep turpentine and i was only surprised you should ask for it in a toyshop but youll get it of mr white next door  i dont believe theres anythink in the world as he cant supply to his customers  david boone bowed them out and then reentered the backshop shaking his head slowly from side to side  i dont like iti dont even like to think of it gorman he said to a big lowbrowed man who sat smoking his pipe beside the little fireplace the fire in which was so small that its smoke scarcely equalled in volume that of the pipe he smoked no i dont like it and i wont do it  well well you can please yourself said gorman knocking the ashes out of his pipe and placing it in his vest pocket as he rose and buttoned his thick peajacket up to the chin but ill tell you what it is if you are a descendant of the hunter of the far west that you boast so much about its precious little of his pluck that youve got an so i tell ee to your face david boone  all ive got to say is that youd better be wise and take my advice and think better of it  so saying gorman went out and slammed the door after him  meanwhile miss matty merryon having purchased a small phial of turpentine returned to number 6 and ushered willie willders into the presence of her mistress  miss emelina tippet was neither tall nor stiff nor angular nor bony on the contrary she was little and plump and not badlooking  and people often wondered why miss tippet was miss tippet and was not mrs somebodyelse  whatever the reason was miss tippet never divulged it so we wont speculate about it here  a note boy from mr auberly exclaimed miss tippet with a beaming smile give it methank you  she opened it and read attentively while master willie glanced round the parlour and took mental notes  miss emma ward sat down on a stool in the window ostensibly to do sums but really to draw faces all of which bore a strong caricatured resemblance to willie at whom she glanced slyly over the top of her slate  matty remained standing at the door to hear what the note was about she did not pretend to busy herself about anything  there was no subterfuge in matty  she had been miss tippets confidential servant before entering the service of mr auberly and her extremely short stay in beverly square had not altered that condition  she had come to feel that she had a right to know all miss tippets affairs and so waited for information  ah exclaimed miss tippet still reading yes get him a situation in your brothers office oh certainly ill be sure to get that he seems smart i might almost say impu ahem  yes well  boy said miss tippet turning suddenly to willie your name is william willders i believe  yes maam  well william mr auberly my relative asks me to get you into my brothersmy brothers whats is nameoffice  of course i shall be happy to try  i am always extremely happy to do anything foryes i suppose of course you can write and what dye call itcountyou can do arithmetic  yes maam replied willie  and you can spelleh  i hope you can spell edward ai mean thomasis it or william  miss tippet looked at willie so earnestly and put this question in tones so solemn that he was much impressed and felt as if all his earthly hopes hung on his reply so he admitted that he could spell  good continued miss tippet  you are i suppose in rather poor circumstances  is your father poor  hes dead maam was drowned  oh shocking thats very sad  was your mother drowned too  no maam shes alive and wellat least shes well for her but she ant over strong  thats why i want to get work that i may help her and she wants me to be a clerk in a office but id rather be a fireman you couldnt make me a fireman could you maam  at this point willie caught miss ward gazing intently at him over the top of her slate so he threw her into violent confusion by winking at her  no boy i cant make you a fireman  strange wishwhy dyou want to be one  cause its such jolly fun replied willie with real enthusiasm reglar bangin crashin sort o workas good as fightin any day an my brother franks a fireman  such a one too youve no notion six fut four he is an as strong asoh why maam he could take you up in one hand maam an twirl you round his head like an old hat  he was at the fire in beverly square last night  this speech was delivered with such vehemence contained so many objectionable sentiments and involved such a dreadful supposition in regard to the treatment of miss tippets person that the worthy lady was shocked beyond all expression  the concluding sentence however diverted her thoughts  ah was he indeed at that sad fire and did he help to put it out  sure an he did more than that exclaimed matty regarding the boy with sudden interest  if that was yer brother that saved miss loo hes a raal man  saved loo cried miss tippet was it your brother that saved loo  yes maam it was  bless him he is a noble fellow and i have great pleasure in taking you by the hand for his sake  miss tippet suited the action to the word and seized willies hand which she squeezed warmly  matty merryon with tears in her eyes embraced him and said that she only wished she had the chance of embracing his brother too  then they all said he must stay to lunch as it was about lunchtime and miss tippet added that he deserved to have been born in a higher position in lifeat least his brother did which was the same thing for he was a true whatsisname who ought to be crowned with thingumyjigs  emma who had latterly been looking at willie with deepening respect immediately crowned him with laurels on the slate and then matty rushed away for the lunchtrayrejoicing in the fire that had sent her back so soon to the old mistress whom she never wanted to leave that had afforded scope for the display of such heroism and had brought about altogether such an agreeable state of unwonted excitation  just as the party were on the point of sitting down to luncheon the streetdoor knocker was applied to the door with an extremely firm touch  miss deemas exclaimed miss tippet  oh  im so glad  rush matty  matty rushed and immediately there was a sound on the wooden passage as of a gentleman with heavy boots  a moment later and matty ushered in a very tall broadshouldered strapping lady if we may venture to use that expression in reference to one of the fair sex  miss deemas was a sort of human eagle  she had an eagle eye an aquiline nose an eagle flounce and an eagle heart  going up to miss tippet she put a hand on each of her shoulders and stooping down pecked her so to speak on each cheek  how are you my dear said miss deemas not by any means tenderly but much in the tone in which one would expect to have ones money or ones life demanded  quite well dear julia and so glad to see you  it is so good of you to take me by surprise this way just at lunchtime too  another plate and knife matty  this is a little boya friendnot exactly a friend but aa thingumy you know  no i dont know emelina what is the precise thingumy you refer to this time said the uncompromising and matteroffact miss deemas  youre so particular dear julia replied miss tippet with a little sigh a whatsisn a protege you know  indeed said miss deemas regarding willie with a severe frown as if in her estimation all proteges were necessarily villains  yes dear julia and would you believe it that this boys brotherinlaw  brother maam interrupted willie  yes brother actually saved my darlings life last night at thethe thing in beverly square  what darlings life and what thing in beverly square demanded miss deemas  what have you not heard of the fire last night in beverly squaremy relative james auberlyliving there with his familyall burnt to ashesand my sweet loo too  a whatsisname was brought and a brave fireman went up it through fire and water and smoke  young auberly went up before him and fellheat and suffocationand saved her in his arms and his name is frank and hes this boys brotherinlaw  to this brief summary given with much excitement miss deemas listened with quiet composure and then said with grim sarcasm and very slowly  let me see there was a fire in beverly square last night and james auberly living there with his family were all burned to ashes  miss tippet here interrupted with no no but her stern friend imposing silence with an eagle look continued  all burned to ashes and also your sweet loo  a whatshisname having been brought a brave fireman goes up it and apparently never comes down again burned to ashes also i fancy but young auberly who went up before him and fellheat and suffocation being the result saved some one named her in his arms his name being frank owing no doubt to his having been rebaptised for ever since i knew him he has been named frederick and he is this boys brotherinlaw  by way of putting an extremely fine point on her sarcasm miss deemas turned to willie with a very condescending air and said  pray when did your sister marry mr frederick auberly  willie with a face of meekness that can only be likened to that of a young turtledove replied  please maam it isnt my sister as has married mr auberly but its my brother frank willders as hopes to marry miss loo auberly on account o havin saved her life wen she comes of age maam  miss deemas stood aghast or rather sat aghast on receiving this reply and scanned willies face with one of her most eagle glances but that small piece of impudence wore an expression of weak goodnature and winked its eyes with the humility of a subdued pup while miss tippet looked halfhorrified and halfamused matty grinned and emma squeaked through her nose  boy said miss deemas severely your looks belie you  yes maam answered willie my mother always said i wasnt half so bad as i looked and shes aware that im absent from home  at this point willie allowed a gleam of intelligence to shoot across his face and he winked to emma who thereupon went into private convulsions in her handkerchief  emelina said miss deemas solemnly let me warn you against that boy he is a bad specimen of a bad sex  he is a precocious type of that base domineering proud and perfidious creature that calls itself lord of creation and which in virtue of its superior physical power takes up every position in life worth having except that of wife and mother meekly suggested miss tippet worth having repeated the eagle sternly as if the position of wife and mother were not worth having worth having and leaves nothing for poor weakbodied though not weakminded woman to do except sew and teach brats  bah  i hate men and they hate me i know it and i would not have it otherwise i wish they had never been made  i wish there had been none in the world but women  what a blessed world it would have been then  miss deemas hit the table with her hand in a masculine manner so forcibly that the plates and glasses rattled then she resumed for she was now on a favourite theme and was delivering a lecture to a select audience  but mark you im not going to be put down by men  i mean to fight em with their own weapons  i mean to  she paused suddenly at this point and descending from her platform advised miss tippet to dismiss the boy at once  poor miss tippet prepared to do so  she was completely under the power of miss deemas whom strange to say she loved dearly  she really believed that they agreed with each other on most points although it was quite evident that they were utterly opposed to each other in everything  wherein the bond lay no philosopher could discover possibly it lay in the fact that they were absolute extremes and in verification of the proverb had met  be this as it may a note was quickly written to her brother thomas tippet esquire which was delivered to willie with orders to take it the following evening to london bridge in the neighbourhood of which mr tippet dwelt and carried on his business    chapter eight  a hidden fire  in the afternoon of the following day willie set off to the city in quest of mr thomas tippet  having to pass the king street fire station he resolved to look in on his brother  the foldingdoors of the enginehouse were wide open and the engine itself clean and businesslike with its brasswork polished bright stood ready for instant action  two of the firemen were conversing at the open door while several others could be seen lounging about inside in one of the former willie recognised the strong man who had collared him on a wellremembered occasion  please sir said willie going up to him is frank willders inside  why youngster said dale laying his hand on willies head aint you the boy that pulled our bell for a lark the other night  yes sir i am but you let me off you know so i hope you wont bear me illwill now  that depends on how you behave in future said dale with a laugh but what dyou want with frank willders  i want to see him  hes my brother  oh indeed  youll find him inside  willie entered the place with feelings of interest for his respect for firemen had increased greatly since he had witnessed their recent doings at the beverly square fire  he found his brother writing at the little desk that stood in the window while five or six of his comrades were chatting by the fire and a group in a corner were playing draughts and spinning yarns of their old experiences  all assisted in loading the air with tobaccosmoke  the round cloth caps worn by the men gave them a much more sailorlike and much less firemanlike appearance than the helmets which with their respective hatchets hung on the walls rendering the apartment somewhat like a cavalry guardroom  this change in the headpiece and the removal of the hatchet was the only alteration in their costume in what may be styled times of peace  in other respects they were at all times accoutred and in readiness to commence instant battle with the flames  hallo blazes how are ye said willie touching his brother on the shoulder  that you willie said frank without looking up from his work where away now  come to tell ye theres a fire said willie with a serious look  eh what dye mean asked frank looking at his brother as if he half believed he was in earnest  i mean what i saya fire here said willie solemnly striking his breast with his clenched fist here in heart street buzzum square ragin like fury and all the ingins o the fire brigade includin the float couldnt put it out no nor even so much as squeanch it  then its of no use our turning out i suppose said frank with a smile as he wiped his pen what set it alight lad  a wax doll with flaxen hair and blue eyes answered willie thems the things as has all along done for me  when i was a boy i falled in love with a noo wax doll every other day  not that i ever owned one myself i only took a squint at em in toyshop winders and they always had flaxen hair and blue peepers  now that ive become a man ive bin an falled in love with a livin wax doll an shes got flaxen hair an blue eyes moreover she draws  drawsboy what does she drawcorks inquires frank  no replied willie with a look of supreme contempt nothin so low she draws faces an pictures likelikea schoolmaster and added willie with a sigh shes bin an drawed all the spirit out o this here buzzum  she must have left a good lot o combustible matter behind however if theres such a fire raging in it  who may this pretty fireraiser be  her name is emma ward and she blongs to a miss tippet to whom shes related somehow but i dont know where she got her nor whos her parents  this same miss tippet is some sort of a relation o mr auberly who sent me to her with a note and she has sent me with another note to her brother near london bridge who i spose will send me with another note to somebody else so im on my way down to see him i thought id look in to ask after you in passin and cheer you on to dooty  a violent fit of somewhat noisy coughing from one of the men at the fireplace attracted willies attention at this point in the conversation  wot a noisy feller you are corney remarked one of the men  faix retorted corney its noisy youd be too av ye had the cowld in yer chist that i have  sure if ye had bin out five times in wan night as i wos on widsenday last wid the branch to howld in a smoke as ud choke baxmore hisself an its well known he can stand amost anything not to spake o the hose bustin right betune me two feet  come come paddy said dale interrupting dont try to choke us now you know very well that one of the fires was only a cutaway affair two were chimneys and one was a false alarm  true for ye cried corney who had a tendency to become irascible in argument or while defending himself true for ye mister dale but they was alarms for all that false or thrue was they not now anyhow they alarmed me out o me bed five times in a night as cowld as the polar ragions and the last time was a raale case o two flats burnt out an four hours work in iced wather  there was a general laugh at this point followed by several coughs and sneezes for the men were all more or less afflicted with colds owing to the severity of the weather and the frequency of the fires that had occurred at that time  theres some of us can sing chorus to corney observed one of the group  i never saw such weather and it seems to me that the worse the weather the more the fires as if they got em up a purpose to kill us  bill moxey cried another youre always givin out some truism with a face like solomon  well jack williams retorted moxey its more than i can say of you for you never say anything worth listenin to and you couldnt look like solomon if you was to try ever so muchyoure too stoopid for that  i say lads cried frank willders what dye say to send along to the doctor for another bottle o cough mixture same as the first  this proposal was received with a general laugh  hell not send us more o that tipple you may depend said williams  no not av we wos dyin said corney with a grin  what was it asked williams  didnt you hear about it inquired moxey  oh to be sure not you were in hospital after you got run over by the baker street engine tell him about it corney  it was you that asked the doctor wasnt it for another bottle  corney was about to speak when a young fireman entered the room with his helmet hanging on his arm  is it go on he inquired looking round  no its go back young rags replied baxmore as he refilled his pipe it was only a chimney so youre not wanted  can any o you fellers lend me a bit o baccy asked rags  ive forgot to fetch mine  here you are said dale offering him a piece of twist  hant ye got a bit o hard baccy for the tooth said rags  will that do asked frank willders cutting off a piece from a plug of cavendish  thankee  good afternoon  young rags put the quid in his cheek and went away humming a tune  in explanation of the above incident it is necessary to tell the reader that when a fire occurred in any part of london at the time of which we write the firestation nearest to it at once sent out its engines and men and telegraphed to the then head or centre station at watling street  london was divided into four districts each district containing several fire stations and being presided over by a foreman from watling street the news was telegraphed to the foremens stations whence it was transmitted to the stations of their respective districts so that in a few minutes after the breaking out of a fire the fact was known to the firemen all over london  as we have said the stations nearest to the scene of conflagration turned out engines and men but the other stations furnished a man each thus machinery was set in motion which moved as it were the whole metropolis and while the engines were going to the fire at full speed single men were setting out from every point of the compass to walk to it with their sailors caps on their heads and their helmets on their arms  and this took place in the case of every alarm of fire because fire is an element that will not brook delay and it does not do to wait to ascertain whether it is worth while to turn out such a force of men for it or not  in order however to prevent this unnecessary assembling of men when the fire was found to be trifling or when as was sometimes the case it was a false alarm the fireman in charge of the engine that arrived first at once sent a man back to the station with a stop that is with an order to telegraph to the central station that the fire turns out to be only a chimney or a false alarm and that all hands who have started from the distant stations may be stopped  the stop was at once telegraphed to the foremen from whom it was passed just as the call had been to the outlying stations and this second telegram might arrive within quarter of an hour of the first  of course the man from each station had set out before that time and the stop was too late for him but it was his duty to call at the various fire stations he happened to pass on the way where he soon found out whether he was to go on or to go back  if no telegram had been received he went on to the fire sometimes walking four or five miles to it at not less than four miles an hour on coming up to the scene of conflagration he put on his helmet thrust his cap into the breast of his coat and reported himself to the chief of the fire brigade who was usually on the spot or to the foreman in command and found probably that he had arrived just in time to be of great service in the way of relieving the men who first attacked the flames  if on the other hand he found that the stop had been telegraphed he turned back before having gone much more than a mile from his own station and so went quietly home to bed  in the days of which we write the effective and beautiful system of telegraphy which now exists had not been applied to the fire stations of london and the system of stops and calls although in operation was carried out much less promptly and effectively by means of messengers  some time before the entrance of willie willders into the king street station the engine had been turned out to a fire close at hand which proved to be only a chimney on fire and which was put out by means of a handpump and a bucket of water while moxey was sent back with the stop to the station  the affair was over and almost forgotten and the men had resumed their pipes as we have seen when young rags entered and was told to go back  apologising for this necessary digression we return to joe corney  the fact was said he that we had had a fearful time of it that winterblowin great guns an snow nearly every night an what wi heat at the fires an cowld i the streets an hot wather pourin on us at wan minnit an freezin on us the nixt amost every man jack of us was coughin an sneezin and watherin so bad at our eyes an noses that i do belave if wed held em over the suctionpipes we might ha filled the ingins without throublin the mains at all  so the doctor he said says he lads ill send ye a bottle o stuff asll put ye right  an sure enough down comes the bottle that night when we was smokin our pipes just afther rollcall  it turned out to be the best midcine ever was  musha says i heres the top o the marnin to ye boys  baxmore he smacks his lips when he tastes it opens his eyes tosses off the glass and holds it out for another  howld on fair play cried jack williams so we all had a glass round  it was just like lemonade or gingerbeer it was  so we sat down an smoked our pipes over it an spun yarns an sung songs in fact we made a jollification of it an when we got up to turn in there warnt a dhrop left i the bottle  youd better go to the doctor for another bottle says moxey as he wint out  i will says i ill go i the marnin  sure enough away i goes i the marnin to doctor offley  doctor says i howldin out the bottle we all think our colds are much the better o this here midcine an i comed av ye plaze for another o the same  musha but ye should ha seen the rage he goes off into  finished it all says he  ivery dhrop doctor says i at wan sittin  at that he stamped an swore at me an ordered me away as if id bin a poor relation an says he ill sind ye a bottle tonight asll cure ye  sure so he did  the second bottle would have poisond a rat  it lasted us all six months an i do belave yell find the most of it in the cupboard at this minnit av ye look  come willie said frank while the men were laughing at the remembrance of this incident  im going down your way and will give you a convoy  we can take a look in at the gymnastics as we pass if you choose  all right blazes come along  so saying they left the station and set off at a brisk pace in the direction of the city    chapter nine  auctions and gymnastics  as the brothers drew near to the busy region of the city which lies to the north of london bridge frank turned aside into one of the narrow streets that diverge from the main thoroughfare  where are ye goin inquired willie  there was a fire here last night said frank i want to have a look at the damage  a fire exclaimed willie  why blazes it strikes me theres bin more fires than usual last night in london  only two lad  only two  how many would you have asked willie with a laugh  dont you know said frank that we have about four fires every night  sometimes more sometimes fewer  of course we dont all of us turn out to them but some of the brigade turn out to that number on an average every night of the year  are ye jokin frank  indeed i am not  i wish with all my heart i could say that i was joking  its a fact boy  you know i have not been long in the force yet ive gone to as many as six fires in one night and we often go to two or three  the one we are going to see the remains of just now was too far from us for our engine to turn out but we got the call to send a man on and i was sent  when i arrived and reported myself to mr braidwood the two top floors were burnt out and the fire was nearly got under  there were three engines and the men were up on the windowsills of the secondfloor with the branches playin on the last of the flames while the men of the salvagecorps were getting the furniture out of the first floor  conductor brown was there with his escape and had saved a whole family from the top floor just before i arrived  he had been changed from his old station at the west end that very day  hes a wonderful fellow that conductor  many a life he has saved but indeed the same may be said of most of the men in the force especially the old hands  here we are lad  this is the house  frank stopped as he spoke in front of a ruined tenement or rather in front of the gap which was now strewn with the charred and blackened debris of what had once been a house  the street in which it stood was a narrow mean one inhabited by a poor and to judge from appearance a dissipated class  the remains of the house were guarded by policemen while a gang of men were engaged in digging among the ruins which still smoked a little here and there  what are they diggin for asked willie  i fear they are looking for dead bodies  the house was let out to lodgers and swarmed with people  at first it was thought that all were saved but just before i was ordered home after the fire was got under some one said that an old man and his grandchild were missing  i suppose theyre looking for them now  on inquiring of a policeman however frank learned that the remains of the old man and his grandchild had already been found and that they were searching for the bodies of others who were missing  a little beyond the spot where the fire had occurred a crowd was gathered round a man who stood on a chair haranguing them with apparently considerable effect for ever and anon his observations were received with cries of hear hear and laughter  going along the middle of the narrow street in order to avoid the smell of the oldclothesshops and pawnbrokers as well as the risk of contact with their wares frank and willie elbowed their way through the crowd to within a few yards of the speaker  what is he inquired frank of a rather dissipated elderly woman  hes a clown or a hacrobat or somethink of that sort in one of the theatres or musicalls  hes bin burnt out o his ome last night ans asellin off all hes been able to save by hauction  come now ladies an gents cried the clown taking up a

elbows an the seams o the back  who bids for this ere venerable garment  six bob come now dont all bid at once  who said six bob  no reply being made to this except a laugh the clown who by the way wore a similarly glossy greatcoat with a hat to match protested that his ears must have deceived him or his imagination had been whispering hopeful thingswhich was not unlikely for his imagination was a very powerful onewhen he noticed franks tall figure among the crowd  come now fireman this is the wery harticle you wants  you comed out to buy it i know an ere it is by a strange coincidence

recognised as the little boy who had once conversed with him in front of the chocolateshop in holborn hill  thank you my son said the clown taking the chair with one hand and patting the boys head with the other this ladies and gents he added in a parenthetical tone is my son hes bin burnt hout of ouse an ome too  now then who bids for the old harmchair the wery identical harmchair that the song was written about  in the embrace o this ere chair has sat for generations past the family o the cattleysthats my name ladies an gents at your service  here sat my greatgreatgrandfather who was

surrounded by virtuous memories in connection with the defunct  now then say five bob for the hold harmchair  while the clown was endeavouring to get the chair disposed of willie pushed his way to the side of jim cattley  i say youngster would you like a cup o chocolate began willie by way of recalling to the boy their former meeting  jim whose face wore a sad and dispirited look turned angrily and said come i dont want none o your sauce  it aint sauce im talkin of its chocolate retorted willie  but come jim i dont want to bother ye  im sorry to see you an yer dad in sitch a fix  have you lost much  its not what weve lost that troubles us said jim softened by willies sympathetic tone more than by his words but sister ziza is took bad an shes a fairy at drury lane an takin her down the fireescape has wellnigh killed her an weve got sitch a cold damp cellar of a place to put her in that i dont think shell get better at all anyhow shell lose her engagement for she cant make two speeches an go up in a silver cloud among blue fire with the flooenzer an er air all but singed off er ead  jim almost whimpered at this point and willie quitting his side abruptly went back to frank who was still standing an amused auditor of the clown and demanded a shilling  what for lad  never you mind blazes but give me the bob an ill pay you back before the weeks out  frank gave him a shilling with which he at once returned to jim and thrusting it into his hand said  there jim your dads hard up just now  go you an get physic with that for the fairy  them flooenzers is ticklish things to play with where dye stop  well you are a queer un thankee all the same said jim pocketing the shilling  weve got a sort o cellar just two doors east o the burnt ouse  why  cause ill come an see you jim  id like to see a live fairy in plain close with her wings off  the rest of the sentence was cut short by the clown who having disposed of the old armchair to a chimneysweep ordered jim to and up another harticle  at the same moment frank touched willie on the shoulder and said lets go lad ill be late i fear for the gymnastics  at the period of which we write the then chief of the london fire brigade mr braidwood had introduced a system of gymnastic training among the firemen which he had found from experience to be a most useful exercise to fit the men for the arduous work they had to perform before going to london to take command of and reorganise the brigade which then went by the name of the london fireengine establishment and was in a very unsatisfactory condition mr braidwood had for a long period been chief of the edinburgh fire brigade which he had brought to a state of great efficiency  taking the requirements and conditions of the service in edinburgh into consideration he had come to the conclusion that the best men for the work in that city were masons housecarpenters slaters and suchlike but these men when at their ordinary employments being accustomed to bring only certain muscles into full play were found to have a degree of stiffness in their general movements which prevented them from performing their duty as firemen with that ease and celerity which are so desirable  to obviate this evil he instituted the gymnastic exercises which by bringing all the muscles of the body into action and by increasing the development of the frame generally rendered the men lithe and supple and in every way more fitted for the performance of duties in which their lives frequently depended on their promptitude and vigour  in addition to these advantages it was found that those exercises gave the men confidence when placed in certain situations of danger  for example writes mr braidwood a fireman untrained in gymnastics on the third or fourth floor of a burning house with the branch in his hands who is uncertain as to his means of escape in the event of his return by the stair being cut off will be too much concerned about his own safety to render much service and will certainly not be half so efficient as the experienced gymnast who with a hatchet and eighty feet of rope at his waist and a window near him feels himself in comparative security knowing that he has the means and the power of lowering himself easily and safely into the streeta knowledge which not only gives him confidence but enables him to give his undistracted attention to the exigencies of the fire  it was to attend this gymnastic class that frank now turned aside and proposed to bid willie goodbye but willie begged to be taken into the room  frank complied and the boy soon found himself in an apartment fitted up with all the appliances of a gymnasium where a number of powerful young men were leaping vaulting climbing and in other ways improving their physical powers  frank joined them and for a long time willie stood in rapt and envious contemplation of the busy scene  at first he could not avoid feeling that there seemed a good deal more of play than business in their doings but his admiration of the scene deepened when he remembered the bold acts of the firemen at beverly square and recognised some of the faces of the men who had been on duty there and reflected that these very men who seemed thus to be playing themselves would on that very night in all probability be called upon to exert these powers sternly and seriously yet coolly in the midst of scenes of terror and confusion and in the face of imminent personal danger  brooding over these things willie having at length torn himself away hastened on his pilgrimage to london bridge    chapter ten  difficulties and dissipations  in a very small office situate in a very large warehouse in that great storehouse of the worlds wealth tooley street sat a clerk named edward hooper  among his familiar friends edward was better known by the name of ned  he was seated on the top of a tall threelegged stool which to judge from the uneasy and restless motions of its occupant must have been a peculiarly uncomfortable seat indeed  there was a clock on the wall just opposite to neds desk which that young gentleman was in the habit of consulting frequentlyvery frequentlyand comparing with his watch as if he doubted its veracity this was very unreasonable for he always found that the two timepieces told the truth at least that they agreed with each other nevertheless in his own private heart ned hooper thought that clock and sometimes called itthe slowest piece of ancient furniture he had ever seen  during one of neds comparisons of the two timepieces the door opened and mr auberly entered with a dark cloud figuratively speaking on his brow  at the same moment the door of an inner office opened and mr auberlys head clerk who had seen his employers approach through the dusty window issued forth and bowed respectfully with a touch of condolence in his air as he referred with much regret to the fire at beverly square and hoped that miss auberly was not much the worse of her late alarm  well she is not the better for it said mr auberly but i hope she will be quite well soon  indeed the doctor assures me of this if care is taken of her  i wish that was the only thing on my mind just now but i am perplexed about another matter mr quill  are you alone  quite alone sir said quill throwing open the door of the inner office  i want to consult with you about frederick said mr auberly as he entered  the door shut out the remainder of the consultation at this point so edward hooper consulted the clock again and sighed  if sighs could have delivered hooper from his sorrows there is no doubt that the accumulated millions of which he was delivered in that office during the last five years would have filled him with a species of semicelestial bliss  at last the hands of the clock reached the hour the hour that was wont to evoke neds last sigh and set him free but it was an aggravating clock  nothing would persuade it to hurry  it would not for all the untold wealth contained in the great stores of tooley street have abated the very last second of the last minute of the hour on the contrary it went through that second quite as slowly as all the others  ned fancied it went much slower at that one on purpose and then with a sneaking parade of its intention to begin to strike it gave a prolonged hiss and did its duty and nothing but its duty by striking the hour at a pace so slow that it recalled forcibly to ned hoopers imaginative mind the minutegun at sea  there was a preliminary warning given by that clock some time before the premonitory hiss  between this harbinger of coming events and the joyful sound which was felt to be an age ned was wont to wipe his pen and arrange his papers  when the hiss began he invariably closed his warehouse book and laid it in the desk and had the desk locked before the first stroke of the hour  while the minutegun at sea was going on he changed his officecoat for a surtout not perfectly new and a white hat with a black band the rim of which was not perfectly straight  so exact and methodical was ned in these operations that his hand usually fell on the doorlatch as the last gun was fired by the aggravating clock  on occasions of unusual celerity he even managed to drown the last shot in the bang of the door and went off with a sensation of triumph  on the present occasion however ned hooper deemed it politic to be so busy that he could not attend to the warnings of the timepiece  he even sat on his stool a full quarter of an hour beyond the time of departure  at length mr auberly issued forth  mr quill said he my mind is made up so it is useless to urge such considerations on me  goodnight  mr quill whose countenance was sad looked as though he would willingly have urged the considerations referred to over again and backed them up with a few more but mr auberlys tone was peremptory so he only opened the door and bowed the great man out  you can go hooper said mr quill retiring slowly to the inner office i will lock up  send the porter here  this was a quite unnecessary permission  quill being a goodnatured easygoing man never found fault with ned hooper and ned being a presumptuous young fellow though goodhumoured enough never waited for mr quills permission to go  he was already in the act of putting on the white hat and two seconds afterwards was in the street wending his way homeward  there was a tavern named the angel at the corner of one of the streets off tooley street which edward hooper had to pass every evening on his way home  ned we grieve to say was fond of his beer he always found it difficult to pass a tavern  yet curiously enough he never found any difficulty in passing this tavern probably because he always went in and slaked his thirst before passing it  good evening mr hooper said the landlord who was busy behind his counter serving a motley and disreputable crew  hooper nodded in reply and said good evening to mrs butler who attended to the customers at another part of the counter  good evenin sir  watll you ave tonight sir  pot o the same mrs b replied ned  this was the invariable question and reply for ned was a man of regularity and method in everything that affected his personal comforts had he brought onetenth of this regularity and method to bear on his business conduct he would have been a better and a happier man  the foaming pot was handed and ned conversed with mrs butler while he enjoyed it and commenced his evening which usually ended in semiintoxication  meanwhile edward hoopers chum and fellowlodger sat in their mutual chamber awaiting him  john barret did not drink but he smoked and while waiting for his companion he solaced himself with a pipe  he was a fine manly fellow very different from ned who although strong of limb and manly enough was slovenly in gait and dress and bore unmistakable marks of dissipation about him  very odd hes later than usual muttered barret as he glanced out at the window and then at the teatable which with the teaservice and indeed everything in the room proved that the young men were by no means wealthy  hell be taking an extra pot at the angel muttered john barret proceeding to relight his pipe while he shook his head gravely but hell be here soon  a foot on the stair caused barret to believe that he was a true prophet but the rapidity and firmness of the step quickly disabused him of that idea  the door was flung open with a crash and a hearty youth with glowing eyes strode in  fred auberly exclaimed barret in surprise  wont you welcome me demanded fred  welcome you  of course i will most heartily old boy cried barret seizing his friends hand and wringing it but if you burst in on a fellow unexpectedly in this fashion and with such wild looks why  well well dont explain man i hate explanations  i have come here for sympathy said fred auberly shutting the door and sitting down by the fire  sympathy fred  ay sympathy  when a man is in distress he naturally craves for sympathy and he turns also naturally to those who can and will give itnot to everybody john barretonly to those who can feel with him as well as for him  i am in distress john and ever since you and i fought our first and last battle at eton i have found you a true sympathiser  so now is your heart ready to receive the flood of my sorrows  young auberly said the latter part of this in a halfjesting tone but he was evidently in earnest so his friend replied by squeezing his hand warmly and saying lets hear about it fred while he relighted his pipe  you have but a poor lodging here john said auberly looking round the room  barret turned on his friend a quick look of surprise and then said with a smile  well i admit that it is not quite equal to a certain mansion in beverly square that i wot of but its good enough for a poor clerk in an insurance office  you are right continued auberly it is not equal to that mansion whose upper floors are at this moment a chevauxdefrise of charcoal beams and rafters depicted on a dark sky and whose lower floors are a fantastic compound of burned bricks and lime broken boards and blackened furniture  you dont mean to say theres been a fire exclaimed barret  and you dont mean to tell me do you that a clerk in a fire insurance office does not know it  i have been ill for two days returned barret and have not seen the papers but im very sorry to hear of it indeed i am  the house is insured of course  i believe it is replied fred carelessly but that is not what troubles me  no exclaimed his friend  no replied the other  if the house had not been insured my father has wealth enough in those abominably unpicturesque stores in tooley street to rebuild the whole of beverly square if it were burnt down the fire costs me not a thought although by the way it nearly cost me my life in a vain attempt i made to rescue my poor dear sister loo  vain attempt exclaimed barret with a look of concern  ay vain as far as i was concerned but a noble firemana fellow that would make a splendid model for hercules in the life academysprang to the rescue after me and saved her  god bless him  dear loo has got a severe shake but the doctors say that we have only to take good care of her and she will do well  but to return to my woes  listen john and you shall hear  fred auberly paused as though meditating how he should commence  you know said he that i am my fathers only son and loo his only daughter  yes  well my father has disinherited me and left the whole of his fortune to loo  as far as dear loo is concerned i am glad for myself i am sad for it is awkward to say the least of it to have been brought up with unlimited command of pocketmoney and expectations of considerable wealth and suddenly to find myself all but penniless without a profession and without expectations at the age of twentytwo  he paused and looked at his friend who sat in mute amazement  failing loo continued fred calmly my fathers fortune goes to some distant relative  but why wherefore exclaimed barret  you shall hear continued auberly  you are aware that ever since i was able to burn the end of a stick and draw faces on the nurserydoor i have had a wild insatiable passion for drawing and ever since the memorable day on which i was whipped by my father and kissed tearfully by my beloved mother for caricaturing our cook on the diningroom window with a diamondring i have had an earnest unextinguishable desire to become aa painter an artist a dauber a dirtier of canvas  dye understand  perfectly said barret  well my father has long been resolved it seems to make me a man of business for which i have no turn whatever  you are aware that for many years i have dutifully slaved and toiled at these heavy books in our officewhich have proved so heavy that they have nearly squeezed the soul out of meand instead of coming to like them better as i was led to believe i should i have only come to hate them more  during all this time too i have been studying painting late and early and although i have not gone through the regular academical course i have studied much in the best of all schools that of nature  i have urged upon my father repeatedly and respectfully that it is possible for me to uphold the credit of the family as a painter that as the business can be carried on by subordinates there is no necessity for me to be at the head of it and that as he has made an ample fortune already the half of which he had told me was to be mine i would be quite satisfied with my share and did not want any more  but my father would never listen to my arguments  the last time we got on the subject he called me a meanspirited fellow and said he was sorry i had ever been born whereupon i expressed regret that he had not been blessed with a more congenial and satisfactory son and tried to point out that it was impossible to change my nature  then i urged all the old arguments over again and wound up by saying that even if i were to become possessor of the whole of his business tomorrow i would sell it off take to painting as a profession and become the patron of aspiring young painters from that date forward  to my surprise and consternation this last remark put him in such a towering rage that he vowed he would disinherit me if i did not then and there throw my palette and brushes into the fire  of course i declined to do such an act whereupon he dismissed me from his presence for ever  this occurred on the morning of the day of the fire  i thought he might perhaps relent after such an evidence of the mutability of human affairs  i even ventured to remind him that tooley street was not made of asbestos and that an occasional fire occurred there  but this made him worse than ever so i went the length of saying that i would at all events in deference to his wishes continue to go to the office at least for some time to come  but alas  i had roused him to such a pitch that he refused to hear of it unless i should throw my palette and brushes into the fire  flesh and blood you know could not do that so i left him and walked off twenty miles into the country to relieve my feelings  there i fell in with such a splendid bit a sluice with a stump of a tree and a winding bit of water with overhanging willows and a peep of country beyond  i sat down and sketched and forgot my woes and rejoiced in the fresh air and delightful sounds of birds and cows and sheep and hated to think of tooley street  then i slept in a country inn walked back to london next day and voila here i am  dont you think fred that time will soften your father  no i dont think it  on the contrary i know it wont  he is a good man but he has an iron will which i never saw subdued  then my dear fred i advise you to consider the propriety of throwing your palette and brushes into  my dear john i did not come here for your advice  i came for your sympathy  and you have it fred cried barret earnestly  but have you really such an unconquerable love for painting  have i really echoed fred  do you think i would have come to such a pass as this for a trifle  why man you have no idea how my soul longs for the life of a painter for the free fresh air of the country for the poetry of the woods the water and the sky for the music of bird and beast and running brook  you know the true proverb man made the town but god made the country  what asked barret would become of the town if all men thought as you do  oh  john barret has town life so marred your once fine intellect that you put such a question in earnest  suppose i answer it by another what would become of the country if all men thought and acted as you do  barret smiled and smoked  and what continued auberly would become of the fine arts if all men delighted in dirt dust dullness and desks  depend upon it john that our tastes and tendencies are not the result of accident they were given to us for a purpose  i hold it as an axiom that when a man or a boy has a strong and decided bias or partiality for any particular work that he knows something about he has really a certain amount of capacity for that work beyond the average of men and is led thereto by a higher power than that of man  do not misunderstand me  i do not say that when a boy expresses a longing desire to enter the navy or the army he has necessarily an aptitude for these professions  far from it  he has only a romantic notion of something about which experimentally he knows nothing but when man or boy has put his hand to any style of work and thereafter loves it and longs after it i hold that that is the work for which he was destined and for which he is best suited  perhaps you are right said barret smoking harder than ever  at all events i heartily sympathise with you and  at this point the conversation was interrupted by a loud burst of whistling as the streetdoor opened and the strains of rule britannia filled the entire building  the music was interrupted by the sudden opening of another door and a rough growl from a male voice  dont get waxy old feller said the performer in a youthful voice i aint agoin to charge you nothink for it  i always do my music gratis havin a beenevolient turn o mind  the door was slammed violently and rule britannia immediately burst forth with renewed and pointed emphasis  presently it ceased and a knock came to barrets door  well what dye want you noisy scamp said barret flinging the door open and revealing the small figure of willie willders  please sir said willie consulting the back of a note are you mister ttomtupper esquire  no im not  aint there sitch a name in the house  no not that i know of  willies face looked blank  well i was told he lived here he muttered again consulting the note  here let me look said barret taking the note from the boy  this is tippet not tupper  he lives in the top floor  by the way auberly said barret glancing over his shoulder isnt tom tippet a sort of connection of yours  yes a distant one said fred carelessly too distant to make it worth while our becoming acquainted  hes rich and eccentric im told assuredly he must be the latter if he lives in such a hole as this what are you staring at boy  this question was put to willie  please sir are you the mr auberly who was amost skumfished with smoke at the beverly square fire tother day in tryin to git hold o yer sister  fred could not but smile as he admitted the fact  please sir i hope yer sister aint the wuss of it sir  not much i hope thank you for inquiring but how come you to know about the fire and to be interested in my sister  cause i was there sir an it was my brother sir frank willders as saved your sister  was it indeed exclaimed fred becoming suddenly interested  come let me hear more about your brother  willie nothing loth related every fact he was acquainted with in regard to franks career and his own family history in the course of which he revealed the object of his visit to mr tippet  when he had finished frederick auberly shook hands with him and said  now willie go and deliver your note  if the application is successful well but if it fails or you dont like your work just call upon me and ill see what can be done for you  yes sir and thankee said willie where did you say i was to call sir  call atehahyes my boy call here and let my friend mr barret know you want to see me  he will let me know and you shall hear from me  just at presentwell never mind go and deliver your note now your brother is a noble fellow  goodnight  and youre a fine little fellow yourself he added after willie closed the door  the fine little fellow gave vent to such a gush of rule britannia at the moment that the two friends turned with a smile to each other  just then a mans voice was heard at the foot of the stair grumbling angrily  at the same moment young auberly rose to leave  goodnight barret  ill write to you soon as to my whereabout and what about  perhaps see you ere long  goodnight  god prosper you fred  goodnight  as he spoke the grumbler came stumbling along the passage  goodnight again fred said barret almost pushing his friend out i have a particular reason for not wishing you to see the fr the man who is coming in  all right old fellow said fred as he passed out and drew up against the wall to allow a drunken man to stumble heavily into the room  next moment he was in the street hastening he knew not whither but following the old and wellknown route to beverly square    chapter eleven  wonderful plans  when willie willders knocked at tom tippets door at the top of the house a rich jovial bass voice cried come in  so willie went in and stood before a stout old gentleman whose voluminous whiskers meeting below his chin made ample amends for the total absence of hair from the top of his head  mr tippet stood without coat or vest and with his braces tied round his waist at a carpenters bench holding a saw in his right hand and a piece of wood in his left  well my lad whats your business he inquired in the voice of a stentor and with the beaming smile of an elderly cherub  please sir a notefrom a lady  i wish your message had been verbal boy  its so difficult to read ladies hands theyre so abominably angular andwhere are my specs ive a mind to have em screwnailed to my nose  ah here they are  he found them under a jackplane and a mass of shavings put them on and read the note while willie took the opportunity of observing that mr tippets room was a drawingroom parlour diningroom workshop and old curiosityshop all in one  a halfopen door revealed the fact that an inner chamber contained mr tippets bed and an indescribable mass of machinery and models in every stage of progression and covered with dust more or less thick in exact proportion to their respective ages a dog and cat lay side by side on the hearth asleep and a small fire burned in a grate on the sides of which stood a variety of crucibles and suchlike articles and a gluepot also a teapot and kettle  you want a situation in my office as a clerk inquired mr tippet tearing up his sisters letter and throwing it into the fire  if you please sir said willie  ha are you good at writing and ciphering  middlin sir  hum  dyou know where my office is and what it is  no sir  what would you say now asked mr tippet seating himself on his bench or rather on the top of a number of gimblets and chisels and files and pincers that lay on it what would you say now to sitting from morning till night in a dusty wareroom where the light is so feeble that it can scarcely penetrate the dirt that encrusts the windows writing in books that are so greasy that the ink can hardly be got to mark the paper  how would you like that william willderseh  i dont know sir replied willie with a somewhat depressed look  of course you dont yet that is the sort of place youd have to work in boy if i engaged you for that is a correct description of my warehouse  im a sleeping partner in the firm  dye know what that is boy  no sir  well its a partner that does no work but im wideawake for all that an have a pretty good notion of what is going on there  now lad if i were to take you in what would you say to 5 pounds a year  it dont sound much sir said willie bluntly but if you take me in with the understandin that im to work my way upards i dont mind about the pay at first  good said mr tippet with a nod of approval  what dye think of my workshop he added looking round with a cherubic smile  its a funny place responded willie with a grin  a funny placeeh  well i daresay it is lad in your eyes but let me tell you it is a place of deep interest and i may add without vanity importance  there are inventions here all in a state bordering more or less upon completion which will when brought into operation modify the state of society very materially in many of its most prominent phases  here for instance is a selfacting galvanohydraulic engine which will entirely supersede the use of steam and by preventing the consumption of coal now going on will avert or at least postpone the decline of the british empire  able men have calculated that in the course of a couple of hundred years or so our coalbeds will be exhausted  i have gone over their calculations and detected several flaws in them which when corrected show a very different resultnamely that in seventeen or eighteen years from this time there will not be an ounce of coal in the kingdom  mr tippet paused to observe the effect of this statement  willie having never heard of such things before and having a thoughtful and speculative as well as waggish turn of mind listened with open eyes and mouth and earnest attention so mr tippet went on  the frightful consequences of such a state of things you may conceive or rather they are utterly inconceivable  owing to the foundations of the earth having been cut away it is more than probable that the present coal districts of the united kingdom will collapse the ocean will rush in and several of our largest counties will become saltwater lakes  besides this coal being the grand source of our national wealth its sudden failure will entail national bankruptcy  the barbarians of europe taking advantage of our condition will pour down upon us and the last spark of true civilisation in our miserable world will be extinguishedthe last refuge for the hunted foot of persecuted freedom will be finally swept from the face of the earth  here mr tippet brought the saw down on the bench with such violence that the dog and cat started incontinently to their legs and willie himself was somewhat shaken  now continued mr tippet utterly regardless of the sensation he had created and wiping the perspiration from his shining head with a handful of shavings now william willders all this may be shall be prevented by the adoption of the galvanohydraulic engine and the consequent restriction of the application of coal to the legitimate purposes of warming our dwellings and cooking our victuals  i mean to bring this matter before the home secretary whenever i have completed my invention which however is not quite perfected  then again continued mr tippet becoming more and more enthusiastic as he observed the deep impression his explanations were making on willie who stood glaring at him in speechless amazement here you have my improved sausagemachine for converting all animal substances into excellent sausages  i hold that every animal substance is more or less good for food and that it is a sad waste to throw away bones and hair etcetera etcetera merely because these substances are unpalatable or difficult to chew  now my machine gets over this difficulty  you cut an animal up just as it is killed and put it into the machinehair skin bones blood and alland set it in motion by turning on the galvanohydraulic fluid  delicious sausages are the result in about twenty minutes  you see my dog therechips i call him because he dwells in the midst of chips and shavings he sleeps upon chips and if he does not exactly eat chips he lives upon scraps which have a strong resemblance to them the cat has no name  i am partial to the timehonoured name of puss besides a cat is not worthy of a name  physically speaking it is only a bundle of living fura mere mass of soft animated nature as goldsmith would express it  intellectually it is nothinga sort of existent nonentity a moral void on which a name would be utterly thrown away  well i could take these two animals chips and puss put them in here alive too for there is a killing apparatus in the instrument which will effectually do away with the cruel process of slaughtering and with its accompanying nuisances of slaughterhouses and butchers put them in here i say and in twenty minutes they would be ground up into sausages  i know that enemies to progress ignorant persons and the like will scoff at this and say it is similar to the american machine into one end of which you put a tree and it comes out at the other end in the shape of readymade furniture  but such scoffs will cease while my invention will live  i am not bigoted william  there may be good objections to my inventions and great difficulties connected with them but the objections i will answer and the difficulties i will overcome  this instrument continued mr tippet pointing to a huge beam which leant against the end of the small apartment is only a speculative effort of mine  it is meant to raise enormous weights such as houses i have long felt it to be most desirable that people should be able to raise their houses from their foundations by the strength of a few men and convey them to other localities either temporarily or permanently i have not succeeded yet but i see my way to success and after all the idea is not new  you can see it partially carried out by an enterprising company in this city whose enormous vans will remove the whole furniture of a drawingroom almost as it stands without packing my chief difficulty is with the fulcrum but that is a difficulty that met the philosopher of old  you have heard of archimedes williamthe man who said he could make a lever big enough to move the world if he could only get a fulcrum to rest it on  but archimedes was weak in that point  he ought to have known that even if he did get such a fulcrum he would still have required another world as long as his lever to enable him to walk out to the end of it  no by the way he might have walked on the lever itself  that did not occur to me before  he might even have ridden along it  come thats a new idea  let me see  in order the better to see mr tippet dropt the piece of wood from his left hand and pressed his fingers into both eyes so as to shut out all earthly objects and enable him to take an undistracted survey of the chambers of his mind  returning suddenly from the investigation he exclaimed  yes william i dont quite see my way to it but i can perceive dimly the possibility of archimedes having so formed his lever that a line of rails might have been run along the upper side of it from the fulcrum to the other end  yes sir exclaimed willie who having become excited was entering eagerly into his patrons speculations and venting an occasional remark in the height of his enthusiasm  such a thing might be done continued mr tippet emphatically a small carriageon the galvanohydraulic principle of coursemight run to and fro  with passengers suggested willie  wellwith passengers assented mr tippet smiling  of course the lever would be very largeextremely large  yes there might be passengers  an stations along the line said willie  mr tippet knitted his brows  yeyeswhy not he said slowly  of course the lever would be very long extremely long and it might be necessary to stop the carriages on the way out  there might be breadth sufficient on the lever to plant small side stations  an twenty minutes allowed for refreshments suggested willie  why as to that said mr tippet if we stop at all there could be no reasonable objection to refreshments although it is probable we might find it difficult to get anyone sufficiently enterprising to undertake the supply of such a line for you know if the lever were to slip at the fulcrum and fall  oh exclaimed willie wouldnt there be a smash neither  the danger of people falling off too continued mr tippet might be prevented by railings run along the extreme edges of the lever  yes interrupted willie whose vivid imagination unused to such excitement had taken the bit in its teeth and run away with him an spikes put on em to keep the little boys from swinging on em an gettin into mischief  oh what jolly fun it would be  only think wed advertise cheap excursion trains along the arkimeedis line mondays an toosdays  fares two hundred pounds fust class  no seconds or parleys allowed for love or money  starts from the fuddlecrum sta  fulcrum said mr tippet correcting  fulcrum station resumed willie at 230 am of the mornin precisely  stops at the quarter halfway an threequarter stations allowin twenty minutes more or less for grubweather permittin  your observations are quaint said mr tippet with a smile but there is a great deal of truth in them  no doubt the connection of such ideas especially as put by you sounds a little ludicrous but when we come to analyse them we see their possibility for if a lever of the size indicated by the ancient philosopher were erected and theoretically the thing is possible then the subordinate arrangements as to a line of railway and stations etcetera would be mere matters of detail  it might be advertised too that the balance of the lever would be so regulated that on the arrival of the train at the terminus the world would rise a fact which might be seen by the excursionists by the aid of enormous telescopes much better than by the people at home and that on the return of the train the world would again sink to its ancient level  there would be considerable risk no doubt continued mr tippet meditatively of foolish young men and boys getting over the rails in sport or bravado and falling off into the depths of illimitable profundity but  we could have bobbies stationed along the line interrupted willie an tickets put up warnin the passengers not to give em money on no account wotsomedever on pain o bein charged double fare for the first offence an pitched over the rails into illimidibble prowhatsisname for the second  ill tell you what it is william said mr tippet suddenly getting off the bench and seizing the boys hand your talents would be wasted in my office  youll come and assist me here in the workshop  im greatly in want of an intelligent lad who can use his hands but by the way can you use your hands  here cut this piece of wood smooth with that knife  he handed willie a piece of crossgrained wood and a blunt knife  willie looked at both smiled and shook his head  it would take a cleverer feller than me to do it but ill try  willie did try after a quarter of an hour spent in vain attempts he threw down the wood and knife exclaiming its impossible  mr tippet who had been smiling cherubically and nodding approval said  i knew it was impossible my lad when i gave it to you and i now know that you are both neathanded and persevering so if you choose ill engage you on the spot to come on trial for a week  after that we will settle the remuneration  meanwhile shake hands again and allow me to express to you my appreciation of the noble character of your brother who i understand from my sisters letter saved a young relative of mine from the midst of imminent danger  goodnight william and come to me on monday next at nine oclock in the morning  willie was somewhat perplexed at this prompt dismissal for mr tippet had opened the door especially after such a long and freeandeasy conversation and he felt that however much license mr tippet might permit he was a man of stern will who could not be resisted with impunity so although he was burning to know the object and nature of innumerable strange pieces of mechanism in the workshop he felt constrained to make a polite bow and depart  on his way downstairs he heard the voices of men as if in angry disputation and on reaching the next floor found mr barret standing at the open door of his room endeavouring to hold ned hooper who was struggling violently  i tell you said the latter in a drunken voice that i wwill go out  come ned not tonight you can go tomorrow said barret soothingly yet maintaining his hold of his friend  wwhy not aint night the best time totobe jollyeh  lme go i shay  he made a fierce struggle at this point and barret ceasing to expostulate seized him with a grasp that he could not resist and dragged him forcibly yet without unnecessary violence into the room  next instant the door was shut with a bang and locked so willie willders descended to the street and turned his face homewards moralising as he went on the evils of drink  it was a long way to notting hill but it was not long enough to enable willie to regain his wonted nonchalance  he had seen and heard too much that night to permit of his equilibrium being restored  he pursed his mouth several times into the form of a round o and began rule britannia but the sounds invariably died at the part where the charter of the land is brought forward  he tried the bay of biscay o with no better success never being able to get farther than lightnings vivid powers before his mind was up in the clouds or in mr tippets garret or out on the archimedeslever railway  thus wandering in dreams he reached home talked wildly to his anxious mother and went to bed in a state of partial insanity    chapter twelve  a little domestic chitchat  one night not long after the events narrated in the last chapter frank willders was standing with the firemanincharge in the king street station  he had just removed his helmet and the perspiration on his brow showed that he had been but recently engaged in some active duty as indeed was the case for he had just returned from a walk to a fire in whitechapel  it was only a small affair said frank hanging up his helmet and axe and sitting down to fill his pipe a low beershop in brook street the taproom burnt out and the rest of the house damaged by smoke  it was pretty well over before i got there and i left half an hour after where are the rest o the lads  theyre out wi both engines said baxmore who was busy making a memorandum on a slate  with both engines said frank  ay both replied baxmore with a laugh as he sat down in front of the fire  let me see its now nine oclock so theyve bin off an hour one to walton street brompton the other to porchester terrace bayswater  the call was the queerest ive seen for many a day  we was all sittin here smokin our pipes as usual when two fellers came to the door full split from opposite pints o the compass an run slap into each other  they looked like gentlemen but they was in such a state it wasnt easy to make out what sort o fish they was  one had his coat torn and his hat gone the other had his tile pretty well knocked down on his eyesi spose by the people he run into on the wayan both were halfmad with excitement  they both stuttered too that was the fun o the thing and they seemed to think each was takin off the other and got into a most awful rage  my own opinion is that one stuttered by nature an the other stuttered from fright  anyhow they both stuttered together and a precious mess they made of it  ffffire roared one  ffffire yelled the other  where away asked mr dale looking quietly at the two men who were gasping for breath  bbbbrompton bbbbayswater they shouted together and then turnin fiercely on each other the one said nnnno and the other said nnnno  now which is it said dale an be quickdo  bbbbrompton  bbbbayswater in a breath then says one ii sssay brompton an the other he says ii sssay bayswater  at this they grew furious and dale tried to calm them and settle the question by asking the name of the street  wwwalton sstreet cried one  pppporchester ttterrace shouted the other  nnno  yyyes  nno an with that one up fist an hit the other a crack between the eyes  tother returned on the nob and then they closed  before this mr dale had ordered out one o the engines an when he heard the two streets named it occurred to him that there might be two fires so he ordered out the other engine and before we got the stutterers separated both engines were off full swing one to brompton the other to bayswater but whether there are two fires or no is yet to be seen  just as baxmore concluded the rattle of a returning engine was heard next moment it dashed up to the door and the firemen leaping off streamed into the station where amid much comment and some laughter at the scene they had so recently witnessed they hung up their helmets and crowded round the fire  so it was in brompton after all said jack williams stirring the coals but it was a small affair in a bakers shop and we soon got it out  is the other engine back inquired moxey  here she comes to answer for herself said mason as the second engine dashed up to the station and the men were joined by their comrades  weve got it out said dale sitting down before the desk to enter the particulars in his diary it was a private house and well alight when we got there but the paddington engine was playing on it and we soon got it under  faix its well them stutterers didnt kape us longer else the whole house would have bin burnt out intirely observed joe corney binding up a slight wound in his thumb which he had received from a splinter  most of the men were more or less begrimed with charcoal and smoke and otherwise bore marks of their recent sharp though short skirmish but none of them deemed it necessary to remove these evidences of devotion to duty until they had refreshed themselves with a pipe  were there people in the house inquired frank  ay but pickford was there with the escape an got em all out before we came up said one  pickford said he couldnt help laughing after he got em out at the remembrance o their faces  when he first went in they was all sound asleep in the top floor for the smoke was only beginnin to show there an the surprise they got when he jump in among em an shouted was wonderful to behold  not so wonderful observed bill moxey as the surprise i seed a whole manowars crew get by consequence o the shout o one of her own men  when was that  lets hear about it bill said corney stuffing down the tobacco in his pipe and firing a battery of cloudlets into the air  we was in the red sea at the time said moxey clearing his throat layin at anchor and a precious hot time we had of it  there was never a cloud amost in the sky and the sun was nigh hot enough to fry the decks off the ship  cook said hed half a mind to try to roast a junk o beef at it but i never heard that he managed that  we slep on deck o nights cause you might as well have tried to sleep in a bakers oven as sleep below  the thing that troubled us most at that time was a tiger we had on board  it did kick up such a shindy sometimes  we thought it would break its cage an make a quid o some of us  i forget who sent it to uspraps it was the pasha of egypt anyhow we werent sorry when the order was given to put the tiger ashore  well the same day that we got rid o the tiger we was sent aboard a malay ship to flog one o the men  hen bin up to some mischief an his comrades were afraid i spose to flog him and as the offence he had committed was against us somehow i never rightly understood it myself some of us went aboard the malay ship tied him up an gave him two dozen  that night the whole ships company slep on deck as usualofficers as wellall but the capn who had gone ashore  it was a tremendous hot night an a good deal darker than usual  there was one man in the ship named wilson but we called him bob roarer because of a habit he had of speakin an sometimes roarin in his sleep  bob lay between me an the purser that night an we slep on all right till it was getting pretty late though there was two or three snorers that got their noses close to the deck an kep up a pretty fair imitation of a brass band suddenly bob began to dream or took a nightmare or somethin for he hit straight out with both fists givin the purser a tap on the nob with his left an diggin his right into my breadbasket with such good will that he nearly knocked all the wind out o me at the same time he uttered a most appallin yell  the confusion that followed is past description  some of us thought it was the tiger had broke looseforgettin that it had been sent ashore  bob sneaked off the moment he found what hed done and the purser thinkin it was pirates grabbed the first he could lay hold of by the throat and that was me so to it we went tooth an nail for i had no notion who was pitchin into me it was so dark two of the men in their fright sprang up the main shrouds  two others who were asleep in the maintop were awoke by the row looked down on the starboard side an saw the two comin up  thinking it was the friends of the malay who had been flogged coming to be revenged they ran down the port shrouds like mad and one o them rushed along the portdeck stickin his feet into the breadbaskets of all the sleepers that hadnt been woke by the yell rousin them up an causin them to roar like bosuns  the row woke the cook who was a nigger he thinkin it was a sudden jollification seized one o the coppers an began to beat it with an iron spoon  this set up the quartermaster who rushed along the starboard deck trampin upon the breasts and faces of all and sundry  the gunner thought it was the tiger and took to the top of the awning while the doctor and bosnsmate they jumped over the side and hung on by ropes up to their waists in water  at the worst o the confusion the capn came aboard  we didnt see him but he ordered silence an after a while we discovered that there was no reason whatever for the shindy  it wasnt till a long time afterwards that we found out the real cause of the false alarm but the only man that got no fright that night and kep quite cool was the man who set it all agoinbob roarer  what a feller you are bill to talk blarney said corney rising and knocking the ashes out of his pipe sure aither yer father or yer mother must have bin an irishman  blarney or no blarney thems the facts said moxey yawning an im off to bed  ditto said frank stretching himself  the two tressels which were always removed from the room during the day had been brought in and were by this time occupied by mason and williams whose duty it was to keep watch that night  baxmore the subengineer of the station sat down at the desk to read over the events of the day and the others rose to leave  by the way baxmore said dale what was that false alarm at 2 pm when i was down at watling street  only a chemist in kensington who it seems is mad after makin experiments and all but blew the roof off his house with one of em  ah only smoke i suppose said dale  that was all said baxmore but there was sitch a lot of it that some fellows thought it was a fire an came tearin down here wi the news so we had a ride for nothing  if im not mistaken youll have a ride for something ere long observed dale turning his head aside while he listened attentively hold on lads a minute  there was a sound of wheels in the distance as if some vehicle were approaching at a furious pace  on it came louder and louder until it turned the corner of the street and the horses feet rattled on the stones as they were pulled up sharp at the station  instantly the bell was rung violently and a severe kicking was bestowed on the door  it is needless to say that the summons was answered promptly  some of the men quietly resumed the helmets they had just hung up well knowing that work lay before them  a cabman darted through the door the instant it was opened shouting  fire  where asked dale  forth street holborn sir cried the cabman  again for the third time that night the order was given to get her out  while this was being done baxmore took a leathern purse from the cupboard and gave the cabman a shilling for being first to give the call  as the men were already accoutred the engine left the station on this occasion in less than five minutes  the distance was short so the pace was full speed and in an incredibly short space of time they drew up in front of a large handsome shop from the firstfloor windows of which thick smoke and a few forked flames were issuing    chapter thirteen  wild doings and daring deeds  quick though they were however in reaching the scene of the fire the escape was there before them  it had a shorter way to travel and was already pitched with its head resting against a window of the second floor and the fly ladder raised to the third  the people who had crowded round the building at the first alarm of fire were looking on as if in suspense and the firemen knew that conductor forest or one of his lionhearted comrades was inside doing his noble and dangerous work  but they had no time to pay attention to what was going on  while some of the firemen got the engine into play the others ran in a body to the frontdoor of the burning house the lower part of which was a coachbuilders warehouse  it was a heavy double door locked and barred and the owner had not yet arrived with the key  it was evident that the fire had originated in one of the upper floors for there was no light in the wareroom  get the poleaxe said dale as soon as he found the door was fast  frank willders sprang off at the word and returned with an axe of the largest size attached to a handle nearly four feet long  drive it in willders said dale  franks powerful blows at once thundered on the massive door but they fell on it in vain for it was unusually strong  seeing this dale ran back to the engine and got out the pole  come lay hold some of you said he  immediately eight firemen frank and dale being at the front charged the door like a thunderbolt with this extemporised batteringram  it gave way with a prodigious crash and the whole party fell over each other into the warehouse  there was a burst of laughter from themselves as well as from the crowd but in another moment they were up and swarming through the premises among the smoke searching for a point of attack  send the branch up here cried mason coughing violently  sure my peepers is out entirely gasped corney rushing to the window for air while showers of water fell on his head for the engine was already in full play  just then there was a noise outside as if men were disputing violently dale guessed at once what it was and ran down the staircase calling out as he passed here willders corney baxmore lend a hand will you  on reaching the engine they found about a dozen roughs of the lowest character disputing fiercely as to which of them was to pump the engine  as each man received one shilling an hour for this work it became a desirable means of earning a good nights wages to these broadshouldered rascals who in their anger and in spite of the police and the solitary fireman who superintended the engine had actually caused the men already at work to cease pumping  we may remark in passing that this would not have been the case but for the police force from some unknown cause being not very strong at that fire and having an excited and somewhat turbulent crowd to keep in order  as a general rule the police of london are of the most essential service at fires and not a few of them have obtained the medals of the society for the protection of life from fire and other rewards for gallantry displayed in saving life at the risk of their own lives  on the present occasion however the few policemen present could barely hold their ground against such a band of stalwart desperadoes so the firemen came to the rescue  in the front of the roughs stood a man who was stronger made and better dressed than the others  he had not been pugnacious at first but having got involved in the riot he struck out with the rest  dale sprang at this man who was none other than the halfnautical individual already introduced to the reader by the name of gorman and launched a lefthander at his head but gorman stepped aside and one of his comrades was felled instead  at this the others made a rush in a body at dale but frank corney and baxmore come up at the moment and each knocked down a man  instantly dale seized an instrument from the engine named a preventer like a large boathook and raising it at the full stretch of his powerful arms he brought it swoop down on the heads of the roughssix of whom including gorman measured their length on the ground  meanwhile bill moxey and jack williams who had charge of the branch which is considered the post of honour at a firehad paid no attention whatever to this little episode but the instant the order was given had conveyed their branch into the building and up to the first floor where they thought they could reach the fire more directly for it is an axiom in fire brigades to get into a burning building without delay and attack the fire at its heart  they got the hose up a staircase and began to play through a doorway at the head of it but to their surprise did not make any impression whatever  two other engines however were at work by this timeso the fire was kept in check  something wrong here said moxey speaking with difficulty owing to the dense smoke  owing to the same cause it was impossible to see what was wrong  ill go in an see said mason dropping on his hands and knees and creeping into the room with his mouth as close to the ground as possible  this he did because in a room on fire there is always a current of comparatively fresh air at the floor  presently the sound of masons small hatchet was heard cutting up woodwork and in a few seconds he rushed out almost choking  there said he stick the branch through that hole  youve bin playin all this time up agin a board partition  moxey and williams advanced put the branch through the partition and the result was at once obvious in the diminution of smoke and increase of steam  while these incidents were occurring outside and inside the building the crowd was still waiting in breathless expectation for the reappearance of conductor forest of the fireescape for the events just narrated although taking a long time to tell were enacted in a few minutes  presently forest appeared at the window of the second floor with two infants in his arms  instead of sending these down the canvas trough of the escape in the usual wayat the risk of their necks for they were very younghe clasped them to his breast and plunging into it himself headforemost descended in that position checking his speed by spreading out his knees against the sides of the canvas  once again he sprang up the escape amid the cheers of the people and reentered the window  at that moment the attention of the crowd was diverted by the sudden appearance of a man at one of the windows of the first floor  he was all on fire and had evidently been aroused to his awful position unexpectedly for he was in such confusion that he did not observe the fireescape at the other window  after shouting wildly for a few seconds and tossing his arms in the air he leaped out and came to the ground with stunning violence  two policemen extinguished the fire that was about him and then procuring a horsecloth lifted him up tenderly and carried him away  it may perhaps surprise the reader that this man was not roused sooner by the turmoil and noise that was going on around him but it is a fact that heavy sleepers are sometimes found by the firemen sound asleep and in utter ignorance of what has been going on long after a large portion of the houses in which they dwell have been in flames  when forest entered the window the second time he found the smoke thicker than before and had some difficulty in groping his wayfor smoke that may be breathed with comparative ease is found to be very severe on the eyes  he succeeded however in finding a woman lying insensible on the floor of the room above  in carrying her to the window he fell over a small child which was lying on the floor in a state of insensibility  grasping the latter with his left hand he seized its nightdress with his teeth and with the woman on his shoulder appeared on the top of the flyladder which he descended in safety  the cheers and shouts of the crowd were deafening as forest came down but the woman who had begun to recover said that her brother was in a loft above the room in which she had been found  the conductor therefore went up again got on the roof of the house broke through the tiles and with much difficulty pulled the man through the aperture and conveyed him safely to the ground  see note 1  the firemen were already at forests heels and as soon as he dragged the man through the hole in the roof frank and baxmore jumped into it with the branch and immediately attacked the fire  by this time all the engines of the district in which the fire had occurred and one from each of the two adjoining districts had arrived and were in full play and one by one the individual men from the distant stations came dropping in and reported themselves to dale mr braidwood not being present on that occasion  there was thus a strong force of fresh firemen on the ground and these as they came up were sentin military parlanceto relieve skirmishers  the others were congregated in front of the door moving quietly about looking on and chatting in undertones  such of the public as arrived late at the fire no doubt formed a very erroneous impression in regard to these men for not only did they appear to be lounging about doing nothing but they were helped by one of their number to a glass of brandysuch of them at least as chose to take it  but those who had witnessed the fire from the beginning knew that these men had toiled with every nerve and muscle strained for upwards of an hour in the face of almost unbearable heat halfsuffocated by smoke and drenched by hot water  they were resting now and they had much need of rest for some of them had come out of the burning house almost fainting from exposure to heat and smoke indeed mason had fainted but the fresh air soon revived him and after a glass of brandy he recovered sufficiently to be fit for duty again in half an hour  frank and baxmore were the last to be relieved  when two fresh men came up and took the branch they descended the stairs and a strange descent it was  the wooden stair or flight of open steps which they had to descend first was burnt to charcoal and looked as if it would fall to pieces with a touch  i hope itll bear said frank to baxmore who went first  bear or not bear we must go down said baxmore  he went unhesitatingly upon it and although the steps bent ominously there was enough of sound wood to sustain him  the second stair also of wood had not been quite so much charred but so great was the quantity of water poured continuously into the house that it formed a regular watercourse of the staircase down which heaps of plaster and bricks and burnt rubbish had been washed and had stuck here and there forming obstructions on which the water broke and round which it roared in the form of what might have been a very respectable mountaintorrent with this striking difference that the water which rushed down it was hot in consequence of its having passed through such glowing materials  the lower staircase was a stone onethe worst of all stairs in a fire owing to its liability to crack at its connection with the wall from the combined influence of heat and cold water  just as the two men reached the head of it it fell without warning in a mass of ruins  never mind said baxmore the fireescape is still at the window  so saying he ran through the smoke and reached it  frank was about to follow when he observed a shut door  without having any definite intention he laid hold of the handle and found that it was locked on the insidehe knew that for he saw the end of the key sticking through the keyhole  at once he threw his weight on it and burst it open  to his amazement he found a little old lady sitting quietly but in great trepidation in an easychair partially clothed in very scanty garments which she had evidently thrown on in great haste  go away young man she screamed drawing a shawl tightly round her go away i say how dare you sir  why maam cried frank striding up to her the house is on fire come ill carry you out  nono she cried pushing him resolutely away  what carry meme out thus  i know its on fire  leave me sir i command youi entreat you i will die rather than appear as i amin public  the poor lady finished off with a loud shriek for frank seeing how matters stood and knowing there was not a moment to lose plucked a blanket from the bed overwhelmed her in it and exclaiming forgive me maam lifted her gently in his arms bore her through the smoke down the escape to the street carried her into a neighbouring house the door of which was opportunely open and laid her like a bundle on one of the beds where he left her with strict injunctions to the people of the house to take care of her  frank then went out to rejoin his comrades and refreshed himself with a glass of beer while baxmore being a teetotaller recruited his energies with a glass of water  by this time the fire had been pretty well subdued but there were some parts smouldering about the roof and upper floor that rendered it necessary to keep the engines going while the firemen hunted their foe from room to room and corner to cornerextinguishing him everywhere not however before he had completely gutted the whole house with the exception of part of the ground floor  keep away from the walls men said dale coming up to the group who were resting  at that moment there was a cry raised that some one was in the cellars  at the word baxmore ran into the house and descended to the basement there was little smoke here but from the roof water was running down in a thick warm shower which drenched him in a few minutes  he ran through the whole place but found no one until he opened the door of a closet when he discovered two old women who had taken refuge there one being deaf and the other lame as her crutches testified  they were up to the knees in water and the same element was pouring in continuous streams on their headsyet like the old lady upstairs they refused to move or be moved  finding that persuasion was useless baxmore ran up for a horsecloth and returning threw it over the head of the deaf old woman whom he bore kicking violently into the street  the other was carried out in the same fashiononly that she screamed violently being unable to kick  soon after that the fire was completely extinguished and the engines and men returned to their several stations leaving london once again in comparative repose    note 1  it is perhaps right to state here that a deed similar to this in nearly every point was performed by conductor samuel wood a member of the london fireescape brigade for which he received a testimonial signed by the then lord mayor and a silver watch with 20 pounds from the inhabitants of whitechapel  wood saved nearly 200 lives by his own personal exertions  many of his brave comrades have also done deeds that are well worthy of record but we have not space to do more than allude to them here    chapter fourteen  joe corneys adventure with ghosts  when we said that the firemen returned to their respective stations it must not be supposed that the house which had been burnt was left in forlorn wretchedness  no one of the firemen remained to watch over it and guard against the upstarting of any sneaking spark that might have managed to conceal itself  the man selected for this duty was joe corney  unfortunately for joe this was the only part of a firemans duty that he did not relish  joe corney was both by nature and education very superstitious  he believed implicitly in ghosts and knew an innumerable host of persons male and female who had seen people who said they had seen ghosts  he was too honest to say he had ever seen a ghost himself but he had been very near seein wan two or three times and he lived in perpetual expectation and dread of meeting one face to face before he died  joe was as brave as a lion and faced danger and sometimes even what appeared to be certain death with as much unflinching courage as the bravest of his comrades  once in particular he had walked with the branch in his hands along the burning roof of a tottering warehouse near the docks in order to gain a point from which he could play on the flames so as to prevent them spreading to the next warehouse and so check a fire which might have easily become one of the great fires of london  joe was therefore a man who could not be easily frightened yet joe trembled in his shoes when he had the most distant prospect of meeting with a ghost  there was no help for it however  he had been appointed to watch the ruin and being a man who cherished a strong sense of duty he set himself doggedly to make the most of his circumstances  it was past one oclock when the fire was finally extinguished  a few nightbirds and late revellers still hung about it as if in the hope that it would burst forth again and afford them fresh excitement but before two oclock everyone had gone away and joe was left alone with his preventer and lantern  even the policeman on the beat appeared to avoid him for although he passed the ruin at regular intervals in his rounds he did not stop at it beyond a few moments to see that the firemans lantern was burning and all right  corney me lad said joe to himself its bad luck has befallen ye this night but face yer luck like a man now and shame it  encouraging himself thus he grasped his preventer and pulled about the debris in various places of which he had some suspicion but the engines had done their work so effectually that not a spark remained then joe walked up and down and in and out for an hour studied the halfconsumed pictures that still hung on the walls of one of the lower rooms which had not been completely destroyed moralised on the dire confusion and ruin that could be accomplished in so short a space of time reflected on the probable condition of the unfortunates who had been burnt out on the mutability of human affairs in general and wondered what his owld mother would think of him if she saw him in his forlorn situation  this latter thought caused his mind to revert to ghosts but he was comforted by hearing the slow distant footfall of the policeman  on it came not unlike the supposed step of an unearthly visitant until the guardian of the night stood revealed before him on the other side of the road  its a cowld night intirely cried corney  it is responded the policeman  how goes the inimy inquired the fireman  just gone three replied the other  the policemans voice although gruff was goodhumoured and hearty but he was evidently a strict disciplinarian for he uttered no other word and passed on  faix im gettin slaipy remarked joe to himself with a loud yawn ill go and rest a bit  so saying he reentered the ruin and with the aid of his lantern sought about for the least uncomfortable apartment on the ground floor he selected one which was comparatively weathertight  that is to say only one of the windows had been dashed out and the ceiling was entire with the exception of a hole about four feet wide through which the charred beams above could be seen depicted against the black sky  there was about an inch of water on the floor but this was a small matter for joes boots were thick and strong  the door too had been burst off its hinges and lay on the floor but joe could raise this and place it in its original position  the room had been a parlour and there were several damaged prints hanging on the walls besides a quantity of detached paper hanging from them  most of the furniture had been removed at the commencement of the fire but a few broken articles remained and one big old easychair which had either been forgotten or deemed unworthy of removal by the men of the salvage corps  see note 1  joe wheeled the chair to the fireplacenot that there was any fire in it on the contrary it was choked up with fallen bricks and mortar and the hearth was flooded with water but as joe remarked to himself it felt more homelike an sociable to sit wid wans feet on the finder  having erected the door in front of its own doorway joe leaned his preventer against the wall placed his lantern on the chimneypiece and sat down to meditate  he had not meditated long when the steady draught of air from the window at his back began to tell upon him  och but its a cowld wind said he  ill try the other side theres nothin like facin wans inimies  acting on this idea he changed his position turning his face to the window and his back to the door  well he remarked on sitting down again theres about as much draught from the door but sure yeve improved yer sitivation corney for havent ye the illigant prospect of over the way through the windy  not long after this joes mind became much affected with ghostly memories  this condition was aggravated by an intense desire to sleep for the poor man had been hard worked that day and stood much in need of repose  he frequently fell asleep and frequently awoke  on falling asleep his helmet performed extremely undignified gyrations  on awaking he always started opened his eyes very wide looked round inquiringly then smiled and resumed a more easy position  but awake or asleep his thoughts ran always in the same channel  during one of those waking moments joe heard a sound which rooted him to his seat with horror and would doubtless have caused his hair to stand on end if the helmet would have allowed it  the sound was simple enough in itself however being slight slow and regular and was only horrible in joes mind because of his being utterly unable to account for it or to conceive what it could be  whatever the sound was it banished sleep from his eyes for at least a quarter of an hour  at last unable to stand the strain of uncertainty he arose drew his hatchet took down his lantern and coughing loudly and sternlyas though to say  have a care im comingremoved the door and went cautiously into the passage where the sound appeared to come from  it did not cease on his appearing but went on slowly and steadily and louder than before it appeared to be at his very elbow yet joe could see nothing and a cold perspiration broke out on him  och av i could only see it he gasped  just as he said this he did see it for a turn of his lantern revealed the fact that a drop of water fell regularly from one of the burnt beams upon a large sheet of paper which had been torn from the passage wall this resting on the irregular rubbish formed a sort of drum which gave forth a hollow sound  ah then but ye are a goose joe corney me boy said the fireman as he turned away with an amiable smile and resumed his seat after replacing the door  about this time the wind began to rise and came in irregular gusts  at each gust the door was blown from the wall an inch or so and fell back with a noise that invariably awoke joe with a start  he looked round each time quickly but as the door remained quiet he did not discover the cause of his alarm  after it had done this several times joe became so to speak desperately courageous  git out wid ye he cried angrily on being startled again wasnt the last wan all a sham an sure yere the same  go long in pacean goodnight  as he said this the overtaxed man fell asleep at the same moment a heavy gust of wind drove the door in altogether and dashed it down on his head  fortunately being somewhat charred the panel that struck his helmet was driven out so that joe came by no greater damage than the fright which caused his heart to bound into his throat for he really believed that the ghost had got him at last  relieving himself of the door which he laid on the floor lest it should play him the same prank over again joe corney once more settled himself in the easychair and resolved to give his mind to meditation  just then the city clocks pealed forth the hour of four oclock  this is perhaps the quietest hour of the twentyfour in london  before this most of the latest revellers have gone home and few of the early risers are moving  there was one active mind at work at that hour howevernamely that of gormanwho after recovering from the blow given him by dale went to his own home on the banks of the thames in the unaristocratic locality of london bridge  gorman owned a small boat and did various kinds of business with it but gormans occupations were numerous and not definite  he was everything by turns and nothing long  when visible to the outward eye and that wasnt often his chief occupations were loafing about and drinking  on the present occasion he drank a good deal more than usual and lay down to sleep vowing vengeance against firemen in general and dale in particular  two or three hours later he awoke and leaving his house crossed london bridge and wended his way back to the scene of the fire without any definite intention but with savage desires in his breast  he reached it just at that point where joe corney had seated himself to meditate as above described  joes powers of meditation were not great at any time  at that particular time they were exerted in vain for his head began to sway backward and forward and to either side despite his best efforts to the contrary  waiting in the shadow of a doorway until the policeman should pass out of sight and hearing and cautiously stepping over the debris that encumbered the threshold of the burnt house gorman peeped into the room where the light told him that some one kept watch  great was his satisfaction and grim his smile when he saw that a stalwart fireman sat there apparently asleep  being only able to see his back he could not make certain who it wasbut from the bulk of the man and breadth of the shoulders he concluded that it was dale  anyhow it was one of his enemies and that was sufficient for gormans nature was of that brutal kind that he would risk his life any day in order to gratify his vengeance and it signified little to him which of his enemies fell in his way so long as it was one of them  taking up a brick from the floor he raised himself to his full height and dashed it down on the head of the sleeping man  just at that moment corneys nodding head chanced to fall forward and the brick only hit the comb of his helmet knocking it over his eyes  next moment he was grappling with gorman  as on previous occasions joes heart had leaped to his throat and that the ghost was upon him at last he had no manner of doubt but no sooner did he feel the human arm of gorman and behold his face than his native courage returned with a bound  he gave his antagonist a squeeze that nearly crushed his ribs together and at the same time hurled him against the opposite wall  but gorman was powerful and savage  he recovered himself and sprang like a tiger on joe who received him in a warm embrace with an irish yell  the struggle of the two strong men was for a few moments terrible but not doubtful for joes muscles had been brought into splendid training at the gymnastics  he soon forced gorman down on one knee but at the same moment a mass of brickwork which had been in a toppling condition and was probably shaken down by the violence of their movements fell on the floor above broke through it and struck both men to the ground  joe lay stunned and motionless for a few seconds for a beam had hit him on the head but gorman leaped up and made off a moment or two before the entrance of the policeman who had run back to the house on hearing joes warwhoop  it is needless to add that joe spent the remainder of his vigil that night in an extremely wakeful condition and that he gave a most graphic account of his adventure with the ghosts on his return to the station    note 1  the salvage corps is a body of men appointed by the insurance offices to save and protect goods at fires and otherwise to watch over their interests  they wear a uniform and helmets something like those of the firemen and generally follow close in their wakein their own vanswhen fires break out    chapter fifteen  a new phase of life  mother said master william willders one night to his parent as he sat at supperwhich meal consisted of bread and milk hes the jolliest old feller that mr tippet i ever came across  im glad you like him willie said mrs willders who was busy patching the knees of a pair of small unmentionables but i wish dear that you would not use slang in your speech and remember that fellow is not spelt with an er at the end of it  come now mother dont you go an get sarcastic  it dont suit you besides theres no occasion for itfor i do my best to keep it down but im so choke full of it that a word or two will spurt up now and then in spite o me  mrs willders smiled and continued her patching willie grinned and continued his supper  mother said willie after an interval of silence  well my son  what dye think the old fellerah  i mean fellowis up to just now  i dont know willie  hes inventin a calclatin machine as is to do anythin from simple addition to fractions an he says if it works well hell carry it on to algebra an mathematics up to the fizmal calclus or somethin o that sort  oh youve no notion how he strains himself at it  he sits down in his shirtsleeves at a writintable hes got in a corner an tears

it works  i hope he wont for chips an i are great friends though weve only bin a month together  i hope hes a good man said mrs willders thoughtfully  well im sure he must be cried willie with enthusiasm for he is very kind to me and also to many poor folk that come about him regularly  im gettin to know their faces now and when to expect em he always takes em into his back roomall sorts old men and old women an children most of em seedy enough but some of em well off to look at  what he says to em i dont know but they usually come out very grave an go away thankin him and sayin they wont forget his advice  if the advice is to come back soon they certainly dont forget it  and hes a great philosopher too mother for he often talks to me about my intlecs  he said jist tother day willie said he get into a habit o usin yer brains my boy  the almighty put us into this world wellmade machines intended to be used in all our parts  now youll find thousands of people who use their muscles and neglect their brains and thousands of others who use their brains and neglect their muscles  both are wrong boy were machines lad wonderful machinesand the machines wont work well if theyre not used all over  dont that sound grand mother  willie might have received an answer if he had waited for one but he was too impatient and went rattling on  and who dye think mother came to see old tippet the other day but little cattley the clowns boy  you remember my tellin you about little cattley and the auction dont you  yes willie  well he came and just as he was goin away i ran out an asked him how the fairy was  shes very ill he said shakin his head and lookin so mournful that i had not the heart to ask more  but im goin to see them mother  thats right my boy said mrs willders with a pleased look i like to hear you talk of going to see people in distress  blessed are they that consider the poor willie  oh as to that you know i dont know that they are poor  only i feel sort o sorry for em somehow and im awful anxious to see a real live fairy even though she is ill  when are you going inquired mrs willders  tomorrow night on my way home  did you look in at franks lodging in passing tonight  yes i did and found that he was in the station on duty again  it wasnt a bad sprain you see an itll teach him not to go jumpin out of a firstfloor window again  he couldnt help it said the widow  you know his escape by the stair had been cut off and there was no other way left  no other way cried willie why didnt he drop  hes so proud of his strength is blazes that he jumped offhand a purpose to show it ha hed be the better of some o my caution  now mother im off to bed  get the bible then said mrs willders  willie got up and fetched a large old family bible from a shelf and laid it on the table before his mother who read a chapter and prayed with her son after which willie gave her one of his roystering kisses and went to bed  the lamps had been lighted for some time next night and the shopwindows were pouring forth their bright rays making the streets appear as light as day when willie found himself in the small disreputable street near london bridge in which cattley the clown dwelt  remembering the directions given to him by little jim cattley he soon found the underground abode near the burnt house the ruins of which had already been cleared away and a considerable portion of a new tenement erected  if the stair leading to the clowns dwelling was dark the passage at the foot of it was darker and as willie groped his way carefully along he might have imagined it to be a place inhabited only by rats or cats had not gleams of light and the sound of voices from sundry closed doors betokened the presence of human beings  of the compound smells peculiar to the place those of beer and tobacco predominated  at the farther end of this passage there was an abrupt turn to the left which brought the boy unexpectedly to a partially open door where a scene so strange met his eyes that he involuntarily stood still and gazed  in a corner of the room which was almost destitute of furniture a little girl wan weary and thin lay on a miserable pallet with scanty covering over her  beside her stood cattleynot as when first introduced in a seedy coat and hat but in full stage costumewith three balls on his head white face triangular roses on his cheeks and his mouth extended outward and upward at the corners by means of red paint  little jim sat on the bed beside his sister clad in pink skintights with cheeks and face similar to his father and a red crest or comb of worsted on his head  ziza darling are you feeling better my lamb said the elder clown with a gravity of expression in his real mouth that contrasted strangely with the expression conveyed by the painted corners  no father not much but perhaps im gettin better though i dont feel it said the sweet faint voice of the child as she opened her large hollow eyes and looked upward  so thats the fairy thought willie sadly as he gazed on the childs beautiful though wasted features  well have done drectly darling said the clown tenderly only one more turn and then well leave you to rest quietly for some hours now then here we are again he added bounding into the middle of the room with a wild laugh  come along jim try that jump once more  jim did not speak but pressing his lips to his sisters brow leaped after his sire who was standing an a remarkably vigorous attitude with his legs wide apart and his arms akimbo looking back over his shoulder  here we go cried jim in a tiny voice running up his fathers leg and side stepping lightly on his shoulder and planting one foot on his head  jump down said the clown gravely  jim obeyed  that wont do jim  you must do it all in one run no pausing on the waybut whoop up you go and both feet on my head at once  dont be afeard you cant tumble you know  im not afeard father said jim but i aint quite springy in my heart tonight  stand again and see if i dont do it right off  cattley the elder threw himself into the required attitude and cattley junior rushed at him ran up him as a cat runs up a tree and in a moment was standing on his fathers head with his arms extended whoopnext moment he was turning round in the air and whoop in another moment he was standing on the ground bowing respectfully to a supposed audience  to jims immense amazement the supposed audience applauded him heartily and said bravyo young un as it stepped into the room in the person of william willders  why who may you be inquired the clown senior stepping up to the intruder  before willie could answer the clown junior sprang on his fathers shoulders and whispered in his ear  whatever he said the result was an expression of benignity and condescension on the clowns faceas far as paint would allow of such expression  glad to meet you master willders he said  proud to know anyone connected with t tippet esquire whos a trump  give us your flipper what may be the object of your unexpected though welcome visit to this this subterraneous grotto which may be said to be next door to the coral caves where the mermaids dwell  yes and theres one o the mermaids singing remarked the clown junior with a comical leer as a womans voice was heard in violent altercation with some one  shes a sayin of her prayers now beseechin of her husband to let her have her own way  willie explained that having had the pleasure of meeting with jim at an auction sale some weeks ago he had called to renew his acquaintance and jim said he remembered the incidentand that if he was not mistaken a desire to see a live fairy in plain close with her wings off had something to do with his visit  here she isby the way whats your name  bill willders  here she is bill this is the fairy he said in quite an altered tone as he went to the bed and took one of his sisters thin hands in both of his  ziza this is the feller i told ye of as wanted to see you dear blongs to mr tippet  ziza smiled faintly as she extended her hand to willie who took it and pressed it gently  willie felt a wonderfully strong sensation within his heart as he looked into the sufferers large liquid eyes and for a few seconds he could not speak  suddenly he exclaimed well you aint one bit like what i expected to see  youre more like a angel than a fairy  ziza smiled again and said she didnt feel like either the one or the other  my poor lamb said the clown sitting down on the bed and parting the dark hair on zizas forehead with a hand as gentle as that of a mother were goin now  times up  shall i ask mrs smith to stay with you again till we come back  oh no no cried the child hurriedly and squeezing her fingers into her eyes as if to shut out some disagreeable object  not mrs smith id rather be alone  i wish i could stay with you ziza said jim earnestly  its of no use wishin jim said his father you cant get off a single night  if you was to fail em youd lose your engagement and we cant afford that just at this time you know but ill try to get mrs james to come  shes a good woman i know and  mister cattley interrupted willie if youll allow a particlarly humble individual to make a observation i would say theres nothin in life to prevent me from keeping this ere fairy company till you come back  ive nothin particular to do as i knows on an im raither fond of lonely meditation so if the fairy wants to go to sleep itll make no odds to me so longs it pleases her  thankee lad said the clown but youll git wearied i fear for we wont be home till mornin  ah interrupted willie till daylight does appear  but thats no odds neithercause im not married yet so theres nobody awaitin for meand he winked to jim at this point my mother knows im out  the clown grinned at this  youd make one of us youngster said he if ye can jump  howsever im obliged by your offer so you can stay if ziza would like it  ziza said she would like it with such goodwill that willie adored her from that moment and vowed in his heart he would nurse her till shehe did not like to finish the sentence yet somehow the little that he had heard and seen of the child led him irresistibly to the conclusion that she was dying  this having been satisfactorily arranged the cattleys senior and junior threw cloaks round them exchanged their wigs for caps and regardless of the absurd appearance of their faces hurried out to one of the minor theatres with heavy hearts because of the little fairy left so ill and comfortless at home  in a few minutes they were tumbling on the stage cracking their jokes and convulsing the house with laughter    chapter sixteen  willie in a new light  left alone with the fairy willie willders began his duties as sicknurse a sphere of action into which he had never thought of being introduced even in his wildest dreams  he began by asking the fairy if she was all right and comfortable to which she replied that she was not upon which he explained that he meant was she as right and comfortable as could be expected in the circumstances could he do anything for her in fact or get her anything that would make her more comfortable than she wasbut the fairy shook her poor head and said no  come now wont you have somethin to eat  what had you for dinner said willie in a cheery voice looking round the room but not discovering any symptoms of food beyond a few empty plates and cups the latter without handles and a teapot with half a spout  i had a little bread and butter said the fairy  no tipple inquired the nurse  no except water  aint there none in the house  no  dye git nothin better at other times inquired willie in surprise  not often  father is very poor  he was ill for a long time too and if it hadnt been for your kind master i think we should all have starved  hes better now but he needs pretty good living to keep him up to his workfor theres a deal of training to be done and it wears him out if he dont get meat  but the pantomimes began and we were getting on better when the fire came and burnt everything we had almost so we cant afford much meat or beer and i dont like beer so ive got them persuaded to let me live on bread and butter and water  i would like tea better because its hot but we cant afford that  here was a revelation  the fairy lived upon bread and butter and water willie thought that but for the interpolation of the butter it would have borne marvellous resemblance to prison fare  when had you dinner inquired willie suddenly  i think about four oclock  an cant you eat nothin now  again the fairy shook her head  nor drink  look if theres anything in the teapot said the fairy  willie looked shook his head and said not a drop  any leaves  why yyes he brought the pot nearer to the candle there are a few usedup ones  oh do pour some hot water into it but i fear the water is cold and the fires too low to boil it and i know the coals are done but father gets paid his salary tomorrow and hell give me some tea then  hes very kind to me father is and so is jim  she sighed as she spoke and shut her eyes  ziza said willie in a careless tone you wont object to my leavin you for a few minutes only a few i want to get a little fresh air an see what sort of a night it is i wont be long gone  ziza so far from objecting said that she was used to being left alone for long long hours at a time and wouldnt mind it  so willie put the candle nearer to her bedside placed a teacup of water within reach went out shut the door softly behind him groped his way through the passage and up the stair and got into the street  that day his eccentric employer had paid him his first months wage a sovereign with many complimentary remarks as to his usefulness  the golden coin lay in his pocket  it was the first he had ever earned  he had intended to go straight home and lay the shining piece in his mothers lap for willie was a peculiar boy and had some strange notions in regard to the destination of firstfruits  where he had got them nobody could tell  perhaps his mother knew but nobody ever questioned her upon the point  taking this gold piece from his pocket he ran into the nearest respectable street and selected there the most respectable grocers shop into which he entered and demanded a pound of the shopmans best tea a pound of his best sugar a pound of his best butter a cut of his best bacon and one of his best waxcandles  willie knew nothing about relative proportion in regard to such things he only knew that they were usually bought and consumed together  the shopman looked at the little purchaser in surprise but as willie emphatically repeated his demands he gave him the required articles  on receiving the sovereign he looked twice at willie rung the piece of money three times on the counter and then returned the change  gathering the packages in his arms and putting the candle between his vest and bosom he went into a bakers shop purchased a loaf and returned to the subterraneous grotto laden like the bee  to say that the fairy was surprised when he displayed these things would be a feeble use of language  she opened her large eyes until willie begged her in alarm not to open them wider for fear they should come out at which sally she laughed and then being weak she cried  after that she fell in with her nurses humour and the two proceeded to have a night of it  ziza said shed be a real fairy and tell him what to do and willie said hed be a gnome or a hefairy and do it  at the outset willie discovered that he had forgotten coals but this was rectified by another five minutes airing and a rousing fire was quickly roaring in the chimney while the kettle sang and spluttered on it like a sympathetic thing as no doubt it was  willie cleared the small table that stood at the invalids bed side and arranged upon it the loaf the teapot two cracked teacups the butter and sugar and the waxcandlewhich latter was stuck into a quart bottle in default of a better candlestick  now aint that jolly said the nurse sitting down and rubbing his hands  very replied the patient her eyes sparkling with delight  its so like a scene in a play continued willie  only much more real suggested the fairy  now then ziza have a cup o tea fresh from the market o chiny as your dad would say if he was sellin it by auction  hes a knowin codger your dad is ziza  there  i knowed i forgot somethin elsethe cream  i dont mind it indeed i dont said ziza earnestly  willie had started up to run out and rectify this omission but on being assured that the fairy liked tea almost as well without as with cream and that there was no cream to be got near at hand he sat down again and continued to do the honours of the table  first he made the fairy sit up in bed and commented sadly on her poor thin neck as she did it observing that she was nothing better than a skeleton in a skin  then he took off his own jacket and put it on her shoulders tying the arms round her neck  next he placed a piece of board in front of her saying that it was a capital tray and on this he arranged the viands neatly  now then go at it ziza he said when all was arranged  ziza who received his attentions with looks that were wonderfully gleeful for one in her weak state of health went at it with such vigour that the bread was eaten and the tea drunk in a few minutes and the supply had to be renewed  when she was in the middle of her second round of buttered toast for willie had toasted the bread she stopped suddenly  why dont you go on asked willie  because you have not eaten or drunk one mouthful yet  but im lookin at you and aint that better  howsever if ye wont go on ill not keep you back and with that willie set to work and being uncommonly hungry did what he styled terrible execution among the wittles  for some time the nurse and patient ate in comparative silence but by degrees they began to talk and as they became more confidential their talk became more personal  dyou like bein a fairy said willie after a lull in the conversation  no i dont replied ziza  why not  becausebecausei dont like the kind of things we have to do and andin short i dont like it at all and i often pray god to deliver me from it  thats strange now said willie i would have thought it great fun to be a fairy  id rather be a little clown or a hefairy myself now than anything else i know of except a fireman  a fireman willie  yes a fireman  my brother blazafrank i mean is one and he saved the lives of some people not long since  of course willie here diverged into a graphic account of the fire in beverly square and seeing that ziza listened with intense earnestness he dilated upon every point and went with special minuteness into the doings of frank  when he concluded ziza heaved a very deep sigh and closed her eyes  ive tired you ziza exclaimed willie jumping up with a look of anxiety and removing the teaboard and jacket as the child slipped down under the clothes  he asked if she wanted to go to sleep  yes for im very tired she sighed languidly then added but please read to me a little first  what book am i to read you said willie looking round the room where no book of any kind was to be seen  here its under the pillow  willie put his hand under the pillow and pulled out a small pocketbible  read the third chapter of saint johns gospel said the child closing her eyes  willie read in the monotonous tones of a schoolboys voice until he came to the sixteenth verse for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life  stop at that verse whispered ziza  ill go to sleep now  her deep breathing soon proclaimed that she was in the land of dreams so willie removed the candle a little further away from her and then resting his elbows on the table and his head in his hands began to read the bible  he turned over a few pages without much intention of finding any particular place for he was beginning to feel sleepy  the first words his eyes fell upon were blessed are they that consider the poor  he roused up a little at this and read the verse again for he connected it with the fact that the fairy was poor  then he pondered it for some time and falling asleep dropt his head on the bible with such force that he woke up for a little and tried to read again but do what he would he could not get beyond that verse finally he gave up the attempt and laying his forehead down upon it quickly fell sound asleep  in this state the couple were discovered an hour or two later by messrs cattley senior and junior on their return from the theatre  inscrutable mysteries say what is this exclaimed the elder clown advancing into the room on tiptoe  apostrophising his eye and one betty martin the younger clown said that it was a rare go and no mistake whereupon his father laid his hand on willies shoulder and gently shook him  eh another cup ziza exclaimed the selfaccused nurse as he put out his hand to seize the teapot  hallo  i thought it was the fairy he added looking up with a sleepy smile i do believe ive gone and fell asleep  why lad where got ye all those things inquired the senior cattley laying aside his cloak and cap and speaking in a low tone for ziza was still sleeping soundly  well i got em replied willie in a meditative tone from a friend of minea very partikler friend o mineas declines to let me mention his name so youll have to be satisfied with the wittles and without the name of the wirtuous giver  praps it was a dook or a squire or a archbishop as did it  anyway his name warnt walker  see now youve bin an woke up the fairy  the sick child moved as he spoke but it was only to turn without awaking on her side  well lad said the clown sitting down and looking wistfully in the face of his daughter youve got your own reasons for not tellin me mayhap ive a pretty good guessanyhow i say god bless him for i do blieve hes saved the childs life  ive not seen her sleep like that for weeks  look at her jim aint she like her old self  yes

her  ill bid ye goodnight now said willie buttoning up his jacket to the chin and pulling his cap down on his brows with the air of a man who has a long walk before him  youre off are youeh said the elder clown rising and taking willie by the hand well youre a good lad  thankee for comin here an takin care of ziza  my subterranean grotto aint much to boast of but such as it is youre welcome to it at all times  goodnight  goodnight said willie goodnight jim  jim replied goodnight heartily and then willie stepped into the dark passage  he glanced back at the fairy before shutting the door but her eyes were closed so he said goodnight to her in his heart and went home    chapter seventeen  home life  my dear miss tippet i shall never no never get over it  so said and so undoubtedly thought a thin little old lady with remarkably bright eyes and a sweet old face as she sat sipping tea at miss tippets elbow  it was in the drawingroom of miss deemas that she sat and the eagle sat opposite to her  it was very dreadful responded miss tippet with a sighvery  it was awful  i know i shall never get over itnever repeated the little old lady finishing her tea and asking for another cup in the calmest possible voice with the sweetest possible smile  oh yes you will mrs denman said miss deemas snappishly  no indeed i wont repeated mrs denman how can i  just think of the situation  sitting in my chair in dishabille when a mana man miss dee  well i know what a man is said the eagle bitterly why dont you go on  burst himself through my bedroomdoor continued mrs denman with lime and charcoal and brickdust and water streaming down his face ffoolded me in his arms bore me out into the streetthe street oh  i shall never never get over it and so little so very little clothing on me  how much had you on asked miss deemas in a deep voice the calmness of which contrasted forcibly with mrs denmans excited tones  really miss deemas i see no necessity for going into particulars  it is sufficient to know that i was carried by a man into the street in the face of some thousands of people for i heard them cheering though i saw them not  i know i shall never get over itanother cup my love not quite so much sugarno not if i were to live to the age of methusaleh  i dont wonder indeed i dont murmured the sympathetic miss tippet i think julia dear you are a little too hard on mrs denman  how would you like to have been carried out of a burning house in such a way by a big rough man  oh my dear interposed mrs denman i did not say he was rough  big he certainly was and strong but i must do him the justice to say that the man lilifoh me lifted me up very tenderly and carried me as though i had been an infant and he my mother through smoke and fire and water into the street before the eyes of thewholeoh its too awful to think of  stuff ejaculated miss deemas pecking a piece of cake out of her fingers as she would metaphorically of course have pecked the eyes out of the head of frank willders or any other man  didnt you say he put a blanket round you  of course miss deemas i should have died otherwise of pure shame  no you wouldnt retorted the eagle  you would probably have been half suffocated and a good deal dirtied and you might have been singed but you wouldnt have died and what need you care now for the people saw nothing but a bundle  you might have been a bundle of old clothes for all they knew or cared  all they wanted to see was the bravery as they call it of the man as if there were not hundreds upon hundreds of women who would do the same thing if their muscles were strong enough and occasion served  but it was a brave act you know said miss tippet timidly  i dont know that retorted miss deemas helping herself to more cake with as much decision of manner as if she had been carrying it off by force of arms from before the very muzzles of a masculine battery  i dont know that  he had to escape you know for his own life and he might as well bring a bundle along with him as not  yes but then said miss tippet he first went up thethe thingumy you know  no he didnt retorted miss deemas smartly he was in the house at the time and only came down the thingumy as you call it  it was a peculiarity of miss deemass character that she claimed the right to be as rude as she chose to people in her own house and rather prided herself on this evidence of independence  in my opinion said mrs denman his being in the burning house at all of his own accord was of itself evidence of courage  i think the fireman is a brave young man  thus much mrs denman said with dignity to miss deemas  the remainder of her speech she addressed to miss tippet  but my dear i feel that although i owe this young man a debt of gratitude which i can never repay i shall never be able to look my preserver in the face  i know that his mind will always revert when he sees me to the fifigthe figure that he lifted out of that easychair  but there is one thing i have resolved on continued the little old lady in more cheerful tones as she asked for another cup of tea and that is to get a fireman to instruct me as to the best method of saving my own life should fire again break out in my dwelling  the eagle gave a hysterical chuckle at this  i have already written to one who has been recommended to me as a shrewd man and he is coming to call on me this very evening at seven oclock  mrs denman started as if her own remark had recalled something and pulled out her watch  why it is almost halfpast six she exclaimed rising hastily excuse a hurried departure miss deemas  your society and sympathy she looked pointedly at miss tippet here have been so agreeable that i did not observe how time was flying  goodbye miss deemas  good evening dear miss tippet  miss deemas bowed  goodbye my love said miss tippet bustling round her friend  im so glad to have met you and i hope youll come and see me soon 6 poorthing lane remember  come whenever you please dear mrs denman yes yes time does indeed fly as you say or as my friend sir archibald whatshisname used to remark tempit fugus something rewhatsisname  goodbye dear mrs denman  while the ladies were thus engaged one whom the eagle would have tossed her beak at with supreme contempt was enjoying himself in the bosom of his family  this was none other than joe corney himself who having received a stop for a distant fire had looked in on his wife to tell her of the note he had received from mrs denman  the family bosom resided in a small portion of a small house in the small street where the fireengine dwelt  joe had laid his helmet on the table and having flung himself into a chair seized his youngest child a little girl in his arms raised her high above his head and laughed in her face at which the child chuckled and crowed to the best of its ability  meanwhile his eldest son joe junior immediately donned the helmet seized the poker thrust the head of it into a bucket of water and pointing the other end at a supposed fire began to work an imaginary handpump with all his might  its goin out daddy cried the urchin  sure hes a true chip o the owld block observed his mother who was preparing the evening meal of the family hes uncommon fond o fire an wather  molly my dear said the fireman id have ye kape a sharp eye on that same chip else his fondness for fire may lead to more wather than yed wish for  ive bin thinkin that same meself honey replied mrs corney placing a pile of buttered toast on the table  shure didnt i kitch him puttin a match to the straw bed the other day  me only consolation is that ivery wan in the house knows how to use the handpump  ah then ye wont believe it joe but i catched the baby at it this mornin no later an shed have got it to work i do believe av she hadnt tumbled right over into the bucket an all but drownded herself but you know the stations not far off if the house did git alight shure ye might run the hose from the ingin to here without so much as drawin her out o the shed  now then joe tays ready so fall to  joe did fall to with the appetite of a man who knows what it is to toil hard late and early  joe junior laid aside the helmet and poker and did his duty at the viands like the true son of a firemannot to say an irishmanand for five minutes or so the family enjoyed themselves in silence  after that joe senior heaved a sigh and said that it would be about time for him to go and see the old lady  what can it be she wants asked mrs corney  dont know replied her husband  all i know is that shes the old lady as was bundled neck and crop out o the firstfloor windy o the house in holborn by frank willders  shes a quare owld woman that shes got two houses no less wan over the coachmakers shopthe shop bein her propertyan wan in russell square  they say shes rich enough to line her coffin with goold an inch thick  spakin o that molly my dear a quare thing happened to me the other night  its what ye call a coinsidence  whats that joe  well taint easy to explain but it means two things happenin together in a most onlikely waydye see  no i dont joe replied mrs corney helping herself to another slice of toast  well it dont matter much resumed joe but this is what it was mr dale an me was sittin about two in the mornin at the station fire smokin our pipes for it was my turn on duty an chattin away about one thing an another when somehow we got upon tellin our experiences an dale he tells me a story o how he was once called to a fire in a cemetary an had to go down among the coffinsfor they was afirean what a fright some o his men got when just as he had finished an all my flesh was creepin at wot id heard there comes a ring at the bell an a call to a fire in portland street  i runs an gets out the ingin an frank he was my mate that night he rings up the boys an away we wint in tin minutes  it wasnt far an when we got there in we wint into the house which was full o smoke but no fire to be seen we wint coughin and sneezin an rubbin our eyes down into a cellar where the lads of another ingin was at work before us wi the handpumps an would ye belaive it but the walls o that cellar was lined wi coffins  true for ye there they was all sizes as thick as they could stand  i thought i was dramin but it was no drame for it was an undertakers shop an when i wint upstairs after we diskivered the fire an put it out i sees two coffins on tressels lyin ready for use  wan was blackpainted wood no doubt for a poor man an nothin inside ot  the other alongside was covered wid superfine black cloth an silvermounted handles an nameplate an it was all padded inside an lined wid white satin  white satin joe  youre jokin  as sure as your names molly it was white satin repeated joe i wouldnt have belaived it av i hadnt seen it but thats the way the quality goes to their graves  i looks at the two coffins as i was comin away an thinks i to myself i wonder whether the poor man or the rich manll be most comfortable when theyre laid there  now molly ill bid ye goodnight an be off to see this owld lady this mrs denman  look afther that boy now an kape the matches out of his way whativer ye do  with this very needful warning joe corney kissed his wife and the baby and went off to the station to obtain leave of absence for a couple of hours    chapter eighteen  joe corneys advice  wending his way through the crowded streets joe soon reached the door of the house in russell square which belonged to mrs denman  the good lady had made use of a cab after quitting miss deemas so that she was at home and seated in a luxuriously easy chair in her splendidly furnished drawingroom when the fireman applied the knocker  does mrs denman stop here my dear said joe to the smart servantgirl who opened the door  yes replied the girl and she told me to show you up to the drawingroom whenever you came  step this way  joe pulled off his cap and followed the maid who ushered him into the presence of the little old lady  pray take a chair said mrs denman pointing to one which had evidently been placed close to hers on purpose  you are a fireman i understand  yes maam replied joe ive bin more nor tin years at the business now  you must find it a very warm business i should imagine said mrs denman with a smile  true for ye maam  my bodys bin amost burnt off my sowl over and over again but its cowld enough too sometimes specially when yeve got to watch the premises after the fires bin put out of a cowld winter night as i had to do at your house maam  mrs denman started and turned pale  what dyou mean to say that you were at the fire inin holborn that night  indeed i do maam  och but ye must be ill maam for yer face is as white as a ghost  shure but its red now  let me shout for some wather for ye maam  no no my good man said mrs denman recovering herself a little iithe fact is it did not occur to me that you had been at that fire else i would neverbut no matter  you didnt seeseeany one saved did you  see any one saved is it  shure i did an yerself among the lot och but its frank willders as knows how to do a thing nately  he brought ye out o the windy maam on his showlder as handy as if yed bin a carpetbag or a porkmanty maam  hush man exclaimed poor mrs denman blushing scarlet for she was a very sensitive old lady i cannot bear to think of it  but how couldyou know it was me  ititmight have been anythinga bundle you know  not by no manes replied the candid joe  we seed your shape quite plain maam for the blankit was tight round ye  mrs denman covered her face with her hand at this point and resting her elbow on the arm of her chair reflected that the thing was beyond remedy and that as the man had come and was now looking at her matters could not be worse so she resolved to carry out her original intention and question him as to the best course of action in the event of fire  my good man she said i have taken the liberty of asking you to come here to tell me what i should do to guard against fire in future  joe rubbed his nose and looked at the ground then he stroked his chin and looked at the old lady then a look of intelligence lighted up his expressive countenance as he said abruptly  is yer house an furniture insured maam  no it is not replied mrs denman  i have never insured in my life because although i hear of fires every day in london it has never occurred to me until lately that there was any probability of my house being burned  i know it was very foolish of me but i shall see to having it done directly  thats right maam said joe with an approving nod  if you seed the heaps an heaps o splendid furnitur an goods an buildins as is burnt every day amost in london an lost to the owners cause they grudged the few shillins of insurance or cause they was careless an didnt blieve a fire would ever come to them no matter how many might come to other folk youd insure yer house an furnitur first thing i the mornin maam  i have no doubt you say what is quite correct mr corney and i will certainly attend to this matter in future but i am more particularly anxious to know how i should act if the house in which i live were to take fire  get out of it as fast as possible said joe promptly an screech out fire till yer sides is sore  but suppose said mrs denman with a faint smile that the fire is burning in the stair and the house full of smoke what am i to do  och  i see yer drift now maam said joe with a knowing look  av its that what ye wants to know ill just with your lave maam give ye a small discourse on the subjic  joe cleared his throat and began with the air of a man who knows what he is talking about  its as well maam to begin by tryin to prevent yer house ketchin fireprevention bein better nor cure  if yed kape clear o that theres two or three small matters to remimber  first of all take oncommon good care o your matches an dont let the childer git at em if youve any in the house  would you believe it maam there was above fifty fires in london last year that was known to ha bin set alight by childers playin wid matches or by careless servants lettin em drop an treadin on em  how many asked mrs denman in surprise  fifty maam  dear me you amaze me fireman i had supposed there were not so many fires in london in a year  a year exclaimed joe  why theres nearly three fires on the average every twintyfour hours in london an thats about a thousand fires in the year maam  are you sure of what you say fireman  quite sure maam ye can ax mr braidwood if ye dont blieve me  mrs denman still in a state of blank amazement said that she did not doubt him and bade him go on  well then resumed joe look well arter yer matches an niver read in bed thats the way hundreds o houses get a light  when you light a candle with a bit o paper maam dont throw it on the floor an tramp on it an think its out for many a time theres a small spark left an the wind as always blows along the floor sets it up an it kitches somethin and there you areblazes an hollerin an ingins goin full swing in no time  then maam never go for to blow out yer gas an if theres an escape dont rest till ye get a gasfitter and find it out but more particularly dont try to find it yerself with a candle  och if yed only seen the blows up as ive seen from gas yed look better arter it  not more nor two weeks gone by maam we was called to attend a fire which was caused by an escape o gas  wen we got there the fire was out but sitch a mess you niver did see  it was a house maam in the west end with the most illigant painted walls and cornices and gimcracks idged all with goold  the family had just got into itnoo done up for em only by good luck there wasnt much o the furnitur in  they had smelled a horrid smell o gas for a good while but couldnt find it  at last the missis she goes with a workman an a candle to look for it an sure enough they found it in a bathroom  it had been escapin in a small closet at the end o the bath and not bein able to git out for the door was a tight fit it had gone away an filled all the space between the ceilins an floors an between the lath and plaster and the walls  the moment the door in the bathroom was opened all this gas took light an blowed up like gunpowder  the whole inner skin o the beautiful drawingroom maam was blowed into the middle of the room  the cook who was in the drawinroom passage she was blowd down stairs the workman as opened the little door he was blowd flat on his back an the missis as was standin with her back to a door she was lifted off her legs and blowd right through the doorway into a bedroom  gracious exclaimed the horrified mrs denman was she killed  no maam she warnt killed  be good luck they was only stunned an dreadful skeared but no bones was broken  mrs denman found relief in a sigh  well maam continued joe let me advise you to sweep yer chimleys once a month  when your chimley gets afire the sparks they get out and when sparks get out of a windy night theres no tellin what they wont light up  its my opinion maam that them as makes the laws should more nor double the fines for chimleys goin afire  but suppose maam your house gets alight in spite of youwell then the question is whats best to do  mrs denman nodded her old head six or seven times as though to say that is precisely the question  ill tell you maamhere joe held up the forefinger of his right hand impressively  in the first place every one in a house ought to know all the outs and ins of it cause if youve got to look for things for the first time when the cry of fire is raised its not likely that youll find em  now dye know or do the servants know or does anybody in the house know where the trap in the roof is  mrs denman appeared to meditate for a minute and then said that she was not sure  she herself did not know and she thought the servants might be ignorant on the point but she rather thought there was an old one in the pantry but they had long kept a cat and so didnt require it  och exclaimed joe with a broad grin sure its a trapdoor im spakin of  mrs denman professed utter ignorance on this point and when told that it ought to be known to every one in the house as a mode of escape in the event of fire she mildly requested to know what she would have to do if there were such a trap  why get out on the roof to be sure mrs denman shivered and get along the tiles to the next house mrs denman shut her eyes and shuddered an so make yer escape  then you should have a ladder fixed to this trapdoor so as it couldnt be took away and ye should have some dozen fathoms o halfinch rope always handy cause if ye was cut off from the staircase by fire an from the roof by smoke ye might have to let yourself down from a windy  its as well too to know how to knot sheets and blankets together so that the ties wont slip for if you have no rope theyd be better than nothin  you should also have a handpump maam and a bucket of water always handy cause if you take a fire at the beginnin its easy put out  an its as well to know that you should go into a room on fire on your hands and knees with your nose close to the groundjust as a pinterdog goescause theres more air there than overhead an its better to go in wi the handpump the first thing  dont wait to dress maam  stop stop mr corney cried mrs denman holding up her hand  the little lady was stunned with the rapid utterance of the enthusiastic fireman and with the dreadful suggestion that she mrs denman should in the dead of night get upon the roof of her dwelling and scramble over the tiles or let herself down by a rope from a window into the public street or creep into a burning room on her hands and knees with her nose to the ground like a pointer and all this too in her nightdress so she begged of him to stop and said  but you forget fireman it is impossible for me to do any of these dreadful things  well maam returned joe coolly it wouldnt be easythough for the matter o that its wonderful what people will do for their lives but i was tellin ye maam what ought to be done so as somebody else in the house might do it if you couldnt  but suppose maam continued joe without waiting for a reply suppose that the house is alight  well the first thing youve got to do is not to get into a fluster  that cant do no good you know and is sure to do mischief  keep cool  thats the first thing maam and be deliberate in all ye do  the second thing is to wrap a blanket round ye an get out of the house as fast as ye can without stoppin to dress  its of no use lookin put out maam for its better to escape without yer cloes than to be burnt alive in em  then be careful to shut all doors after ye as ye go  this keeps the air from gittin at the fire and so smothers it down till the ingines come up  also keep all windows shut  if the smoke is like to choke ye git yer nose as near the ground as possible an go along on yer hands and knees  a bit o flannel or a worsted sock held over yer mouth an nose will help you to bear it better  if ye cant escape by the streetdoor or the trap in the roof then get into a front room where you will be more easy to be got at wid ladders or fireescapes an see that every mimber o the household is there  many a wan has bin forgotten in the hurryskurry of a fire and left asleep in bed ignorant o the danger till too late when a cool head might have missed em and wakened em in time  whatever ye do maamkeep cool  the probability of poor mrs denman keeping cool in such circumstances was uncommonly small for she was at that moment hot all over and her face flushed at the mere recital of such horrors  joe then went on to state that the very last thing she should do was to jump from a window a somewhat unnecessary piece of advice poor miss denman thought and that when she was compelled to take such a step she should first of all pitch over all the blankets and bedding she could lay hold of to make her fall easy  he wound up with an emphatic reiteration of the assurance that her only chance lay in keeping cool  that night poor mrs denman in a condition of mind that is utterly indescribable because inconceivable went through the whole of the dreadful processes which joe had described and did it too with miraculous presence of mind and energyin her dreams    chapter nineteen  dark plots are hatched  gorman was one of those peculiar characters who in personal appearance are totally devoid of peculiarity  he was a middlesized thickset commonplace grave quiet man very powerfulbut not apparently so one whom it was impossible to find out unless he chose to let himself be found out  above all he was a reserved man  everybody knew well enough at least among his intimates that he was named gorman but not one of the number knew what his christian name was  a few were aware that he signed himself d  gorman but whether the d represented david dastard drunkard or demon was a matter of pure speculation to all a few of his female acquaintance excepted for he had no friends who asserted roundly that it represented them all and some were even willing to go the length of saying that it represented more and stood for dirty drivelling desperate and a few other choice words which it is quite unnecessary to mention  only a few and these were among the knowing and peculiarly observant ones of gormans intimates said that d stood for deep  but then many of those who thus pronounced their opinion were comparatively worthless characters given to scandal and slander so the reader must not allow himself to be biassed too much by their report  certain it is however that when gorman was asked on one occasion what his christian name was he replied that he had no christian name because he didnt believe in christianity and that he signed himself d to be distinguished from the other gormans who might chance to exist in the universe  people were not at all shocked at his bold statement of unbelief because in the circle in which he moved the same disbelief was pretty general  besides many other traits and qualities definable and indefinable gorman had the power of assuming the appearance either of a burglar of the lowest type or a welltodo contractor or tradesman  a slight change in dress and manner were sufficient to metamorphose him beyond recognition  everybody knew also that gorman was the landlord of a small publichouse at the corner of a dirty street not far from london bridge and that he kept a stout middleaged man on the premises to do the duty of host while he himself went about other business which nobody knew of and which no one could find out although many had tried to do so with all their might  every day in the year gorman might have been seen at the golden swan but never for longer than a few minutes at a time when he inspected the books received the cash drawn the day before and made an impression on all in the premises that tended to convince them they were well looked after  humph ejaculated gorman as he finished counting the dirty coppers and pieces of silver which his agent had delivered to him and dropped them from his dirty fingers into a dirty leather bag business is dull i think  it aint brisk just now sir replied the deputylandlord of the golden swan  gorman received this reply with another humph and then putting the bag in his coat pocket prepared to leave  no one bin askin for me inquired gorman  no sir no one  ill be back tomorrow about this time  the deputy knew that this was false for his employer invariably came at a different hour each day in order to take the house by surprise but he said very well sir as usual  and mind continued gorman that you put the lights out  youre uncommon careful about that i hope  it is worthy of remark in reference to gormans anxiety about putting out lights that he had been burned out of several sets of premises in the course of a few years  he was quite a martyr as it were to fire unaccountably worried pursued and damaged by itno not damaged by the way because gorman was a prudent man and always insured to the full amount  his enemies sometimes said above it but neither they nor we have any means of proving or disproving that  the deputy protested that he always exercised the utmost precaution in putting everything out every nightfrom the last beery lingerer to the gasand that he felt quite put out himself at being asked the question as it implied a doubt of his care and attention to business  hereupon gorman said goodnight and the deputy returned to the counter where besotted men and drunken women awaited his attendance  threequarters of an hour sufficed to convey gorman from the east to the west end of london  here he sought the wellknown precincts of poorthing lane and entered the shop of mr david boone  that worthy received him with a look of glad surprise but with a feeling of the deepest misery  anyone inside asked gorman  no said boone cept the boy  ill call him to mind the shop and then we can be alone  as gorman did not vouchsafe a reply but walked straight into the little room behind the shop boone called the boy and bade him mind the shop while he held private consultation with his friend  the shopboy enjoyed the name of robert roddy  he was a softfaced washedout youth with a disposition to wink both eyes in a meek manner roughspoken people called him an idiot but roddy was not quite such an idiot as they took him for  he obeyed his masters mandate by sitting down on a tall stool near the window and occupied himself in attempting to carve a human face on the head of a walkingstick  glad to see you mr gorman said boone seating his tall body on a low stool at the side of his friend who with his hat on had thrown himself into an armchair and spread out both legs before the fire very glad to see you indeed in mylittle sanctum my withdrawing room if i may venture to use the name to which i retire during the intervals of business  boone said this with an air of pleasantry and smiled but his visitor did not encourage him  pretty long intervals i should suppose he growled pulling out his pipe and lighting it  boone admitted with a sigh that they were and observed that trade was extremely dullastonishingly dull  why would you believe it sir i have not sold twenty shillings worth o goods all last week and only one waxdoll within the month although its gettin well on for christmastime  one would amost fancy the childrn was about to give up such vanities an devote themselves to serious business  its a serious business for the like of us anyhow  again mr boone smiled and again failed to make an agreeable impression on his visitor who demanded in a surly tone if he had been thinking over it and made up his mind to do it  boones face changed at this indefinite question and became a shade paler than it was by nature as he replied hesitatingly that he had been thinking over it and that he had made up his mind not to do it  oh you have have you said gorman in a tone of irony  very good then ill trouble you to pay me the three hundred pounds you owe me by this day next week and the rent of this here tenement for last half  boones face became still paler  youre a hard landlord said he  youre a soft tenant retorted gorman  you know what the punishment is by law continued boone  yesdeath said the other drily but you know as well as i do that its never carried out nowadays  but penal servitude for ten or twenty years aint much better  some men think its worse replied gorman with a savage grin but youve no need to fear  if you only take the right precautions its impossible to find it out an ill engage to put ye up to doin it in such a way that there wont be a scrap the size of a sixpence left to convict you  only put a bold face on it and the things done and your fortune made as well as mine  the mans voice and manner softened a little as he said this for he thought he perceived symptoms of wavering in his tenant who covered his face with his large thin hands and sighed deeply  come dont be hard on me he said at length i really havent got courage to go through with this  only give me a little more time and ill  very good interrupted gorman with an oath as he rose and dashed his pipe into fragments on the hearth if you wont burn yourself out o this scrape  hush hush man said boone in a hoarse whisper not so loud my lad will hear you  come ill think of it  will you do it demanded the other fiercely  you know the alternative if you dont  ruination  exactly so and that without delay  ruination either way murmured boone sadly to himself as though he were counting the cost  tut man said his landlord becoming more gentle its nothing of the sort  if you only take my advice itll be a jolly blaze which instead of ending in smoke will end in some thousands of pounds and commencing business again on fresh capital  come ive not got time to waste with you  theres no escape for you so youd better say yes else ill go and have a talk with a legal friend of mine who is used to screwing gold out of most unpromising mines  david boones face had by this time become so pale that it could not become paler so it turned somewhat green instead  his teeth too had a tendency to chatter when he spoke but by a strong mental effort he prevented this and said in a subdued voice that he was willing to do whatever his landlord pleased to command  thats all right said gorman resuming his seat in front of the fire now you speak like a man  sit down and ill go over the matter with you and make your mind easy by showing you that it aint either a difficult or risky piece of work  bless you it aint the first time ive been up to that sort o thing  it did not require the diabolical leer that accompanied this remark to convince his hearer of its truth  now then said gorman with a business air first of all how stands the stock in the shop  rather low answered boone who had reseated himself on the stool in fact ive got little or nothing more than what is visible  ive bin so hardup of late that ive had to crowd everything into view an make the most of appearances  all the dressed dolls has got their frocks spread out and the undressed ones their arms an legs throwed about to make em take up as much room as possible  the lids of all the work boxes is open the slates and puzzle boxes stuck up in single rows with their broadsides to the front and the collapsin worlds is all inflated everything in the front is real but all behind is sham dummies an empty boxes  gorman opened his eyes a little on hearing this  good he said after a pause youre a cleverer fellow than i took you for  i thought you was well off and im sure the neighbours think the same for the place looks pretty full an thrivin  i suppose now if it was all sold off you wouldnt have enough to pay up my loans  nothink like it said boone earnestly  ive slaved night and day an done my best but lucks again me  ah thats cause youve bin fainthearted in time past youre goin to be bold in time to come my good fellow youll have to be bold you will  come ill explain how  but first let me ask how much you think the stock is worth  not much above fifty pounds  hum it looks like more  thats true an the people about think its worth two or three hundred for you see i have a lot o cheap jewellery and some of the inquisitive ones have been trying to pump me of late  they all think im thriving said boone shaking his head sorrowfully  so you are so you are man said gorman jocosely and youre going to make your fortune soon and so am i though at present im poor enough  however that dont matter  heres your course for the future which youre to steer by  youll go an begin chatting with your neighbours at odd times and your conversation curiously enough will always be about the times bein better than usual an about the approach of christmas an the stock you mean to lay in against that festive season  after that youll lay in the stockfifty pounds worth and it wont be sham itll be real  but where is the money to come from asked boone  oh dont you trouble about the money ill provide that  ive a curious power of raisin the wind on easy terms  fifty pounds worth of real goods will be bought by you my thriving shopman and youll let some of the neighbours partiklerly these same inquisitive uns see the goods and some of the invoices and youll tell them that youve laid in 150 pounds worth of stock and that you think of layin in more  on the strength of the press o business youll get another shoplad and youll keep em employed a good deal goin messages so that they wont get to know much about the state o things and ill take care to send you a rare lot o customers wholl come pretty often for small purchases and give the shop an uncommon thrivin look  oh well make a splendid appearance of doin business and well have lots of witnesses ready to bother these sharp lawyers if need bewont we boone  poor boone whose colour had not yet improved much smiled in a ghastly way but said nothing  well then resumed gorman after a few minutes meditation when this thriving trade is in full swing well get it insured  you know it would never do to risk the loss of such valuable stock by fireeh boone common prudence pints that out  you say what you have is worth fifty and what youll lay in is fifty more makin a hundred so well insure for five hundred theres a clear gain of four hundred per cent only think of that  well the house i have already insured for five hundred that makes nine hundred and well insure the furniture and fixings for fifty thatll look businesslike you know  then the goods laid in will be carefully removed in the night at various times before the fire so you had better see that they are small and portable objects thatll make another fifty pounds if not more  so i see my way to a thousand pounds  thats a neat sum aint it boone  still boone made no reply but favoured his visitor with another ghastly smile  well then pursued gorman all youve got to do is on a certain night that i will fix to set the shop alight and the things done quite easy  but thats not all  youve got an old mother i believe well it would be very unnatural in you to run the risk of being burned to death an leaving her penniless so youll insure your life for five hundred pounds and ill pay the first premium on it and then youll die  die exclaimed boone with a start  ay why not if youre to get a small fortune by it  but hows that to be managed inquired boone with a look of doubt  managed  nothing easier  youll be so desperately upset by the fire perhaps singed a little toothat youll be taken ill and wont get better  ill look carefully after you as your loving friend and when youre about dead youll get up and clear off in a quiet way  ill make arrangements to have a corpse as like you as possible put in your bed and then youll be buried comfortably and well share the insurance of course youll have to leave this part of the town and disguise yourself but that wont be difficult  why man if you were only fond of a joke you might even attend your own funeral  its not the first time that sort of thing has bin done  so then youll have your life insured but not yet  your first business is to set about the purchase of the stock and let me tell you theres no time to lose so i advise you to write out the orders this very night  ill fetch you fifty pounds in a day or two and youll pay up at once  itll look well you know and after its all settled well divide the plunder  now then goodnight  i congratulate you on your thriving business  gorman opened the door of the inner room as he said the last words so that the lad in the shop might hear them  as he passed through the shop he whispered in his friends ear mind the consequences if you fail and then left him with another hearty goodnight  poor david boone having sold himself to the tempter went about his duties like an abject slave  he began by ordering goods from various wholesale dealers in the city after which he took occasion to stand a good deal at his shop door and accost such of his neighbours as chanced to pass  the conversation at such times invariably began with the interesting topic of the weather on which abstruse subject boone and his friends displayed a surprising profundity of knowledge by stating not only what the weather was at the time being and what it had been in time past but what it was likely to be in time to come  it soon diverged however to business and usually ended in a display of fresh goods and invoices and in references on the part of boone to the felicitous state of trade at the time  do what he would however this thriving tradesman could not act his part well  in the midst of his prosperity his smiles were ghastly and his laughter was sardonic  even when commenting on the prosperity of trade his sighs were frequent and deep  one of his friends thought and said that prosperity was turning the poor mans brain  others thought that he was becoming quite unnatural and unaccountable in his deportment and a few acting on the principle of the sailors parrot which could not speak much but was a tremendous thinker gave no outward indication of their thoughts beyond wise looks and grave shakes of the head by which most people understood them to signify that they feared there was a screw loose somewhere  this latter sentiment it will be observed is a very common one among the unusually wise ones of the earth and is conveniently safe inasmuch as it is more or less true of every person place and thing in this sad world of loose screws    chapter twenty  a little more hatching  one night edward hooper having consulted his watch frequently and compared it with the clock of slow notoriety in the warehouse in tooley street until his patience was almost gone at last received the warning hiss and had his books shut and put away before the minutegun began to boom  he was out at the door and halfway up the lane with his hat a good deal on one side of his head and very much over one eye before the last shot was fired  its a jolly time of day thisthe jolliest hour of the twentyfour muttered ned to himself with a smile  his speech was thick and his smile was rather idiotic by reason of his having drunk more than his usual allowance at dinner that day  by way of mending matters ned resolved to renew his potations immediately and announced his intentions to himself in the following words  commiboyyyoull goave anurrer poroporerthash yer sort  at a certain point in the drunkards downward career he ceases to have any control over himself and increases his speed from the usual staggering jogtrot to a brisk zigzag gallop that generally terminates abruptly in the grave  ned hooper a kindhearted fellow enough and thinking himself not so bad as he seemed because of that same kindheartedness had reached the galloping point and was travelling unusually fast along the high road to ruin  being of a generous nature ned was in the habit of extending his patronage to various beershops among others to that one near london bridge which has been described as the property of gorman  business pleasure or fancy led him to that shop on the evening in question  he was standing at the counter steadying himself with his left hand and holding a pewterpot in his right when the door of the inner room opened and gorman crossed the floor  he was in a thoughtful mood and was about to pass out without raising his eyes when ned arrested him with  good evnin misher gormn  gorman glanced back and then turned away as if in contempt but suddenly checking himself returned and going up to hooper with as affable a smile as his countenance would admit of said that he was delighted to shake hands with him and that he was the very man he wanted to see as he wished to have a word of conversation with him  convshasn wi me said ned swaying himself to and fro as he endeavoured to look steadily in the face of his friend fire away shen  im sh man fr convshashn grave or gay comicrshublime s all the shame to me  he finished the pot and laid it with an immense assumption of care on the counter  come out well walk as we talk said gorman  ha to bshure ats poeticalvery good very good well waalk as we talkha ha very good  didnt know you wash a poeteh dont look like un  come along then said gorman taking him by the arm  shtop said ned drawing himself up with an air of drivelling dignity and thrusting his hand into his trouserpocket  what for asked the other  i havent ppaid for my bbeer  never mind the beer  ill stand that said gorman dragging his friend away  ned consented to be dragged and said something to the effect that he hoped to have the pleasure of standing treat on some future occasion  now then said gorman somewhat firmly though not sternly for he knew that ned hooper was not to be browbeat are you sober enough to attend to what ive got to say  shober as a dudge answered ned  gorman looked earnestly in his face for a few moments and then began to talk to him in a continuous strain by way of testing him  cfound these cabs an bbusseses a feller ccant hear a word said ned  your lodgins ant far off are they  close t and answered ned  lets go to em said gorman  in silence ned hooper led the way and conducting his friend into his chamber as he styled his poor abode begged him to be seated and threw himself into an armchair beside the little fire  there was a pipe on the chimneypiece which ned began to fill while gorman opened the conversation  youre hard up rather just now said the latter  xactly so thats my cndition to a tee  ned smiled as he said this as though it were the most satisfactory state of things possible and lighted his pipe  of course youve no objection to make a fifty pound note or so asked gorman  none in sh wold always he became very earnest here always shposin that i make it honestly  of course of course rejoined the other i would never propose anything that would lead you into a scrape  you dont suppose i would do that i hope  shertenly not replied ned with a smile fire away  well then im anxious just now to procure a dead corpse  ned hooper drunk as he was felt somewhat startled by this but being a man of wandering and lively imagination turned from the point in question to an idea suggested by it  i shpose a living corpse wouldnt do would it  it must be a dead oneeh  be serious if you can said gorman angrily  i want a corpse  ned hooper who like many goodhumoured men was easily roused when in a state of intoxication fired at the tone of gormans voice and looked at him as sternly as he could while he replied  what have i got to do with yer wants an yer copseseh  you dont shpose i keep a stock of em on hand readymade do youeh  then relapsing into a placid frame he smiled and added but fire away ol feller im yer man for convsashin specially wen its in the comic line  thats right said gorman clapping ned on the shoulder and endeavouring to conciliate him now then the question is how am i to get un  ah thash the question if shaksprs to be blieved  well but couldnt you think said gorman  think exclaimed the other what am i paid a salary for  what are my brains doin night an dayeh  of course i can think thashs my prfeshion is thinking  gorman cast a scornful look at his friend but he deemed it prudent to admit the truth of what he said and suggested that he might perhaps remember a certain medical student with whom he had once held pleasant converse in his gormans house of entertainment  rmember him of course hiccuped ned  well then he could get us a corpse you knowcouldnt he  ned looked uncommonly knowing at this point and admitted that he rather thought he coulda dozen of them if necessary  well i want one and ill pay well for it if its of the right sort it must be at least sixfoot two thin about the jaws with lanky black hair and a yellow complexion  ned smiled facetiously but at the same time shook his head  six ft two said he ant a common height it wont be easy to get un so tall butbut he pondered here with a grave expression of countenance but it might be stretched a bit you knoweh  as to thin jaws most of em is thin about sh jaws an black hair aint un uncommon  ned yawned at this point and looked very sleepy  well youll speak to him wont you and ill make it worth while for both of you  oh yesh ill shpeak to him said ned as his head fell on the table and his senses utterly forsook him  bah you beast muttered gorman casting a glance of scorn on his friend as he rose to leave  he had the sense before going to extinguish the candle lest ned should overturn it and set the house on fire not that he cared either for ned or the house but as the former happened to be necessary to him just then he did not wish him to be burned too soon  then he went out closing the door softly after him  half an hour afterwards neds friend and fellowlodger john barret entered the room accompanied by fred auberly  come fred said the former we can chat here without interr hallo  whats wrong inquired fred endeavouring to make out objects by the feeble flicker of the fire while his friend struck a light  barret did not reply but the light soon revealed neds disreputable figure half sprawling on and half clinging to the table  surely this is not your chum john asked fred in surprise  yes thats him answered barret in a low sad voice  help me to get him into bed like a good fellow  without a word the young men raised the drunken figure in their arms and laid it like some loathsome object on one of the beds in the adjoining room  how can you stay with him asked auberly after they had returned to the other room and seated themselves at the fire  he is an old schoolfellow of mine said barret in a low voice  im sorry youve seen him in this state  he was a very different fellow once i assure you and if it were not for that accursed drink he would be as pleasant a companion as exists  you know i have no friends in london save yourself fred and this young fellowi came to stay with him at first not knowing his character and now i remain to try to tosave him but i fear his case is hopeless  come fred we wont talk of it  you were saying as we came along that your father is sterner than ever were you not  ay said fred with a sigh he wont even let me call to see my sister toothats the worst of it  for the rest i care not my brush has sustained me hitherto and my love for my profession increases every hour  i feel towards it john as a man may be supposed to feel towards the sweet young girl whom wicked guardians had for a long time refused to let him wed  nothing but death shall separate us now  barret smiled and was about to make some rejoinder but he checked himself and changed the subject  how is your sister said he i have not heard of her for a long time  not well answered fred the doctors shake their heads and speak of the shock having been too much for her  dear loo she never was strong and im afraid that she has received fatal injury on the night of the fire  im told that my poor father is sadly cut up about herattends on her night and day and humours her every whim  this is so unlike him that it fills me with anxiety on account of dear loo whom i have not seen since i went to live at kensington  kensington fred  i did not know you had gone to live there  i was just going to mention that when we came in  i have got a very comfortable lodging withwho do you think youll never guessmrs willders the mother of our young friend willie who works with old tom tippet upstairs  you may well look surprised  i came upon the lodging quite accidentally and finding that it suited my inclinations and my purse i took it at once for a few weeks  its in a very poor locality no doubt but you know a man must cut his coat according to his cloth and my cloth is not broad at present  but then continued fred with sudden animation its a splendid place for a painter  there are such picturesque regions and bits near it  why kensington gardens are sufficient to make the fortune of a landscapepainterat least in the way of trees then an hours walk takes you to rural scenery or canal scenery with barges bridges boats old stores cottages etcetera oh its a magnificent spot and im hard at work on a picturesque old pump near shepherds bush common with a bit of old brick wall behind it halfcovered with ivy and a gipsylike beggargirl drinking at it out of her hand thatthatll make an impression i think on the royal academy ifif they take it in  ah if they take it in said john barret smiling  well retorted fred auberly i know that is a point of uncertainty and im not very sanguine because there is great lack of room nevertheless i mean to send it  and you know john faint heart never won fair lady so  at this point the conversation was interrupted by a shrill whistle at the top of the house which as it drew nearer became identified with the air of rule britannia  thats willie willders said barret laughing  i guessed as much and with your leave ill call him in  he knows of my having become an inmate of his mothers house and as he is probably going home i would like to send a message to his mother  hallo willie  ay ay sir answered the youth in the tones of a thoroughbred seaman  not that willie had ever been at sea but he was so fond of seamen and had mingled with them so much at the docks as well as those of them who had become firemen that he tried to imitate their gait and tones  come here you scamp and stop your noise  certainly sir said willie with a grin as he entered the room cap in hand  going home lad asked fred  yes sirat least in a permiscuous sort of way entertainin myself as i goes with agreeable talk and improvin obsarvation of the shop winders etceterrer  will you take a message to your mother  surely answered willie  well say to her that i have several calls to make tonight and may be late in getting home but she need not sit up for me as i have the doorkey tell her not to forget to leave the door on the latch  wery good sir said willie  may i make so bold as to ask how miss loo was when you seed her last  not well i regret to say replied fred  indeed  im surprised to hear that for shes agoin out to tea tomorrow night sir  my surprise is greater than yours lad how dyou know that and where is she going to asked auberly  here willie explained in a very elaborate manner that a note had arrived that forenoon from miss tippet inviting mr tippet to tea the following evening and expressing a hope that he would bring with him his clerk mister willders the brother of the brave fireman who had saved loos life and that miss louisa auberly was to be there and that mr tippet had written a note accepting the same  then youll have to take another message from me willie  tell miss tippet when you go tomorrow that i will give myself the pleasure of looking in on her in the course of the evening said fred  mr auberly is not to be there is he  no not as i knows of  well goodnight willie  willie took his departure marching to the usual national air and soon after fred auberly bade his friend goodnight and left him    chapter twenty one  a small teaparty  miss tippets teaparty began by the arrival of willie willders who being fond of society and regardless of fashion understood his hostess literally when she named her teahour  for full half an hour therefore he had the field to himself and improved the occasion by entertaining miss tippet and emma ward with an account of the wonderful inventions that emanated from the fertile brain of mr thomas tippet  strange to say a deep and lasting friendship had sprung up between the eccentric old gentleman and his volatile assistant  willie sympathised so fully with his master in his wild schemes and displayed withal such an aptitude for mechanical contrivance and such a ready appreciation of complex theories that mr tippet soon came to forget his extreme youth and to converse with him propound schemes and new ideas to him and even to ask his advice with as much seriousness as though he had been a fullgrown man  this was of course very gratifying to willie who repaid his masters condescension and kindness by devoting himself heart and soul to the duties of what he styled his profession  he was a good deal put out when his brother frank asked him one day what his profession was and resolving never again to be placed in such an awkward position of ignorance asked his employer what was the name of his business to which the employer replied that it had no particular name but on being urged by his assistant to give it a name he suggested that he might if so disposed style himself a polyartist which he explained meant an artist of many occupations  willie felt that this might be translated jackofalltrades but on mature consideration he resolved to adopt it in the belief that few people would understand what it meant and that thereby he would be invested with a halo of mystery which was upon the whole a gratifying reflection  gradually however willie was led to diverge from his employer to his brother frank in regard to whom miss tippet entertained the strongest feelings of admiration because of his courageous conduct in saving louisa auberly  willie pursued this theme all the more willingly that emma appeared to be deeply interested in it  emma ward was very romantic in her nature yet she had a keen appreciation of the ludicrouswhich caused her to appear somewhat lightheaded and giddy in the eyes of superficial observers but she possessed an underlying earnestness of soul which displayed itself in a thousand ways to those who had much intercourse with her  she was an ardent heroworshipper and while miss tippet was her heroine frank willders was at that time her beau ideal of a hero although she only knew him from description  willie was still in the middle of a glowing account of a fire in which frank and his friends dale and baxmore were the chief actors and emma was listening with heightened colour parted lips and sparkling eyes when matty merryon opened the door and announced mr tippet  that gentleman was still in the act of shaking his sisters hands with both of his and kissing her on both cheeks heartily when matty announced miss deemas  matty being irish allowed her soul to gush out too obviously in her tones so that her feelings towards the eagle though unexpressed were discernible  miss deemas strode up to miss tippet and pecked her on the right cheek much as an eagle might peck a tender rabbit which it could slay and devour if it chose but which it preferred to spare for a time  she was immediately introduced to mr tippet whom she favoured with a stiff bow intended to express armed neutrality in the meantime with a possibility if not a probability of war in the future  the eccentric gentleman felt chilled but ventured to express an opinion in regard to the weather glancing for confirmation of the same towards the window through which he naturally enough expected to see the sky but was baffled by only seeing the green venetian blinds which ruled off the opposite houses in narrow stripes  before he had recovered himself to make any further observation miss deemas had attempted in a condescending way to peck the cheek of emma ward but that young lady feeling disinclined so managed that she received the peck on her forehead  on willie miss deemas bestowed a glance of utter indifference which willie replied to with a gaze of desperate defiance  then miss deemas seated herself on the sofa and asked her dear friend how she did and how she felt and whether things in general were much as usual from which elevated region of generalities she gradually descended into the more particular sphere of gossip and scandal  it is only just to miss tippet to say that the eagle did not find her a congenial bird of prey in this region  on the contrary she had to drag her unwilling friend down into it and as miss tippet was too conscientious and kindhearted to agree with her in her sweeping censures and caustic observations and wilful misconstructions it is difficult to conceive wherein she the eagle found pleasure in her society  probably it was because she found in her one who would submit meekly to any amount of contradiction and listen patiently to any amount of vituperative declamation  so it seems mr auberly has disinherited and dismissed his son my dear said miss deemas smoothing her dress with both hands as though she were about to lay mr auberly in her lap and analyse him  im sorry to say that it is too true julia answered miss tippet with a sigh  ha its so like one of these creatures said miss deemas pursing her thin lips so domineering so towering in their pride of mere physical power  mr tippet glanced at the eagle in surprise not being able to understand to what sort of creatures she made reference  poor frederick sighed miss tippet i dont know what hell do ring the bell emma darling hes such a bold highspirited young man and its all owing to his determination to take toto whatsisname as a profession bring the tea matty  its very sad  that must be a new sort of profession observed miss deemas pointedly  oh  i mean painting you know  its impossible to arrange ones things in such very correct language you know dear julia you are really toooh did you hear of joe corney and whatshisfiremans visit to mrs denman  to be sure you did i forgot it was in your house  it was such a funny account you heard of it brother ring the bell again dear didnt you  mr tippet whose wonted vivacity was quite subdued by the freezing influence of the eagle said that he had not heard of it whereupon miss tippet said that she had heard of it and so had willie willders who had heard of it from his brother frank who had heard of it from joe corney himself and then she attempted to relate the matter but failed and finally asked willie to tell the story which willie did with much gusto looking at miss deemas all the time and speaking in a very positive tone as if he thought she was doubting every word he said and was resolved to hurl it in her teeth whether she chose to believe it or not  capital exclaimed mr tippet laughing heartily when willie had concluded what an energetic old lady she must be  really i must get introduced to her and show her the selfacting fireextinguisher i have just invented  you remember it willie  willie nodded  ive laid it aside for some time but it is very nearly complete now  a little more work on it will finish it  my only difficulty in regard to it is madam he addressed himself to miss deemas here that it is apt to burst and i am uncertain whether or not to add a safetyvalve to prevent such a catastrophe or to make the metal so very strong that nothing short of gunpowder would burst it but then you see that would make the whole affair too heavy  however these are only minor difficulties of detail which a little thought will overcome  miss deemas received all this with a sinister smile and replied with the single word oh after which she turned immediately to miss tippet and remarked that the weather had been unusually warm of late for the season of the year which remark so exasperated willie willders that he turned with a face of crimson to emma and asked her if she didnt feel a draught of cold air coming over her from somewhere and whether she would not sit nearer the fire and farther away from the window  willie meant this for an uncommonly severe cut for miss deemas sat at the end of the sofa near the window  fortunately at this point matty merryon ushered in loo auberly who was instantly enfolded in miss tippets arms and thence transferred to emmas in which she was led to the sofa and gently deposited in the softest corner  darling loo exclaimed miss tippet with tears in her eyes you look so thin and pale  there could be no doubt on that point  little loo as emma styled her was worn to a shadow by sickness which had hitherto baffled the doctors skill  but she was a beautiful shadow such a sweet gentle shadow that one might feel thankful rather than otherwise to be haunted by it  pray dont mind me im too tired to speak to you yet just go on talking  i like to listen said loo softly  with ready kindness miss tippet at once sought to draw attention from the child by reverting to mrs denman and matty created a little opportune confusion by stumbling into the room with the tea  matty usually tripped over the carpet at the door and never seemed to become wiser from experience  poor mrs denman said miss tippet pouring out the tea it must have been an awful shock think of a sugar brother  i always forget what was ioh yes think of a fireman seizing one round the cream willie i know you have a sweet tooth so i dont need to ask if you take sugaryes he carried her down that dreadful whatdyecallit and into the next house with nothing a little more sugar julia  no  nothing on but her whatsisname  oh it was sad sad to lose all her fine things tooher furniture andand thingumies  do try a piece of cake brother  i know a worse case than hers said willie with a knowing look  do you exclaimed miss tippet  oh do tell it cried emma earnestly hes just been telling it to me and it is so sad and interesting  come lets hear about it lad said mr tippet  thus encouraged willie related his adventure with the clowns family and told his tale with such genuine feeling that miss tippet loo and emma found their eyes moist when he had concluded  there was a good deal of comment upon this subject and miss deemas animadverted very strongly upon actors in general and clowns in particular  as to balletgirls she could not find words to express her contempt for them but in reference to this miss tippet ventured to rebuke her friend and to say that although she could not and would not defend the position of these unfortunates yet she felt that they were very much to be pitied seeing that they were in many cases trained to their peculiarly indelicate life by their parents and had been taught to regard balletdancing as quite a proper and legitimate whatsitsname  no doubt this was only a palliation of the life they led but she thought that if anyone was to be severely blamed in the matter it was the people who went to witness and encourage such wicked displays  miss deemas dissented generally from all her friends observations and wishing to change the subject asked loo if her father was coming to fetch her home  no said loo dear papa is not well tonight but he is to send the carriage for me  oh i wish she continued reverting to the previous subject i wish i could do something for these poor people  im so very very sorry for the fairy  so you can if you choose said miss deemas sharply  no indeed i cannot replied loo in an earnest voice im too ill and weak now to be of any use to anyone  once i was useful to dear papa but ever since the fire i have not been of use to anybody only a hindrance to them  since i have been ill i have thought much more about what i read in the bible and ive had a great desire to do good in some way or other but how can iso weak and helpless  loo almost sobbed for her sympathies had been awakened by willie and a chord had been touched which had been vibrating in her breast for some weeks past  your father is rich is he not asked the eagle  yes i believe so  well a word to him may be the cause of much good in the shape of money at least to people in distress but rich people dont always like to spend their money in that way  loo hung down her head and made no reply for she knew that her father did not like to part with money  she had often heard him refuse to do so in days gone by even when very pathetic appeals as she thought were made to him and experience told her that it was in vain to look for help in that quarter  the party was now increased by the arrival of frederick auberly who at once infused life into everybody except miss deemas who had life enough of her own and would by no means accept the loan of any from anyone else  fred therefore ignored her altogether and told stories and cracked jokes and sang songs as if no such female iceberg were present  poor loo was overjoyed to see him and laying her head on his breast bade him speak away and not ask questions only speak and allow her to listen and rest  fred obeyed and at once began an earnest discussion with willie as to the best method of getting a stout gentleman out of a thirdfloor window in case of fire when matty merryon entered with a flushed face and said that a fireman who would not give his name wished to see willie willders for a minute and she was inclined to think it was his brother  what  frank exclaimed willie rising to go downstairs  stay willie cried miss tippet eagerly dont go down  pray let me have him up i should so like to see him and im sure so would loo the man you know who went up the whatsitsname and brought youyes send him up matty  plaze mim he wont come replied the girl i knowd ye would like to see him an axed him in  tell him said miss tippet that i request it as a favour  while matty was delivering this message the eagle took occasion to sniff once or twice in a contemptuous manner and wondered why people worshipped men just because they happened to be big and what they called handsome  for her part she hated all men but if she were to be obliged to choose between any class which she was thankful to say was not necessary in her case she would certainly give the preference to ugly men and small  willie willders nodded his head approvingly and being exasperated into a savage seriocomic condition as well by the eagles voice and aspect as by her sentiments he said that she was quite right and that if he were a lady like her he would hold the same opinions because then said he being stout i could wallop my husband an keep him down an the contrast of his ugly face with mine would not be so obvious  franks step on the stair fortunately prevented this open and desperate attack being noticed  next moment all turned their eyes in breathless expectation towards the door  being on duty frank appeared in firemans costume with the sailorlike undress cap in his hand  he bowed to the company and apologised to miss tippet for intruding but he had wished to ask his brother willie to call at the fire station on his way home to convey a letter to his mother and merely meant to see him at the door  im very glad you came mr willders said miss tippet for i assure you we all regard you as the preserver of our dear miss auberlys life when you went up thethething  here she is  you must shake thats itso nice  the last part of miss tippets remark referred to loo stretching out her hand to frank who advanced promptly and shook it with great tenderness he then shook hands with fred who expressed his regard for him in warm terms also with mr tippet who paid him some enthusiastic compliments and said something to the effect that the parent stem from which two such branches as he and willie had grown must be a prime plant  as he turned from mr tippetwho being very short appeared to be looking up at a steeple while he delivered this opinionfranks eyes encountered those of emma ward who was gazing at him in such undisguised admiration that being a somewhat bashful man he felt a little confused and dropped his eyes figuratively on the floor  emma blushed scarlet with shame at being caught in this way and thereafter became rigidly grave and indifferent  when frank again raised his eyeswhich by the way he did immediatelythey encountered the eagle glance of miss deemas frowning defiance on him as being a sort of type or pattern specimen of his highly objectionable race  had miss deemas been a man which would have gratified her more than she could have expressed frank could have met the frown with a smile of pity  as it was he turned to the little eager countenance of miss tippet and felt deeper respect than ever for the sex thus showing that just as an exception proves a rule so an unfavourable contrast strengthens a cause  pray sit down mr willders entreated miss tippet earnestly i should like so much to hear how you did it from your own lips and how you can possibly venture up such dreadful things just like going up the outside of the monument  dear loo and you came down it too but to be sure your eyes were shut which was as well for you were only in your nightah well yes do sit down mr firemwillders i mean  frank thanked her but declined on the ground that he was on duty and that he feared he was doing wrong in even looking in on them for the few minutes he had stayed  goodnight maam he continued goodnight youll call at the station on your way home willie  willie said he would and then all the company excepting the eagle shook hands with the stalwart fireman looking up at him as if he were a hero just returned from the proverbial hundred fights  even emma ward condescended to shake hands with him at parting  perhaps youll be in the middle of a fire this very night cried tom tippet following him to the door  it is quite possible said frank with a smile  miss deemas was heard to snort contemptuously at this  perhaps you may even save more lives cried miss tippet  it may be so answered frank again smiling but evidently feeling anxious to make his escape for he was not one of those men who like to be lionised  only think exclaimed miss tippet as frank quitted the room  ha ejaculated the eagle in a tone which was meant to convey her wellknown opinion that women would do such things quite as well as men if their muscles were a little stronger  it is but justice to miss deemas to explain that she did not champion and exalt women out of love to her sex  love was not one of her strong points  rampant indignation against those whom she bitterly termed lords of creation was her strong tower of refuge in which she habitually dwelt and from the giddy summit of which she hurled wouldbe destruction on the doomed males below  among her various missiles she counted the wrongs of her sex the most telling shaft and was in consequence always busy sharpening and polishing and flourishing this dread weapon in the eyes of her friends as well as her enemies although of course she only launched it at the latter  perched on her selfexalted eyrie miss deemas did not know that there was a pretty large number of her own sex in the comparatively humble multitude below who while they clearly recognised the wrongs of women and preferred to call them misfortunes did not attribute them solely or even largely to the wickedness of men but to the combined wickedness and folly of society in general and who were of opinion that such matters were to be put right by patient persevering laborious and persistent efforts on the part of men and women acting in concert and not by the unwomanly acts and declamation of ladies of the deemas stamp whom they counted the worst enemies of the good causesome wittingly others unwittingly so  these people among the comparatively humble multitude below also had the penetration to perceive that the socalled wrongs did not lie all on one side but that there was a pretty large class of the socalled lords who went about the world habitually in a sad and disgraceful state of moral seminakedness in consequence of their trousers having been appropriated and put on by their betterhalves and that therefore it was only meet that men and women should be united as indeed they were from the first intended to be in their efforts to put each others wrongs to rights  in addition to all this these weakminded shall we call them people moving in the comparatively humble multitude below entertained the belief that rising in antagonism to the male sex in this matter was not only unnecessary and unjust and impolitic but also ungenerous for they reflected with much calm satisfaction that the lords are after all under womans control  but miss deemas and all the ladies of the eagle stamp did not think so they did not believe that a strong mind means a mind strong enough to exercise its own powers to the ascertainment and reception of truth and the rejection of falsehood and fallacy strong enough under the influence of gods love to perceive the paths of duty in all their ramifications and to resolve to follow them  they did not believe that a high spirit in the true sense of the word meant a spirit broken down altogether and brought into subjection to its owners not anothers will  by no means  a strong mind with the deemaseagles meant unutterable and unalterable obstinacy blind as a bat with the great guns blazing all round and the colours nailed to the mast  high spirit with them meant the inclinationever present always strong and often assertedto seize all the rest of the world male and female and lead it by the nose  the deemaseagles as a class receive readymade opinions fabricated by someone else and call them their ownreceiving them originally and holding them subsequently not because they are true but because they are pleasant to their eyes and sweet to their taste  they hold them stoutly too probably because having no foundation they would be apt to fall and get broken if not upheld  having said thus much in behalf of the deemas eagles we now dismiss them with an apology to the reader    chapter twenty two  a firemans life  the clocks were striking nine when frank issued from miss tippets dwelling and walked briskly away  on turning a corner he came upon one of the numerous fireescapes that nightly rear their tall heads against the houses all over london in a somewhat rampant way as though they knew of the fires that were about to take place and like mettlesome warhorses were anxious to rush into action without delay  on the pavement close by the escape stood a small sentrybox and the moment frank came in sight of it he remembered that it was the nocturnal habitation of his friend conductor samuel forest  sam himself was leaning his arms on the lower half of his divided door and gazing contemplatively along the street  well sam what news inquired frank as he came up  that you willders said sam a quiet smile of recognition playing on his goodhumoured features  i thought it must be the giant theyre exhibitin in saint jamess hall just now takin a stroll at night to escape the boys  why when do you mean to stop growing  i dont mean to interfere with nature at all replied frank and i believe the world will be big enough to hold me whatever size i grow to  well whats the news inquired sam emerging from his narrow residence and proving in the act that though not quite so tall as his friend he was one who required a pretty fair share of room in the world for himself  nothing particular said frank leaning against the escape only a chimney and a cutaway affair last night and a false alarm and a firstfloor burnt out the day before  hows thompson asked forest  poorly i fear said frank with a shake of his head  the sprained ankle he got when he fell off the foldingboard is getting well but the injury to his spine from the engine is more serious  ah poor fellow said forest hes just a little too reckless  how came he by the sprain  it was in the basement of a bookbinders in littleton street said frank lighting a cigar  we got the call about 11 pm and on getting there found three engines at work  mr braidwood ordered our fellows to go down into the basement  it was very dark and so thick of smoke that i couldnt see halfaninch before my nose  we broke through the windows and found ourselves ankledeep in water  the engines had been at work flooding the place for some time and there was more water than we expected but we had got on the foldingboards without knowing it an before we knew where we were down went thompson into water four feet deep  i think myself some of the waterpipes had burst  he rose gasping and i caught him by the collar and hauled him out  it was in trying to recover himself when he fell that he got the sprain  youve heard how he came by the other mishap  yes it was gallopin down ludgate hill wasnt it  ay the engine went over a barrow and the jolt threw him off and before he got up it was on him  by good fortune it did not go over him it only bruised his back but its worse than we thought it would be i fear  ah one never knows said forest gravely  theres one man jackson now only two weeks ago he was up in a third floor in lambeth and had brought down two women and a child and was in the backrooms groping for more when the floor above gave way and came down on him  we all thought he was done for but some of the beams had got jammed and not five minutes after he steps out of a window all rightonly a scratch or two not worth mentioning yet that same man fell down a flight of stairs at the same fire with a boy on his shoulder and sprained his ankle so bad that hes bin laid up for three weeks but he saved the boy  ah it was worth the sprain said frank  it was responded forest  well goodnight said frank resuming his walk  samuel forest responded goodnight and then getting into his box sat down on its little seat which was warranted not to hold two trimmed the lamp that hung at his side and pulling out a book from a corner began to peruse it  sam was of a literary turn of mind  he read a great deal during his lonely watches and used often to say that some of his happiest hours were those spent in the dead of night in his sentrybox  his helmet hung on a peg beside him  his hatchet was in his girdle and a small cap covered his head  looking at him in his snug and brightly illuminated little apartment he appearedby contrast with the surrounding darknessinexpressibly comfortable  nevertheless sam forest could have told you that appearances are often deceptive and that no matter how it looked his box was but a cold habitation on a biting december night  while deeply immersed in his book sam heard the sound of approaching footsteps and pricked up his ears  he was a good judge of such sounds as they drew near he quietly took off his cap put on his helmet and stepped from his box  the street was very silent and perhaps not one of the hundreds of sleepers there thought of the solitary man who held vigil and was so alert to do them service if the hour of their extremity should come  but a cry arose that startled themfire fire  another moment and two men dashed round the corner yelling at the top of their voices  gasping for breath they named the locality  almost before they had done so two policemen were on the spot and in another moment the fireescape was in motion  instructed by the conductor the two strangers and the policemen lent their willing aid  before ten minutes had passed the tall machine was run up to a burning house the lower part of which was blazing while from the upper windows frantic cries were heard for help and sundry figures in dishabille were seen waving their arms  the escape was run up and one after another the inmates were rescued from their perilous position  while this scene was enacting frank was pursuing his way to the regent street fire station but news of the fire got there before him  he arrived just in time to don his helmet and take his place on the engine away they went and in ten minutes after the arrival of the fireescape they dashed up almost running into an engine which appeared from an opposite direction  the fire was blazing brightly by this time and the whole neighbourhood was in a state of commotion and excitement  the two engines were got to work with as little delay as possible  a body of police kept the gathering crowd back and soon volumes of steam began to mingle with the black smoke of the burning building  the superintendent was early on the scene and he directed frank and another fireman to try to persuade the people in the adjoining houses to remain quiet and not throw their furniture over the window but this some of them would not consent to do  it was plain that one or two were mad with fear and excitement and as the ruling passion is strong in death so it would seem to be by no means weak in the midst of danger from fire for many of them bent their whole energies to the saving of their goods and chattelsregardless of their lives  one stout old gentleman in particular was seen at a thirdfloor window heaving out chairs and stools and books and small tables and clocks and even quantities of crockery with desperate energy to the great danger of the onlookers at whose feet the various articles fell and were dashed to atoms  frank darted up the stairs that led to this mans apartments and burst in upon him  oh come along fireman help me to save my things he exclaimed as he struggled with superhuman efforts to thrust a table through the window which was too small to permit its passage  stop sir are you mad cried frank sternly  help me help me  oh fireman it will be all burned  fire fire fire  his voice rose into a fierce yell as he strove in vain with the table  youre quite safe cried frank holding him your house aint alight and the engines have got it almost under  but frank spoke to deaf ears so he coolly lifted the man in his arms carried him kicking downstairs and placed him in charge of a policeman  just then a cry was raised that there were two kegs of gunpowder in one of the shops on the ground floor  the owner of the shop came up in a frantic state and corroborated this statement  itll blow the house to bits sir he said to mr braidwood  of course it will remarked the latter in a quiet voice  come here my man he added taking the shopkeeper apart from the crowd and questioning him closely  immediately after he ordered the engines to play on a particular part of the building  just then frank came up to the superintendent  theres gunpowder in the backshop somewhere im told sir shall i go in for it  no willders you couldnt find it in the smoke  take the branch lad and get up into that window above the door  frank sprang to obey  at the same time mr braidwood suddenly seized a horsecloth and dashed in through the smoke  in a few seconds he returned with one of the kegs of powder in his arms  giving it to one of his men he darted in again and speedily reissued with the second keg of powder amid the frantic cheering of the crowd  having done this he continued to superintend the men until the fire was got under which was soon accomplished having been attacked promptly and with great vigour soon after it broke out  you neednt wait mr dale said braidwood going up to his foreman its all safe now  ill keep one engine but you and your lads get off to your beds as fast as ye can  dale obeyed and a few minutes after the engine was galloping homewards  willie willders was in the station when it arrived and so was fred auberly who having accompanied willie had got into such an interesting talk with the subengineer in charge that he forgot time and was still in animated conversation when the wheels were heard in the distance  the three were out at the door in an instant  on came the engine the horses feet and the wheels crashing harshly in the silent night  they came round the corner with a sharp swing either the driver had become careless or he was very sleepy that night for he dashed against an iron post that stood at the corner and carried off two wheels  the engine went full thirty yards on the two offwheels before it came to the ground which it did at last with a terrific crash throwing the firemen violently to the ground  the subengineer and fred and willie sprang forward in great alarm but the most of the men leaped up at once and one or two of them laughed as if to show that they had got no damage  but one of them lay extended on the pavement  it needed not a second glance to tell that it was frank willders  lift him gently lads said dale who was himself severely bruised  stop exclaimed frank in a low voice ive got no harm except to my left leg  its broken i think  theres no use of lifting me till you get a cab  ill go straight home if he fainted as he spoke  run for a cab willie said fred auberly  willie was off in a moment  at the same instant a messenger was despatched for dr offley and in a short time after that frank willders was lying on his mothers sofa with his left leg broken below the knee    chapter twenty three  mr james auberly  with a very stiff cravat and a dreadfully stiff back and a painfully stiff aspect mr james auberly sat by the side of a couch and nursed his sick child  stiff and starched and stern though he was mr auberly had a soft point in his nature and this point had been reached at last for through all the stiffness and starch there shone on his countenance an expression of deep anxiety as he gazed at loos emaciated form  mr auberly performed the duties of a nurse awkwardly enough not being accustomed to such work but he did them with care and with an evident effort to please which made a deep impression on the childs heart  dear papa she said after he had given her a drink and arranged her coverings  i want you to do me a favour  she said this timidly for she knew from past experience that her father was not fond of granting favours but since her illness he had been so kind to her that she felt emboldened to make her request  i will do it dear said the stiff man bending morally as well as physically as he had never bent beforefor the prospect of loos death had been presented to him by the physicians  i will do it dear if i can and if the request be reasonable  oh then do forgive fred and let him be an artist cried loo eagerly stretching out one of her thin hands  hush darling said mr auberly with a look of distress you must not excite yourself so  i have forgiven fred long ago and he has become an artist in spite of my objections  yes but let him come home i mean and be happy with us again as he used to be and go to the office with you said loo  mr auberly replied somewhat coldly to this that fred was welcome to return home if he chose but that his place in the office had been filled up  besides it was impossible for him to be both a painter and a man of business he said and added that loo had better not talk about such things because she did not understand them  all he could say was that he was willing to receive fred if fred was willing to return  he did not say however that he was willing to restore fred to his former position in regard to his fortune and as loo knew nothing about her brother having been disinherited she felt that she must be satisfied with this cold concession  can you not ask some other favour such as i could grant said mr auberly with a smile which was not nearly so grim as it used to be before the fire  the family always talked of the burning of mr auberlys house as the fire to the utter repudiation of all other firesthe great one of monumental fame included  loo meditated some time before replying  oh yes she exclaimed suddenly i have another favour to ask  how stupid of me to forget it  i want you very much to go and see a fairy that lives  a fairy loo said mr auberly while a shade of anxiety crossed his face  youyou are rather weak just now i must make you be quiet and try to sleep if you talk nonsense dear  its not nonsense said loo again stretching out the thin hand which her father grasped replaced under the coverings and held there its quite true papa she continued energetically it is a fairy i want you to go and seeshes a pantomime fairy and lives somewhere near london bridge and shes been very ill and is so poor that they say shes dying for want of good food  who told you about her loo  willie willders she replied he has been to see her and her father the clown a good many times  mr auberly frowned for the name of willie willders did not sound pleasantly in his ears  do go to see her pray dear papa pleaded loo with much earnestness and give her some money  you know that darling mamma said just before she was taken away the poor child persistently refused to use the expression when she died she wanted you to take me sometimes to see poor people when they were sick and ive often thought of that sinceespecially when i have come to the verse in my bible which tells me to consider the poor and i have oftenoh so very oftenlonged to go but you were always so busy dear papa that you never had time you know the stiff man winced a little at this but you seem to have more time now papa and although im too weak to go with you i thought i would ask you to go to see this poor fairy and tell her i will go to see her some dayifif god makes me strong again  the stiff man winced still more at this but it was only a momentary wince such as a man gives when he gets a sudden and severe twinge of toothache  it instantly passed away  still as in the case of toothache it left behind an uneasy impression that there might be something very sharp and difficult to bear looming in the not distant future  mr auberly had covered his face with his hand and leant his elbow on the head of the couch  looking up quickly with a smilestill tinged with grimness for evil habits and their results are not to be got rid of in a dayhe said  well loo i will go to see this fairy if it will please you but somewhere near london bridge is not a very definite address  oh but willie willders knows it said loo  but where is willie willders objected her father  perhaps at home perhaps at mr tippets place  well we shall soon find out said mr auberly rising and ringing the bell  hopkins answered the summons  stiff thin tall sedate powdered superfine hopkins how different from the personage we saw but lately plunging like a maniac at the firebell  could it have been thee hopkins  is it possible that anything so spruce dignified almost stately could have fallen so very low  we fear it is too true for human nature not unfrequently furnishes instances of tremendous contrast just as material nature sometimes furnishes the spectacle of the serene summer sky being engulfed in the black thunderstorm  hopkins said mr auberly handing him a slip of paper go to this address and ask for the boy william willders if he is there bring him here immediately if not find out where he is search for him and bring him here without delay  take a cab  hopkins folded the paper delicately with both his little fingers projecting very much as though they wished it to be distinctly understood that they had no connection whatever with the others and would not on any account assist the lowborn and hardworking forefingers and thumbs in such menial employment  hopkinss nose appeared to be affected with something of the same spirit  then hopkins bowedthat is to say he broke across suddenly at the middle causing his stiff upper man to form an obtuse angle with his rigid legs for one moment recovered his perpendicularand retired  oh  hopkins how difficult to believe that thy back was once as round as a hoop and thy legs bent at acute angles whilst thou didst lay violent hands onwell well let bygones be bygones and let us all in kindness to thee learn the song which says    teach o teach me to forget  hailing a cab with the air of six emperors rolled into one hopkins drove to mr tippets residence where he learned that willie had gone home so he followed him up and soon found himself at notting hill before the door of mrs willders humble abode  the door was opened by willie himself who stared in some surprise at the stately visitor  is william willders at ome said hopkins  i rather think he is replied willie with a grin who shall i say calls on himeh  youd better send up your card  hopkins frowned but being a goodnatured man he immediately smiled and said he would walk in  i think said willie interposing his small person in the way that youd as well stop where you are for theres a invalid in the drawingroom and all the other rooms is engaged cept the kitchen which of course i could not show you into  couldnt you deliver your message  i could manage to carry it if it aint too heavy  in a state of uncertainty as to how far this was consistent with his dignity hopkins hesitated for a moment but at length delivered his message with which willie returned to the parlour  here on the little sofa lay the tall form of frank willders arrayed in an old dressinggown and with one of his legs bandaged up and motionless  his face was pale and he was suffering great pain but a freeandeasy smile was on his lips for beside him sat a lady and a young girl the latter of whom was afflicted with strong sympathy but appeared afraid to show it  mrs willders with a stocking and knittingwires in her hands sat on a chair at the head of the bed looking anxious but hopeful and mild  an open bible which lay on a small table at her side showed how she had been engaged before the visitors entered  my good sir said the lady with much earnestness of voice and manner i assure you it grieves me to the heart to see you lying in this state and im quite sure it grieves emma too and all your friends  when i think of the risks you run and the way you dash up these dreadful fire firethingswhatdyecallums  what do you call them  fireescapes maam answered frank with a smile  ah fireescapes how you ever come down them alive is a mystery to me im sure  but as i was saying it makes one shudder to think of and andhow does your leg feel now said miss tippet forgetting what she had intended to say  pretty well replied frank the doctor tells me it has broken without splintering and that ill be all right in a few weeks and fit for duty again  fit for duty young man exclaimed miss tippet do you mean to say that you will return to your dreadful profession when you recover  have you not received warning enough  why madam said frank some one must look after the fires you know else london would be in ashes in a few months and i like the work  like the work cried miss tippet in amazement like to be almost smoked to death and burned alive and tumbled off roofs and get upset off whatsitsnames and fall down firefirethings and break all your legs and arms  wellno i dont like all that said frank laughing but i like the vigour and energy that are called forth in the work and i like the object of the work which is to save life and property  why exclaimed frank enthusiastically it has all the danger and excitement of a soldiers life without the bloody work and with better ends in view  nay nay frank said the peaceful mrs willders you must not say better ends because it is a great and glorious thing to defend ones native land  a very just observation said miss tippet nodding approval  why mother who would have expected to hear you standing up for the redcoats in this fashion said frank  i stand up for the bluejackets too observed mrs willders meekly they fight for their country as well  true mother rejoined frank but i did not refer to ultimate ends i only thought of the immediate results in connection with those engaged the warrior fights and in so doing destroys life and property  the fireman fights and in doing so protects and preserves both  hear hear interrupted willie but the copybook says comparisons are odiows dont it  mother heres a fathom and two inches or so of humanity as wants me to go with him to mr auberly  i spose frank can get along without me for a little whileeh  certainly my son why does he want you  dont know  praps hes goin to offer to make me his secretary  but you dont seem at all alarmed at the prospect of my being carried off by a flunkey  youll come back dearie i doubt not  dont you  oh very well then ill just look after myself  if i dont return ill advertise myself in the times  goodbye  willie returned to the door and announced that he was ready to go  but where is william asked hopkins  mister william willders stands before you said the boy placing his hand on his heart and making a bow  come now longlegs he added seizing hopkins by the arm and pushing him downstairs and into the cab leaping in after him he shut the door with a bang  now then cabby all right beverly square full split sixpence extra if you do it within the half  away they went and in a few seconds were in the mall driving at a rattling pace  see that house asked willie so suddenly as to startle hopkins who was quite overwhelmed by the vigour and energy of his young companion  eh which the one with the porch before the door  no no stoopid the old redbrick house with the limbs of a vine all over the front of it and the skeleton of a virginia creeper on the wall  yes i see it said hopkins looking out  ah a friend o mine lives there  im on wisitin terms there i am now then mind your eye pumphandle cried willie the turns rather sharphallo  as they swung round into the bayswater road the cab came in contact with a butchers cart which being the lighter vehicle was nearly upset no serious damage resulted however and soon after they drew up at the door of the house next mr auberlys for that gentleman still occupied the residence of his friend  master willders said hopkins ushering him into the presence of mr auberly who still sat at the head of the couch  willie nodded to loo and then to her father  boy said the latter beckoning willie to approach my daughter wishes me to go and visit a poor family near london bridge  she tells me you know their name and address  the fairy you know said loo explaining  ah the cattleys answered willie  yes resumed mr auberly  will you conduct me to their abode  in some surprise willie said that he would be happy to do so and then asked loo how she did  while mr auberly was getting ready willie was permitted to converse with loo and mrs rose who was summoned to attend her young mistress presently mr auberly returned bade mrs rose be very careful of the invalid and then set off with willie  at first the boy felt somewhat awed by the remarkably upright figure that stalked in silence at his side but as they continued to thread their way through the streets he ventured to attempt a little conversation  weathers improvin sir said willie looking up  it is replied mr auberly looking down in surprise at the boldness of his small guide  good for the country sir observed willie  mr auberly being utterly ignorant of rural matters thought it best to say nothing to this  we may add that willie knew just as little or as much and had only ventured the remark because he had often heard it made in every possible variety of weather and thought that it would be a safe observation replete for all he knew to the contrary with hidden wisdom  there was silence after this for some time  dyou know mr tippet well sir inquired willie suddenly  yeyes oh yes i know him pretty well  ah hes a firstrater observed willie with a look of enthusiasm youve no notion what a trump he is  did you hear ever of his noo machine for makin artificial butter  no said mr auberly somewhat impatiently  ah its a wonderful invention that is sir  boy said mr auberly will you be so good as to walk behind me  oh cernly sir said willie with a profound bow as he fell to the rear  they walked on in silence until they came to the vicinity of the monument when mr auberly turned round and asked willie which way they were to go now  right back again said willie  how boy what do you mean  weve overshot the mark about half a mile sir  but please i thought you must be wishin to go somewhere else first as you led the way  lead the way now boy said mr auberly with a stern look  willie obeyed and in a few minutes they were groping in the dark regions underground which mr cattley and his family inhabited  with some difficulty they found the door and stood in the presence of the fairy  thin though the fairy had been when willie saw her last she might have been called fat compared with the condition in which they now found her she appeared like a mere shadow with a delicate skin thrown over it a bad transparency would have been more substantial in appearance  she lay alone on her lonely pallet with a farthing candle beside her which cast a light sufficient only to make darkness visible  being near the poor invalid it caused her large dark eyes to glitter in an awful manner  willie at once forgot his companion and running up to the fairy seized her hand and asked her how she did  pretty well willie  its kind of you to come and see me so often  not a bit ziza you know i like it besides ive only come today to show a gentleman the way  he pointed to mr auberly who had stopped short in the doorway but who now advanced and sat down beside the invalid and put to her several formal questions in a very stately and stiff manner with a great assumption of patronage  but it was evident that he was not accustomed to the duty of visiting the sick and like little boys and girls when they sit down to write a letter was very much at a loss what to say he began by asking the fairy about her complaint and exhausted every point that entered into his imagination in reference to that  then he questioned her as to her circumstances after which he told her that he had been sent to see her by his daughter louisa who was herself very ill owing to the effects of a fire in his own house  at this point the child became interested and came to his relief by asking a great many eager and earnest questions about loo  she knew about the fire in beverly square and its incidents willie having often related them to her during his visits and she knew mr auberly by name and was interested in him but his frigid manner had repelled her until he spoke of loo having sent him to see her  oh ive been so sorry about miss loo sir said ziza raising her large eyes full in mr auberlys face ive heard of her you know from willie and when ive been lying all alone here for hours and hours together i have wondered how she spent her time and if there were kind people about her to keep up her spirits  its so strange that she and i should have been both hurt by a fire an both of us so different every way  i do hope shell get better sir  mr auberly became suddenly much interested in the fairy for just as love begets love so does interest beget interest  his feelings having been roused his tongue was loosed and forthwith he enjoyed a delightful conversation with the intelligent child not that there was any remarkable change as to the matter of what was spoken but there was a vast change in the manner of speaking it  willie also chimed in now and then and volunteered his opinions in a way that would have called forth a sharp rebuke from his patron half an hour before but he was permitted to speak even encouraged now for mr auberly was being tickled pleasantly he was having his feelings and affections roused in a way that he had never thought of or tried before he was gathering golden experiences that he had never stooped to touch before although the mine had been under his feet all his life and his path had been strewn with neglected nuggets from the cradlefortunately not as yet to the grave  zizas bible lay on the counterpane close to her wasted little hand  while she was talking of loo with deep sympathy beaming out of her eyes and trembling in her tones mr auberly laid his hand inadvertently on it  she observed the action and said  are you going to read and pray with me sir  mr auberly was taken very much aback indeed by this question  wellno said he that isiffact i have not brought my prayerbook with me butbuti will read to you if you wish it  sympathy was gone now the fairy felt that and not clearly understanding why wondered at it  she thanked her visitor however and shut her eyes while mr auberly opened the bible and cleared his voice  his confusion was only momentary still the idea that he could be confused at all by two mere children in such a wretched cellar so nettled the worthy man that he not only recovered his selfpossession but read a chapter with all the solemn dignity of tone and manner that he would have assumed had he been officiating in saint pauls or westminster abbey  this was such a successful essay and overawed his little congregation so terribly that for a moment he thought of concluding with the benediction but being uncertain whether he could go correctly through it he wisely refrained  thereafter he rose and bade the fairy goodnight  your father does not return till late i suppose he said while he held her hand  no it is morning generally before he gets away  the pantomimes are hurting him i fear for hes not so active as he once was and he says he feels the falls very bad  poor man  its very sad but i suppose its the usual way with that class of men  well goodnight again  goodnight sir responded the fairy with a bright smile and thank you very much for your visit  goodnight willie  willie said goodnight in such a sulky tone and followed mr auberly to the door with such a reckless swagger that the fairy gazed after him in unutterable surprise  after shutting the door with a bang he suddenly opened it again and said in a loud voice  i say ill get my wages day arter tomorrow  ill bring you a couple o bobs then  its all i can afford just now for cigars are dear  if youre hard up for wittles in the meantime just grin and bear it youll not die you know youll only get thinner  i have heard that a bit o boiled shoeleather aint a bad thing to keep one easy till relief comes  dear me exclaimed mr auberly in the distance and bustling back as lie spoke i quite forgot how stupid of me  i was directed by my daughter to give you this  he took a tenpound note from his purse and put it into the fairys hand  this is from louisa he continued and i may add that it is the savings from her pocketmoney  i did not wish the dear child to part with it and said i would give it to you from myself but she was so urgent and seemed so distressed when i refused my consent that i gave in so you have to thank my daughter not me  mr auberly smiled and nodded as he turned to go and there was really very little grimness in the smile on this occasionvery little indeed willie also nodded with great violence and frequency he likewise winked with one eye and otherwise sought to indicate that there were within him sundry deep and not easily expressed thoughts and feelings which were upon the whole of a satisfactory nature  as for the fairy she never once smiled or thanked mr auberly but simply stared at him with her lustrous eyes open to their very widest and she continued to stare at the door as though she saw him through it for some time after they were gone  then she turned suddenly to the wall thanked god and burst into tearsglad tears such as only those can weep who have unexpectedly found relief when their extremity was greatest    chapter twenty four  a change in fortune  there is nothing more surprising in regard to sublunary matters than the way in which unexpected events arise out of what may be called unintentional causes  when david boone and his friend gorman planned the insurance and destruction of the toy shop and its contents they no more expected that the very first steps towards that end would result in the conversion of a poor into a flourishing business than they expected that the expression of a wish would convert poorthing lane into beverly square yet so it was  poor david was rendered so desperate by his straits and so anxious to escape from the crime into which his friend sought to plunge him that he meditated suicide but lacking the courage to accomplish this he relieved his feelings by carrying out the details of his business and the preliminary steps of his plan with the wild and reckless energy of a maniac  the more he thought of the meshes which gorman had cast around him the more did he regard escape impossible  he therefore sought relief in action  he not only talked to his neighbours as per agreement about his rapidly increasing business but he made purchases on a scale more extensive than he had ever before contemplated even in his dreams  being convinced that ruin sooner or later was his doom he indulged in the most extravagant excesses with much of the feeling which prompts some seamen when the ship is sinking to break into the spirit room and spend the short remnant of life in jollity  he experienced a sort of savage delight in ordering right and left from wholesale dealers in town and country and even went so far as to write to germany for toys using the name of a wellknown london house which had hitherto and justly believed him to be an honest man  the result of this was that poorthing lane was besieged for some time by railway vans and waggons so huge that apparently an inch more added to their bulk would have rendered their passage impossible  great deal boxes were constantly being unpacked in front of mr boones door much to the annoyance of miss tippet who could not imagine how it happened that her sedate and slowgoing landlord had got such a sudden increase of business  little did she think poor lady that this was the fuel with which it was intended to roast her alive  some of the smaller accounts for goods thus purchased boone paid at once with the money furnished to him by gorman and thus got credit for being a capitalist  others he deferred payment of until a more convenient season  his friend gorman who would not have bent the joint of his little finger to have saved him from destruction was so anxious to get up a good appearance for the sake of getting the insurance effected advantageously that he did his best to carry out his part of the plan and being a man of energy who in the paths of virtue might have risen to a high position among men he succeeded beyond his expectation crowds of purchasers were sent by him to the shop of the celebrated toyman  some were mere decoyducks who came and went for a consideration pretty frequently and only priced the goods  others were genuine purchasers and between the two they created so much traffic in the toyshop that the multitudeso difficult to move by mere suasion but so prone to follow blindly in the wake of a senseless rush when once the rush takes placebegan to move in the direction of the toyshop and shortly before christmas the demand for toys was so great that boone had to engage two assistants to carry on the business and even the lane itself began to feel the benefit of the sudden increase of traffic  all this was patent to the eyes of david boone but he was so overwhelmed with a sense of the guilt he was about to incur and the deception he was even then practising that he regarded the whole affair as a hollow bubble which would soon burst and leave nothing behind even the rapid increase of the creditbalance in his bankbook did not affect his opinion for he was not much of a financier and knowing that his transactions were founded on deception he looked on the balance as being deceptive also  not so thought gorman  that wily individual perceived to his amazement that things were taking a turn which had never been contemplated so he silently looked on and wondered and chuckled and resolved to abide his time  as prosperity flowed in upon him david boone became more insanefor his condition of mind was little if at all short of temporary insanityand his proceedings became more eccentric than ever  among other things he became suddenly smitten with a desire to advertise and immediately in the columns of the tapers appeared advertisements to the effect that the celebrated toy emporium was to be found in poorthing lane  finding that this increased his business considerably he hit upon a plan of advertising which has been practised rather extensively of late years in london  he sent out an army of boys with pots of whitewash and brushes with directions to print in rough but large legible letters the words whos boone on all the blank walls of the metropolis and in the papers he answered the question by having printed under the same title why the manager of the toy emporium to be sure in poorthing lane  he also advertised specially that he had in stock an assortment of 500 goldenhaired dolls from germany fulldressed halfdressed and naked  this last was irresistible  thousands of young hearts beat high at the mere thought of such numberswith golden hair too and dozens of mammas and papas too visited poorthing lane in consequence  in course of time david boones eyes began to open to the fact that he was rapidly making a fortune  it was after the bustle of the christmas season was over that he made this discovery  one of his new assistants a young man named lyall was the means of opening his employers eyes to the truth  lyall was a clever accountant and had been much surprised from the first that boone kept no regular system of books  at the end of the year he suggested that it would be well to take stock and find out the state of the business  boone agreed  lyall went to work and in a short time the result of his labours showed that after all debts were paid there would remain a satisfactory creditbalance at the bank  on the evening of the day on which this marvellous fact was impressed on boones mind gorman called and found his friend rubbing his hands and smiling benignantly in the back room  you seem jolly said gorman sitting down as usual by the fire and pulling out as usual the short pipe  business gittin on well  it is said boone standing with his back to the fire and swaying himself gently to and fro things dont look so bad  i can pay you the arrears of rent now  oh can you said gorman  ah  yes and im in a position to pay you fifty pounds of the debt i owe you besides said boone  and a bill at three months for the balance inquired gorman  no he could not venture to do that exactly but he hoped to pay a further instalment before the end of three months  humph  how much may the profits be  boone could not say precisely not having had all his accounts squared but he believed they were considerable  ill be bound they are said gorman with a growl you wont want to set things alight now i daresay  well i think itll be as well to wait a bit and let us make hay while this sunshine goes on  let you make hay you mean  oh as to that the most of it will go to your stack for some time to come gorman  hm and what about the insurance  well you know observed boone its of no use paying the premium for nothing  as we dont mean to set the place alight you know  ay but the life insurance i mean said gorman  boone laughed and observed that he thought it best not to die just at that particular time whereupon gorman laughed too and said he was about right and that it would be as well to delay both events in the meantime after saying which he took his leave in better humour than usual for gorman was what men of his own stamp termed a deep file he saw into futurityso he thoughta considerable way farther than most men and in the future of his own imagination he saw such a pleasant picture that his amiable spirit was quite cheered by it  he saw david boone making money so fast that his goods might be insured at a much larger amount he saw him getting into fresh difficulties of course because such a business on such a foundation could not go on prosperously except under the most able management and even though it did prosper in spite of improbabilities he foresaw that there was an amiable gentleman much like himself who would induce boone to traffic beyond his means and when money was wanted the same kind gentleman he saw that quite clearly would come forward generously with a loan for which he would only ask boone to make over to him in security his two policies of insurancefire and life after whichwell we need not go on revealing the future as it appeared to gormans mental vision suffice it to say that he saw upon the whole a prospect which gave him great satisfaction  there were one or two things which he did not see however and which might have modified his feelings considerably if he had seen them  of these we shall say nothing at present  as for david boone his heart rejoiced for he too had visions of the future which charmed him  he saw his debt to gorman paid and himself set free from the power of that amiable friend  he saw a toyshop change its locality and its aspect  he saw it transplanted into regent street with plateglass windows in which were displayed objects of marvellous ingenuity and transcendent beauty  one window especially exhibiting not a crowd but a very nation of waxdolls with blue eyes and golden hair  he saw moreover a very little old woman lying in a bed in an elegant and comfortable apartment with a bible beside her and a contented smile on her face  this old lady resembled his own mother so strongly that all other prospects of the future faded from his view and in the fulness of his heart and his success he resolved then and there to go home and present her with a gift on the strength of the prosperity at that time attained to  david was sorely perplexed as to what this gift ought to be  he thought of a new silk gown at first but the remembrance of the fact that his mother was bedridden banished this idea  owing to the same fact new boots and gloves were inadmissible but caps were nothappy thought he started off at once and returned home with a cap so gay voluminous and imposing that the old lady unused though she was to mirth laughed with amusement while she cried with joy at this not the first evidence of her sons affection    chapter twenty five  changes and mysteries  seven years passed away  during that period london revolved in its usual course reproducing its annual number of eventsits births deaths and marriages its plans plots and pleasures its business bustle and bungle its successes sentiments and sensations its facts fancies and failuresalso its fires which last had increased steadily until they reached the imposing number of about twelve hundred in the year  but although that time elapsed and many changes took place for better or for worse in all circles of society there had not been much change in the relative positions of the actors in our tale at least not much that was apparent  great alterations however had taken place in the physical condition of some of them as the sequel will show  one bright morning in the springtime of the year a youth with the soft down of early manhood on his lips and cheeks paced slowly to and fro near the margin of the pond in kensington gardens  being early the spot was as complete a solitude as the backwoods of north america and so thick was the foliage on the noble trees that no glimpse of the surrounding city could be obtained in any direction everything that greeted eye and ear was characteristic of the woods even to the swans geese ducks and other waterfowl which sported on the clear surface of the pond while the noise of traffic in the mighty metropolis was so subdued by distance as to resemble the deeptoned roar of a great cataract  a stranger rambling there for the first time would have found it difficult to believe that he was surrounded on all sides by london  it was one of those soulstirring mornings in which nature seems to smile  there was just enough of motion in the air to relieve the effect of what is called a dead calm  the ripple on the water caught the suns rays and breaking them up scattered them about in a shower of fragmentary diamonds  fleecywhite clouds floated in the blue sky suggesting dreams of fairyland and scents of sprouting herbage filled the nostrils reminding one of the fastapproaching summer  the youth who sauntered alone by the margin of the pond was broad of shoulder and stout of limb though not unusually tallnot much above the middle height  his gait was easy freealmost recklessas though he cared not a fig for anybody high or low rich or poor yet his eye was bright and his smile kindly as though he cared for everybodyhigh low rich and poor  he sauntered with his hands in the pockets of his short coat and whistled an operatic air in a low melodious tone  he was evidently waiting for someone and judging from his impatient gestures someone who was resolved to keep him waiting  presently a female figure appeared in the far distance on the broad avenue that leads direct from the serpentine  she was young and graceful in form but she walked with a quick step with her eyes looking down like one who regarded neither youth nor grace  curiously enough this downcast look gave to her fair face a modest captivating grace which is never seen to sit upon the lofty brow or to circle round the elevated nose of conscious beauty  the youth at first paid no attention to her she was not the someone for whom he waited but as she drew near he became suddenly interested and threw himself in her way  just as she was about to pass she raised her eyes started blushed and exclaimed  mr willders  good morning miss ward said the youth advancing with a smile and holding out his hand this is indeed an unexpected pleasure i did not know that you were addicted to early walking  i am indeed fond of early walking replied emma with a smile but i cannot say that it is so much pleasure as duty which brings me here  i am a daygoverness and pass this pond every morning on my way to kensington where the family in which i teach resides  indeed said willie with that amount of emphasis which denotes moderate surprise and solicits information  he paused for a single moment but seeing that emma did not intend to speak of her own affairs he added quickly  i am waiting for my brother frank  we arranged to meet here this morning  i hope that miss tippet is well  quite well replied emma with a blush as she took a sudden interest in a large duck which swam up to the edge of the pond at that moment in the hope no doubt of obtaining food from her hand  its hopes were disappointed however for emma only called it a beautiful creature and then turning somewhat abruptly to willie said with a slight look of embarrassment that she feared she should be late and must bid him goodmorning  willie felt a good deal puzzled and had he been the same willie that we introduced at the commencement of our tale he would have told emma his mind candidly and asked her what was the matter but willie was a man now so he smiled lifted his hat politely and wished her goodmorning  five minutes later frank appeared in the distance and hurried forward seven years had added a little to the breadth of his shoulders and the firm selfpossession of his step and look but they had made no other perceptible impression on him  there was indeed a deep scar on his right temple but that was the result of accident not of time  many a hairbreadth escape had he made during these seven years of fighting with the flames and often had his life been in imminent danger but he was fortunate in having escaped hitherto with only a broken leg and a variety of small cuts scalds and bruises  the cut on his temple was the severest and most recent of these  he had got it in a fall through a second floor which gave way under him as he was attempting to rescue an old bedridden man who lay in an inner chamber  frank was carried out in a state of insensibility on the broad shoulders of his friend baxmore while dale rescued the old man  how goes it frank cried willie advancing and giving his brothers hand a warm shake the cut head mendingeh  oh its all right replied frank with a smile as they sauntered up and down by the margin of the pond the headaches have left me now im thankful to say and thedoctor tells me it wont leave much of a mark  you dont need to care much if it does for its an honourable scar and does not spoil your beauty old boy  well willie said frank here i am at your request  what have you got to tell me nothing serious i hope  the stalwart fireman looked earnestly into his brothers face and exhibited more anxiety than there seemed to be any occasion for  no nothing very serious  it may be serious enough for all i know but as far as my knowledge goes its not bad enough to make you look so anxious  why whats the matter with you  nothing willie  perhaps my late accident has shaken my nerves a bit  willie burst into a loud laugh and said that it was so awfully absurd to hear a man like frank talking of nerves at all that he could not help it  well but what is the news youve got to tell me resumed frank youre not going to be married are you  frank asked this with a look and expression so peculiar that willie again laughed and said that really he could not understand him at all for even suppose he had been going to be married that was no reason why he should take it so much to heart as the expression on his face implied he did  perhaps not willie said frank with a quiet smile but that is not what you want to speak about then  no certainly not  frank appeared relieved and willie observing the appearance said  come now i really dont see why you should be so very much pleased to hear that  im young it is true but im old enough and i have a good business with brilliant prospects and there appears to me no reason on earth why i should not marry if i felt so disposed  none in the world willie said frank with some haste but you tell me you are not thinking of that just now so pray lets hear what youve got to say  oh its all very well in you old blazes to change the subject in that way but im nettled at your implied objection to my getting married if i choose  however we wont quarrel over it so here goes for the point  willies bantering manner instantly left him  he walked in silence for a few seconds as if he pondered what he had to say  there are two points which trouble me just now frank and i want your opinion in regard to them  the first is miss tippet  she is a small point no doubt whether we regard her physically or mentally but she is by no means a small point if we regard her socially for the good that that little woman does in a quiet unobtrusive way is almost incredible  dye know frank i have a sort of triumphant feeling in regard to the sour cynical folk of this worldwhom it is so impossible to answer in their fallacious and sophistical argumentswhen i reflect that there is a day coming when the meek and lowly and unknown workers for the sake of our lord shall be singled out from the multitude and their true place and position assigned them  miss tippet will stand higher i believe in the next world than she does in this  well miss tippet has been much out of sorts of late mentally and mr tippet who is the kindest man alive has been very anxious about her and has begged of me to try to counsel and comfort her  now it is not an easy matter to comply with this request because in the first place miss tippet does not want me to counsel or comfort her so far as i know and in the second place my motives for attempting to do so might be misunderstood  how so exclaimed frank quickly  well you know miss ward lives with her said willie with a modest look  there was again something peculiar about franks expression and manner as he said well it would not signify much i daresay if people were to make remarks about you and miss ward for you know it would not be misconstruction after all  what mean you asked willie in surprise  you remember what you once said to me about your bosom being on fire pursued frank  i suppose the fire has not been got under yet has it  willie burst into a loud laugh  why blazes do you not know  but no matter we came here to talk of business after that is done we can diverge to love  willie paused here again for a few seconds and then resumed  you must know frank that the cause of miss tippets disturbance just now is the strange conduct of her landlord david boone who has been going on of late in a way that would justify his friends putting him in an asylum  his business affairs are i fear in a bad way and he not only comes with excessive punctuality for miss tippets rent but he asks her for loans of money in a wild incoherent fashion and favours her with cautions and warnings of a kind that are utterly incomprehensible  only the other night he came to her and asked if she did not intend soon to visit some of her friends and on being informed that she did not he went further and advised her to do so saying that she was looking very ill and he feared she would certainly get into bad health if she did not  in fact he even said that he feared she would die if she did not go to the country for a few weeks  now all this would be laughable as being the eccentricity of a halfcracked fellow if it were not that he exhibits such a desperate anxiety that his advice should be followed and even begged of the poor lady with tears in his eyes to go to visit her friends  what dye think of it frank  i confess myself utterly nonplussed  i dont know what to think said frank after a pause  either the man must be mad or he wishes to rob miss tippets house in her absence  willie admitted that the first supposition might be true but he held stoutly that the second was impossible for boone was too honest for that  they conversed for some time on this point and both came ultimately to the conclusion that the thing was incomprehensible and mysterious and that it ought to be watched and inquired into  willie moreover said he would go and consult his friend barret about it  you know barret frank  no but i have heard of him  ah hes a firstrate fellowin one of the insurance officesi forget which  i came to know him when i first went to mr tippets  he lived then in the floor below us with a drunken companion whom he was anxious to reclaim but he found him so hard to manage that he at last left him and went to live in hampstead  he and i became great friends when he lived under our workshop  he got married two years ago and i have not seen much of him since but hes a sharp fellow and knows a good deal more of the tippets than i was aware of  ill go and see if he can throw any light on this subject  the next point pursued willie is cattley the clown  have you seen or heard of him lately  frank said he had not  well i am greatly troubled about him  he has become a regular drunkard and leads his poor daughter a terrible life  he is so broken down with dissipation that he can scarcely procure employment anywhere his son is fortunately a pretty decent fellow though somewhat wild and helps in a small way to support his father having obtained a situation as clown at one of the minor theatres  the daughter ziza has long ago given up the profession and has been struggling to maintain herself and her father by painting firescreens and making artificial flowers but the work is severe and ill paid and i see quite well that if the poor girl is not relieved in some way she will not be able to bear up  i grieve to hear this willie said frank but how comes it that you take so great an interest in these people  frank said willie assuming a tone of deep seriousness while a glow suffused his cheeks can you keep a secret  i think so lad at least i promise to try  well then said willie i love ziza cattley  i knew her first as a fairy i know her now as a woman who is worthy of a place among the angels for none but those who know her well and have seen her fighting the battle of life can have the least idea of the selfdenial the perseverance under difficulties the sweetness of temper and the deepseated love of that devoted girl  she goes every night after the toil of each day to the door of the theatre where she waits to conduct her father safely past the ginpalaces into which but for her he would infallibly stray and she spends all she has in making him comfortable but i see well enough that this is killing her  she cant stand it long and i wont stand it at all  ive made up my mind to that  now frank i want your advice  to say that frank was hearty in his assurances that he would do what he could to help his brother would be a faint way of stating the truth frank shook willie by the hand and congratulated him on having gained the affections of one whom he knew to be a good girl and then condoled with him on that girls unfortunate circumstances but willie stopped him short at this point by asking him in a tone of surprise what could be the matter with him for at first he had been apparently annoyed at the notion of his willies being in love and now he seemed quite pleased about it  in short his conduct was unaccountable  frank laughed but said eagerly  why  willie did you not tell me long ago that there was a fire in your bosom lit up by a certain young friend of miss tippets  oh interrupted willie emma ward ah yes i confess that i did feel spooney once in that direction when i was a boy but the fairy displaced her long ago  no no frank im not accountable for boyish fancies by the way i have just parted from the fair emma  we had a teteatete here not half an hour before you arrived  here exclaimed frank in surprise  ay here repeated willie she passes this pond every morning she told me on her way to teach a family in kensington by the way i didnt think of asking whether the father mother and servants were included among her pupils  why frank what an absent frame of mind you are in this morning  i declare it is not worth a mans while consulting you about anything  i beg pardon cried frank quickly your words caused my mind to wander a bit  come what do you think of doing  what do you think i should do that is the question  you can offer to assist them suggested frank  ive done so said the other but ziza wont accept of assistance  could we not manage to get her a situation of some sort with light work and good pay  ah a firemans for instance cried willie with a sarcastic laugh did you ever hear of a situation with light work and good pay except under government  i never did but we might perhaps find steady work and good pay  it would only be required for a time because i mean toah well no matterbut how and where is it to be got  good mr tippet is of no use because he is mad  mad willie  ay mad as a march hare  for years back i have suspected it but now i am sure of it in fact i feel that i have gradually come to be his keeperbut more of that anon  meanwhile what is to be done for the cattleys  could nothing be done with mr auberly  willie shook his head  no i fear not  he was in a soft state oncelong agosix or seven years now i thinkwhen the dear fairy was ill and he seemed as if he were going to become a man but his daughter loo had just begun to be ill at that time  shes been so long ill now that he has got used to it and has relapsed again into an oyster  he might be reached through loo yet said frank  perhaps replied willie but i doubt it for hes a blunt old fellow in his feelings however sharp he may be in his business besides loo is so weak now that very few are allowed to see her except ziza and miss tippet and emma ward  the brothers remained silent after this for some time for neither of them could see his way out of their difficulties at last frank suggested that willie should go home and consult his mother  she is wise willie and has never given us bad advice yet  i know what her first advice will be said willie  what asked frank  to go and pray about it answered willie  well she might give worse advice than that said frank with much earnestness  in fact i doubt if she could give better  true assented willie and now old fellow im off  mr tippet likes punctuality  ill look in at the station in passing if anything turns up to clear my mind on these matters meanwhile goodbye  it is a remarkable fact that frank willders took an early walk as frequently as possible in kensington gardens near the pond after this conversation with his brother and it is a still more remarkable fact that he always felt like a guilty man on these occasions as if he were taking some mean advantage of some one yet it was certain that he took advantage of no one for nobody ever met him there by any chance whatever  a fact even more remarkable still was that never after that day did emma ward go to her duties through kensington gardens but always by the bayswater road although the latter was dusty and unpicturesque compared with the former and it is a circumstance worthy of note as savouring a little of mystery that emma acted as if she too were a guilty creature during her morning walks and glanced uneasily from side to side as she went along expecting apparently that a policeman or a detective would pounce upon her suddenly and bear her off to prison  but whether guilty or not guilty it is plain that no policeman or detective had the heart to do it for miss ward went on her mission daily without molestation  it is not easy to say what was the cause of these unaccountable proceedings  we might hazard an opinion but we feel that our duty is accomplished when we have simply recorded them  perhaps love had something to do with themperhaps notwho knows    chapter twenty six  what drink will do  time passed on as time is wont to do and christmas came again  the snow was deep in london streets and thick on the roofs and chimneys  it curled over the eaves of the houses in heavy white folds ready to fall and smother the unwary passengers  it capped the railings everywhere with little white knobs and rounded off the corners of things so that wherever the eye alighted the same impressions were invariably conveyed to it namely whiteness and rotundity  corinthian capitals were rendered if possible more ornate than ever by snow equestrian statues were laden with it so heavily that the horses appeared to stagger beneath their trappings and the riders having white tips to their noses white lumps on their heads and shoulders and white patches on their cheekbones and chins looked ineffably ridiculous and miserably cold  everything in fact was covered and blocked up with snow and londoners felt as if they had muffled drums in their ears  it was morning  the sky was clear the air still and the smoke of chimneys perpendicular  poulterers shops were in their holiday attire toyshops were in the ascendant and all other shops were gayer than usual  so were the people who thronged the streets and beat their hands and stamped their feetfor it was unusually cold  street boys were particularly lively and chaff was flying as thickly as snowflakes had fallen the night before  even the roughswho forsook their dens and with shovels and brooms on their shoulders paraded the streets intent on clearing doorsteps with or without the leave of inhabitantsseemed to be less gruff than usual and some of them even went the length of cutting jokes with the cabmen and the boys  perhaps their spirits were elevated by the proud consciousness of being for once in the way of earning an honest penny  i say ned observed one of these roughs a lively one who was very rough indeed to a companion who was rougher still and gloomy look at that there gal cleanin of her steps with a fireshovel  aint that economy gone mad  hallo young ooman whats the use o trying to do it with a teaspoon when theres ned and me ready to do it with our shovels for next to nothin  the servantgirl declined the assistance thus liberally offered so the two men moved slowly on looking from side to side as they went in expectation of employment while a small boy in a mans hat who walked behind them nodded to the girl and said she was a sensible thrifty gal and that she might be sure there was some feller unknown who would bless the day he was born after hed got her  fifty yards farther on a stout redfaced elderly gentleman was observed to look out at the street door and frown at things in general  have your doorsteps cleaned sir asked the lively rough taking the shovel off his shoulder  the elderly gentleman being angry on private and unknown grounds perhaps bad digestion vouchsafed no reply but looked up at the sky and then over the way  do it cheap sir said the lively rough  no said the elderly gentleman with a sort of snapping look as he turned his gaze up the street and then down it  snows wery deep on the steps sir said the rough  dyou suppose im an ass exclaimed the elderly gentleman in a sudden burst  well sir said the lively rough in the grave tone and manner of one who has had a difficult question in philosophy put to him well sir i dont know about that  his large mouth expanded gradually from ear to ear after this reply the elderly gentlemans face became scarlet and his nose purple and retreating two paces he slammed the door violently in the roughs face  ah it all comes of overfeedin poor feller said the lively man shouldering his shovel and resuming his walk beside his gloomy comrade who neither smiled nor frowned at these pleasantries  a warm old gnlmn remarked the boy in the mans hat as he passed  the lively man nodded and winked  might eat his wittles raw an cook em inside amost continued the boy would advise him to keep out of yde park though for fear hed git too near the powdermagazine  at this point the gloomy roughwho did not appear however to be a genuine rough but a pretty good imitation of one made of material that had once seen better daysstopped and said to his comrade that he was tired of that sort of work and would bid him goodday  without waiting for an answer he walked away and his companion without vouchsafing a reply looked after him with a sneer  a rum cove he remarked to the small boy in the mans hat as he continued his progress  rayther replied the boy  with this interchange of sentiment these casual acquaintances parted to meet probably no more  meanwhile the gloomy rough whom the lively one had called ned walked with rapid steps along several streets as though he had a distinct purpose in view  he turned at last into a narrow quiet street and going up to the door of a shabbygenteel house applied the knocker with considerable vigour  now then go along with you we dont want your services here we clear off our own snow we do  imprence to knock too as if he was a gentleman  this was uttered by a servantgirl who had thrust her head out of a secondfloor window to take an observation of the visitor before going down to open the door  is he at home betsy dear inquired the gloomy man looking up with a leer which proved that he could be the reverse of gloomy when he chose  oh its you is it  i dont think he wants to see you indeed im sure of it said the girl  yes he does dear at all events i want to see him and betsy say its pressing business and not beggin  betsy disappeared and soon after reappearing at the door admitted the man whom she ushered into a small apartment which was redolent of tobacco and in which sat a young man slippered and dressinggowned taking breakfast  how are you doctor said the visitor in a tone that did not accord with his soiled and ragged garments as he laid down his hat and shovel and flung himself into a chair  none the better for seeing you hooper replied the doctor sternly  well well exclaimed ned what a world we live in to be sure  it was hail fellow well met when i was well off now he scowled here my old familiars give me the cold shoulder because im poor  you know that you are unjust said the doctor leaning back in his chair and speaking less sternly though not less firmly you know ned that i have helped you with advice and with money to the utmost extent of my means and you know that it was a long long time before i ceased to call you one of my friends but i do not choose to be annoyed by a man who has deliberately cast himself to the dogs whose companions are the lowest wretches in london and whose appearance is dirty and disgusting as well as disreputable  i cant help it pleaded hooper i can get no work  i dont wonder at that replied the doctor every friend you ever had has got you work of one kind or another during the last few years and you have drunk yourself out of it every time  do you imagine that your friends will continue to care for a man who cares not for himself  ned did not reply but hung his head in moody silence  now continued the doctor my time is a little more valuable than yours state what you have got to say and then be off  stay he added in a softened tone have you breakfasted  no answered ned with a hungry glance at the table  well then as you did not come to beg you may draw in your chair and go to work  ned at once availed himself of this permission and his spirits revived wonderfully as he progressed with the meal during which he stated the cause of his visit  the fact is said he that i want your assistance doctor  i told you already interrupted the other that i have assisted you to the utmost extent of my means  my good fellow not so sharp pray said ned helping himself to another roll the first having vanished like a morning cloud i dont want moneyah that is to say i do want money but i dont want yours  no i came here to ask you to help me to get a body  a body  what do you mean  why what i say surely youve cut up enough of em to know em by name a dead body doctora subject  the doctor smiled  thats a strange request ned  youre not going to turn to my profession as a last resort i hope  no not exactly but a friend of mine wants a bodythats all and offers to pay me a good round sum if i get one for him  is your friend a medical man asked the doctor  nno hes not  in fact he has more to do with spirits than bodies but he wants one of the latterand i said id try to get him oneso if you can help me do so like a good fellow  my friend is particular however he wants a man one above six feet thin and sallow and with long black hair  you dont suppose i keep a stock of assorted subjects on hand do you said the doctor  i fear it wont be easy to get what you want  do you know what your friend intends to do with it  not i and i dont care said ned pouring out another cup of coffee what does a body cost  between two and three pounds replied the doctor  dear me so cheap said ned with a look of surprise then that knocks on the head a little plan i had  i thought of offering myself for sale at guys or one of the hospitals and drinking myself to death with the money leaving my address so that they might know where to find me but its not worth while to do it for so little in fact i dont believe i could accomplish it on three pounds worth of dissipation  dont jest about your besetting sin said the doctor gravely its bad enough without that  bad enough exclaimed ned with a sudden flash of ferocity ay bad enough in all conscience and the worst of it is that it makes me ready to jest about anythingin heaven earth or hell  oh drink accursed drink  he started up and clutched the hair of his head with both hands for a moment but the feeling passed away and he sat down again and resumed breakfast while he said in a graver tone than he had yet used  excuse me doctor im subject to these bursts now and then  well what say you about the body  my friend offers me twenty pounds if i get the right kind  that would be seventeen pounds of profit on the transaction  its worth an effort  it might put me in the way of making one more stand  ned said this sadly for he had made so many stands in time past and failed to retain his position that hope was at dead lowwater of a very neaptide now  i dont like the look of the thing said the doctor  theres too much secrecy about it for me  why dont your friend speak out like a man state what he wants it for and get it in the regular way  it maynt be a secret for all i know said ned hooper as he concluded his repast  i did not take the trouble to ask him because i didnt care  you might help me in this doctor  well ill put you in the way of getting what you want said the doctor after a few moments reflection but you must manage it yourself  ill not act personally in such an affair and let me advise you to make sure that you are not getting into a scrape before you take any steps in the matter  meanwhile i must wish you goodday  call here again tonight at six  the doctor rose as he spoke and accompanied ned to the door  he left a coin of some sort in his palm when he shook hands  thankee said ned  if you had come to beg you should not have got it said the doctor god help him he added as he shut the door it is an awful sight to see an old companion fall so low    chapter twenty seven  an old plot  it is evening now  the snow is still on the ground but it looks ruddy and warm in the streets because of the blaze of light from the shopwindows and it looks colder than it did on the housetops by reason of the moon which sails in the wintry sky  the man in the moon must have been in good spirits that night for his residence seemed almost fuller than the usual full moon and decidedly brighterto many at least of the inhabitants of london  it looked particularly bright to miss tippet as she gazed at it through the windows of her upper rooms and awaited the arrival of a few friends to tea  miss tippets heart was animated with feelings of love to god and man and she had that day in obedience to the divine precept attempted and accomplished a good many little things all of which were either directly or indirectly calculated to make human beings happy  emma ward too thought the moon particularly bright that night in fact she might almost have been regarded as a lunatic so steadily did she gaze at the moon and smile to herself without any apparent motive there was reason for her joy however for she had come to know in some mysterious way that frank willders loved her and she had known for a long time past that she loved frank willders  frank had become a foreman of the fire brigade and had been removed from his former station and comrades to his new charge in the city  but frank had not only risen in his profession he had also risen intellectually  his mother had secured to him a pretty good education to begin with and his own natural taste and studious habits had led him to read extensively  his business required him to sit up and watch when other men slept  he seldom went to bed before four oclock any morning and when he did take his rest he lay down like the soldier in an enemys country ready to rush to arms at the first sound of the bugle  his bugle by the way was a speakingtrumpet one end of which was close to the head of his bed the other end being in the lobby where the men on duty for the night reposed  during these long watches in the silent lobby with the two men belted and booted on their tressels the clock ticking gently by his side like the soft quiet voice of a chatty but not tiresome friend frank read book after book with absorbing interest  history poetry travel romanceall kinds were equally devoured  at the particular time of which we write however he read more of poetry than of anything else  the consequence was that frank who was one of natures gentlemen became a wellinformed man and might have moved in any circle of society with credit to himself and profit as well as pleasure to others  frank was by nature grave sedate earnest thoughtful  emma was equally earnestmore so perhapsbut she was lighthearted not light headed observe and volatile  the result was mutual attraction  let philosophers account for the mutual attraction of these qualities as they best may we simply record the fact  history records it nature records it experienceeverything records it who has the temerity or folly to deny it  emma and frank felt it and in some mysterious way frank had come to know something or other about emmas feelings which it is not our business to inquire into too particularly  so then frank also gazedno not at the moon it would have required him to ascend three flights of stairs and a ladder besides passing through a trap to the roof of the station to enable him to do that but there was a lamp over the fireplace with a tin reflector which had quite a dazzling effect of its ownnot a bad imitation of the moon in a small wayso he gazed at that and thought it very bright indeed brighter than usual  we may as well put the reader out of suspense at once by saying that we do not intend to describe miss tippets evening with a few friends our own private opinion in regard to the matter is that if they had been fewer than they were and more worthy of the name of friends the evening might have been worth recording but it is sufficient to say that they all came acted as usual spoke as usual felt as usual favoured the company with songs as usual andahyesenjoyed themselves as usual till about halfpast eleven oclock when they all took their leave with the exception of miss deemas who in consideration of the coldness of the weather had agreed to spend the night with her dear friend  miss deemas was one of those unfortunates with whom it is impossible for any one to sleep  besides being angular and hard she had a habit of kicking in her slumbers and being powerful was a dangerous bedfellow she knew this herself and therefore wisely preferred when visiting her friends to sleep alone  hence it happened that miss tippet and emma went to bed in the back room with the green hangings while miss deemas retired to the front room with the blue paper  there is a common fallacy in naval matters founded on poetical license to the effect that the mariner is separated from death by a single plank whereas the unpoetical truth is that the separation consists of many hundreds of planks and a solid bulwark of timbers more than a foot thick besides an inner skin the whole being held together by innumerable iron and oaken bolts and trenails and tightened with oakum and pitch  we had almost fallen into this erroror poetical laxity of expressionby saying that on the night of which we write little did miss tippet know that she was separated from not death exactly but from something very awful by a single plank at least by the floor of her own residence and the ceiling of the house belowas the sequel will show  that same night david boone gaunt tall and cadaverous as of old sat in his back parlour talking with his friend gorman  now boone said the latter with an oath im not goin to hang off and on any longer  its more than seven years since we planned this business the insurances have been effected youve bin a prosperous man yet here you are deeper in my debt than ever  quite true replied boone whose face was so pale that he might have easily been mistaken for a ghost but you know i have paid up my premiums quite regular and your interest too besides clearin off some of the principal  come dont be hard on me gorman  if it had not been that trade has got worse of late i would have cleared off all i owe you but indeed indeed i have not been so successful of late and im again in difficulties  if you will only wait  no cried gorman ill not wait  i have waited long enough  how long would you have me waiteh  moreover im not hard on you  i show you an easy way to make a good thing of it and youre so chickenhearted that youre afraid to do it  its such a mean thing to do said boone  mean  why what do you call the style of carrying on business that you started with seven years ago and have practised more or less ever since  that is mean too said boone im ashamed of it sorry for it  it was for a time successful no doubt and i have actually paid off all my creditors except yourself but i dont think it the less mean on that account and im thoroughly ashamed of it  there was a good deal of firmness in boones tone as he said this and his companion was silent for a few minutes  i have arranged he said at last about your making over your policies of insurance to me as security for the debt you owe me  you wont have to pay them next halfyear ill do that for you if necessary  he laughed as he said this  i have now come to ask you to set the house alight and have the plan carried out and the whole affair comfortably settled  gorman said this in an encouraging voice assuming that his dupe was ready to act  bbut its awful to think of said boone suppose its found out  how can it be found out  well i dont know  its wonderful how crime is discovered said boone despondingly besides think of the risk we run of burning the people who live above as well as my two clerks who sleep in the room below us that would be murder you know  im sure i have tried my very best to get miss tippet to go from home for a short time ive almost let the cat out of the bag in my anxiety but she wont take the hint  oho exclaimed gorman with a laugh  well have you made the arrangements as i directed you last night  yes ive got a lot of tarry oakum scattered about and there is a pile of shavings he added pointing to a corner of the room the only thing im anxious about is that my young man robert roddy caught me pouring turpentine on the walls and floor of the shop  i pretended that it was water i had in the can and that i was sprinkling it to lay the dust before sweeping up  roddy is a slow stupid youth he always was and i daresay did not notice the smell  gorman was himself filled with anxiety on hearing the first part of this but at the conclusion he appeared relieved  its lucky you turned it off so said he and roddy is a stupid fellow  i daresay he has no suspicion  in fact i am sure of it  its not of much importance now however said boone rising and confronting his friend with more firmness than he had ever before exhibited to him because i have resolved not to do it  gorman lit his pipe at the fire looking at the bowl of it with a scornful smile as he replied  oh you have made up your mind have you  yes decidedly  nothing will move me  you may do your worst  very good remarked gorman advancing with the lighted paper towards the heap of shavings  boone sprang towards him and seizing his arms grasped the light and crushed it out  what would you do madman he cried  you can only ruin me but do you not know that i will have the power to denounce you as a fireraiser  gorman laughed and returned to the fireplace while boone sat down on a chair almost overcome with terror  what you dare to defy me said gorman with an air of assumed pity a pretty case you would have to make out of it  you fill your shop with combustibles you warn your tenant upstairs to get out of the premises for a time in a way that must be quite unaccountable to her until the fire accounts for it and your own clerk sees you spilling turpentine about the place the day before the fire occurs and yet you have the stupidity to suppose that people will believe you when you denounce me  poor david boones wits seemed to be sharpened by his despair for he said suddenly after a short pause  if the case is so bad it will tell against yourself gorman for i shall be certainly convicted and the insurance will not be paid to you  ay but the case is not so bad as it looks said gorman if you only have the sense to hold your tongue and do what you are told for nobody knows all these things but you and me and nobody can put them together except ourselvesdye see  it matters not said boone firmly i wont do itthere  both men leaped up  at the same moment there was a sound as of something falling in the shop  they looked at each other  go see what it is said gorman  the other stepped to the door  its only two of my waxdolls tumbled off the shelf he said on returning  an exclamation of horror escaped him for he saw that the heap of shavings had been set on fire during his momentary absence and gorman stood watching them with a demoniacal grin  boone was struck dumb  he could not move or speak  he made a feeble effort to stretch out his hands as if to extinguish the fire but gorman seized him in his powerful grasp and held him fast  in a few seconds the flames were leaping up the walls and the room was so full of smoke that they were driven into the front shop  now then said gorman in a fierce whisper your only chance is to act out your part as wisely as you can  shout fire now till youre black in the facefire  fire  fire  david boone obeyed with all his might and when gorman released him ran back into the parlour to try to extinguish the flames but he was driven back again scorched and halfchoked while gorman ran off at full speed to the nearest station gave the alarm received the shilling reward for being first to give the call and then went leisurely home to bed    chapter twenty eight  at the post of duty  fire  there is something appalling in the cry to most ears something deadly in the sound something that tells of imminent danger and urgent haste  after david boones first alarm was given other voices took it up passersby became suddenly wild darted about spasmodically and shouted it late sittersup flung open their windows and proclaimed it sleepers awoke crying what where and huddling on their clothes rushed out to look at it little boys yelled it frantic females screamed it and in a few minutes the hubbub in poorthing lane swelled into a steady roar  among the sound sleepers in that region was miss deemas  the fair head of that lady reposed on its soft pillow all unconscious of the fact that she was even then being gently smoked before being roasted alive  miss tippet on the very first note of alarm bounced out of bed with an emphatic there which was meant to announce the triumphant fulfilment of an old prophecy which she had been in the habit of making for some time past namely that matty merryon would certainly set the house on fire if she did not take care  the energy with which miss tippet sprang to the floor and exclaimed there caused emma ward to open her eyes to the utmost possible extent and exclaim where  without waiting for a reply she too bounded out of bed like an indiarubber ball and seeing for there was always a nightlight in the room that miss tippets face was as white as her nightdress she attempted to shriek but failed owing to a lump of some kind that had got somehow into her throat and which refused to be swallowed on any terms  the repetition of the cry fire fire outside induced both ladies at once to become insane  miss tippet with a touch of method even in her madness seized the counterpane wrapped it round her and rushed out of the room and downstairs  emma followed her example with a blanket and also fled just as matty merryon who slept in an attic room above tumbled down her wooden staircase and burst into the room by another door uttering a wild exclamation that was choked in the bud partly by terror partly by smoke  attempting in vain to wrap herself in a bolster matty followed her mistress  all three had utterly forgotten the existence of miss deemas  that strongminded lady being as we have hinted a sound sleeper was not awakened by the commotion in the street  in fact she was above such weaknesses  becoming aware of a crackling sound and a sensation of smoke she smiled sweetly in her slumbers and turning gently on her other side with a sigh dreamed ardently of fried ham and eggsher usual breakfast  while these events were occurring the cry of fire had reached the ears of one of londons guardians our friend samuel forest  that stouthearted man was seated at the time rapping the sides of his sentrybox with his head in a useless struggle with sleep  he had just succumbed and was snoring out his allegiance to the great conqueror when the policeman on the beat dashed open his door and shouted fire  sam was a calm selfpossessed man  he was no more flurried by this sudden unexpected and fierce shout of fire than he would have been if the policeman had in a mild voice made a statement of water  but although selfpossessed and cool sam was not slow  with one energetic effort he tripped up and floored the conqueror with one hand as it were while he put on his black helmet with the other and in three minutes more the fireescape was seen coming up the lane like a rampant monster of the antediluvian period  it was received by the crowd with frantic cheers because they had just become aware that a lady was asleep in one of the upper rooms which were by that time unapproachable owing to the lower part of the staircase having caught fire  the fact was made known with a sudden look of horror by miss tippet who with emma ward had been rescued from the firstfloor window by a gallant policeman  this man having procured a ladder entered the house at considerable personal risk and carried the ladies out in safety one after the other an event we may remark in passing which is not of rare occurrence at london fires where the police are noted for their efficient services and for the daring of some of the members of the force many of whom have received medals and other rewards for acts of personal daring in attempting to save life before the firemen had arrived on the ground  having put miss tippet and emma in a place of security the policeman was about to make a desperate attempt to reach the upper floor by rushing through the flames when the escape came up and rendered it unnecessary  dozens of tongues and hundreds of voices directed sam forest to the right window  he pointed his escape towards it but so vigorous was the uninvited assistance lent by the crowd that the head of the machine went crashing through it and dashed the frame into the middle of the room  to say that miss deemas was horrorstruck by such an awakening would be to use a mild expression  her strong mind was not strong enough to prevent her strong body from trembling like an aspen leaf as she lay for a few moments unable to cry or move  suddenly she believed that she was dreaming and that the instrument which had burst through her window was a nightmare or a guillotine and she made dreadful efforts to pinch herself awake without success  next moment a mans head looking very grim in the light of a bullseye lamp appeared at the top of the guillotine  so far this was in keeping with her idea but when the head leapt into the room followed by its relative body and made a rush at her miss deemas cast courage and philosophy to the dogs gave herself over to abject fear uttered a piercing shriek dipped her head under the bedclothes and drawing her knees up to her mouth clasped her hands over them in agony  come maam dont take on so no time to lose floors goin down said sam  he coughed as he said it for the smoke was getting thicker every moment  shriek upon shriek was the only answer vouchsafed by the terrified eagle  a wild cheer from the mob outside seemed to be a reply of encouragement to her but it was not so it was called forth by the sudden appearance of a fireengine dashing round the corner of the lane  be quiet my good lady said sam forest in a voice of tenderness but if his voice was tender his actions were the reverse for it was now a matter of life or death so he grasped the eagle bedclothes and all in his arms and bore her to the window  it is probable that this act revived in miss deemas some reminiscences of her childhood for she suddenly straightened herself out and struggled violently after the manner of those sweet little ones who wont be made to sit on nurses knees  being a tall heavy woman she struggled out of sams grasp and fell to the floor but her victory was shortlived  another moment and that bold man had her round the waist in a grasp from which she could not free herself  sam was considerate however and polite even in this extremity  he begged pardon as he wrapped the bedclothes round his victim and lifting her into the head of the escape let her go  no swoop that the eagle ever made mentally down upon base unworthy arrogant man was at all comparable to the descent which she made physically on that occasion into the arms of an expectant fireman she held her breath also the blankets tightly as she went down like a lightningflash and felt that she was about to be dashed to pieces but to her surprise soft cushions received her and she was immediately borne by another of these desperate men in helmets into an adjoining house and left unhurt in the arms of her sympathetic friend miss tippet  oh my dear dear julia exclaimed miss tippet shutting the door of the room into which they had been ushered and assisting her friend to disentangle herself from the bedclothes  oh what a mercy weve not all been roasted alive like beef steaksoroh what a sight you are my darling  you must have got it coming down that dreadful thingthe whatsisname you know  shall i ring for water  tut nonsense exclaimed the eagle panting as well from nervous excitement as exhaustion you are always so fussy emelina  please assist me to tie this string miss ward  yes i know im fussy dear julia exclaimed miss tippet bustling nervously about the room but i cant help it and im so thankful for but it was so bold in these noble fellows to risk their lives to  noble fellows shouted miss deemas with flashing eyes dyou call it noble to pull me out of bed and roll me in a blanket and shoot me down aai dont know what like a sack of coals  noble fellows indeed brutes  here miss deemas clasped her hands above her head in a passion of conflicting feelings and being unable to find words for utterance burst into a flood of tears dropped into a chair and covered her face with both hands  dear dear darling julia said miss tippet soothingly  dont speak to me sobbed the eagle passionately and stamping her foot i cant bear to think of it  but you know dear persevered her friend they could not help beingbeingwhat dyou call itenergetic you know for it was not rough  we should all have been roasted to death but for them and i feel very very grateful to them  i shall respect that policeman as long as i live  ah sure an he is a dacent boy now said matty merryon who entered the room just then the way he lifted you an miss emma up an flung ye over his showlder as aisy as if ye was two bolsters was beautiful to look at indade it was  shure it remimbered me o the purty pottery ye was readin just the other night as was writ by odood or ohood  hood suggested miss tippet  praps it was said matty hed be none the worse of an o before his name anyhow  but the pottery begood withtake her up tinderly lift her with care if i dont misremimber  will you hold your tongue cried the eagle looking up suddenly and drying her eyes  surely miss said matty with a toss of her head anything to plaize ye  it is due to matty to say that while the policeman was descending the ladder with her mistress she had faithfully remained to comfort and encourage emma and after emma was rescued she had quietly descended the ladder without assistance having previously found time to clothe herself in something a little more ample and appropriate than a bolster  but where was david boone all this time  rather say where was he not everywhere by turns and nowhere long was david to be seen in the frenzy of his excitement  consciencesmitten for what he had done or rather intended to do he ran wildly about making the most desperate efforts to extinguish the fire  no one knows what he can do till he is tried  that is a proverb at least if it is not it ought to be which embraces much deep truth  the way in which david boone set personal danger at defiance and seemed to regard suffocation by smoke or roasting by fire as terminations of life worth courting was astounding and rendered his friends and neighbours dumb with amazement  david was now on the staircase among the firemen fighting his way up through fire and smoke for the purpose of saving miss tippet until he was hauled forcibly back by dale or baxmorewho were in the thick of it as usual  anon down in the basement kneedeep in water searching for the bodies of his two shopmen both of whom were standing comfortably outside looking on  presently he was on the leads of the adjoining house directing commanding exhorting entreating the firemen there to point their branch at the blue bedroom  soon after he was in the street tearing his hair shouting that it was all his fault that he did it and that it would kill him  before the fire was put out poor boones eyelashes and whiskers were singed off little hair was left on his head and that little was short and frizzled  his clothes of course were completely soaked in addition to which they were torn almost to shreds and some of his skin was in the same condition  at last he had to be forcibly taken in charge and kept shut up in an adjoining house from the window of which he watched the destruction of his property and his hopes  almost superhuman efforts had been made by the firemen to save the house  many a house in london had they saved that year partially or wholly as indeed is the case every year and many thousands of pounds worth of property had they rescued but this case utterly defied them  so well had the plot been laid so thoroughly had the combustibles been distributed and lubricated with inflammable liquids that all the engines in the metropolis would have failed to extinguish that fire  david boone knew this and he groaned in spirit  the firemen knew it not and they worked like heroes  there was a shout at last among the firemen to look out  it was feared one of the partition walls was coming down so each man beat a hasty retreat  they swarmed out at the door like bees and were all safe when the wall fellall safe but one joe corney who being a reckless man took things too leisurely and was knocked down by the falling bricks  moxey and williams ran back and carried him out of danger  then seeing that he did not recover consciousness although he breathed they carried him at once to the hospital  the flames of the burning house sprang up just then as if they leaped in triumph over a fallen foe but the polished surface of poor joes helmet seemed to flash back defiance at the flames as they bore him away  after the partition wall fell the fire sank and in the course of a few hours it was extinguished altogether  but nothing whatever was saved and the firemen had only the satisfaction of knowing that they had done their best and had preserved the adjoining houses which would certainly have gone but for their untiring energy  by this time david boone besides being mad was in a raging fever the tenant of the house to which he had been taken was a friend as well as a neighbour of his owna greengrocer named mrs craw and she turned out to be a good samaritan for she insisted on keeping boone in her house and nursing him asserting stoutly and with a very red face she almost always asserted things stoutly and with a red face that mister boone was one of er best an holdest friends as she wouldnt see im go to a hospital on charitywhich she despised so she didas long as there was a spare bed in her ouse so there waswhich it wasnt as long as could be wished considerin mister boones height but that could be put right by knocking out the footboard and two cheers so it couldand as long she had one copper to rub on another no though she was to be flayed alive for her hospitality  by which round statement mrs craw was understood to imply a severe rebuke to mrs grabanother greengrocer over the way and a widowwho had been heard to say during the progress of the fire that it served boone right and that she wouldnt give him a helping hand in his distress on any account whatever  why mrs grab was so bitter and mrs craw so humane is a matter of uncertainty but it was generally believed that the former having had a matrimonial eye on boone and that boone having expressed general objections to matrimonybesides having gone of late to mrs craw for his vegetableshad something to do with it  next day d gorman happened quite in a casual way of course to saunter into poorthing lane and it was positively interesting to note as many people did notethe surprise and consternation with which he received the news of the fire from the people at the end of the lane who first met him and who knew him well  wery sad aint it sir said a sympathetic barber  he was sitch a droll dog too  hell be quite a loss to the neighbourhood wont he sir  i hope he wont said gorman loud enough to be heard by several persons who lounged about their doors  i hope to see him start afresh an git on better than ever poor fellow at least ill do all i can to help him  ah youve helped him already sir more than once i believe at least so he told me said the barber with an approving nod  well so i have returned gorman modestly but he may be assured that any trifle he owes me wont be called for just now  in fact my small loan to him is an old debt which i might have got any time these last six years when he was flourishing so im not going to press him now poor fellow  hes ill you say  yes so im told raither serious too  thats very sad where is he  with mrs craw sir the greengrocer  ah ill go and see him  goodday  gorman passed on with as much benignity thrown into his countenance as it could contain and the barber observed as he reentered his shop that that man was a better fellow than he looked  but gormans intentions whatever they might have been were frustrated at that time for he found boone in high fever and quite delirious  he did not however quit the house without putting as he expressed it at least one spoke in his wheel for he conducted himself in such a way towards mrs craw and expressed so much feeling for her friend and his that he made quite a favourable impression on that worthy woman he also left a sovereign wherewith to purchase any little luxuries for the sick man that might be conducive to his health and comfort and went away with the assurance that he would look in to inquire for him as often as he could    chapter twenty nine  willie willders in difficulties  mr thomas tippet beaming and perspiring as of old was standing at his bench chisel in hand and willie willders was standing with his back to the fire and his legs pretty wide apart not because he preferred that degage attitude but because chips and puss were asleep side by side between his feet  it must not be supposed that although willie had changed so much since the first day he stood there an equal change had taken place in mr tippet  by no means  he was a little stouter perhaps but in all other respects he was the same man  not a hair greyer nor a wrinkle more  the workshop too was in exactly the same state only a little more crowded in consequence of numerous models having been completed and shelved during the last seven years  there was however something new in the shape of a desk with some halffinished plans upon it for willie had gradually introduced a little genuine engineering into the business  at first naturally enough the boy had followed his employers lead and as we have said before being very ingenious as well as enthusiastic had entered with all his heart and head into the absurd schemes of his patron but as he became older he grew wiser  he applied himself to reading and study at home in the evenings with indomitable perseverance  the result of his application was twofold  in the first place he discovered that he was very ignorant and that there existed a huge illimitable field of knowledge worth entering on seriously  his early training having been conducted thanks to his mother in the fear of the lord he regarded things that are spiritual and have god and mans duty to him for their object as partthe chief partof that great field of knowledge not as a separate field which may or may not be entered on according to taste  in the second place he began to discover that his kindhearted employer was a monomaniac  in other words that although sane enough in all other matters he was absolutely mad in regard to mechanical discoveries and inventions and that most of the latter were absolutely nonsensical  this second discovery induced him to prosecute his studies with all the more energy in order that he might be prepared for the battle of life in case his existing connection with mr tippet should be dissolved  his studies naturally took an engineering turn and being what is termed a thoroughgoing fellow he did not rest until he had dived into mathematics so deep that we do not pretend to follow him even in the way of description  architecture surveying shipbuilding and cognate subjects claimed and obtained his earnest attention and year after year on winter nights did he sit at the side of the fire in the little house at notting hill adding to his stores of knowledge on these subjects while his meek old mother sat darning socks or patching male attire on the other side of the fire with full as much perseverance and assiduity  one consequence of this was that willie willders having begun as a jackofall trades pushed on until he became a philosopherofalltrades and of many sciences too so that it would have been difficult to find his match between charing cross and primrose hill  and willie was not changeable  true to his first love he clung with all the ardour of youth to fire fireengines and the firebrigade  he would have become a member of the latter if he could but that was in the circumstances impossible  he studied the subject however and knew its history and its working details from first to last  he did his best to invent new engines and improve on old ones but in such matters he usually found that his inventions had been invented and his improvements made and improved upon long before  such checks however did not abate his ardour one jot  he persevered in his varied courses until he worked himself into a species of business which could exist only in london which it would be difficult to describe and which its practitioner styled polyartism with as much boldness as if the word were in johnsons dictionary  standing on the hearth as we have said willie related to his friend all he knew in regard to the cattley family and wound up with an anxious demand what was to be done for them  mr tippet leaning on his bench and looking into willies face with a benignant smile said  done my boy why help em of course  ay but how asked willie  how cried mr tippet why by giving em money  you are aware that i stopped their allowance because cattley senior went and drank it as soon as he got it and cattley junior is able to support himself and i was not until now aware that the poor daughter was killing herself to support her father but as i do know it now ill continue the allowance and increase it and we shall give it into the daughters hands so that the father wont be able to misspend it  mr tippets visage glowed with ardour as he stated this arrangement but the glow was displaced by a look of anxiety as he observed that willie shook his head and looked as perplexed as ever  if that plan would have availed i would have tried it long ago said he with a sad smile for my income is a pretty good one thanks to you sir  thanks to your own genius willie for the remarkable and prolific offshoots which you have caused to sprout from this dry old root said mr tippet interrupting as he glanced round the room with an air of affection which showed that he loved the root dearly despite its age and dryness  not the less thanks to you sir said willie in the deferential tone which he had assumed involuntarily towards his patron almost from the commencement of their intercourse but zamiss cattley positively refuses to accept of money from anyone in charity as long as she can work  ah exclaimed mr tippet shaking his head slowly pride simple pride  not laudable pride observe  she deceives herself no doubt into the belief that it is laudable but it is not for when a girl cannot work without working herself into her grave it is her duty not to work and it is the duty as well as the privilege of her friends to support her  truth is truth willie and we must not shrink from stating it because a few illogical thinkers are apt to misunderstand it or because there are a number of meanspirited wretches who would be too glad to say that they could not work without injuring their health if they could by so doing persuade their friends to support them  what are those whom god has visited with weakness of body to be made to toil and moil far beyond their strength in order to prove that they do not belong to the class of deceivers and sycophants  yet public opinion in regard to this matter of what is called selfrespect and proper pride compels many hundreds who urgently require assistance to refuse it and dooms many of them to a premature grave while it does not shut the maw of a single one of the other class  why sir miss cattley is committing suicide and in regard to her father who is dependent on her she is committing murdermurder sir  mr tippets eyes flashed with indignation and he drove the chisel deep down into the bench as if to give point and force to his sentiment as well as an illustration of the dreadful idea with which he concluded  willie admitted that there was much truth in mr tippets observations but did not quite agree with him in his sweeping condemnation of ziza  however continued mr tippet resuming his quiet tone and benignant aspect ill consider the matter  yes ill consider the matter and see whats to be done for em  he leaped from the bench with a quiet chuckle as he said this and began to saw vigorously while willie went to his desk in the corner and applied himself to an abstruse calculation considerably relieved in mind for he had unbounded belief in the fertility of mr tippets imagination and he knew well that whatever that old gentleman promised he would certainly fulfil    chapter thirty  the bestlaid plans  there were other men besides mr tippet who could be true to their promises when it suited them  d gorman was true to his in so far as they concerned david boone  he visited that unfortunate invalid so frequently and brought him so many little nice things for the alleviation of his sufferings and exhibited altogether such nervous anxiety about his recovery that worthy mrs craw was quite overwhelmed and said in the fulness of her heart that she never did see a kinder friend or one who more flatly gave the liedirect to his looks which she was bound to admit were not prepossessing  but despite his friends solicitude and his doctors prescriptions and his nurses kindness david boone continued steadily to sink until at last the doctor gave it as his opinion that he would not recover  one afternoon soon after the expression of this opinion gorman called on his friend and was shown as usual into his chamber  it was a wet cold stormy afternoon and the window rattled violently in its frame  boone was much better that afternoon  it seemed as if he had just waited for the doctor to pronounce his unfavourable opinion in order to have the satisfaction of contradicting it  hes better today sir said mrs craw in a whisper  better exclaimed gorman with a look of surprise im glad to hear thatvery glad  he looked as if he were very sorry but then as mrs craw said his looks belied him  hes asleep now sir the doctor said if he slept he was on no account to be waked up so ill leave you to sit by him sir till he wakes and please be as quiet as you can  mrs craw left the room on tiptoe and gorman went to the bedside and looked on the sick mans wasted features with a frown  ha youre asleep are you and not to be waked upeh  come ill rouse you  he shook him violently by the shoulder and boone awoke with a start and a groan  hope i didnt disturb you boone said his friend in a quiet voice i came to inquire for you  boone started up in his bed and stared wildly at some object which appeared to be at the foot of the bed  gorman started too and turned pale as his eyes followed those of the invalid  what is it you see boone  there there he whispered hoarsely clutching gormans arm as if for protection look i heard his voice just now oh save me from that man hehewants to kill me  come david said gorman soothingly its only a fancytheres nobody therenobody in the room but me  and who are you inquired the sick man falling back exhausted while he gazed vacantly at his friend  dont you know me david  never mind shut your eyes now and try to sleep  itll be time to take your physic soon  physic cried boone starting up in alarm and again clutching gormans arm  you wont let him give it me will you  oh say you wontpromise to give it me yourself  gorman promised and a very slight but peculiar smile turned up the corners of his mouth as he did so  boone again sank back on his pillow and gorman sat down on a chair beside him  his villainous features worked convulsively for in his heart he was meditating a terrible deed  that morning he had been visited by ned hooper who in the most drunken of voices told him that it wash mposhble to git a body fr love or munny so if e wanted one hed better cuts own throat  his plans having miscarried in this matter gorman now meditated taking another and more decided step  he looked at the sick man and seeing how feeble he was his fingers twitched as if with a desire to strangle him  so strong was the feeling upon him that he passed his fingers nervously about his own throat as if to ascertain the formation of it and the precise locality of the windpipe  then his hand dropped to his side and he sat still again while boone rolled his poor head from side to side and moaned softly  evening drew on apace and the shadows in the sickroom gradually became deeper and deeper until nothing could be seen distinctly  still gorman sat there with his features pale as death and his fingers moving nervously and still the sick man lay and rolled his head from side to side on the pillow  once or twice gorman rose abruptly but he as often sat down again without doing anything  suddenly a ray of bright light shot through the window  gorman started and drew back in alarm  it was only a lamplighter who had lighted one of the streetlamps and the ray which he had thus sent into the sickchamber passed over the bed  it did not disturb boone for the curtains were between him and it but it disturbed gorman for it fell on the chimneypiece and illuminated a group of phials one of which half full of a black liquid was labelled poison  gorman started up and this time did not sit down but with a trembling step moved to the fireplace  he stretched out his hand to grasp the bottle and almost overturned it for just at the moment his own figure intercepted the ray of light and threw the spot where it stood into deep shadow  whats that asked boone  its only me said gorman getting you your physic  i almost upset it in the dark  here now drink it off  i cant find the cup but you can take it out of the bottle  you wont let him come near when you give it will you asked boone anxiously  no no come open your mouth  boone hesitated to do so but gorman used a little force  his hands were steady now  his heart was steeled to the deed and the cry which boone was about to utter was choked by the liquid flowing down his throat  gorman had flung him back with such violence that he lay stunned while the murderer replaced the bottle on the chimneypiece and hurried to the door  a gentle knock at it arrested him but his indecision was momentary  he opened the door softly and going out said to mrs craw in a whisper  hes sleeping now  i found it hard to get him to give up talking for he waked up soon after i went in but hes all right now  i suppose the medicine is beginning to operate he told me he took it himself just before i came in  took it himself exclaimed mrs craw  impossible  well i dont know but hes better now  i would let him rest a while if i were you  stay sir  ill go fetch a light said mrs craw  never mind i know the stair well said gorman hurriedly dont mind a light i shant want it  he was right  if any man ever wanted darkness rather than lightthick heavy impenetrable darknessit was d gorman at that time  took it himself repeated mrs craw in unabated surprise as she closed the street door  its impossible  hes got no more strength than an unborn hinfant  i must go an see to this  lighting a candle she went softly into the sick chamber and looked at the invalid who was apparently asleep but breathing heavily  she then went to the chimneypiece and began to examine the phials there  my she exclaimed suddenly with a look of alarm if he hant bin an drunk up all the tinctur o rhubarb  an the laudanumbottle standin close beside it too  what a mercy he didnt drink that  well lucky for him there wasnt much in it for an overdose of anything in his state would be serious  full of her discovery mrs craw set the candle on the table and sat down on the chair by the bedside to think about it but the more she thought about it the more puzzled she was  took it himself she said reverting to gormans words  impossible  she continued to shake her head and mutter impossible for some time while she stared at the candle as if she expected that it would solve the mystery  then she got up and examined the bedclothes and found that a good deal of the rhubarb had been spilt on the sheets and that a good deal more of it had been spilt on boones chin and chest after which her aspect changed considerably as setting down the candle she resumed her seat and said  took it himself  impossible    darkness  if ever a man sought darkness in vain and found light bright blazing light everywhere it was gorman  at first in a burst of frenzy he rushed away at full speed  it was well for him that the wind had increased to a hurricane and the rain was blinding else had he been stopped on suspicion so fierce was his mien so haggard his look so wild his race  gradually his pace slackened and gradually as well as naturally he gravitated to his old familiar haunts but go where he would there was light everywhere except within his own breast  it was all darkness there  it is true the sky was dark enough for the war of elements was so great that it seemed to have been blotted out with ink but the shops appeared to have been lit up more brilliantly than usual  every lamp poured a flood of light around it  the lanterns of the cabs and omnibuses sent rich beams of light through the air and the air itself laden as it was with moisture absorbed a portion of light and invested everything with a halo  light light all round and the light of conscience within rendering the darkness there visible and shining on the letters of a word written in dark redmurderer  gorman tried to extinguish the light but it was a fire that would not be put out  he cursed the shopwindows and the lamps for shining so brightly on him he cursed the few people whose curiosity induced them to pause and look back at him and he cursed himself for being such a fool  on reaching cheapside he began to recover his selfpossession and to walk in the storm as other men did  but in proportion as his composure returned the enormity of his crime became more apparent to him and the word written in red letters became so bright that he felt as if every passerby must read it unless he dropt his eyes to prevent their seeing through them into his soul  at london bridge he became nervously apprehensive  each unusually quick footstep startled him  every policeman was carefully avoided and anything approaching to a shout behind caused him to start into an involuntary run  despite his utmost efforts to control himself the strong man was unmanned a child could have made him fly  he was about to cross london bridge when he observed a policeman taking shelter under the parapet and apparently watching those who passed him gorman could not make up his mind to go on so he turned aside and descended the nearest stairs  the policeman had doubtless been watching for someone or suspected gorman because of his undecided movements for he followed him  the latter observed this and quickened his pace  the instant he was hidden from his pursuer he darted away at full speed and did not halt until he stood at the foot of one of the stairs where wherries are usually to be found  the sight that met his gaze there might have overawed the most reckless of men  a hurricane was raging such as is not often experienced in our favoured island  the wind blew not in gusts and squalls but in one continuous roar lashing the thames into crested waves tearing ships from their moorings and dashing them against other ships which were likewise carried away and swept downward with the tide  dozens of barges were sunk and the shrieks of their crews were heard sometimes rising above the storm  the gale was at its height when gorman came into full view of the thames  a waterman who was crouching for shelter in the angle of a warehouse observed him and came forward  an awful night sir he said  yes answered gorman curtly  he started as he spoke for he heard or he fancied he heard a shout behind him  is that your boat said he  it is replied the waterman in surprise you dont want to go on the water on such a night do you  yes i do said gorman trembling in every limb come jump in and shove off  at that moment a policeman came running down towards them  are you mad exclaimed the man grasping gorman by the arm as he sprang toward the boat  in a moment gorman struck him to the ground and leaping into the boat pushed off just as the policeman came up  he was whirled away instantly  grasping one of the oars he was just in time to prevent the boat being dashed against one of the wooden piers of a wharf  he was desperate now  shipping both oars he pulled madly out into the stream but in a few moments he was swept against the portbow of a large vessel against the stem of which the water was curling as if the ship had been breasting the atlantic waves before a stiff breeze  one effort gorman made to avoid the collision then he leaped up and just as the boat struck sprang at the forechains  he caught them and held on but his hold was not firm the next moment he was rolling along the vessels side tearing it with his nails in the vain attempt to grasp the smooth hull  he struck against the bow of the vessel immediately behind and was swept under it  rising to the surface he uttered a wild shriek and attempted to stem the current  he was a powerful swimmer and despair lent him energy to buffet the waves for a short time but he was again swept away by the irresistible tide and had almost given up hope of being saved when his forehead was grazed by a rope which hung from a vessels side  seizing this he held on and with much difficulty succeeded in gaining the vessels deck  with his safety gormans fear of being captured returned  he hid himself behind some lumber and while in this position wrung some of the water out of his clothes  in a few minutes he summoned courage to look about him and discovered that the vessel was connected with the one that lay next to it by a plank  no one appeared to be moving and it was so dark that he could not see more than four or five yards before him  to pass from one vessel to the other was the work of a few seconds  finding that the second vessel lay moored to the quay he sprang from it with all his might and alighted safely on the shore from the position of the shipping he knew that he stood on the south bank of the river having been swept right across the thames so he had now no further difficulty in hiding his guilty head in his own home    chapter thirty one  new lights of various kinds  time sped on apace and in its train came many changes  to the confusion of the doctor and despite the wouldbe murderer david boone recovered  but that brought no relief to gorman whose remorse increased daily insomuch that he became if not quite very nearly insane and his fear of being caught was so great that he never ventured near the quarter of london in which boone dwelt  he therefore remained in ignorance of the failure of his murderous attempt  what would he not have given to have known the truth to have had the dreadful word removed from the light which shone upon it brighter and brighter every day until it was made redhot as it were and became within him as a consuming fire  preferring darkness to light more than ever gorman kept in secret places during the day and only ventured out with other human vultures at night  the wretched man feared the darkness too although he sought it and what between the darkness that he feared yet courted and the light that he feared and fled from and the light within that he feared but could not fly from he became one of the most miserable of all the outcasts in london  as for his deeplaid plans they were all scattered to the winds  in the presumption of ignorance he had fancied that he knew his own power and so in one sense he did but he was not aware of his own want of power he knew indeed that he had the brute courage to dare and do anything desperate or dastardly but he did not know that he lacked the moral courage to bear the consequences of his deeds  the insurance policies therefore lay unclaimedeven uncared for  another change for the worse effected by time was the death of loo auberly  gradually and gently her end approached  death was so slow in coming that it was long expected yet it was so very slow that when it came at last it took her friends by surprise  james auberly continued stiff and stately to the last  he refused to believe that his child was dying and spared no expense to provide everything that money could procure to restore her health  he also refused to be reconciled to his son fred who had succeeded in his loved profession beyond his expectations and who had sought again and again to propitiate his father  at last fred resolved to go abroad and study the works of the ancient masters  he corresponded regularly with loo for some time but his letters suddenly ceased to make their appearance and nothing was heard of him for many months  during the long and weary illness loo had three friends whose visits were to her soul like gleams of sunshine on a cloudy daymiss tippet emma ward and a poor artificialflower maker named ziza cattley  those three so different yet so like were almost equally agreeable to the poor invalid  miss tippet was so funny but so good and emmas sprightly nature seemed to charm away her pain for a time while grave gentle earnest ziza made her happy during her visits and left a sensation of happiness after she went away  all three were equally untiring in talking with her about the old old storythe love of jesus christ  yes it comes to this at last if not at first with all of us  even the professed infidel laugh as he may in the springtide of life usually listens to that old old story when lifes tide is very low if not with faith at least with seriousness and with a hope that it may be true  may be true  why if the infidel would only give one tithe of the time and trouble and serious inquiry to the investigation of that same old story and its credentials that he gives so freely to the study of the subtleties of his art or profession he would find that there is no historical fact whatever within his ken which can boast of anything like the amount or strength of evidence in favour of its truth that exists in favour of the truth of the story of the life death and resurrection of jesus christ our lord  when loo died the stateliness and stiffness of james auberly gave way and the stern man leaning his head upon the coffin as he sat alone in the darkened room wept as if he had been a little child  there was yet another change brought about by that great overturner time  but as the change to which we refer affects those who have yet to take a prominent part in our tale we will suffer them to speak for themselves  one afternoon long after the occurrence of those changes to which reference has just been made mrs willders while seated quietly at her own fireside although there was no fire there the month being june was interrupted in her not unusual though innocent occupation of darning socks by the abrupt entrance of her son frank who flung his cap on the table kissed his mother on the forehead and then flung himself on the sofa which piece of furniture being old and decrepit groaned under his weight  mother he exclaimed with animation ive got strange news to tell you  is willie at home  no but i expect him every minute  he promised to come home earlier today and wont be long for he is a boy of his word  mrs willders persisted in calling her strapping sons boys despite the evidence to the contrary on their cheeks and chins  here he comes cried frank as a rapid step was heard  next moment the door burst open and willie performing much the same ceremony that frank had done and in a wonderfully similar way said he had come home with something strange to tell though not altogether strange either as his mother he said knew something about it already  mrs willders smiled and glanced at frank  which is to begin first she asked  what do you know about it too cried willie turning to his brother  know about what said frank  you have not told me what it is how can i answer you  about mr auberly said willie  frank said that he knew nothing new or peculiar about him except that he wasno he wouldnt say anything bad of him for he must be a miserable man at that time  but out with your news willie he added mine will keep and as yours is according to yourself partly known already to my mother its as well to finish off one subject before we begin to another  oh then you have news too have you said willie  frank nodded  strange coincidence exclaimed willie  did you ever hear of a coincidence that was not strange lad  go on with your news else ill begin before you  thus admonished willie began  oh mother youre a nice deceiver youre a sly old lady aint you and you sit there with a face as meek and sweet and smiling as if you had never deceived anybody in all your life not to speak of your two sons  o fy  as mrs willders still smiled and went on with her knitting serenely without vouchsafing a reply willie continued with an offhand airwell then i may as well tell you that i have just had an interview with uncle auberlyhallo you seem surprised  mrs willders was indeed surprised  her serenity of aspect fled in an instant  oh willie how comes it that you know  im sure i did not mean to tell you  i promised i never would  i must have let it out inadvertently or when i was asleep  make yourself quite easy mother said willie ill explain it all presently  just go on with your knitting and dont put yourself into a state  the widow recovering herself a little resumed her work and frank who had listened with an amused smile up to this pointsupposing that his brother was jestingelongated his face and opened his eyes wider and wider as he listened  you must know resumed willie that i received a note from mr auberly last night asking me to call on him some time this afternoon so i went and found him seated in his library  poor man he has a different look now from what he had when i went last to see him  you know i have hardly ever seen him since that day when i bamboozled him so about another boy that he expected to call  but his spirit is not much improved i fear  sit down mr willders he said  i asked you to call in reference to a matter which i think it well that the parties concerned should understand thoroughly  your brother frank i am told has had the presumption to pay his addresses to miss ward the young lady who lives with my relative miss tippet  yes mr auberly i replied and miss ward has had the presumption to accept him  it was wrong of you to answer so interrupted mrs willders shaking her head  wrong mother how could i help it  was i going to sit there and hear him talk of franks presumption as if he were a chimneysweep  mr auberly thinks miss ward above him in station and so deems his aspiring to her hand presumption replied the widow gently  besides you should have remembered the respect due to age  well but mother said willie defending himself it was very impudent of him and i did speak very respectfully to him in tone if not in words  the fact is i felt nettled for after all what is miss ward  the society she mingles in is miss tippets society and thats not much to boast of and her father i believe was a confectionerno doubt a rich one that kept his carriage before he failed and left his daughter almost a beggar  but riches dont make a gentleman or a lady either mother im sure youve often told me that and explained that education and good training and good feelings and polite manners and consideration for others were the true foundations of gentility  if that be so mother there are many gentlemen born who are not gentlemen bred and many lowly born who  come lad dont bamboozle your mother with sophistries interrupted frank but go on to the point and dont be so long about it  well mother resumed willie mr auberly gave me a harder rebuke than you have done for he made no reply to my speech at all but went on as quietly and coolly as if i had not opened my lips  now said he i happen to have a particular regard for miss ward  i intend to make her my heir and i cannot consent to her union with a man who has nothing  mr auberly said i and i assure you mother i said this quite respectfully my brother is a man who has little money no doubt but he has a good heart and a good head and a strong arm an arm too which has saved life before now  i stopped at that for i saw it went home  quite true he replied i do not forget that he saved my lost childs life butbutthe thing is outrageousthat a penniless man should wed the lady who is to be my heir  no sir i sent for you to ask you to say to your brother from me that however much i may respect him i will not consent to this union and if it goes on despite my wishes i shall not leave miss ward a shilling  he had worked himself up into a rage by this time and as i felt i would only make matters worse if i spoke i held my tongue except that i said i would deliver his message at once as i expected to meet my brother at home  he seemed sorry for having been so sharp however and when i was about to leave him he tried to smile and said i regret to have to speak thus to you sir but i felt it to be my duty  you talk of meeting your brother tonight at home do you not live together  no sir i replied my brother lodges close to his station and i live with my mother in notting hill  notting hill he cried falling back in his chair as if he had been struck by a thunderbolt  your mother he gasped mrs willdersmy sisterinlawthe watermans widow  a sailors widow sir said i who is proud of the husband who rose to the top of his profession  why did you deceive me sir cried mr auberly with a sudden frown i would have undeceived you said i when we first met but you dismissed me abruptly at that time and would not hear me out  since then i have not thought it worth while to intrude on you in reference to so small a matterfor i did not know till this day that we are related  he frowned harder than ever at this and bit his lip and then said well young man this will make no difference i assure you  i desire you to convey my message to your brother  leave me now i was just on the point of saying goodbye uncle but he covered his face with his hands and looked so miserable that i went out without a word more  there youve got the whole of my story  what think you of it  its a curious one and very unexpected at least by me said frank though as you said part of it must have been known to mother who no doubt had good reasons for concealing it from us but i rather think that my story will surprise you more and its a better one than yours willie in this respect that it is shorter  come then out with it said willie with a laugh why this is something like one of the arabian nights entertainments  well mother said frank laying his hand gently on the widows shoulder you shant darn any more socks if i can help it for im a man of fortune now  how frank said mrs willders with a puzzled look  the fact is mother that mrs denman the poor old lady whom i carried down the escape i forget how many years ago is dead and has left me her fortune which i believe amounts to something like twenty thousand pounds  you dont mean that cried willie starting up  indeed i do said frank earnestly  then long life to ye my boy cried willie wringing his brothers hand and success to the oldwell no i dont exactly mean that but if she were alive i would say my blessing on the old lady  i wish you joy old fellow  i say surely the stately man wont object to the penniless fireman nowha ha  well its like a dream but tell us all about it frank  there is very little to tell lad  i got a very urgent message the day before yesterday to go to see an old lady who was very ill  i obtained leave for an hour and went at once not knowing who it was till i got there when i found that it was mrs denman  she looked very ill and i do assure you i felt quite unmanned when i looked into her little old face  young man she said in a low voice you saved my life i am dying and have sent for you to thank you  god bless you  she put out her thin hand and tried to shake mine but it was too feeble she could only press her fingers on it  that was all that passed and i returned to the station feeling quite in low spirits i do assure you  well next day a little man in black called and said he wished to have a few words with me  so i went out and he introduced himself as the old ladys lawyer told me that she was gone and that she had almost with her last breath made him promise to go the moment she was dead and see the fireman who had saved her life and tell him that she had left her fortune to him  he congratulated me said that there were no near relations to feel aggrieved or to dispute my rights and that as soon as the proper legal steps had been takenthe debts and legacies paid etceterahe would have the pleasure of handing over the balance which would probably amount to twenty thousand pounds  its like a dream said willie  so it is replied frank but its well that it is not a dream for if i had been the penniless man that mr auberly thinks me i would have been obliged in honour to give up emma ward  give her up exclaimed willie in amazement  why  why because i could not think of standing in the way of her good fortune  oh frank oh blazes said willie sadly has money told on you so fearfully already  do you think that she would give you up for the sake of auberlys dross  i believe not lad butbutwellnever mind we wont be troubled with the question now  but mother you dont seem to think much of my good fortune  i do think much of it frank it has been sent to you by the lord and therefore is to be received with thanksgiving  but sudden good fortune of this kind is very dangerous  it makes me anxious as well as glad  at that moment there came a loud knocking at the door which startled mrs willders and caused willie to leap up and rush to open it  frank rose and put on his cap with the quiet promptitude of a man accustomed to alarms  thats a fire mother the kind of knock is quite familiar to me now dont be alarmed we hear that kind of thing about two or three times a day at the station they knew i was here and have sent a messenger  a fire cried willie running into the room in great excitement  tut lad said frank with a smile as he nodded to his mother and left the room youd never do for a fireman youre too excitable wheres the messengerah here you are  well where is it  tooley street exclaimed a man whose condition showed that he had run all the way  frank started and looked very grave as he said hurriedly to his brother  goodnight lad  i wont likely be able to get out tomorrow to talk over this matter of the fortune  fires are usually bad in that neighbourhood  look well after mother  goodnight  in another moment he was gone  and well might frank look grave for when a fireman is called to a fire in tooley street or any part of the docks he knows that he is about to enter into the thickest of the great fight  to ordinary fires he goes lightheartedlyas a bold trooper gallops to a skirmish but to a fire in the neighbourhood of the docks he goes with something of the feeling which must fill the breast of every brave soldier on the eve of a great battle    chapter thirty two  the fire in tooley street  one of those great calamities which visit us once or twice it may be in a century descended upon london on saturday the 22nd of june 1861 it was the sudden and for the time overwhelming attack of an old and unconquerable enemy who found us as usual inadequately prepared to meet him  fire has fought with us and fed upon us since we became a nation and yet despite all our efforts its flames are at this day more furious than ever  there are more fires daily in london now than there ever were before  has this foe been properly met is a question which naturally arises out of this fact  referring to the beautiful organisation of the present fire brigade the ability of its chiefs and the courage of its men the answer is yes decidedly  but referring to the strength of the brigade to the munitions of war in the form of water to the means of conveyance in the form of mains to the system of check in the shape of an effective act in reference to partitionwalls and moderatelysized warehouses to the means of prevention in the shape of prohibitions and regulations in regard to inflammable substances referring to all these things the answer to the question has the foe been properly met is emphatically no  it is not sufficient to reply that a special inquiry has been made into this subject that steps are being actually taken to remedy the evils of our system or rather of our want of system of fire prevention  good may or may not result from this inquiry that is yet to be seen meanwhile the public ought to be awakened more thoroughly to the fact that an enemy is and always has been abroad in our land who might be if we chose more effectively checked who if he has not yet attacked our own particular dwelling may take us by surprise any day when we least expect him and who does at all times very materially diminish our national wealth and increase our public burdens  perhaps we should not style fire an enemy but a mutinous servant who does his work faithfully and well except when neglected or abused  about five oclock on saturday afternoon intelligence of the outbreak of fire in tooley street reached the headquarters of the brigade in watling street  fire in tooley street  the mere summons lent energy to the nerves and spring to the muscles of the firemen  not that tooley street in itself is more peculiarly dangerous in regard to fire than are the other streets of shops in the city  but tooley street lies in dangerous neighbourhood  the streets between it and the thames and those lying immediately to the west of it contain huge warehouses and bonded stores which are filled to suffocation with the wealth of nations dirty streets and narrow lanes here lead to the fountainhead of wealth untoldalmost inconceivable  the elegant filigreework of west end luxury may here be seen unsmelted as it were and in the ore  at the same time the rich substances on which fire feeds and fattens are stored here in warehouses which as they are should never have been built and in proximities which should never have been permitted  examine the wharvesbrooks wharf beals wharf cottons wharf chamberlains wharf freemans wharf griffins wharf stantons wharf and others investigate the laneshays lane mill lane morgans lane and the streetsbermondsey dockhead pickle herring street horsleydown and othersand there besides the great deposit and commission warehouses which cover acres of ground and are filled from basement to ridgepole with the commodities and combustibles of every clime you will find huge granaries and stores of lead alum drugs tallow chicory flour rice biscuit sulphur and saltpetre mingled with the warehouses of cheeseagents hamfactors provision merchants tarpaulindealers oil and colour merchants etcetera  in fact the entire region seems laid out with a view to the raising of a bonfire or a pyrotechnic display on the grandest conceivable scale  little wonder then that the firemen of watling street turned out all their engines including two of shand and masons new landsteam fireengines which had at that time just been brought into action little wonder that the usual request for a man from each station was changed into an urgent demand for every man that could possibly be spared  the fire began in the extensive wharves and warehouses known as cottons wharf near london bridge and was first observed in a warehouse over a countingroom by some workmen who at once gave the alarm and attempted to extinguish it with some buckets of water  they were quickly driven back however by the suffocating smoke which soon filled the various floors so densely that no one could approach the seat of the fire  mr braidwood who was early on the spot saw at a glance that a pitched battle was about to be fought and like a wise general concentrated all the force at his command  expresses were sent for the more distant brigade engines and these came dashing up one after another at full speed  the two powerful steam floatingengines which guard the thames from fire were moored off the wharf two lengths of hose attached to them and led on shore and brought to bear on the fire  a number of landengines took up a position in tooley street ready for action but these were compelled to remain idle for nearly an hour before water was obtainable from the fireplugs  o london with all your wealth and wisdom how strange that such words can be truly written of you  the vessels which were lying at the wharf discharging and loading were hauled out of danger into the stream  in course of time the engines were in full play but the warehouse burst into flames from basement to roof in spite of them and ere long eight of the great storehouses were burning furiously  the flames made rapid work of it progressing towards the line of warehouses facing the river and to the lofty building which adjoined on the tooley street side  dale and his men were quickly on the scene of action and had their engine soon at work  before long frank willders joined them  they were playing in at the windows of a large store which was burning so furiously that the interior appeared to be redhot  relieve corney lad said dale as frank came forward  och its time cried corney delivering up the branch to frank and moxey sure baxmore and me are melted intirely  frank made no reply  he and moxey directed the branch which the others resigned turning their backs as much as possible on the glowing fire and glancing at it over their shoulders for it was too hot to be faced  just then the chief of the brigade came up  its of no use sir said dale we cant save these  true dale true said mr braidwood in a quick but quiet tone this block is doomed  take your lads round to the noreast corner we must try to prevent it spreading  as he surveyed the progress of the fire with a cool practical eye and hurried off to another part of the battlefield to post his men to best advantage little did the leader of the forces think that he was to be the first to fall that day  engines were now playing on the buildings in all directions but the flames were so fierce that they made no visible impression on them and even in the efforts made to check their spreading little success appeared to attend them at first  warehouse after warehouse ignited  to make matters worse a fresh breeze sprang up and fanned the flames into redoubled fury so that they quickly caught hold of vast portions of the premises occupied by the firm of scovell and company  theres not a chance said frank to dale while he wiped the perspiration from his forehead and sat down for a few seconds to recover breath for he had just issued from a burning building driven back by heat and smoke  theres not a chance of saving that block all the iron doors that were meant to keep the fire from spreading have been left open by the workmen  chance or no chance we must do our best said dale  come lad with me i think we may get at a door inside the next warehouse through which we might bring the branch to bear  are you able  all right exclaimed frank leaping up and following his leader through the smoke  have a care cried frank pausing as a tremendous explosion caused the ground to tremble under their feet  its sulphur or saltpetre said dale pushing on there are tons upon tons of that stuff in the cellars all round  this was indeed the case  it was said that upwards of 2000 tons of saltpetre were in the vaults at the time and several explosions had already taken place though fortunately without doing injury to any one  dale had already partially examined the warehouse into which he now led frank and therefore although it was full of smoke he moved rapidly along the narrow and intricate passages between the bales of goods until he reached an iron door  here it is well open this and have a look he said grasping the handle and swinging the heavy door open  instantly a volume of black smoke drove both the men back almost suffocating them  they could not speak but each knew that the reclosing of that iron door was allimportant for the fire had got nearer to it than dale had imagined  they both darted forward but were again driven back and had to rush to the open air for breath  frank recovered before his comrade in consequence of the latter having made a more strenuous and prolonged effort to close the door which he had so unfortunately opened  without a moments hesitation he sprang into the warehouse again regained and partially closed the door when the stifling smoke choked him and he fell to the ground  a few seconds later dale followed him and found him there  applying his great strength with almost superhuman energy to the door it shut with a crash and the communication between the buildings was cut off  dale then seized frank by the collar and dragged him into the open air when he himself almost sank to the ground  fresh air however soon restored them both and in a few minutes they were actively engaged at another part of the building  bravely and perseveringly though this was done it availed not for nothing could withstand the fury of the fire  the warehouse caught and was soon a glowing mass like the others while the flames raged with such violence that their roaring drowned the shouting of men and the more distant roar of the innumerable multitude that densely covered london bridge and clustered on every eminence from which a safe view of the great fire could be obtained  the floating fireengines had now been at work for some time and the men in charge of their branches were suffering greatly from the intense heat  about this time nearly seven oclock in the evening mr braidwood went to these men to give them a word of encouragement  he proceeded down one of the approaches to the river from tooley street and stopped when nearly half way to give some directions when a sudden and tremendous explosion took place shaking the already tottering walls which at this place were of great height  a cry was raised run the wall is falling  every one sprang away at the word  the wall bulged out at the same time and one of the firemen seeing that mr braidwood was in imminent danger made a grasp at him as he was springing from the spot but the heavy masses of brickwork dashed him away and in another moment the gallant chief of the fire brigade lay buried under at least fifteen feet of burning ruin  any attempt at rescue would have been impossible as well as unavailing for death must have been instantaneous  the heros warfare with the flames which had lasted for upwards of thirtyeight years was ended and his brave spirit returned to god who gave it  that a man of no ordinary note had fallen was proved before many hours had passed by the deep and earnest feeling of sorrow and sympathy which was manifested by all classes in london from queen victoria downwards as well as by the public funeral which took place a few days afterwards at which were present the duke of sutherland the earl of caithness the reverend doctor cumming and many gentlemen connected with the insurance offices the committee and men of the london fire brigade also those of various private and local brigades the secretary and conductors of the royal society for the protection of life from fire the mounted metropolitan and city police the london rifle brigade of which mr braidwoods three sons were members the superintendents and men of the various water companies and a long string of private and mourning carriages to witness the progress of which hundreds of thousands of people densely crowded the streets and clustered in the windows and on every available eminence along the route while in cheapside almost all the shops were shut and business was suspended and in the neighbourhood of shoreditch toiling thousands of artisans came forth from factory and workshop to see the last of braidwood whose name had been so long familiar to them as a household word  the whole heart of london seemed to have been moved by one feeling and the thousands who thronged the streets had in the language of one of the papers of the day gathered together to witness the funeral not of a dead monarch not of a great warrior not of a distinguished statesman not even of a man famous in art in literature or in science but simply of james braidwood late superintendent of the london fireengine establishmenta true hero and one who was said by those who knew him best to be an earnest christian man  but at the moment of his fall his men were engaged in the thick of battle  crushing though the news of his death was there was no breathing time to realise it  the fierce heat had not only driven back the firemen on shore but had compelled the floating fireengines to haul off in consequence of the flaming matter which poured over the wharf wall and covered the surface of the river the entire length of the burning warehouses while the whole of the carriageway of tooley street was ankle deep in hot oil and tallow  after the fall of their chief messrs henderson and fogo two of the principal officers of the brigade did their utmost to direct the energies of the men  night closed in and the flames continued to rage in all their fury and magnificence  news of this great fire spread with the utmost rapidity over the metropolis  indeed it was visible at hampstead while it was yet daylight  when darkness set in one of the most extraordinary scenes that london ever produced was witnessed  from all quarters the people came pouring in on foot in omnibus cab pleasurevan cart and waggonall converging to london bridge  at nine oclock the bridge and its approaches presented all the appearance of the epsom road on the derby day  cabs and buses plied backwards and forwards on the bridge all night carrying an unlimited number of passengers at 2 pence and 3 pence each and thousands of persons spent the night in thus passing to and fro  the railway terminus billingsgate market the roof of the coal exchange the monument the quays the windows the housetops the steeples and the chimneystalksall were crowded with human beings whose eager upturned faces were rendered intensely bright against the surrounding darkness by the fierce glare of the fire  but the thames presented the most singular appearance of allnow reflecting on its bosom the inky black clouds of smoke anon the red flames as fresh fuel was licked up by the devouring element and occasionally sheets of silver light that flashed through the chaos when sulphur and saltpetre explosions occurred  mountains of flame frequently burst away from the mass of burning buildings and floated upward for a few moments and the tallow and tar which flowed out of the warehouses floated away blazing with the tide and set the shipping on fire so that land and water alike seemed to be involved in one huge terrific conflagration  the utmost consternation prevailed on board the numerous craft on the river in the vicinity of the fire for thick showers of sparks and burning materials fell incessantly  gusts of wind acted on the ruins now and then and at such moments the gaunt walls cracked and riven out of shape stood up glowing with intense white heat in the midst of a sea of fire from which red flames and dark clouds of smoke were vomited as from the crater of some mighty volcano with a roar that mingled with the shouts of excited thousands and drowned even the dull incessant thumpings of the engines that worked in all directions  moored alongside of chamberlains wharf was a small sloop  little blue blisters of light broke out on her rigging soon these increased in size and in a few minutes she was on fire from stem to stern immediately after there came a barge with flowing sails borne on the rising tide  she passed too near to the conflagration  her crew of three men became panicstricken and lost control of her  at sight of this a great shout was raised and a boat put off and rescued the crew but almost before they were landed their barge was alight from stem to stern  the tremendous cheer that burst from the excited multitude at sight of this rescue rose for a moment above the roaring of the conflagration  then another barge was set on fire by the blazing tallow which floated out to her but she was saved by being scuttled  in the midst of such a scene it was to be expected that there would be damage to life and limb  the firemen besides being exposed to intense heat for hours were almost blinded and choked by the smoke emitted from the burning peppermore especially the cayenneof which there was a large quantity in the warehouses  some of the men who were working the engines fell into the river and were drowned  a gentleman who was assisting the firemen had his hand impaled on an iron spike  a poor irishman had his neck broken by the chain of the floatingengine and several of the police force and others were carried to hospital badly burned and otherwise injured  some of the casualties occurred in places where only a few persons were there to witness them but others were enacted on the river and on spots which were in full view of the vast multitudes on london bridge a boat containing five men put off to collect the tallow which floated on the water but it got surrounded by tallow which had caught fire and the whole of its occupants were either burned to death or drowned later in the night a small skiff rowed by a single man was drawn by the tide into the vortex of the fire  another boat ran out and saved the man but a second boat which was pulled off by a single rower for the same purpose was drawn too near the fire and its brave occupant perished  so eager were the multitude on the bridge to witness these scenes that some of themselves were forced over the parapet into the river and drowned  comical incidents were strangely mingled with these awful scenes although it is but justice to say the prevailing tone of the crowd was one of solemnity  itinerant vendors of gingerbeer fruit cakes and coffee ranged themselves along the pavements and carried on a brisk tradeespecially after the publichouses were closed many of which however taking advantage of the occasion kept open door all night  among these last was the angel belonging to gorman  that worthy was peculiarly active on this occasion  he never neglected an opportunity of turning an honest penny and accordingly had been engaged from an early hour in his boat collecting tallow of which plunder a considerable amount had been already conveyed to his abode  besides gorman several of the other personages of our tale found their way to the great centre of attraction london bridge on that night among them was john barret who on hearing of the fire had left his snug little villa and pretty little wife to witness it  he had already made one or two cheap trips on one of the omnibuses and about midnight got down and forced his way to a position near the south side of the bridge  here he was attracted to a gingerbeer barrow which an unusually adventurous man had pushed through the crowd into a sheltered corner  he forced his way to it and to his amazement found the owner to be his former friend ned hooper  hallo  barret  why ned were the exclamations that burst simultaneously from their lips  this is a strange occupation said barret with a smile  ah it may seem strange to you no doubt but its familiar enough to me replied ned with a grin  the demand for beer was so great at this time that ned could not continue the conversation  here boy he said to an urchin who stood near you draw corks as fast as you can and pour out the beer and ill give you a copper or two and a swig into the bargain  the boy accepted the post of salesman with alacrity and ned turned to his friend and seized his hand  barret said he in a low earnest voice if i succeed in holding out i own my salvation under god to you  ive tasted nothing but gingerbeer for many a long day and i really believe that i have got my enemy down at last  its not a lucrative business as you may see he added with a sad smile glancing at his threadbare garments nor a very aristocratic one  my dear ned cried barret interrupting and suddenly thrusting his hand into his pocket  no barret no said ned firmly as he laid his hand on the others arm i dont want money ive given up begging  you gave me your advice once and i have taken thatit has been of more value to me than all the wealth that is being melted into thin air john by yonder fire  ned was interrupted at this point by a burst of laughter from the crowd the cause of their mirth was the appearance of a tall thin and very lugubriouslooking man who had come on the bridge to see the fire  he had got so excited that he had almost fallen over the parapet and a policeman had kindly offered to escort him to a place of safety  why what dye meanwhat dye take me for cried the tall man angrily im an honest man my name is david boone ive only come to see the fire youve no occasion to lay hold o me  i know that said the policeman i only want to get you out of danger  come along now  just then a thickset man with a red handkerchief tied round his head came forward to the stall and demanded a glass of beer  the moment his eyes encountered those of boone he became pale as death and staggered back as if he had received a deadly blow  is that you gorman cried david in a voice and with an expression of amazement  gorman did not reply but gazed at his former friend with a look of intense horror while his chest heaved and he breathed laboriously suddenly he uttered a loud cry and rushed towards the river  part of the crowd sprang after him as if with a view to arrest him or to see what he meant to do  in the rush barret and boone were carried away  a few moments later a deep murmur of surprise rose from the thousands of spectators on the bridge for a boat was seen to dash suddenly from the shore and sweep out on the river  it was propelled by a single rowera man with a red kerchief tied round his head  the murmur of the crowd suddenly increased to a shout of alarm for the man was rowing his boat straight towards a mass of tallow which floated and burned on the water  hold on  lookout ahead shouted several voices while others screamed too late  hes gone and then there arose a wild cry for the man rowed straight into the centre of the burning mass and was enveloped in the flames  for one moment he was seen to rise and swing his arms in the airthen he fell backwards over the gunwale of his boat and disappeared in the blazing flood  fiercer and fiercer raged the fire  the night passedthe day came and went and night again set inyet still the flames leaped and roared in resistless fury and still the firemen fought them valiantly  and thus they fought day and night hand to hand for more than a fortnight before the battle was thoroughly ended and the victory gained  how the firemen continued to do their desperate work day and night almost without rest it is impossible to tell  frank willders said that after the first night he went about his work like a man in a dream  he scarcely knew when or how or where he rested or ate  he had an indistinct remembrance of one or two brief intervals of oblivion when he supposed he must have been asleep but the only memory that remained strong and clear within him was that of constant determined fighting with the flames  and willie willders followed him like his shadow clad in a coat and helmet borrowed from a friend in the salvage corps  willie fought in that great fight as if he had been a trained fireman  on the fourth day towards evening frank was ordered down into a cellar where some tarbarrels were burning  he seized the branch and was about to leap down the stair when dale stopped him  fasten the rope to your belt he said  frank obeyed without speaking and then sprang forward while dale himself followed ordering corney baxmore and one or two others to hold on to the ropes  willie willders also ran in but was met by such a dense cloud of smoke that he was almost choked  rushing back he shouted haul on the ropes  the men were already hauling them in and in a few seconds dale and frank were dragged by their waistbelts into the open air the former nearly and the latter quite insensible  in a few minutes they both recovered and another attempt was made to reach the fire in the cellar but without success  the public did not witness this incident  the firemen were almost surrounded by burning ruins and none but comrades were there  indeed the public seldom see the greatest dangers to which the fireman is exposed  it is not when he makes his appearance on some giddy height on a burning and tottering house and is cheered enthusiastically by the crowd that his courage is most severely tried  it is when he has to creep on hands and knees through dense smoke and hold the branch in the face of withering heat while beams are cracking over his head and burning rubbish is dropping around and threatening to overwhelm himit is in such circumstances when the public know nothing of what is going on and when no eye sees him save that of the solitary comrade who shares his toil and danger that the firemans nerve and endurance are tested to the uttermost  after leaving the cellar dale and his men went to attempt to check the fire in a quarter where it threatened to spread and render thisthe greatest of modern conflagrationsequal to the great one of 1666  we might reach it from that window said dale to frank pointing to a house the sides of which were already blistering and the glass cracking with heat  frank seized the branch and gained the window in question but could not do anything very effective from that point  he thought however that from a window in an adjoining store he might play directly on a house which was in imminent danger  but the only means of reaching it was by passing over a charred beam thirty feet beneath which lay a mass of smouldering ruins  for one moment he hesitated uncertain whether or not the beam would sustain his weight  but the point to be gained was one of great importance so he stepped boldly forward carrying the branch with him  as he advanced the light of the fire fell brightly upon him revealing his tall figure clearly to the crowd which cheered him heartily  at that moment the beam gave way  willie who was about to follow had barely time to spring back and gain a firm footing when he beheld his brother fall headlong into the smoking ruins below  in another moment he had leaped down the staircase and was at franks side  baxmore dale corney and others followed and in the midst of fire and smoke they raised their comrade in their arms and bore him to a place of safety  no one spoke but a stretcher was quickly brought and frank was conveyed in a state of insensibility to the nearest hospital where his manly formshattered burned and laceratedwas laid on a bed  he breathed although he was unconscious and evinced no sign of feeling when the surgeons examined his wounds  a messenger was despatched for mrs willders and willie remained to watch beside him while his comrades went out to continue the fight    chapter thirty three  the last  for many months frank willders lay upon his bed unable to move and scarcely able to speak  his left leg and arm had been broken his face and hands were burned and cut and his once stalwart form was reduced to a mere wreck  during that long and weary time of suffering he had two nurses who never left himwho relieved each other day and night smoothed his pillow and read to him words of comfort from gods blessed book  these were his own mother and emma ward  for many weeks his life seemed to waver in the balance but at last he began to mend  his frame however had been so shattered that the doctors held out little hope of his ever being anything better than a helpless cripple so one day he said to emma  i have been thinking emma of our engagement  he paused and spoke sadlyas if with great difficulty  and i have made up my mind he continued to release you  frank exclaimed emma  yes dear  no one can possibly understand what it costs me to say this but it would be the worst kind of selfishness were i to ask you to marry a poor wretched cripple like me  but what if i refuse to be released frank said emma with a smile you may indeed be a cripple but you shall not be a wretched one if it is in my power to make you happy and as to your being poorwhat of that  i knew you were not rich when i accepted you and you know i have a very very small fortune of my own which will at least enable us to exist until you are able to work again  frank looked at her in surprise for he had not used the word poor with reference to money  has mother then not told you anything about my circumstances of late he asked  no nothing what could she tell me that i do not already know said emma  frank made no reply for a few moments then he said with a sad yet gratified smile  so you refuse to be released  yes frank unless you insist on it replied emma  again the invalid relapsed into silence and shut his eyes  gradually he fell into a quiet slumber from which about two hours later he awoke with a start under the impression that he had omitted to say something looking up he found that his mother had taken emmas place  he at once asked why she had not told emma about the change in his fortunes  because i thought it best said mrs willders to leave you to tell her yourself frank  well mother i depute you to tell her now and pray do it without delay  i offered to give her up a short time ago but she refused to listen to me  im glad to hear it replied the widow with a smile  i always thought her a good sensible girl  hm so did i said frank and something more  once again he became silent and as an inevitable consequence fell fast asleep  in which satisfactory state we will leave him while we run briefly over the events of his subsequent history  in direct opposition to the opinion of all his doctors frank not only recovered the use of all his limbs but became as well and strong as everand the great fire in tooley street left no worse marks upon him than a few honourable scars  his recovery however was tedious  the state of his health coupled with the state of his fortune rendered it advisable that he should seek the benefit of country air so he resigned his situation in the london fire brigaderesigned it we may add with deep regret for some of his happiest days had been spent in connection with that gallant corps  rambling and fishing among the glorious mountains of wales with his brother willie he speedily regained health and strength  while wandering with delight through one of the most picturesque scenes of that wild and beautiful region he came suddenly one day on a large white umbrella under which sat a romanticlooking man something between an italian bandit and an english sportsman who was deeply engrossed with a sheet of paper on which he was depicting one of the grandest views in the splendid pass of llanberis  at this man willie rushed with a shout of surprise and found that he answered at once to the name of fred auberly  fred was thrown into such a state of delight at the sight of his old friends that he capsized the white umbrella packed up his paints and accompanied them to their inn  here on being questioned he related how that while in rome he had been seized with a fever which laid him prostrate for many weeks that on his recovery he wrote to loo and his father but received no reply from either of them that he afterwards spent some months in switzerland making more than enough of money with his brush to keep the pot boiling and that finally he returned home to find that dear loo was dead and that the great tooley street fire had swept away his fathers premises and ruined him  as this blow had however been the means of softening his father and effecting a reconciliation between them he was rather glad than otherwise he said that the fire had taken place  fred did not say although he might have said it with truththat stiff and stately mr auberly had been reduced almost to beggary and that he was now dependent for a livelihood on the very palette and brushes which once he had so ruthlessly condemned to the flames  after this trip to wales frank returned home and told his mother abruptly that he meant to marry emma ward without delay to which mrs willders replied that she thought he was quite right  as emma appeared to be of the same mind the marriage took place in due course  that is to say miss tippet and emma managed to put it off as long as possible and to create as much delay as they could  when they had not the shadow of an excuse for further delaynot so much as a forgotten band or an omitted hook of the voluminous trousseauthe great event was allowed to go onor to come off  many and varied were the faces that appeared at the church on that auspicious occasion  mr auberly was there to give away the bride and wonderfully cheerful he looked too considering that he gave her to the man whom he once thought so very unworthy of her  willie was groomsman of course and among the bridesmaids there was a little graceful darkeyed and darkhaired creature whom he regarded as an angel or a fairy or something of that sort and whom everybody else except frank and mrs willders thought the most beautiful girl in the church  in the front gallery just above this darkeyed girl sat an elderly man who gazed at her with an expression of intense affection  his countenance was careworn and had a somewhat dissipated look upon it yet there was a healthy glow on it too as if the dissipation were a thing of the distant past  the darkeyed girl once or twice stole a glance at the elderly man and smiled on him with a look of affection quite as fervent as his own  there was a rather stylish youth at this mans elbow whose muscles were so highly developed that they appeared about to burst his superfine black coat  he was observed to nod familiarly to the darkeyed girl more than once and appeared to be in a state of considerable excitementready as it were to throw a somersault over the gallery on the slightest provocation  of course miss tippet was there in such a love of a bonnet looking the picture of happiness  so was mr tippet beaming all over with joy so was miss deemas scowling hatred and defiance at the men  so was david boone whose circumstances had evidently improved if one might judge from the selfsatisfied expression of his face and the splendour of his attire  john barret was also there and close beside him stood ned hooper who appeared to shrink modestly from observation owing perhaps to his coat being a little threadbare  but ned had no occasion to be ashamed of himself for his face and appearance showed clearly that he had indeed been enabled to resist temptation and that he had risen to a higher position in the social scale than a vendor of gingerbeer  in the background might have been seen hopkinstall and dignified as ever with matty merryon at his side  it was rumoured belowstairs that these two were engaged but as the engagement has not yet advanced to anything more satisfactory we hold that to be a private matter with which we have no right to meddle  close to these stood a group of stalwart men in blue coats and leathern belts and with sailorlike caps in their hands  these men appeared to take a lively interest in what was going forward and evidently found it difficult to restrain a cheer when frank took emmas hand  once or twice during the service one or two other men of similar appearance looked into the church as if in haste nodded to their comrades and went out again while one of them appeared in the organ loft with a helmet hanging on his arm and his visage begrimed with charcoal as if he were returning from a recent fire  this man feeling no doubt that he was not very presentable evidently wished to see without being seen he was very tall and stout and was overheard to observe in very irish tones that it was a purty sight intirely  when the carriage afterwards started from the door this manwho bore a strong resemblance to joe corneysprang forward and called for three cheers which call was responded to heartily by all but especially by the bluecoated and belted fellows with sailorlike caps who cheered their old comrade and his blooming bride with those deep and thrilling tones which can be produced in perfection only by the lungs and throats of trueblue british tars  now it must not be supposed that this was the end of franks career in truth it was only the beginning of it for frank willders was one of those men who know how to make a good use of money  his first proceeding after the honeymoon was to take a small farm in the suburbs of london  he had a tendency for farming and he resolved at least to play at it if he could make nothing by it  there was a small cottage on the farm not far from the dwellinghouse  this was rented by willie and into it he afterwards introduced ziza cattley as mrs william willders  the widow inhabited another small cottage not a hundred yards distant from it but she saw little of her own home except at night being constrained to spend most of her days with one or other of her boys  as the farm was near a railway station willie went to town every morning to businesssaturdays and sundays exceptedand returned every evening  his business prospered and so did mr tippets  that eccentric old gentleman had like mr auberly been ruined by the great fire but he did not careso he saidbecause the other business kept him going  he was not aware that willies engineering powers turned in all the money of that other business and willie took care never to enlighten him but helped him as of old in planning inventing and discovering to the end of his days  there was one grand feature which frank introduced into his suburban establishment which we must not omit to mention  this was a new patent steam fireengine  he got it not only for the protection of his own farm but being a philanthropic man for the benefit of the surrounding district and he trained the men of his farm and made them expert firemen  willie was placed in command of this engine so that the great wish of his early years was realised  there was not a fire within ten miles round them at which willies engine was not present and the brothers continued for many years to fight the flames together in that neighbourhood  as for stout george dale and sturdy baxmore and facetious joe corney with his comrades moxey williams and mason and sam forest those heroes continued to go on the even tenor of their way fighting more battles with the flames in six months than were fought with our human enemies by all our redcoats and bluejackets in as many years and without making any fuss about it too although danger was the element in which they lived and wounds or death might have met them any day of the year  for all we know to the contrary they may be carrying on the war while we pen this chronicle and unless more vigorous measures are adopted for preventing fire than have been taken in time past there can be no question that these stouthearted men will in time to come have more occasion than ever forfighting the flames  the end
