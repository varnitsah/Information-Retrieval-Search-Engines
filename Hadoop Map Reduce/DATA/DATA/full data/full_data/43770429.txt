43770429	the man of the forest  by zane grey   harper and brothers  new york  1920  published 1919     chapter i  at sunset hour the forest was still lonely sweet with tang of fir and spruce blazing in gold and red and green and the man who glided on under the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and disappearing to have become a part of the wild woodland  old baldy highest of the white mountains stood up round and bare rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun then as the fire dropped behind the domed peak a change a cold and darkening blight passed down the black spearpointed slopes over all that mountain world  it was a wild richly timbered and abundantly watered region of dark forests and grassy parks ten thousand feet above sealevel isolated on all sides by the southern arizona desertthe virgin home of elk and deer of bear and lion of wolf and fox and the birthplace as well as the hidingplace of the fierce apache  september in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze following shortly after sundown twilight appeared to come on its wings as did faint sounds not distinguishable before in the stillness  milt dale man of the forest halted at the edge of a timbered ridge to listen and to watch beneath him lay a narrow valley open and grassy from which rose a faint murmur of running water its music was pierced by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote from overhead in the giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the night and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild turkeys going to roost  to dales keen ear these sounds were all they should have been betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland he was glad for he had expected to hear the clipclop of white mens horseswhich to hear up in those fastnesses was hateful to him he and the indian were friends that fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter but there hid somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men sheepthieves whom dale did not want to meet  as he started out upon the slope a sudden flaring of the afterglow of sunset flooded down from old baldy filling the valley with lights and shadows yellow and blue like the radiance of the sky the pools in the curves of the brook shone darkly bright dales gaze swept up and down the valley and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook where the wall of spruce stood up its speared and spiked crest against the pale clouds the wind began to moan in the trees and there was a feeling of rain in the air dale striking a trail turned his back to the fading afterglow and strode down the valley  with night at hand and a rainstorm brewing he did not head for his own camp some miles distant but directed his steps toward an old log cabin when he reached it darkness had almost set in he approached with caution this cabin like the few others scattered in the valleys might harbor indians or a bear or a panther nothing however appeared to be there then dale studied the clouds driving across the sky and he felt the cool dampness of a fine misty rain on his face it would rain off and on during the night whereupon he entered the cabin  and the next moment he heard quick hoofbeats of trotting horses peering out he saw dim moving forms in the darkness quite close at hand they had approached against the wind so that sound had been deadened five horses with riders dale made outsaw them loom close then he heard rough voices quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a ladder he knew led to a loft and finding it he quickly mounted taking care not to make a noise with his rifle and lay down upon the floor of brush and poles scarcely had he done so when heavy steps with accompaniment of clinking spurs passed through the door below into the cabin  wal beasley are you here queried a loud voice  there was no reply the man below growled under his breath and again the spurs jingled  fellars beasley aint here yet he called put the hosses under the shed well wait  wait huh came a harsh reply mebbe all nightan we got nuthin to eat  shut up moze reckon youre no good for anythin but eatin put them hosses away an some of you rustle firewood in here  low muttered curses then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain of leather and heaves of tired horses  another shuffling clinking footstep entered the cabin  snake itd been sense to fetch a pack along drawled this newcomer  reckon so jim but we didnt an whats the use hollerin beasley wont keep us waitin long  dale lying still and prone felt a slow start in all his blooda thrilling wave that deepvoiced man below was snake anson the worst and most dangerous character of the region and the others undoubtedly composed his gang long notorious in that sparsely settled country and the beasley mentionedhe was one of the two biggest ranchers and sheepraisers of the white mountain ranges what was the meaning of a rendezvous between snake anson and beasley milt dale answered that question to beasleys discredit and many strange matters pertaining to sheep and herders always a mystery to the little village of pine now became as clear as daylight  other men entered the cabin  it aint agoin to rain much said one then came a crash of wood thrown to the ground  jim hyars a chunk of pine log dry as punk said another  rustlings and slow footsteps and then heavy thuds attested to the probability that jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured  snake lemme your pipe an ill hev a fire in a jiffy  wal i want my terbacco an i aint carin about no fire replied snake  reckon youre the meanest cuss in these woods drawled jim  sharp click of steel on flintmany timesand then a sound of hard blowing and sputtering told of jims efforts to start a fire presently the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed there came a little crackling of wood and the rustle of flame and then a steady growing roar  as it chanced dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft and right near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs when the fire blazed up he was fairly well able to see the men below the only one he had ever seen was jim wilson who had been well known at pine before snake anson had ever been heard of jim was the best of a bad lot and he had friends among the honest people it was rumored that he and snake did not pull well together  fire feels good said the burly moze who appeared as broad as he was blackvisaged falls sure acomin now if only we had some grub  moze theres a hunk of deer meat in my saddlebag an if you git it you can have half spoke up another voice  moze shuffled out with alacrity  in the firelight snake ansons face looked lean and serpentlike his eyes glittered and his long neck and all of his long length carried out the analogy of his name  snake whats this here deal with beasley inquired jim  reckon youll larn when i do replied the leader he appeared tired and thoughtful  aint we done away with enough of them poor greaser herdersfor nothin queried the youngest of the gang a boy in years whose hard bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades  youre dead right burtan thats my stand replied the man who had sent moze out snake snow ll be flyin round these woods before long said jim wilson are we goin to winter down in the tonto basin or over on the gila  reckon well do some tall ridin before we strike south replied snake gruffly  at the juncture moze returned  boss i heerd a hoss comin up the trail he said  snake rose and stood at the door listening outside the wind moaned fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin  ahuh exclaimed snake in relief  silence ensued then for a moment at the end of which interval dale heard a rapid clipclop on the rocky trail outside the men below shuffled uneasily but none of them spoke the fire cracked cheerily snake anson stepped back from before the door with an action that expressed both doubt and caution  the trotting horse had halted out there somewhere  ho there inside called a voice from the darkness  ho yourself replied anson  that you snake quickly followed the query  reckon so returned anson showing himself  the newcomer entered he was a large man wearing a slicker that shone wet in the firelight his sombrero pulled well down shadowed his face so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked he had a black drooping mustache and a chin like a rock a potential force matured and powerful seemed to be wrapped in his movements  hullo snake hullo wilson he said ive backed out on the other deal sent for you onon another little matter particular private  here he indicated with a significant gesture that snakes men were to leave the cabin  ahuh ejaculated anson dubiously then he turned abruptly moze you an shady an burt go wait outside reckon this aint the deal i expected an you can saddle the hosses  the three members of the gang filed out all glancing keenly at the stranger who had moved back into the shadow  all right now beasley said anson lowvoiced whats your game jim here is in on my deals  then beasley came forward to the fire stretching his hands to the blaze  nothin to do with sheep replied he  wal i reckoned not assented the other an saywhatever your game is i aint likin the way you kept me waitin an ridin around we waited near all day at big spring then thet greaser rode up an sent us here were a long way from camp with no grub an no blankets  i wont keep you long said beasley but even if i did youd not mindwhen i tell you this deal concerns al auchinclossthe man who made an outlaw of you  ansons sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame wilson likewise bent forward eagerly beasley glanced at the doorthen began to whisper  old auchincloss is on his last legs hes goin to croak hes sent back to missouri for a niecea young girlan he means to leave his ranches an sheepall his stock to her seems he has no one else them ranchesan all them sheep an hosses you know me an al were pardners in sheepraisin for years he swore i cheated him an he threw me out an all these years ive been swearin he did me dirtowed me sheep an money ive got as many friends in pinean all the way down the trailas auchincloss has an snake see here  he paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the blaze anson leaned forward like a serpent ready to strike and jim wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand  see here panted beasley the girls due to arrive at magdalena on the sixteenth thats a week from tomorrow shell take the stage to snowdrop where some of auchinclosss men will meet her with a team  ahuh grunted anson as beasley halted again an

when i last seen him beasley in case i play your gamehowm i to know that girl  her names helen rayner replied beasley eagerly shes twenty years old all of them auchinclosses was handsome an they say

his breath  youve said it  wal i aint fancyin the girl end of this deal but you can count on me september sixteenth at magdalenaan her names helenan shes handsome  yes my herders will begin drivin south in about two weeks later if the weather holds good send me word by one of them an ill meet you  beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze pulled on his gloves and pulled down his sombrero and with an abrupt word of parting strode out into the night  jim what do you make of him queried snake anson  pard hes got us beat two ways for sunday replied wilson  ahuh wal lets get back to camp and he led the way out  low voices drifted into the cabin then came snorts of horses and striking hoofs and after that a steady trot gradually ceasing once more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest stillness    chapter ii  milt dale quietly sat up to gaze with thoughtful eyes into the gloom  he was thirty years old as a boy of fourteen he had run off from his school and home in iowa and joining a wagontrain of pioneers he was one of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the white mountains but he had not taken kindly to farming or sheepraising or monotonous home toil and for twelve years he had lived in the forest with only infrequent visits to pine and show down and snowdrop this wandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for the villagers for he did care and he was welcome everywhere but that he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive instinctive force of a savage  and on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a friend  that man beasley he soliloquized beasleyin cahoots with snake anson well he was right al auchincloss is on his last legs poor old man when i tell him hell never believe me thats sure  discovery of the plot meant to dale that he must hurry down to pine  a girlhelen raynertwenty years old he mused beasley wants her made off with that meansworse than killed  dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore bad men worked their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer he had shot wolves for that trick with men good or bad he had not clashed old women and children appealed to him but he had never had any interest in girls the image then of this helen rayner came strangely to dale and he suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent beasley not to befriend old al auchincloss but for the sake of the girl probably she was already on her way west alone eager hopeful of a future home how little people guessed what awaited them at a journeys end many trails ended abruptly in the forestand only trained woodsmen could read the tragedy  strange how i cut across country today from spruce swamp reflected dale circumstances movements usually were not strange to him his methods and habits were seldom changed by chance the matter then of his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason and of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl was indeed an adventure to provoke thought it provoked more for dale grew conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins he who had little to do with the strife of men and nothing to do with anger felt his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl  old al wont listen to me pondered dale an even if he did he wouldnt believe me maybe nobody will all the same snake anson wont get that girl  with these last words dale satisfied himself of his own position and his pondering ceased taking his rifle he descended from the loft and peered out of the door the night had grown darker windier cooler broken clouds were scudding across the sky only a few stars showed fine rain was blowing from the northwest and the forest seemed full of a low dull roar  reckon id better hang up here he said and turned to the fire the coals were red now from the depths of his huntingcoat he procured a little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat these strips he laid for a moment on the hot embers until they began to sizzle and curl then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter grateful for little  he sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing glowing golden embers outside the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased to a roar dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him drowsily lulling and he heard the stormwind in the trees now like a waterfall and anon like a retreating army and again low and sad and he saw pictures in the glowing embers strange as dreams  presently he rose and climbing to the loft he stretched himself out and soon fell asleep   when the gray dawn broke he was on his way crosscountry to the village of pine  during the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased a suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places all was graythe parks the gladesand deeper darker gray marked the aisles of the forest shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent with spectral forms then the east kindled the gray lightened the dreaming woodland awoke to the farreaching rays of a bursting red sun  this was always the happiest moment of dales lonely days as sunset was his saddest he responded and there was something in his blood that answered the whistle of a stag from a nearby ridge his strides were long noiseless and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the dewladen grass  dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest climbing but the senacasthose parklike meadows so named by mexican sheepherderswere as round and level as if they had been made by man in beautiful contrast to the darkgreen rough and rugged ridges both open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance of game the cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the spruces a round black lumbering object a twittering in the brush and stealthy steps were all easy signs for dale to read once as he noiselessly emerged into a little glade he espied a red fox stalking some quarry which as he advanced proved to be a flock of partridges they whirred up brushing the branches and the fox trotted away in every senaca dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the high grass  it had always been his custom on his visits to pine to kill and pack fresh meat down to several old friends who were glad to give him lodging and hurried though he was now he did not intend to make an exception of this trip  at length he got down into the pine belt where the great gnarled yellow trees soared aloft stately and aloof from one another and the ground was a brown odorous springy mat of pineneedles level as a floor squirrels watched him from all around scurrying away at his near approachtiny brown lightstriped squirrels and larger ones russetcolored and the splendid darkgrays with their white bushy tails and plumed ears  this belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide gray rolling open land almost like a prairie with foothills lifting near and far and the redgold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun here dale flushed a flock of wild turkeys upward of forty in number and their subdued color of gray flecked with white and graceful sleek build showed them to be hens there was not a gobbler in the flock they began to run pellmell out into the grass until only their heads appeared bobbing along and finally disappeared dale caught a glimpse of skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys and as they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the hindmost his bullet struck low as he had meant it to but too low and the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pineneedles thrown up into his face this frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt into a tree rolled over gained his feet and then the cover of the forest dale was amused at this his hand was against all the predatory beasts of the forest though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the gentle beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed but some he loved better than others and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty  he crossed the wide grassy plain and struck another gradual descent where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm sunlighted glades bordered along a sparkling brook here he heard a turkey gobble and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching silent detour around a clump of aspens in a sunny patch of grass a dozen or more big gobblers stood all suspiciously facing in his direction heads erect with that wild aspect peculiar to their species old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk dale shot two of them the others began to run like ostriches thudding over the ground spreading their wings and with that running start launched their heavy bodies into whirring flight they flew low at about the height of a man from the grass and vanished in the woods  dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way soon he came to a break in the forest level from which he gazed down a leaguelong slope of pine and cedar out upon the bare glistening desert stretching away endlessly rolling out to the dim dark horizon line  the little hamlet of pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered forest a road running parallel with a darkwatered swiftflowing stream divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue smoke drifted lazily aloft fields of corn and fields of oats yellow in the sunlight surrounded the village and green pastures dotted with horses and cattle reached away to the denser woodland this site appeared to be a natural clearing for there was no evidence of cut timber the scene was rather too wild to be pastoral but it was serene tranquil giving the impression of a remote community prosperous and happy drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives  dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden bordered with sunflowers his call was answered by an old woman gray and bent but remarkably spry who appeared at the door  why lands sakes if it aint milt dale she exclaimed in welcome  reckon its me mrs cass he replied an ive brought you a turkey  milt youre that good boy who never forgits old widow cass what a gobbler first one ive seen this fall my man tom used to fetch home gobblers like that an mebbe hell come home again sometime  her husband tom cass had gone into the forest years before and had never returned but the old woman always looked for him and never gave up hope  men have been lost in the forest an yet come back replied dale as he had said to her many a time  come right in you air hungry i know now son when last did you eat a fresh egg or a flapjack  you should remember he answered laughing as he followed her into a small clean kitchen  lawsame an thets months ago she replied shaking her gray head milt you should give up that wild lifean marryan have a home  you always tell me that  yes an ill see you do it yet now you set there an pretty soon ill give you thet to eat which ll make your mouth water  whats the news auntie he asked  nary news in this dead place why nobodys been to snowdrop in two weeks sary jones died poor old

i reckon from horsethieves  well thats a blessin weve had some stock stole this summer milt an no mistake  thus while preparing a meal for dale the old woman went on recounting all that had happened in the little village since his last visit dale enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy and it was exceedingly good to sit at her table in his opinion nowhere else could there have been such butter and cream such ham and eggs besides she always had apple pie it seemed at any time he happened in and apple pie was one of dales few regrets while up in the lonely forest  hows old al auchincloss presently inquired dale  poorlypoorly sighed mrs cass but he tramps an rides around same as ever als not long for this world an milt that reminds metheres the biggest news you ever heard  you dont say so exclaimed dale to encourage the excited old woman  al has sent back to saint joe for his niece helen rayner shes to inherit all his property weve heard much of hera purty lass they say now milt dale heres your chance stay out of the woods an go to work you can marry that girl  no chance for me auntie replied dale smiling  the old woman snorted much you know any girl would have you milt dale if youd only throw a kerchief  me an why auntie he queried half amused half thoughtful when he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the ideas of people  why i declare milt you live so in the woods youre like a boy of tenan then sometimes as old as the hills theres no young man to compare with you hereabouts an this girlshell have all the spunk of the auchinclosses  then maybe shed not be such a catch after all replied dale  wal youve no cause to love them thats sure but milt the auchincloss women are always good wives  dear auntie youre dreamin said dale soberly i want no wife im happy in the woods  air you goin to live like an injun all your days milt dale she queried sharply  i hope so  you ought to be ashamed but some lass will change you boy an mebbe itll be this helen rayner i hope an pray so to thet  auntie supposin she did change me shed never change old al he hates me you know  wal i aint so sure milt i met al the other day he inquired for you an said you was wild but he reckoned men like you was good for pioneer settlements lord knows the good turns youve done this village milt old al doesnt approve of your wild life but he never had no hard feelins till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep  auntie i dont believe tom ever killed als sheep declared dale positively  wal al thinks so an many other people replied mrs cass shaking her gray head doubtfully you never swore he didnt an there was them two sheepherders who did swear they seen him  they only saw a cougar an they were so scared they ran  who wouldnt thet big beast is enough to scare any one for lands sakes dont ever fetch him down here again ill never forgit the time you did all the folks an children an hosses in pine broke an run thet day  yes but tom wasnt to blame auntie hes the tamest of my pets didnt he try to put his head on your lap an lick your hand  wal milt i aint gainsayin your cougar pet didnt act better n a lot of people i know fer he did but the looks of him an whats been said was enough for me  an whats all that auntie  they say hes wild when out of your sight an thet hed trail an kill anythin you put him after  i trained him to be just that way  wal leave tom to home up in the woodswhen you visit us  dale finished his hearty meal and listened awhile longer to the old womans talk then taking his rifle and the other turkey he bade her goodby she followed him out  now milt youll come soon again wont youjest to see als niecewholl be here in a week  i reckon ill drop in some day auntie have you seen my friends the mormon boys  no i aint seen them an dont want to she retorted milt dale if any one ever corrals you itll be mormons  dont worry auntie i like those boys they often see me up in the woods an ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh meat  theyre workin for beasley now  is that so rejoined dale with a sudden start an what doin  beasley is gettin so rich hes buildin a fence an didnt have enough help so i hear  beasley gettin rich repeated dale thoughtfully more sheep an horses an cattle than ever i reckon  lawsame why milt beasley aint any idea what he owns yes hes the biggest man in these parts since poor old als took to failin i reckon als health aint none improved by beasleys success theyve bad some bitter quarrels latelyso i hear al aint what he was  dale bade goodby again to his old friend and strode away thoughtful and serious beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent but he would be dangerous to oppose there did not appear much doubt of his driving his way roughshod to the dominance of affairs there in pine dale passing down the road began to meet acquaintances who had hearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings so that his pondering was interrupted for the time being he carried the turkey to another old friend and when he left her house he went on to the village store this was a large log cabin roughly covered with clapboards with a wide plank platform in front and a hitchingrail in the road several horses were standing there and a group of lazy shirtsleeved loungers  ill be doggoned if it aint milt dale exclaimed one  howdy milt old buckskin right down glad to see you greeted another  hello dale you air shore good for sore eyes drawled still another  after a long period of absence dale always experienced a singular warmth of feeling when he met these acquaintances it faded quickly when he got back to the intimacy of his woodland and that was because the people of pine with few exceptionsthough they liked him and greatly admired his outdoor wisdomregarded him as a sort of nonentity because he loved the wild and preferred it to village and range life they had classed him as not one of them some believed him lazy others believed him shiftless others thought him an indian in mind and habits and there were many who called him slowwitted then there was another side to their regard for him which always afforded him goodnatured amusement two of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison another wanted to hunt with him lem harden came out of the store and appealed to dale to recover his stolen horse lems brother wanted a wildrunning mare tracked and brought home jesse lyons wanted a colt broken and broken with patience not violence as was the method of the hardriding boys at pine so one and all they besieged dale with their selfish needs all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures and on the moment there happened by two women whose remarks as they entered the store bore strong testimony to dales personality  if there aint milt dale exclaimed the older of the two how lucky my cows sick an the men are no good doctorin ill jest ask milt over  no one like milt responded the other woman heartily  good day thereyou milt dale called the first speaker when you git away from these lazy men come over  dale never refused a service and that was why his infrequent visits to pine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure  presently beasley strode down the street and when about to enter the store he espied dale  hullo there milt he called cordially as he came forward with extended hand his greeting was sincere but the lightning glance he shot over dale was not born of his pleasure seen in daylight beasley was a big bold bluff man with strong dark features his aggressive presence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy  dale shook hands with him  how are you beasley  aint complainin milt though i got more work than i can rustle reckon you wouldnt take a job bossin my sheepherders  reckon i wouldnt replied dale thanks all the same  whats goin on up in the woods  plenty of turkey an deer lots of bear too the indians have worked back on the south side early this fall but i reckon winter will come late an be mild  good an where re you headin from  crosscountry from my camp replied dale rather evasively  your camp nobody ever found that yet declared beasley gruffly  its up there said dale  reckon youve got that cougar chained in your cabin door queried beasley and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular frame also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes  tom aint chained an i havent no cabin beasley  you mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein hogtied or corralled demanded beasley  sure he does  beats me but then im queer on cougars have had many a cougar trail me at night aint sayin i was scared but i dont care for that brand of varmint milt you goin to stay down awhile  yes ill hang around some  come over to the ranch glad to see you any time some old huntin pards of yours are workin for me  thanks beasley i reckon ill come over  beasley turned away and took a step and then as if with an afterthought he wheeled again  suppose youve heard about old al auchincloss bein near petered out queried beasley a strong ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate from his features dale divined that beasleys next step would be to further his advancement by some word or hint  widow cass was tellin me all the news too bad about old al replied dale  sure is hes done for an im sorrythough als never been square  beasley interrupted dale quickly you cant say that to me al auchincloss always was the whitest an squarest man in this sheep country  beasley gave dale a fleeting dark glance  dale what you think aint goin to influence feelin on this range returned beasley deliberately you live in the woods an  reckon livin in the woods i might thinkan know a whole lot interposed dale just as deliberately the group of men exchanged surprised glances this was milt dale in different aspect and beasley did not conceal a puzzled surprise  about whatnow he asked bluntly  why about whats goin on in pine replied dale  some of the men laughed  shore lots goin onan no mistake put in lem harden  probably the keen beasley had never before considered milt dale as a responsible person certainly never one in any way to cross his trail but on the instant perhaps some instinct was born or he divined an antagonism in dale that was both surprising and perplexing  dale ive differences with al auchinclosshave had them for years said beasley much of what he owns is mine an its goin to come to me now i reckon people will be takin sidessome for me an some for al most are for me where do you stand al auchincloss never had no use for you an besides hes a dyin man are you goin on his side  yes i reckon i am  wal im glad youve declared yourself rejoined beasley shortly and he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any obstacle from his path  milt thets badmakin beasley sore at you said lem harden hes on the way to boss this outfit  hes sure goin to step into als boots said another  thet was white of milt to stick up fer poor old al declared lems brother  dale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road the burden of what he knew about beasley weighed less heavily upon him and the closelipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest he needed to think before undertaking to call upon old al auchincloss and to that end he sought an hours seclusion under the pines    chapter iii  in the afternoon dale having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him by his old friends at pine directed slow steps toward the auchincloss ranch  the flat square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon a little hill half a mile out of the village a home as well as a fort it had been the first structure erected in that region and the process of building had more than once been interrupted by indian attacks the apaches had for some time however confined their fierce raids to points south of the white mountain range auchinclosss house looked down upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes and hundreds of acres of wellcultivated soil fields of oats waved gray and yellow in the afternoon sun an immense green pasture was divided by a willowbordered brook and here were droves of horses and out on the rolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle  the whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of man the brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the village water for the house however came down from the high wooded slope of the mountain and had been brought there by a simple expedient pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end with a deep trough cut in them and they made a shining line down the slope across the valley and up the little hill to the auchincloss home near the house the hollowed halves of logs had been bound together making a crude pipe water ran uphill in this case one of the facts that made the ranch famous as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small boys of pine the two good women who managed auchinclosss large household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into their kitchen with the everflowing stream of clear cold mountain water  as it happened this day dale encountered al auchincloss sitting in the shade of a porch talking to some of his sheepherders and stockmen auchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width of shoulder he had no gray hairs and he did not look old yet there was in his face a certain weariness something that resembled sloping lines of distress dim and pale that told of age and the ebbtide of vitality his features cast in large mold were cleancut and comely and he had frank blue eyes somewhat sad yet still full of spirit  dale had no idea how his visit would be taken and he certainly would not have been surprised to be ordered off the place he had not set foot there for years therefore it was with surprise that he saw auchincloss wave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular expression  howdy al how are you greeted dale easily as he leaned his rifle against the log wall  auchincloss did not rise but he offered his hand  wal milt dale i reckon this is the first time i ever seen you that i couldnt lay you flat on your back replied the rancher his tone was both testy and full of pathos  i

incredulously  sure  wal ill be damned he sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at dale whats got into you milt hev you heard about my niece thets comin an think youll shine up to her  yes al her comin

a woman to fetch you out of the woods but boy this niece of mine helen rayner will stand you on your head i never seen her they say shes jest like her mother an nell auchinclosswhat a girl she was

damn me if i didnt know that cougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes there  the old rancher expected to be laughed at but dale was grave  al i know how you felt he replied as if they were discussing an action of a human being sure id hate to doubt old tom but hes a cougar an the ways of animals are strange anyway al ill make good the loss of your sheep  no you wont rejoined auchincloss quickly well call it off im takin it square of you to make the offer thets enough so forget your worry about work if you had any  theres somethin else al i wanted to say began dale with hesitation an its about beasley  auchincloss started violently and a flame of red shot into his face then he raised a big hand that shook dale saw in a flash how the old mans nerves had gone  dont mentionthetthet

but altheres worse went on dale hurriedly worse your lifes threatenedan your niece helenshes to be  shut upan clear out roared auchincloss waving his huge fists  he seemed on the verge of a collapse as shaking all over he backed into the door a few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful old man  but alim your friend began dale appealingly  friend hey returned the rancher with grim bitter passion then youre the only one milt dale im rich an im a dyin man i trust nobody but you wild hunterif youre my friendprove it go kill thet greaser sheepthief do somethinan then come talk to me  with that he lurched half falling into the house and slammed the door  dale stood there for a blank moment and then taking up his rifle he strode away  toward sunset dale located the camp of his four mormon friends and reached it in time for supper  john roy joe and hal beeman were sons of a pioneer mormon who had settled the little community of snowdrop they were young men in years but hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured only a years difference in age stood between john and roy and between roy and joe and likewise joe and hal when it came to appearance they were difficult to distinguish from one another horsemen sheepherders cattleraisers huntersthey all possessed long wiry powerful frames lean bronzed still faces and the quiet keen eyes of men used to the open  their camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens some three miles from pine and though working for beasley near the village they had ridden to and fro from camp after the habit of seclusion peculiar to their kind  dale and the brothers had much in common and a warm regard had sprang up but their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things pertaining to the forest dale ate supper with them and talked as usual when he met them without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his mind after the meal he helped joe round up the horses hobble them for the night and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines later when the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind and the campfire glowed comfortably dale broached the subject that possessed him  an so youre working for beasley he queried by way of starting conversation  we was drawled john but today bein the end of our month we got our pay an quit beasley sure was sore  whyd you knock off  john essayed no reply and his brothers all had that quiet suppressed look of knowledge under restraint  listen to what i come to tell you then youll talk went on dale and hurriedly he told of beasleys plot to abduct al auchinclosss niece and claim the dying mans property  when dale ended rather breathlessly the mormon boys sat without any show of surprise or feeling john the eldest took up a stick and slowly poked the red embers of the fire making the white sparks fly  now milt whyd you tell us thet he asked guardedly  youre the only friends ive got replied dale it didnt seem safe for me to talk down in the village i thought of you boys right off i aint goin to let snake anson get that girl an i need help so i come to you  beasleys strong around pine an old als weakenin beasley will git the property girl or no girl said john  things dont always turn out as they look but no matter about that the girl deal is what riled me shes to arrive at magdalena on the sixteenth an take stage for snowdrop now what to do if she travels on that stage ill be on it you bet but she oughtnt to be in it at all  boys somehow im goin to save her will you help me i reckon ive been in some tight corners for you sure this s different but are you my friends you know now what beasley is an youre all lost at the hands of snake ansons gang youve got fast hosses eyes for trackin an you can handle a rifle youre the kind of fellows id want in a tight pinch with a bad gang will you stand by me or see me go alone  then john beeman silently and with pale face gave dales hand a powerful grip and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise their eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered around their thin lips  milt mebbe we know what beasley is better n you said john at length he ruined my father hes cheated other mormons we boys have proved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep ansons gang steals an drives the herds to phenix our people wont let us accuse beasley so weve suffered in silence my father always said let some one else say the first word against beasley an youve come to us  roy beeman put a hand on dales shoulder he perhaps was the keenest of the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most he had been oftenest with dale on many a long trail and he was the hardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country  an were goin with you he said in a strong and rolling voice  they resumed their seats before the fire john threw on more wood and with a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up fanned by the wind as twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a roar a pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries  the five young men conversed long and earnestly considering planning rejecting ideas advanced by each dale and roy beeman suggested most of what became acceptable to all hunters of their type resembled explorers in slow and deliberate attention to details what they had to deal with here was a situation of unlimited possibilities the horses and outfit needed a long detour to reach magdalena unobserved the rescue of a strange girl who would no doubt be selfwilled and determined to ride on the stagethe rescue forcible if necessary the fight and the inevitable pursuit the flight into the forest and the safe delivery of the girl to auchincloss  then milt will we go after beasley queried roy beeman significantly  dale was silent and thoughtful  sufficient unto the day said john an fellars lets go to bed  they rolled out their tarpaulins dale sharing roys blankets and soon were asleep while the red embers slowly faded and the great roar of wind died down and the forest stillness set in    chapter iv  helen rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twentyfour hours before she made an alarming discovery  accompanied by her sister bo a precocious girl of sixteen helen had left st joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at home yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life in the far west all her people had the pioneer spirit love of change action adventure was in her blood then duty to a widowed mother with a large and growing family had called to helen to accept this rich uncles offer she had taught school and also her little brothers and sisters she had helped along in other ways and now though the tearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard this opportunity was irresistible in its call the prayer of her dreams had been answered to bring good fortune to her family to take care of this beautiful wild little sister to leave the yellow sordid humdrum towns for the great rolling boundless open to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day to be her own to have fulfilled a deep instinctive and undeveloped love of horses cattle sheep of desert and mountain of trees and brooks and wild flowersall this was the sum of her most passionate longings now in some marvelous fairylike way to come true  a check to her happy anticipations a blank sickening dash of cold water upon her warm and intimate dreams had been the discovery that harve riggs was on the train his presence could mean only one thingthat he had followed her riggs had been the worst of many sore trials back there in st joseph he had possessed some claim or influence upon her mother who favored his offer of marriage to helen he was neither attractive nor good nor industrious nor anything that interested her he was the boastful strutting adventurer not genuinely western and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety helen had suspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his and also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be badas western men were bad but on the train in the station at la junta one glimpse of him manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of her sight warned helen that she now might have a problem on her hands  the recognition sobered her all was not to be a road of roses to this new home in the west riggs would follow her if he could not accompany her and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything helen felt the startling realization of being cast upon her own resources and then a numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness but these feelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her temper opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to it she would not have been al auchinclosss niece if she had faltered and when temper was succeeded by genuine anger she could have laughed to scorn this harve riggs and his schemes whatever they were once and for all she dismissed fear of him when she left st joseph she had faced the west with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of that west homes had to be made out there in that far country so uncle al had written and women were needed to make homes she meant to be one of these women and to make of her sister another and with the thought that she would know definitely what to say to riggs when he approached her sooner or later helen dismissed him from mind  while the train was in motion enabling helen to watch the everchanging scenery and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping bo well in hand at stations she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests and the red rocky gullies and the dim bold mountains she saw the sun set over distant ranges of new mexicoa golden blaze of glory as new to her as the strange fancies born in her thrilling and fleeting by bos raptures were not silent and the instant the sun sank and the color faded she just as rapturously importuned helen to get out the huge basket of food they had brought from home  they had two seats facing each other at the end of the coach and piled there with the basket on top was luggage that constituted all the girls owned in the world indeed it was very much more than they had ever owned before because their mother in her care for them and desire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle had spent money and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes  the girls sat together with the heavy basket on their knees and ate while they gazed out at the cool dark ridges the train clattered slowly on apparently over a road that was all curves and it was suppertime for everybody in that crowded coach if helen had not been so absorbed by the great wild mountainland she would have had more interest in the passengers as it was she saw them and was amused and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car all middleclass people poor and hopeful traveling out there to the new west to find homes it was splendid and beautiful this fact yet it inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness from the train window that world of forest and crag with its long bare reaches between seemed so lonely so wild so unlivable how endless the distance for hours and miles upon miles no house no hut no indian tepee it was amazing the length and breadth of this beautiful land and helen who loved brooks and running streams saw no water at all  then darkness settled down over the slowmoving panorama a cool night wind blew in at the window white stars began to blink out of the blue the sisters with hands clasped and heads nestled together went to sleep under a heavy cloak   early the next morning while the girls were again delving into their apparently bottomless basket the train stopped at las vegas  look look cried bo in thrilling voice cowboys oh nell look  helen laughing looked first at her sister and thought how most of all she was good to look at bo was little instinct with pulsating life and she had chestnut hair and darkblue eyes these eyes were flashing roguish and they drew like magnets  outside on the rude station platform were railroad men mexicans and a group of lounging cowboys long lean bowlegged fellows they were with young frank faces and intent eyes one of them seemed particularly attractive with his superb build his redbronze face and brightred scarf his swinging gun and the huge long curved spurs evidently he caught bos admiring gaze for with a word to his companions he sauntered toward the window where the girls sat his gait was singular almost awkward as if he was not accustomed to walking the long spurs jingled musically he removed his sombrero and stood at ease frank cool smiling helen liked him on sight and looking to see what effect he had upon bo she found that young lady staring frightened stiff  good mawnin drawled the cowboy with slow goodhumored smile now where might youall be travelin  the sound of his voice the cleancut and droll geniality seemed new and delightful to helen  we go to magdalenathen take stage for the white mountains replied helen  the cowboys still intent eyes showed surprise  apache country miss he said i reckon im sorry thets shore no place for youall beggin your pawdinyou aint mormons  no were nieces of al auchincloss rejoined helen  wal you dont say ive been down magdalena way an heerd of al reckon youre goin avisitin  its to be home for us  shore thets fine the west needs girls yes ive heerd of al an old arizona cattleman in a sheep country thets bad now im wonderinif id drift down there an ask him for a job ridin for himwould i get it  his lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal water the gaze he bent upon bo somehow pleased helen the last year or two since bo had grown prettier all the time she had been a magnet for admiring glances this one of the cowboys inspired respect and liking as well as amusement it certainly was not lost upon bo  my uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his ranch replied helen smiling  shore ill go i reckon id jest naturally drift that waynow  he seemed so laconic so easy so nice that he could not have been taken seriously yet helens quick perceptions registered a daring a something that was both sudden and inevitable in him his last word was as clear as the soft look he fixed upon bo  helen had a mischievous trait which subdue it as she would occasionally cropped out and bo who once in her wilful life had been rendered speechless offered such a temptation  maybe my little sister will put in a good word for youto uncle al said helen just then the train jerked and started slowly the cowboy took two long strides beside the car his heated boyish face almost on a level with the window his eyes now shy and a little wistful yet bold too fixed upon bo  goodbysweetheart he called  he haltedwas lost to view  well ejaculated helen contritely half sorry half amused what a sudden young gentleman  bo had blushed beautifully  nell wasnt he glorious she burst out with eyes shining  id hardly call him that but he wasnice replied helen much relieved that bo had apparently not taken offense at her  it appeared plain that bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the window and to wave her hand but she only peeped out manifestly to her disappointment  do you think hehell come to uncle als asked bo  child he was only in fun  nell ill bet you he comes oh itd be great im going to love cowboys they dont look like that harve riggs who ran after you so  helen sighed partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor and partly because bos future already called mysteriously to the child helen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense and wilful spirit  one of the trainmen directed the girls attention to a green sloping mountain rising to a bold blunt bluff of bare rock and calling it starvation peak he told a story of how indians had once driven spaniards up there and starved them bo was intensely interested and thereafter she watched more keenly than ever and always had a question for a passing trainman the adobe houses of the mexicans pleased her and then the train got out into indian country where pueblos appeared near the track and indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild mustangsthen she was enraptured  but these indians are peaceful she exclaimed once regretfully  gracious child you dont want to see hostile indians do you queried helen  i do you bet was the frank rejoinder  well ill bet that ill be sorry i didnt leave you with mother  nellyou never will   they reached albuquerque about noon and this important station where they had to change trains had been the first dreaded anticipation of the journey it certainly was a busy placefull of jabbering mexicans stalking redfaced wickedlooking cowboys lolling indians in the confusion helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness with bo to watch and all that baggage to carry and the other train to find but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped them off the train into the othera service for which helen was very grateful  albuquerques a hard place confided the trainman better stay in the carand dont hang out the windows good luck to you  only a few passengers were in the car and they were mexicans at the forward end this branch train consisted of one passengercoach with a baggagecar attached to a string of freightcars helen told herself somewhat grimly that soon she would know surely whether or not her suspicions of harve riggs had warrant if he was going on to magdalena on that day he must go in this coach presently bo who was not obeying admonitions drew her head out of the window her eyes were wide in amaze her mouth open  nell i saw that man riggs she whispered hes going to get on this train  bo i saw him yesterday replied helen soberly  hes followed youthethe  now bo dont get excited remonstrated helen weve left home now weve got to take things as they come never mind if riggs has followed me ill settle him  oh then you wont speakhave anything to do with him  i wont if i can help it  other passengers boarded the train dusty uncouth ragged men and some hardfeatured poorly clad women marked by toil and several more mexicans with bustle and loud talk they found their several seats  then helen saw harve riggs enter burdened with much luggage he was a man of about medium height of dark flashy appearance cultivating long black mustache and hair his apparel was striking as it consisted of black frockcoat black trousers stuffed in high fancytopped boots an embroidered vest and flowing tie and a black sombrero his belt and gun were prominent it was significant that he excited comment among the other passengers  when he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself and turning abruptly approached the seat occupied by the girls when he reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite took off his sombrero and deliberately looked at helen his eyes were light glinting with hard restless quiver and his mouth was coarse and arrogant helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings and now the difference struck cold upon her heart  hello nell he said surprised to see me  no she replied coldly  ill gamble you are  harve riggs i told you the day before i left home that nothing you could do or say mattered to me  reckon that aint so nell any woman i keep track of has reason to think an you know it  then you followed meout here demanded helen and her voice despite her control quivered with anger  i sure did he replied and there was as much thought of himself in the act as there was of her  why why its uselesshopeless  i swore id have you or nobody else would he replied and here in the passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for a womans love but i reckon id have struck west anyhow sooner or later  youre not going toall the wayto pine faltered helen momentarily weakening  nell ill camp on your trail from now on he declared  then bo sat boltupright with pale face and flashing eyes  harve riggs you leave nell alone she burst out in ringing brave young voice ill tell you whatill betif you follow her and nag her any more my uncle al or some cowboy will run you out of the country  hello pepper replied riggs coolly i see your manners havent improved an youre still wild about cowboys  people dont have good manners withwith  bo hush admonished helen it was difficult to reprove bo just then for that young lady had not the slightest fear of riggs indeed she looked as if she could slap his face and helen realized that however her intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a wild country and whatever her determination to be brave the actual beginning of selfreliance had left her spirit weak she would rise out of that but just now this flashingeyed little sister seemed a protector bo would readily adapt herself to the west helen thought because she was so young primitive elemental  whereupon bo turned her back to riggs and looked out of the window the man laughed then he stood up and leaned over helen  nell im goin wherever you go he said steadily you can take that friendly or not just as it pleases you but if youve got any sense youll not give these people out here a hunch against me i might hurt somebody an wouldnt it be betterto act friends for im goin to look after you whether you like it or not  helen had considered this man an annoyance and later a menace and now she must declare open enmity with him however disgusting the idea that he considered himself a factor in her new life it was the truth he existed he had control over his movements she could not change that she hated the need of thinking so much about him and suddenly with a hot bursting anger she hated the man  youll not look after me ill take care of myself she said and she turned her back upon him she heard him mutter under his breath and slowly move away down the car then bo slipped a hand in hers  never mind nell she whispered you know what old sheriff haines said about harve riggs a fourflush wouldbe gunfighter if he ever strikes a real western town hell get run out of it i just wish my redfaced cowboy had got on this train  helen felt a rush of gladness that she had yielded to bos wild importunities to take her west the spirit which had made bo incorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out in this free country yet helen with all her warmth and gratefulness had to laugh at her sister  your redfaced cowboy why bo you were scared stiff and now you claim him  i certainly could love that fellow replied bo dreamily  child youve been saying that about fellows for a long time and youve never looked twice at any of them yet  he was different nell ill bet he comes to pine  i hope he does i wish he was on this train i liked his looks bo  well nell dear he looked at me first and lastso dont get your hopes up oh the trains starting goodby albukerwhats that awful name nell lets eat dinner im starved  then helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future and what with listening to bos chatter and partaking again of the endless good things to eat in the huge basket and watching the noble mountains she drew once more into happy mood  the valley of the rio grande opened to view wide near at hand in a great graygreen gap between the bare black mountains narrow in the distance where the yellow river wound away glistening under a hot sun bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little mexican children that darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by and she exclaimed her pleasure in the indians and the mustangs and particularly in a group of cowboys riding into town on spirited horses helen saw all bo pointed out but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung longest and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something from her she had never before experienced any feeling like that she had never seen a tenth so far and the sight awoke something strange in her the sun was burning hot as she could tell when she put a hand outside the window and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the train she gathered at once what tremendous factors in the southwest were the sun and the dust and the wind and her realization made her love them it was there the open the wild the beautiful the lonely land and she felt the poignant call of blood in herto seek to strive to find to live one look down that yellow valley endless between its dark iron ramparts had given her understanding of her uncle she must be like him in spirit as it was claimed she resembled him otherwise  at length bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life and with her bright head on the faded cloak she went to sleep but helen kept steady farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain and during the long hours as she watched through clouds of dust and veils of heat some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to change and then to fix it was her physical acceptanceher eyes and her senses taking the west as she had already taken it in spirit  a woman should love her home wherever fate placed her helen believed and not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living how could life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous vastness of bare earth and open sky where the need to achieve made thinking and pondering superficial  it was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the rio grande and then of its paralleled mountain ranges but the miles brought compensation in other valleys other bold black upheavals of rock and then again bare boundless yellow plains and sparsely cedared ridges and white dry washes ghastly in the sunlight and dazzling beds of alkali and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers bloomed  she noted too that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had begun to shade to redand this she knew meant an approach to arizona arizona the wild the lonely the red desert the green plateauarizona with its thundering rivers its unknown spaces its pasturelands and timberlands its wild horses cowboys outlaws wolves and lions and savages as to a boy that name stirred and thrilled and sang to her of nameless sweet intangible things mysterious and all of adventure but she being a girl of twenty who had accepted responsibilities must conceal the depths of her heart and that which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being born a boy  time passed while helen watched and learned and dreamed the train stopped at long intervals at wayside stations where there seemed nothing but adobe sheds and lazy mexicans and dust and heat bo awoke and began to chatter and to dig into the basket she learned from the conductor that magdalena was only two stations on and she was full of conjectures as to who would meet them what would happen so helen was drawn back to sober realities in which there was considerable zest assuredly she did not know what was going to happen twice riggs passed up and down the aisle his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile deliberately forced upon her sight but again helen fought a growing dread with contemptuous scorn this fellow was not half a man it was not conceivable what he could do except annoy her until she arrived at pine her uncle was to meet her or send for her at snowdrop which place helen knew was distant a good long ride by stage from magdalena this stageride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey in helens considerations  oh nell cried bo with delight were nearly there next station the conductor said  i wonder if the stage travels at night said helen thoughtfully  sure it does replied the irrepressible bo  the train though it clattered along as usual seemed to helen to fly there the sun was setting over bleak new mexican bluffs magdalena was at hand and night and adventure helens heart beat fast she watched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed their presence and irrigation ditches and cottonwoodtrees told her that the railroad part of the journey was nearly ended then at bos little scream she looked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low flat redadobe houses the train began to slow down helen saw children run white children and mexican together then more houses and high upon a hill an immense adobe church crude and glaring yet somehow beautiful  helen told bo to put on her bonnet and performing a like office for herself she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers there were bustle and talk in the car  the train stopped helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of mexicans and indians all motionless and stolid as if trains or nothing else mattered next helen saw a white man and that was a relief he stood out in front of the others tall and broad somehow striking he drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in grayfringed buckskin and carrying a rifle    chapter v  here there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their luggage helen bade bo take her share thus burdened they made an awkward and laborious shift to get off the train  upon the platform of the car a strong hand seized helens heavy bag with which she was straining and a loud voice called out  girls were heresure out in the wild an woolly west  the speaker was riggs and he had possessed himself of part of her baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious crowd than to be really kind in the excitement of arriving helen had forgotten him the manner of sudden reminderthe insincerity of itmade her temper flash she almost fell encumbered as she was in her hurry to descend the steps she saw the tall hunter in gray step forward close to her as she reached for the bag riggs held  mr riggs ill carry my bag she said  let me lug this you help bo with hers he replied familiarly  but i want it she rejoined quietly with sharp determination no little force was needed to pull the bag away from riggs  see here helen you aint goin any farther with that joke are you he queried deprecatingly and he still spoke quite loud  its no joke to me replied helen i told you i didnt want your attention  sure but that was temper im your friendfrom your home town an i aint goin to let a quarrel keep me from lookin after you till youre safe at your uncles  helen turned her back upon him the tall hunter had just helped bo off the car then helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing gray eyes  are you helen rayner he asked  yes  my names dale ive come to meet you  ah my uncle sent you added helen in quick relief  no i cant say al sent me began the man but i reckon  he was interrupted by riggs who grasping helen by the arm pulled her back a step  say mister did auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here he demanded arrogantly  dales glance turned from helen to riggs she could not read this quiet gray gaze but it thrilled her  no i come on my own hook he answered  youll understand thentheyre in my charge added riggs  this time the steady lightgray eyes met helens and if there was not a smile in them or behind them she was still further baffled  helen i reckon you said you didnt want this fellows attention  i certainly said that replied helen quickly just then bo slipped close to her and gave her arm a little squeeze probably bos thought was like hershere was a real western man that was her first impression and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased nerves  riggs swaggered closer to dale  say buckskin i hail from texas  youre wastin our time an weve need to hurry interrupted dale his tone seemed friendly an if you ever lived long in texas you wouldnt pester a lady an you sure wouldnt talk like you do  what shouted riggs hotly he dropped his right hand significantly to his hip  dont throw your gun it might go off said dale  whatever riggss intention had beenand it was probably just what dale evidently had read ithe now flushed an angry red and jerked at his gun  dales hand flashed too swiftly for helens eye to follow it but she heard the thud as it struck the gun went flying to the platform and scattered a group of indians and mexicans  youll hurt yourself some day said dale  helen had never heard a slow cool voice like this hunters without excitement or emotion or hurry it yet seemed full and significant of things the words did not mean bo uttered a strange little exultant cry  riggss arm had dropped limp no doubt it was numb he stared and his predominating expression was surprise as the shuffling crowd began to snicker and whisper riggs gave dale a malignant glance shifted it to helen and then lurched away in the direction of his gun  dale did not pay any more attention to him gathering up helens baggage he said come on and shouldered a lane through the gaping crowd the girls followed close at his heels  nell what d i tell you whispered bo oh youre all atremble  helen was aware of her unsteadiness anger and fear and relief in quick succession had left her rather weak once through the motley crowd of loungers she saw an old gray stagecoach and four lean horses a grizzled sunburned man sat on the drivers seat whip and reins in hand beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees another man young tall lean dark stood holding the coach door open he touched his sombrero to the girls his eyes were sharp as he addressed dale  milt wasnt you held up  no but some longhaired galoot was tryin to hold up the girls wanted to throw his gun on me i was sure scared replied dale as he deposited the luggage  bo laughed her eyes resting upon dale were warm and bright the young man at the coach door took a second look at her and then a smile changed the dark hardness of his face  dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage and then placing the lighter luggage in with them he threw the heavier pieces on top  joe climb up he said  wal milt drawled the driver lets ooze along  dale hesitated with his hand on the door he glanced at the crowd now edging close again and then at helen  i reckon i ought to tell you he said and indecision appeared to concern him  what exclaimed helen  bad news but talkin takes time an we mustnt lose any  theres need of hurry queried helen sitting up sharply  i reckon  is this the stage to snowdrop  no that leaves in the mornin we rustled this old trap to get a start tonight  the sooner the better but ii dont understand said helen bewildered  itll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin stage returned dale  safe oh what do you mean exclaimed helen apprehensively she gazed at him and then back at bo  explainin will take time an facts may change your mind but if you cant trust me  trust you interposed helen blankly you mean to take us to snowdrop  i reckon wed better go roundabout an not hit snowdrop he replied shortly  then to pineto my uncleal auchincloss  yes im goin to try hard  helen caught her breath she divined that some peril menaced her she looked steadily with all a womans keenness into this mans face the moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the west had in store for her her future and that of bos were now to be dependent upon her judgments it was a hard moment and though she shivered inwardly she welcomed the initial and inevitable step this man dale by his dress of buckskin must be either scout or hunter his size his action the tone of his voice had been reassuring but helen must decide from what she saw in his face whether or not to trust him and that face was clear bronze unlined unshadowed like a tranquil mask cleancut strongjawed with eyes of wonderful transparent gray  yes ill trust you she said get in and let us hurry then you can explain  all ready bill send em along called dale  he had to stoop to enter the stage and once in he appeared to fill that side upon which he sat then the driver cracked his whip the stage lurched and began to roll the motley crowd was left behind helen awakened to the reality as she saw bo staring with big eyes at the hunter that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began with the rattling roll of that old stagecoach  dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward holding his rifle between his knees the light shone better upon his features now that he was bareheaded helen had never seen a face like that which at first glance appeared darkly bronzed and hard and then became clear cold aloof still intense she wished she might see a smile upon it and now that the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it there was singular force in it but she did not recognize what kind of force one instant she thought it was stern and the next that it was sweet and again that it was neither  im glad youve got your sister he said presently  how did you know shes my sister  i reckon she looks like you  no one else ever thought so replied helen trying to smile  bo had no difficulty in smiling as she said wish i was half as pretty as nell  nell isnt your name helen queried dale  yes but mysome few call me nell  i like nell better than helen an whats yours went on dale looking at bo  mines bo just plain bo isnt it silly but i wasnt asked when they gave it to me she replied  bo its nice an short never heard it before but i havent met many people for years  oh weve left the town cried bo look nell how bare its just like desert  it is desert weve forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a tree  helen glanced out a flat dullgreen expanse waved away from the road on and on to a bright dark horizonline where the sun was setting rayless in a clear sky open desolate and lonely the scene gave her a cold thrill  did your uncle al ever write anythin about a man named beasley asked dale  indeed he did replied helen with a start of surprise beasley that name is familiar to usand detestable my uncle complained of this man for years then he grew bitteraccused beasley but the last year or so not a word  well now began the hunter earnestly lets get the bad news over im sorry you must be worried but you must learn to take the west as it is theres good an bad maybe more bad thats because the countrys young so to come right out with itthis beasley hired a gang of outlaws to meet the stage you was goin in to snowdroptomorrowan to make off with you  make off with me ejaculated helen bewildered  kidnap you which in that gang would be worse than killing you declared dale grimly and he closed a huge fist on his knee  helen was utterly astounded  how horrible she gasped out make off with me what in heavens name for  bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance  for reasons you ought to guess replied dale and he leaned forward again neither his voice nor face changed in the least but yet there was a something about him that fascinated helen im a hunter i live in the woods a few nights ago i happened to be caught out in a storm an i took to an old log cabin soon as i got there i heard horses i hid up in the loft some men rode up an come in it was dark they couldnt see me an they talked it turned out they were snake anson an his gang of sheepthieves they expected to meet beasley there pretty soon he came he told anson how old al your uncle was on his last legshow he had sent for you to have his property when he died beasley swore he had claims on al an he made a deal with anson to get you out of the way he named the day you were to reach magdalena with al dead an you not there beasley could get the property an then he wouldnt care if you did come to claim it it d be too late well they rode away that night an next day i rustled down to pine theyre all my friends at pine except old al but they think im queer i didnt want to confide in many people beasley is strong in pine an for that matter i suspect snake anson has other friends there besides beasley so i went to see your uncle he never had any use for me because he thought i was lazy like an indian old al hates lazy men then we fell outor he fell outbecause he believed a tame lion of mine had killed some of his sheep an now i reckon that tom might have done it i tried to lead up to this deal of beasleys about you but old al wouldnt listen hes crossvery cross an when i tried to tell him why he went right out of his head sent me off the ranch now i reckon you begin to see what a pickle i was in finally i went to four friends i could trust theyre mormon boysbrothers thats joe out on top with the driver i told them all about beasleys deal an asked them to help me so we planned to beat anson an his gang to magdalena it happens that beasley is as strong in magdalena as he is in pine an we had to go careful but the boys had a couple of friends heremormons too who agreed to help us they had this old stage an here you are dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at helen and then at bo  youre perfectly splendid cried bo ringingly she was white her fingers were clenched her eyes blazed  dale appeared startled out of his gravity and surprised then pleased a smile made his face like a boys helen felt her body all rigid yet slightly trembling her hands were cold the horror of this revelation held her speechless but in her heart she echoed bos exclamation of admiration and gratitude  so far then resumed dale with a heavy breath of relief no wonder youre upset ive a blunt way of talkin now weve thirty miles to ride on this snowdrop road before we can turn off today sometime the rest of the boysroy john an halwere to leave show down whichs a town farther on from snowdrop they have my horses an packs besides their own somewhere on the road well meet themtonight maybeor tomorrow i hope not tonight because that d mean ansons gang was ridin in to magdalena  helen wrung her hands helplessly  oh have i no courage she whispered  nell im as scared as you are said bo consolingly embracing her sister  i reckon thats natural said dale as if excusing them but scared or not you both brace up its a bad job but ive done my best an youll be safer with me an the beeman boys than youd be in magdalena or anywhere else except your uncles  mrmr dale faltered helen with her tears falling dont think me a cowardoror ungrateful im neither its only im soso shocked after all we hoped and expectedthisthisis such aa terrible surprise  never mind nell dear lets take what comes murmured bo  thats the talk said dale you see ive come right out with the worst maybe well get through easy when we meet the boys well take to the horses an the trails can you ride  bo has been used to horses all her life and i ride fairly well responded helen the idea of riding quickened her spirit  good we may have some hard ridin before i get you up to pine hello whats that  above the creaking rattling rolling roar of the stage helen heard a rapid beat of hoofs a horse flashed by galloping hard  dale opened the door and peered out the stage rolled to a halt he stepped down and gazed ahead  joe who was that he queried  nary me an bill didnt know him either replied joe i seen him way back he was ridin some an he slowed up goin past us now hes runnin again  dale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances  milt hell never get by roy on this road said joe  maybe hell get by before roy strikes in on the road  it aint likely  helen could not restrain her fears mr dale you think he was a messengergoing ahead to post thatthat anson gang  he might be replied dale simply  then the young man called joe leaned out from the seat above and called miss helen dont you worry thet fellar is more liable to stop lead than anythin else  his words meant to be kind and reassuring were almost as sinister to helen as the menace to her own life long had she known how cheap life was held in the west but she had only known it abstractly and she had never let the fact remain before her consciousness this cheerful young man spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf the thought it roused was tragicfor bloodshed was insupportable to herand then the thrills which followed were so new strange bold and tingling that they were revolting helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths of instincts at which she was amazed and ashamed  joe hand down that basket of grubthe small one with the canteen said dale reaching out a long arm presently he placed a clothcovered basket inside the stage girls eat all you want an then some  we have a basket half full yet replied helen  youll need it all before we get to pine now ill ride up on top with the boys an eat my supper itll be dark presently an well stop often to listen but dont be scared  with that he took his rifle and closing the door clambered up to the drivers seat then the stage lurched again and began to roll along  not the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way bo reached for the basket of food helen simply stared at her  bo you cant eat she exclaimed  i should smile i can replied that practical young lady and youre going to if i have to stuff things in your mouth wheres your wits nell he said we must eat that means our strength is going to have some pretty severe trials gee its all greatjust like a story the unexpectedwhy he looks like a prince turned hunterlong dark stage journeyheld upfightescapewild ride on horseswoods and camps and wild placespursuedhidden in the forestmore hard ridesthen safe at the ranch and of course he falls madly in love with meno you for ill be true to my las vegas lover  hush silly bo tell me arent you scared  scared im scared stiff but if western girls stand such things we can no western girl is going to beat me  that brought helen to a realization of the brave place she had given herself in dreams and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly proud of this little sister  bo thank heaven i brought you with me exclaimed helen fervently ill eat if it chokes me  whereupon she found herself actually hungry and while she ate she glanced out of the stage first from one side and then from the other these windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in the sun had long since sunk out to the west where a bold black horizonline swept away endlessly the sky was clear gold shading to yellow and blue above stars were out pale and wan but growing brighter the earth appeared bare and heaving like a calm sea the wind bore a fragrance new to helen acridly sweet and clean and it was so cold it made her fingers numb  i heard some animal yelp said bo suddenly and she listened with head poised  but helen heard nothing save the steady clipclop of hoofs the clink of chains the creak and rattle of the old stage and occasionally the low voices of the men above  when the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst night had settled down black they pulled the cloaks up over them and close together leaned back in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers helen did not have much to say but bo was talkative  this beats me she said once after an interval where are we nell those men up there are mormons maybe they are abducting us  mr dale isnt a mormon replied helen  how do you know  i could tell by the way he spoke of his friends  well i wish it wasnt so dark im not afraid of men in daylight nell did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow whatd they call him miltmilt dale he said he lived in the woods if i hadnt fallen in love with that cowboy who called mewell id be a goner now  after an interval of silence bo whispered startlingly wonder if harve riggs is following us now  of course he is replied helen hopelessly  hed better look out why nell he never sawhe neverwhat did uncle al used to call itsavsavviedthats it riggs never savvied that hunter but i did you bet  savvied what do you mean bo  i mean that longhaired galoot never saw his real danger but i felt it something went light inside me dale never took him seriously at all  riggs will turn up at uncle als sure as im born said helen  let him turn replied bo contemptuously nell dont you ever bother your head again about him ill bet theyre all men out here and i wouldnt be in harve riggss boots for a lot  after that bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness and from that she drifted back to the loved ones at home now seemingly at the other side of the world and then she broke down and cried after which she fell asleep on helens shoulder  but helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to  she had always since she could remember longed for a moving active life and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies and now it struck her grimly that if these first few hours of her advent in the west were forecasts of the future she was destined to have her longings more than fulfilled  presently the stage rolled slower and slower until it came to a halt then the horses heaved the harnesses clinked the men whispered otherwise there was an intense quiet she looked out expecting to find it pitchdark it was black yet a transparent blackness to her surprise she could see a long way a shootingstar electrified her the men were listening she listened too but beyond the slight sounds about the stage she heard nothing presently the driver clucked to his horses and travel was resumed  for a while the stage rolled on rapidly evidently downhill swaying from side to side and rattling as if about to fall to pieces then it slowed on a level and again it halted for a few moments and once more in motion it began a laborsome climb helen imagined miles had been covered the desert appeared to heave into billows growing rougher and dark round bushes dimly stood out the road grew uneven and rocky and when the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted bo out of her sleep and in fact almost out of helens arms  where am i asked bo dazedly  bo youre having your hearts desire but i cant tell you where you are replied helen  bo awakened thoroughly which fact was now no wonder considering the jostling of the old stage  hold on to me nell is it a runaway  weve come about a thousand miles like this i think replied helen ive not a whole bone in my body  bo peered out of the window  oh how dark and lonesome but itd be nice if it wasnt so cold im freezing  i thought you loved cold air taunted helen  say nell you begin to talk like yourself responded bo  it was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak all at once but they succeeded except in the roughest places when from time to time they were bounced around bo sustained a sharp rap on the head  oooooo she moaned nell rayner ill never forgive you for fetching me on this awful trip  just think of your handsome las vegas cowboy replied helen  either this remark subdued bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile her to the hardships of the ride  meanwhile as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep the driver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of western men who knew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance  by and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so long with the men whispering on top that helen and bo were roused to apprehension  suddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead  thets roy said joe beeman in a low voice  i reckon an meetin us so quick looks bad replied dale drive on bill  mebbe it seems quick to you muttered the driver but if we haint come thirty mile an if thet ridge thar haint your turninoff place why i dont know nothin  the stage rolled on a little farther while helen and bo sat clasping each other tight wondering with bated breath what was to be the next thing to happen  then once more they were at a standstill helen heard the thud of boots striking the ground and the snorts of horses  nell i see horses whispered bo excitedly there to the side of the road and here comes a man oh if he shouldnt be the one theyre expecting  helen peered out to see a tall dark form moving silently and beyond it a vague outline of horses and then pale gleams of what must have been packloads  dale loomed up and met the stranger in the road  howdy milt you got the girl sure or you wouldnt be here said a low voice  roy ive got two girlssisters replied dale  the man roy whistled softly under his breath then another lean rangy form strode out of the darkness and was met by dale  now boyshow about ansons gang queried dale  at snowdrop drinkin an quarrelin reckon theyll leave there about daybreak replied roy  how long have you been here  mebbe a couple of hours  any horse go by  no  roy a strange rider passed us before dark he was hittin the road an hes got by here before you came  i dont like thet news replied roy tersely lets rustle with girls on hossback youll need all the start you can get hey john  snake anson shore can foller hoss tracks replied the third man  milt say the word went on roy as he looked up at the stars daylight not far away heres the forks of the road an your hosses an our outfit you can be in the pines by sunup  in the silence that ensued helen heard the throb of her heart and the panting little breaths of her sister they both peered out hands clenched together watching and listening in strained attention  its possible that rider last night wasnt a messenger to anson said dale in that case anson wont make anythin of our wheel tracks or horse tracks hell go right on to meet the regular stage bill can you go back an meet the stage comin before anson does  wal i reckon soan take it easy at thet replied bill  all right continued dale instantly john you an joe an hal ride back to meet the regular stage an when you meet it get on an be on it when anson holds it up  thets shore agreeable to me drawled john  id like to be on it too said roy grimly  no ill need you till im safe in the woods bill hand down the bags an you roy help me pack them did you get all the supplies i wanted  shore did if the young ladies aint powerful particular you can feed them well for a couple of months  dale wheeled and striding to the stage he opened the door  girls youre not asleep come he called  bo stepped down first  i was asleep till thisthis vehicle fell off the road back a ways she replied  roy beemans low laugh was significant he took off his sombrero and stood silent the old driver smothered a loud guffaw  veehicle wal ill be doggoned joe did you hear thet all the spunky gurls aint born out west  as helen followed with cloak and bag roy assisted her and she encountered keen eyes upon her face he seemed both gentle and respectful and she felt his solicitude his heavy gun swinging low struck her as she stepped down  dale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags these he set down on the ground  turn around bill an go along with you john an hal will follow presently ordered dale  wal gurls said bill looking down upon them i was shore powerful glad to meet youall an im ashamed of my countryofferin two sich purty gurls insults an lowdown tricks but shore youll go through safe now you couldnt be in better company fer ridin or huntin or marryin or gittin religion  shut up you old grizzly broke in dale sharply  haw haw goodby gurls an good luck ended bill as he began to whip the reins  bo said goodby quite distinctly but helen could only murmur hers the old driver seemed a friend  then the horses wheeled and stamped the stage careened and creaked presently to roll out of sight in the gloom  youre shiverin said dale suddenly looking down upon helen she felt his big hard hand clasp hers cold as ice  i am ccold replied helen i guess were not warmly dressed  nell we roasted all day and now were freezing declared bo i didnt know it was winter at night out here  miss havent you some warm gloves an a coat asked roy anxiously it aint begun to get cold yet  nell weve heavy gloves ridingsuits and bootsall fine and newin this black bag said bo enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet  yes so we have but a lot of good theyll do us tonight returned helen  miss youd do well to change right here said roy earnestly itll save time in the long run an a lot of sufferin before sunup  helen stared at the young man absolutely amazed with his simplicity she was advised to change her travelingdress for a ridingsuitout somewhere in a cold windy desertin the middle of the nightamong strange young men  bo which bag is it asked dale as if she were his sister and when she indicated the one he picked it up come off the road  bo followed him and helen found herself mechanically at their heels dale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes  hurry an change here he said well make a pack of your outfit an leave room for this bag  then he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared  bo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes helen could just see her pale pretty face and big gleaming eyes by the light of the stars it struck her then that bo was going to make eminently more of a success of western life than she was  nell those fellows are nnice said bo reflectively arent you ccold say he said hurry  it was beyond helens comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out there in that open windy desert but after she had gotten launched on the task she found that it required more fortitude than courage the cold wind pierced right through her almost she could have laughed at the way bo made things fly  ggggee chattered bo i nnever wwas so cccold in all my life nell rayner mmay the ggood lord forgive yyou  helen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk she was a strong healthy girl swift and efficient with her hands yet this the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced almost overcame her bo outdistanced her by moments helped her with buttons and laced one whole boot for her then with hands that stung helen packed the travelingsuits in the bag  there but what an awful mess exclaimed helen oh bo our pretty travelingdresses  well press them ttomorrowon a llog replied bo and she giggled  they started for the road bo strange to note did not carry her share of the burden and she seemed unsteady on her feet  the men were waiting beside a group of horses one of which carried a pack  nothin slow about you said dale relieving helen of the grip roy put them up while i sling on this bag  roy led out two of the horses  get up he said indicating bo the stirrups are short on this saddle  bo was an adept at mounting but she made such awkward and slow work of it in this instance that helen could not believe her eyes  haw re the stirrups asked roy stand in them guess theyre about right careful now thet hoss is skittish hold him in  bo was not living up to the reputation with which helen had credited her  now miss you get up said roy to helen and in another instant she found herself astride a black spirited horse numb with cold as she was she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins  roy was at the stirrups with swift hands  youre taller n i guessed he said stay up but lift your foot shore now im glad you have them thick soft boots mebbe well ride all over the white mountains  bo do you hear that called helen  but bo did not answer she was leaning rather unnaturally in her saddle helen became anxious just then dale strode back to them  all cinched up roy  jest ready replied roy  then dale stood beside helen how tall he was his wide shoulders seemed on a level with the pommel of her saddle he put an affectionate hand on the horse  his names ranger an hes the fastest an finest horse in this country  i reckon he shore isalong with my bay corroborated roy  roy if you rode ranger hed beat your pet said dale we can start now roy you drive the packhorses  he took another look at helens saddle and then moved to do likewise with bos  are youall right he asked quickly  bo reeled in her seat  im nnear froze she replied in a faint voice her face shone white in the starlight helen recognized that bo was more than cold  oh bo she called in distress  nell dont you worry now  let me carry you suggested dale  no ill ssstick on this horse or ddie fiercely retorted bo  the two men looked up at her white face and then at each other then roy walked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and dale swung astride the one horse left  keep close to me he said  bo fell in line and helen brought up the rear  helen imagined she was near the end of a dream presently she would awaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at home and hear the cherry branches brushing her window and the old clarionvoiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn    chapter vi  the horses trotted and the exercise soon warmed helen until she was fairly comfortable except in her fingers in mind however she grew more miserable as she more fully realized her situation the night now became so dark that although the head of her horse was alongside the flank of bos she could scarcely see bo from time to time helens anxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right  helen had not ridden a horse for more than a year and for several years she had not ridden with any regularity despite her thrills upon mounting she had entertained misgivings but she was agreeably surprised for the horse ranger had an easy gait and she found she had not forgotten how to ride bo having been used to riding on a farm near home might be expected to acquit herself admirably it occurred to helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick comfortable riding outfits  dark as the night was helen could dimly make out the road underneath it was rocky and apparently little used when dale turned off the road into the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain the traveling was harder rougher and yet no slower the horses kept to the gait of the leaders helen discovering it unnecessary ceased attempting to guide ranger there were dim shapes in the gloom ahead and always they gave helen uneasiness until closer approach proved them to be rocks or low scrubby trees these increased in both size and number as the horses progressed often helen looked back into the gloom behind this act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread dale expected to be pursued and helen experienced along with the dread flashes of unfamiliar resentment not only was there an attempt afoot to rob her of her heritage but even her personal liberty then she shuddered at the significance of dales words regarding her possible abduction by this hired gang it seemed monstrous impossible yet manifestly it was true enough to dale and his allies the west then in reality was raw hard inevitable  suddenly her horse stopped he had come up alongside bos horse dale had halted ahead and apparently was listening roy and the packtrain were out of sight in the gloom  what is it whispered helen  reckon i heard a wolf replied dale  was that cry a wolfs asked bo i heard it was wild  were gettin up close to the foothills said dale feel how much colder the air is  im warm now replied bo i guess being near froze was what ailed me nell how re you  im warm too but helen answered  if you had your choice of being here or back home snug in bedwhich would you take asked bo  bo exclaimed helen aghast  well id choose to be right here on this horse rejoined bo  dale heard her for he turned an instant then slapped his horse and started on  helen now rode beside bo and for a long time they climbed steadily in silence helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed and she welcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east then the stars paled gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars the great white morning star wonderful as helen had never seen it lost its brilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue  daylight came gradually so that the gray desert became distinguishable by degrees rolling bare hills half obscured by the gray lifting mantle of night rose in the foreground and behind was gray space slowly taking form and substance in the east there was a kindling of pale rose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing visibly rugged  reckon wed better catch up with roy said dale and he spurred his horse  ranger and bos mount needed no other urging and they swung into a canter far ahead the packanimals showed with roy driving them the cold wind was so keen in helens face that tears blurred her eyes and froze her cheeks and riding ranger at that pace was like riding in a rockingchair that ride invigorating and exciting seemed all too short  oh nell i dont carewhat becomes ofme exclaimed bo breathlessly  her face was white and red fresh as a rose her eyes glanced darkly blue her hair blew out in bright unruly strands helen knew she felt some of the physical stimulation that had so roused bo and seemed so irresistible but somber thought was not deflected thereby  it was clear daylight when roy led off round a knoll from which patches of scrubby treescedars dale called themstraggled up on the side of the foothills  they grow on the north slopes where the snow stays longest said dale  they descended into a valley that looked shallow but proved to be deep and wide and then began to climb another foothill upon surmounting it helen saw the rising sun and so glorious a view confronted her that she was unable to answer bos wild exclamations  bare yellow cedardotted slopes apparently level so gradual was the ascent stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose black over range after range at last to fail near the bare summit of a magnificent mountain sunriseflushed against the blue sky  oh beautiful cried bo but they ought to be called black mountains  old baldy there is white half the year replied dale  look back an see what you say suggested roy  the girls turned to gaze silently helen imagined she looked down upon the whole wide world how vastly different was the desert verily it yawned away from her red and gold near at hand growing softly flushed with purple far away a barren void borderless and immense where darkgreen patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to emphasize distance and space  see thet little green spot said roy pointing thets snowdrop an the other oneway to the rightthets show down  where is pine queried helen eagerly  farther still up over the foothills at the edge of the woods  then were riding away from it  yes if wed gone straight for pine thet gang could overtake us pine is four days ride an by takin to the mountains milt can hide his tracks an when hes thrown anson off the scent then hell circle down to pine  mr dale do you think youll get us there safelyand soon asked helen wistfully  i wont promise soon but i promise safe an i dont like bein called mister he replied  are we ever going to eat inquired bo demurely  at this query roy beeman turned with a laugh to look at bo helen saw his face fully in the light and it was thin and hard darkly bronzed with eyes like those of a hawk and with square chin and lean jaws showing scant light beard  we shore are he replied soon as we reach the timber thet wont be long  reckon we can rustle some an then take a good rest said dale and he urged his horse into a jogtrot  during a steady trot for a long hour helens roving eyes were everywhere taking note of the things from near to farthe scant sage that soon gave place to as scanty a grass and the dark blots that proved to be dwarf cedars and the ravines opening out as if by magic from what had appeared level ground to wind away widening between gray stone walls and farther on patches of lonely pinetrees two and three together and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens and up beyond the fringed border of forest growing nearer all the while the black sweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of the range  no birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber which fact seemed strange to helen the air lost something of its cold cutting edge as the sun rose higher and it gained sweeter tang of forestland the first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly new to helen yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and with it an emotion as strange it was as if she had smelled that keen pungent tang long ago and her physical sense caught it before her memory  the yellow plain had only appeared to be level roy led down into a shallow ravine where a tiny stream meandered and he followed this around to the left coming at length to a point where cedars and dwarf pines formed a little grove here as the others rode up he sat crosslegged in his saddle and waited  well hang up awhile he said reckon youre tired  im hungry but not tired yet replied bo  helen dismounted to find that walking was something she had apparently lost the power to do bo laughed at her but she too was awkward when once more upon the ground  then roy got down helen was surprised to find him lame he caught her quick glance  a hoss threw me once an rolled on me only broke my collarbone five ribs one arm an my bowlegs in two places  notwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple as he stood there tall and lithe in his homespun ragged garments he looked singularly powerful and capable  reckon walkin around would be good for you girls advised dale if you aint stiff yet youll be soon an walkin will help dont go far ill call when breakfasts ready   a little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and found campfire and meal awaiting them roy was sitting crosslegged like an indian in front of a tarpaulin upon which was spread a homely but substantial fare helens quick eye detected a cleanliness and thoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of men of the wilds moreover the fare was good she ate heartily and as for bos appetite she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as amused at it the young men were all eyes assiduous in their service to the girls but speaking seldom it was not lost upon helen how dales gray gaze went often down across the open country she divined apprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it  ideclare burst out bo when she could not eat any more this isnt believable im dreaming nell the black horse you rode is the prettiest i ever saw  ranger with the other animals was grazing along the little brook packs and saddles had been removed the men ate leisurely there was little evidence of hurried flight yet helen could not cast off uneasiness roy might have been deep and careless with a motive to spare the girls anxiety but dale seemed incapable of anything he did not absolutely mean  rest or walk he advised the girls weve got forty miles to ride before dark  helen preferred to rest but bo walked about petting the horses and prying into the packs she was curious and eager  dale and roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and packed them away in a heavy canvas bag  you really expect anson ll strike my trail this mornin dale was asking  i shore do replied roy  an how do you figure that so soon  howd you figure itif you was snake anson queried roy in reply  depends on that rider from magdalena said dale soberly although its likely id seen them wheel tracks an hoss tracks made where we turned off but supposin he does  milt listen i told you snake met us boys face to face day before yesterday in show down an he was plumb curious  but he missed seein or hearin about me replied dale  mebbe he did an mebbe he didnt anyway whats the difference whether he finds out this mornin or this evenin  then you aint expectin a fight if anson holds up the stage  wal hed have to shoot first which aint likely john an hal since thet shootinscrape a year ago have been sort of gunshy joe might get riled but i reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay an itd be sense not to count on thet  then you hang up here an keep watch for ansons gangsay long enough sos to be sure theyd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin makin sure one way or another you ride crosscountry to big spring where ill camp tonight  roy nodded approval of that suggestion then without more words both men picked up ropes and went after the horses helen was watching dale so that when bo cried out in great excitement helen turned to see a savage yellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing the air roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp  nell look at that for a wild pony exclaimed bo  helen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated mustang roy dragged him to a cedar near by  come now buckskin said roy soothingly and he slowly approached the quivering animal he went closer hand over hand on the lasso buckskin showed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth but he stood while roy loosened the loop and slipping it down over his head fastened it in a complicated knot round his nose  thets a hackamore he said indicating the knot hes never had a bridle an never will have one i reckon  you dont ride him queried helen  sometimes i do replied roy with a smile would you girls like to try him  excuse me answered helen  gee ejaculated bo he looks like a devil but id tackle himif you think i could  the wild leaven of the west had found quick root in bo rayner  wal im sorry but i reckon ill not let youfor a spell replied roy dryly  he pitches somethin powerful bad  pitches you mean bucks  i reckon  in the next halfhour helen saw more and learned more about how horses of the open range were handled than she had ever heard of excepting ranger and roys bay and the white pony bo rode the rest of the horses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and packed it was a job for fearless strong men and one that called for patience as well as arms of iron so that for helen rayner the thing succeeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect to an observing woman that halfhour told much  when all was in readiness for a start dale mounted and said significantly roy ill look for you about sundown i hope no sooner  wal itd be bad if i had to rustle along soon with bad news lets hope for the best weve been shore lucky so far now you take to the pinemats in the woods an hide your trail  dale turned away then the girls bade roy goodby and followed soon roy and his buckskincolored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of trees  the unhampered horses led the way the packanimals trotted after them the riders were close behind all traveled at a jogtrot and this gait made the packs bob up and down and from side to side the sun felt warm at helens back and the wind lost its frosty coldness that almost appeared damp for a dry sweet fragrance dale drove up the shallow valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of timber some few miles ahead it did not take long to reach the edge of the forest  helen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no farther probably the growth had to do with snow but as the ground was level she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just there  they rode into the forest  to helen it seemed a strange critical entrance into another world which she was destined to know and to love the pines were big brownbarked seamed and knotted with no typical conformation except a majesty and beauty they grew far apart few small pines and little underbrush flourished beneath them the floor of this forest appeared remarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and wide brown areas of pineneedles these manifestly were what roy had meant by pinemats here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or rotting helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and the strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all and when they did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log likewise she became aware of a springy nature of the ground and then she saw that the pinemats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the horses and after they had passed sprang back to place again leaving no track helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind indeed it would take a sharp eye to follow dale through that forest this knowledge was infinitely comforting to helen and for the first time since the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind and heart it left her free for some of the appreciation she might have had in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances  bo however seemed too young too wild too intense to mind what the circumstances were she responded to reality helen began to suspect that the girl would welcome any adventure and helen knew surely now that bo was a true auchincloss for three long days helen had felt a constraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar for the last hours it had been submerged under dread but it must be she concluded blood like her sisters pounding at her veins to be set free to race and to burn  bo loved action she had an eye for beauty but she was not contemplative she was now helping dale drive the horses and hold them in rather close formation she rode well and as yet showed no symptoms of fatigue or pain helen began to be aware of both but not enough yet to limit her interest  a wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her of all living creatures in nature helen liked birds best and she knew many and could imitate the songs of a few but here under the stately pines there were no birds squirrels however began to be seen here and there and in the course of an hours travel became abundant the only one with which she was familiar was the chipmunk all the others from the slim bright blacks to the striped russets and the whitetailed grays were totally new to her they appeared tame and curious the reds barked and scolded at the passing cavalcade the blacks glided to some safe branch there to watch the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their domain  once dale halting his horse pointed with long arm and helen following the direction descried several gray deer standing in a glade motionless with long ears up they made a wild and beautiful picture suddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides  the forest on the whole held to the level open character but there were swales and streambeds breaking up its regular conformity toward noon however it gradually changed a fact that helen believed she might have observed sooner had she been more keen the general lay of the land began to ascend and the trees to grow denser  she made another discovery ever since she had entered the forest she had become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting her nostrils she imagined with regret that she had taken cold but presently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch the smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength also her throat and lungs seemed to burn  when she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings it was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied recognition thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they grew worse one especially was a pain beyond all her experience it lay in the muscles of her side above her hip and it grew to be a treacherous thing for it was not persistent it came and went after it did come with a terrible flash it could be borne by shifting or easing the body but it gave no warning when she expected it she was mistaken when she dared to breathe again then with piercing swiftness it returned like a blade in her side this then was one of the ridingpains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride it was almost too much to be borne the beauty of the forest the living creatures to be seen scurrying away the time distanceeverything faded before that stablike pain to her infinite relief she found that it was the trot that caused this torture when ranger walked she did not have to suffer it therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared or until dale and bo were almost out of sight then she loped him ahead until he had caught up  so the hours passed the sun got around low sending golden shafts under the trees and the forest gradually changed to a brighter but a thicker color this slowly darkened sunset was not far away  she heard the horses splashing in water and soon she rode up to see the tiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss she crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a more open place in the forest where the pines were huge towering and far apart a low gray bluff of stone rose to the right perhaps onethird as high as the trees from somewhere came the rushing sound of running water  big spring announced dale we camp here you girls have done well  another glance proved to helen that all those little streams poured from under this gray bluff  im dying for a drink cried bo with her customary hyperbole  i reckon youll never forget your first drink here remarked dale  bo essayed to dismount and finally fell off and when she did get to the ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function and she fell flat dale helped her up  whats wrong with me anyhow she demanded in great amaze  just stiff i reckon replied dale as he led her a few awkward steps  bo have you any hurts queried helen who still sat her horse loath to try dismounting yet wanting to beyond all words  bo gave her an eloquent glance  nell did you have one in your side like a wicked long darningneedle punching deep when you werent ready  that one ill never get over exclaimed helen softly then profiting by bos experience she dismounted cautiously and managed to keep upright her legs felt like wooden things  presently the girls went toward the spring  drink slow called out dale  big spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray weathered bluff from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water its fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold stone  helen and bo lay flat on a mossy bank seeing their faces as they bent over and they sipped a mouthful by dales advice and because they were so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a precious opportunity  the water was so cold that it sent a shock over helen made her teeth ache and a singular revivifying current steal all through her wonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh irresistible in its appeal to thirst helen raised her head to look at this water it was colorless as she had found it tasteless  nelldrink panted bo think of ourold springin the orchardfull of pollywogs  and then helen drank thirstily with closed eyes while a memory of home stirred from bos gift of poignant speech    chapter vii  the first camp duty dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the horses and opening it he took out tarpaulin and blankets which he arranged on the ground under a pinetree  you girls rest he said briefly  cant we help asked helen though she could scarcely stand  youll be welcome to do all you like after youre broke in  broke in ejaculated bo with a little laugh im all broke up now  bo it looks as if mr dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in the woods  it does replied bo as slowly she sat down upon the blankets stretched out with a long sigh and laid her head on a saddle nell didnt he say not to call him mister  dale was throwing the packs off the other horses  helen lay down beside bo and then for once in her life she experienced the sweetness of rest  well sister what do you intend to call him queried helen curiously  milt of course replied bo  helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches  i suppose then when your las vegas cowboy comes along you will call him what he called you  bo blushed which was a rather unusual thing for her  i will if i like she retorted nell ever since i could remember youve raved about the west now youre out west right in it good and deep so wake up  that was bos blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination of helens superficialities it sank deep helen had no retort her ambition as far as the west was concerned had most assuredly not been for such a wild unheardof jaunt as this but possibly the westa living from day to daywas one succession of adventures trials tests troubles and achievements to make a place for others to live comfortably some day that might be bos meaning embodied in her forceful hint but helen was too tired to think it out then she found it interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch dale  he hobbled the horses and turned them loose then with ax in hand he approached a short dead tree standing among a few whitebarked aspens dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax with his coat off displaying his wide shoulders straight back and long powerful arms he looked a young giant he was lithe and supple brawny but not bulky the ax rang on the hard wood reverberating through the forest a few strokes sufficed to bring down the stub then he split it up helen was curious to see how he kindled a fire first he ripped splinters out of the heart of the log and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground then from a saddlebag which hung on a nearby branch he took flint and steel and a piece of what helen supposed was rag or buckskin upon which powder had been rubbed at any rate the first strike of the steel brought sparks a blaze and burning splinters instantly the flame leaped a foot high he put on larger pieces of wood crosswise and the fire roared  that done he stood erect and facing the north he listened helen remembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before since the arrival at big spring it was roy for whom he was listening and watching the sun had set and across the open space the tips of the pines were losing their brightness  the camp utensils which the hunter emptied out of a sack gave forth a jangle of iron and tin next he unrolled a large pack the contents of which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes these evidently contained food supplies the bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over it pack and all dale filled it at the spring upon returning to the campfire he poured water into a washbasin and getting down to his knees proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly the act seemed a habit for helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods and listened then he dried his hands over the fire and turning to the spreadout pack he began preparations for the meal  suddenly helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied at magdalena on the stageride and last night she had trusted this stranger a hunter of the white mountains who appeared ready to befriend her and she had felt an exceeding gratitude still she had looked at him impersonally but it began to dawn upon her that chance had thrown her in the company of a remarkable man that impression baffled her it did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind to help a young woman in peril or that he appeared deft and quick at campfire chores most western men were brave her uncle had told her and many were roughly kind and all of them could cook this hunter was physically a wonderful specimen of manhood with something leonine about his stature but that did not give rise to her impression helen had been a schoolteacher and used to boys and she sensed a boyish simplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter she believed however that it was a mental and spiritual force in dale which had drawn her to think of it  nell ive spoken to you three times protested bo petulantly what re you mooning over  im pretty tiredand far away bo replied helen what did you say  i said i had an enormous appetite  really thats not remarkable for you im too tired to eat and afraid to shut my eyes theyd never come open when did we sleep last bo  second night before we left home declared bo  four nights oh weve slept some  ill bet i make mine up in this woods do you suppose well sleep right hereunder this treewith no covering  it looks so replied helen dubiously  how perfectly lovely exclaimed bo in delight well see the stars through the pines  seems to be clouding over wouldnt it be awful if we had a storm  why i dont know answered bo thoughtfully it must storm out west  again helen felt a quality of inevitableness in bo it was something that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in st joseph all of a sudden helen received a flash of wondering thoughta thrilling consciousness that she and bo had begun to develop in a new and wild environment how strange and fearful perhaps to watch that growth bo being younger more impressionable with elemental rather than intellectual instincts would grow stronger more swiftly helen wondered if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive but how could anyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way it was the savage who did not think  helen saw dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest  reckon roy aint comin he soliloquized an thats good then he turned to the girls suppers ready  the girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity and they ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods dale attended them with a pleasant light upon his still face  tomorrow night well have meat he said  what kind asked bo  wild turkey or deer maybe both if you like but its well to take wild meat slow an turkeythat ll melt in your mouth  uummm murmured bo greedily ive heard of wild turkey  when they had finished dale ate his meal listening to the talk of the girls and occasionally replying briefly to some query of bos it was twilight when he began to wash the pots and pans and almost dark by the time his duties appeared ended then he replenished the campfire and sat down on a log to gaze into the fire the girls leaned comfortably propped against the saddles  nell ill keel over in a minute said bo and i oughtntright on such a big supper  i dont see how i can sleep and i know i cant stay awake rejoined helen  dale lifted his head alertly  listen  the girls grew tense and still helen could not hear a sound unless it was a low thud of hoof out in the gloom the forest seemed sleeping she knew from bos eyes wide and shining in the campfire light that she too had failed to catch whatever it was dale meant  bunch of coyotes comin he explained  suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy highstrung strange barks they sounded wild yet they held something of a friendly or inquisitive note presently gray forms could be descried just at the edge of the circle of light soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded the camp and then barks and yelps broke out all around it was a restless and sneaking pack of animals thought helen she was glad after the chorus ended and with a few desultory spiteful yelps the coyotes went away  silence again settled down if it had not been for the anxiety always present in helens mind she would have thought this silence sweet and unfamiliarly beautiful  ah listen to that fellow spoke up dale his voice was thrilling  again the girls strained their ears that was not necessary for presently clear and cold out of the silence pealed a mournful howl long drawn strange and full and wild  oh whats that whispered bo  thats a big gray wolfa timberwolf or lofer as hes sometimes called replied dale hes high on some rocky ridge back there he scents us an he doesnt like it there he goes again listen ah hes hungry  while helen listened to this exceedingly wild cryso wild that it made her flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come over hershe kept her glance upon dale  you love him she murmured involuntarily quite without understanding the motive of her query  assuredly dale had never had that question asked of him before and it seemed to helen as he pondered that he had never even asked it of himself  i reckon so he replied presently  but wolves kill deer and little fawns and everything helpless in the forest expostulated bo  the hunter nodded his head  why then can you love him repeated helen  come to think of it i reckon its because of lots of reasons returned dale he kills clean he eats no carrion hes no coward he fights he dies game an he likes to be alone  kills clean what do you mean by that  a cougar now he mangles a deer an a silvertip when killin a cow or colt he makes a mess of it but a wolf kills clean with sharp snaps  what are a cougar and a silvertip  cougar means mountainlion or panther an a silvertip is a grizzly bear  oh theyre all cruel exclaimed helen shrinking  i reckon often ive shot wolves for relayin a deer  whats that  sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer an while one of them rests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner wholl take up the chase that way they run the deer down cruel it is but nature an no worse than snow an ice that starve deer or a fox that kills turkeychicks breakin out of the egg or ravens that pick the eyes out of newborn lambs an wait till they die an for that matter men are crueler than beasts of prey for men add to nature an have more than instincts  helen was silenced as well as shocked she had not only learned a new and striking viewpoint in natural history but a clear intimation to the reason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in this man a hunter was one who killed animals for their fur for their meat or horns or for some lust for bloodthat was helens definition of a hunter and she believed it was held by the majority of people living in settled states but the majority might be wrong a hunter might be vastly different and vastly more than a tracker and slayer of game the mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men perhaps dale knew its secrets its life its terror its beauty its sadness and its joy and if so how full how wonderful must be his mind he spoke of men as no better than wolves could a lonely life in the wilderness teach a man that bitterness envy jealousy spite greed and hatethese had no place in this hunters heart it was not helens shrewdness but a womans intuition which divined that  dale rose to his feet and turning his ear to the north listened once more  are you expecting roy still inquired helen  no it aint likely hell turn up tonight replied dale and then he strode over to put a hand on the pinetree that soared above where the girls lay his action and the way he looked up at the treetop and then at adjacent trees held more of that significance which so interested helen  i reckon hes stood there some five hundred years an will stand through tonight muttered dale  this pine was the monarch of that widespread group  listen again said dale  bo was asleep and helen listening at once caught low distant roar  wind its goin to storm explained dale youll hear somethin worth while but dont be scared reckon well be safe pines blow down often but this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was better slip under the blankets so i can pull the tarp up  helen slid down just as she was fully dressed except for boots which she and bo had removed and she laid her head close to bos dale pulled the tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads  when it rains youll wake an then just pull the tarp up over you he said  will it rain helen asked but she was thinking that this moment was the strangest that had ever happened to her by the light of the campfire she saw dales face just as usual still darkly serene expressing no thought he was kind but he was not thinking of these sisters as girls alone with him in a pitchblack forest helpless and defenseless he did not seem to be thinking at all but helen had never before in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience  ill be close by an keep the fire goin all night he said  she heard him stride off into the darkness presently there came a dragging bumping sound then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire a cloud of sparks shot up and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp ground smoke again curled upward along the great seamed treetrunk and flames sputtered and crackled  helen listened again for the roar of wind it seemed to come on a breath of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew bos curls and it was stronger but it died out presently only to come again and still stronger helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching storm her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open and she knew if she let them close she would instantly drop to sleep and she wanted to hear the stormwind in the pines  a few drops of cold rain fell upon her face thrilling her with the proof that no roof stood between her and the elements then a breeze bore the smell of burnt wood into her face and somehow her quick mind flew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little brothers the memory faded the roar that had seemed distant was now back in the forest coming swiftly increasing in volume like a stream in flood it bore down helen grew amazed startled how rushing oncoming and heavy this stormwind she likened its approach to the tread of an army then the roar filled the forest yet it was back there behind her not a pineneedle quivered in the light of the campfire but the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge the roar augmented till it was no longer a roar but an onsweeping crash like an ocean torrent engulfing the earth bo awoke to cling to helen with fright the deafening stormblast was upon them helen felt the saddlepillow move under her head the giant pine had trembled to its very roots that mighty fury of wind was all aloft in the treetops and for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power then the deafening crash passed to roar and that swept on and on lessening in volume deepening in low detonation at last to die in the distance  no sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and ceased and rose again helen lay there whispering to bo and heard again the great wave of wind come and crash and cease that was the way of this stormwind of the mountain forest  a soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned helen to remember dales directions and pulling up the heavy covering she arranged it hoodlike over the saddle then with bo close and warm beside her she closed her eyes and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain faded last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the tarpaulin   when she opened her eyes she remembered everything as if only a moment had elapsed but it was daylight though gray and cloudy the pines were dripping mist a fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and a savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air horses were standing near by biting and kicking at one another bo was sound asleep dale appeared busy around the campfire as helen watched the hunter she saw him pause in his task turn his ear to listen and then look expectantly and at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest helen recognized roys voice then she heard a splashing of water and hoofbeats coming closer with that the buckskin mustang trotted into camp carrying roy  bad mornin for ducks but good for us he called  howdy roy greeted dale and his gladness was unmistakable i was lookin for you  roy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort and his swift hands slapped the straps as he unsaddled buckskin was wet with sweat and foam mixed with rain he heaved and steam rose from him  must have rode hard observed dale  i shore did replied roy then he espied helen who had sat up with hands to her hair and eyes staring at him  mornin miss its good news  thank heaven murmured helen and then she shook bo that young lady awoke but was loath to give up slumber bo bo wake up mr roy is back  whereupon bo sat up disheveled and sleepyeyed  ohh but i ache she moaned but her eyes took in the camp scene to the effect that she added is breakfast ready  almost an flapjacks this mornin replied dale  bo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she laced her boots helen got their travelingbag and with this they repaired to a flat stone beside the spring not however out of earshot of the men  how long are you goin to hang around camp before tellin me inquired dale  jest as i figgered milt replied roy thet rider who passed you was a messenger to anson he an his gang got on our trail quick about ten oclock i seen them comin then i lit out for the woods i stayed off in the woods close enough to see where they come in an shore they lost your trail then they spread through the woods workin off to the south thinkin of course thet you would circle round to pine on the south side of old baldy there aint a hosstracker in snake ansons gang thets shore wal i follered them for an hour till theyd rustled some miles off our trail then i went back to where you struck into the woods an i waited there all afternoon till dark expectin mebbe theyd backtrail but they didnt i rode on a ways an camped in the woods till jest before daylight  so far so good declared dale  shore theres rough country south of baldy an along the two or three trails anson an his outfit will camp you bet  it aint to be thought of muttered dale at some idea that had struck him  what aint  goin round the north side of baldy  it shore aint rejoined roy bluntly  then ive got to hide tracks certainrustle to my camp an stay there till you say its safe to risk takin the girls to pine  milt youre talkin the wisdom of the prophets  i aint so sure we can hide tracks altogether if anson had any eyes for the woods hed not have lost me so soon  no but you see hes figgerin to cross your trail  if i could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an hide tracks certain id feel safe from pursuit anyway said the hunter reflectively  shore an easy responded roy quickly i jest met up with some greaser sheepherders drivin a big flock theyve come up from the south an are goin to fatten up at turkey senacas then theyll drive back south an go on to phenix wal its muddy weather now you break camp quick an make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail as if you was travelin south but instead you ride round ahead of thet flock of sheep theyll keep to the open parks an the trails through them necks of woods out here an passin over your tracks theyll hide em  but supposin anson circles an hits this camp hell track me easy out to that sheep trail what then  jest what you want goin south thet sheep trail is downhill an muddy its goin to rain hard your tracks would get washed out even if you did go south an anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the scent leave it to me milt youre a hunter but im a hosstracker  all right well rustle  then he called the girls to hurry    chapter viii  once astride the horse again helen had to congratulate herself upon not being so crippled as she had imagined indeed bo made all the audible complaints  both girls had long waterproof coats brandnew and of which they were considerably proud new clothes had not been a common event in their lives  reckon ill have to slit these dale had said whipping out a huge knife  what for had been bos feeble protest  they wasnt made for ridin an youll get wet enough even if i do cut them an if i dont youll get soaked  go ahead had been helens reluctant permission  so their long new coats were slit halfway up the back the exigency of the case was manifest to helen when she saw how they came down over the cantles of the saddles and to their boottops  the morning was gray and cold a fine misty rain fell and the trees dripped steadily helen was surprised to see the open country again and that apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while the country was wide and flat on the right and to the left it rolled and heaved along a black scalloped timberline above this bordering of the forest low drifting clouds obscured the mountains the wind was at helens back and seemed to be growing stronger dale and roy were ahead traveling at a good trot with the packanimals bunched before them helen and bo had enough to do to keep up  the first hours ride brought little change in weather or scenery but it gave helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up all day she began to welcome the places where the horses walked but she disliked the levels as for the descents she hated those ranger would not go down slowly and the shakeup she received was unpleasant moreover the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and washes he sailed over them like a bird helen could not acquire the knack of sitting the saddle properly and so not only was her person bruised on these occasions but her feelings were hurt helen had never before been conscious of vanity still she had never rejoiced in looking at a disadvantage and her exhibitions here must have been frightful bo always would forge to the front and she seldom looked back for which helen was grateful  before long they struck into a broad muddy belt full of innumerable small hoof tracks this then was the sheep trail roy had advised following they rode on it for three or four miles and at length coming to a graygreen valley they saw a huge flock of sheep soon the air was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep and a low soft roar of pattering hoofs the flock held a compact formation covering several acres and grazed along rapidly there were three herders on horses and several packburros dale engaged one of the mexicans in conversation and passed something to him then pointed northward and down along the trail the mexican grinned from ear to ear and helen caught the quick si senor gracias senor it was a pretty sight that flock of sheep as it rolled along like a rounded woolly stream of grays and browns and here and there a black they were keeping to a trail over the flats dale headed into this trail and if anything trotted a little faster  presently the clouds lifted and broke showing blue sky and one streak of sunshine but the augury was without warrant the wind increased a huge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that could be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a swiftly moving wall soon it enveloped the fugitives  with head bowed helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold gray rain that blew almost on a level finally the heavy downpour passed leaving a fine mist the clouds scurried low and dark hiding the mountains altogether and making the gray wet plain a dreary sight helens feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water and they were cold her gloves too had not been intended for rain and they were wet through the cold bit at her fingers so that she had to beat her hands together ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was to trot faster which event was worse for helen than freezing  she saw another black scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its trailing sheets of rain and this one appeared streaked with white snow the wind was now piercingly cold helens body kept warm but her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly she gazed ahead grimly there was no help she had to go on dale and roy were hunched down in their saddles probably wet through for they wore no rainproof coats bo kept close behind them and plain it was that she felt the cold  this second storm was not so bad as the first because there was less rain still the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow it lasted for an hour during which the horses trotted on trotted on again the gray torrent roared away the fine mist blew the clouds lifted and separated and closing again darkened for another onslaught this one brought sleet the driving pellets stung helens neck and cheeks and for a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was afraid she could not hold up under them the bare places on the ground showed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice  thus storm after storm rolled over helens head her feet grew numb and ceased to hurt but her fingers because of her ceaseless efforts to keep up the circulation retained the stinging pain and now the wind pierced right through her she marveled at her endurance and there were many times that she believed she could not ride farther yet she kept on all the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as this hard and cold wet and windy at an increasing elevationthat was the explanation the air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood  still during all those interminable hours helen watched where she was traveling and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize it the afternoon appeared far advanced when dale and roy led down into an immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats they rode along its margin splashing up to the knees of the horses cranes and herons flew on with lumbering motion flocks of ducks winged swift flight from one side to the other beyond this depression the land sloped rather abruptly outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of the highest ground and again a dark fringe of trees appeared  how many miles wondered helen they seemed as many and as long as the hours but at last just as another hard rain came the pines were reached they proved to be widely scattered and afforded little protection from the storm  helen sat her saddle a dead weight whenever ranger quickened his gait or crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling off her mind harbored only sensations of misery and a persistent thoughtwhy did she ever leave home for the west her solicitude for bo had been forgotten nevertheless any marked change in the topography of the country was registered perhaps photographed on her memory by the torturing vividness of her experience  the forest grew more level and denser shadows of twilight or gloom lay under the trees presently dale and roy disappeared going downhill and likewise bo then helens ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid water ranger trotted faster soon helen came to the edge of a great valley black and gray so full of obscurity that she could not see across or down into it but she knew there was a rushing river at the bottom the sound was deep continuous a heavy murmuring roar singularly musical the trail was steep helen had not lost all feeling as she had believed and hoped her poor mistreated body still responded excruciatingly to concussions jars wrenches and all the other horrible movements making up a horsetrot  for long helen did not look up when she did so there lay a green willowbordered treeless space at the bottom of the valley through which a brownwhite stream rushed with steady earfilling roar  dale and roy drove the packanimals across the stream and followed going deep to the flanks of their horses bo rode into the foaming water as if she had been used to it all her days a slip a fall would have meant that bo must drown in that mountain torrent  ranger trotted straight to the edge and there obedient to helens clutch on the bridle he halted the stream was fifty feet wide shallow on the near side deep on the opposite with fast current and big waves helen was simply too frightened to follow  let him come yelled dale stick on now ranger  the big black plunged in making the water fly that stream was nothing for him though it seemed impassable to helen she had not the strength left to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them ranger in two more plunges surmounted the bank and then trotting across the green to where the other horses stood steaming under some pines he gave a great heave and halted  roy reached up to help her off  thirty miles miss helen he said and the way he spoke was a compliment  he had to lift her off and help her to the tree where bo leaned dale had ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddleblankets on the ground under the pine  nellyou sworeyou loved me was bos mournful greeting the girl was pale drawn bluelipped and she could not stand up  bo i never didor id never have brought you to thiswretch that i am cried helen oh what a horrible ride  rain was falling the trees were dripping the sky was lowering all the ground was soaking wet with pools and puddles everywhere helen could imagine nothing but a heartless dreary cold prospect just then home was vivid and poignant in her thoughts indeed so utterly miserable was she that the exquisite relief of sitting down of a cessation of movement of a release from that infernal perpetualtrotting horse seemed only a mockery it could not be true that the time had come for rest  evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheepherders for there were remains of a fire dale lifted the burnt end of a log and brought it down hard upon the ground splitting off pieces several times he did this it was amazing to see his strength his facility as he split off handfuls of splinters he collected a bundle of them and laying them down he bent over them roy wielded the ax on another log and each stroke split off a long strip then a tiny column of smoke drifted up over dales shoulder as he leaned bareheaded sheltering the splinters with his hat a blaze leaped up roy came with an armful of strips all white and dry out of the inside of a log crosswise these were laid over the blaze and it began to roar then piece by piece the men built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods branches and stumps and logs erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke roared upward it had not taken two minutes already helen felt the warmth on her icy face she held up her bare numb hands  both dale and roy were wet through to the skin yet they did not tarry beside the fire they relieved the horses a lasso went up between two pines and a tarpaulin over it vshaped and pegged down at the four ends the packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and bedding were placed under this shelter  helen thought this might have taken five minutes more in this short space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot rain was falling steadily all around but over and near that roaring blaze ten feet high no water fell it evaporated the ground began to steam and to dry helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out the cold but presently the pain ceased  nell i never knew before how good a fire could feel declared bo  and therein lay more food for helens reflection  in ten minutes helen was dry and hot darkness came down upon the dreary sodden forest but that great campfire made it a different world from the one helen had anticipated it blazed and roared cracked like a pistol hissed and sputtered shot sparks everywhere and sent aloft a dense yellow whirling column of smoke it began to have a heart of gold  dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the coffeepot and oven soon began to steam  roy i promised the girls turkey tonight said the hunter  mebbe tomorrow if the wind shifts this s turkey country  roy a potato will do me exclaimed bo never again will i ask for cake and pie i never appreciated good things to eat and ive been a little pig always i nevernever knew what it was to be hungryuntil now  dale glanced up quickly  lass its worth learnin he said  helens thought was too deep for words in such brief space had she been transformed from misery to comfort  the rain kept on falling though it appeared to grow softer as night settled down black the wind died away and the forest was still except for the steady roar of the stream a folded tarpaulin was laid between the pine and the fire well in the light and warmth and upon it the men set steaming pots and plates and cups the fragrance from which was strong and inviting  fetch the saddleblanket an set with your backs to the fire said roy   later when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and sheltered from the rain helen remained awake after bo had fallen asleep the big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day she could see the smoke the trunk of the big pine towering aloft and a blank space of sky the stream hummed a song seemingly musical at times and then discordant and dull now low now roaring and always rushing gurgling babbling flowing chafing in its hurry  presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses and beside the fire they conversed in low tones  wal thet trail we made today will be hid i reckon said roy with satisfaction  what wasnt sheeped over would be washed out weve had luck an now i aint worryin returned dale  worryin then its the first i ever knowed you to do  man i never had a job like this protested the hunter  wal thets so  now roy when old al auchincloss finds out about this deal as hes bound to when you or the boys get back to pine hes goin to roar  do you reckon folks will side with him against beasley  some of them but al like as not will tell folks to go where its hot hell bunch his men an strike for the mountains to find his nieces  wal all youve got to do is to keep the girls hid till i can guide him up to your camp or failin thet till you can slip the girls down to pine  no one but you an your brothers ever seen my senaca but it could be found easy enough  anson might blunder on it but thet aint likely  why aint it  because ill stick to thet sheepthiefs tracks like a wolf after a bleedin deer an if he ever gets near your camp ill ride in ahead of him  good declared dale i was calculatin youd go down to pine sooner or later  not unless anson goes i told john thet in case there was no fight on the stage to make a beeline back to pine he was to tell al an offer his services along with joe an hal  one way or another then theres bound to be blood spilled over this  shore an high time i jest hope i get a look down my old fortyfour at thet beasley  in that case i hope you hold straighter than times ive seen you  milt dale im a good shot declared roy stoutly  youre no good on movin targets  wal mebbe so but im not lookin for a movin target when i meet up with beasley im a hossman not a hunter youre used to shootin flies off deers horns jest for practice  roy can we make my camp by tomorrow night queried dale more seriously  we will if each of us has to carry one of the girls but theyll do it or die dale did you ever see a gamer girl than thet kid bo  me whered i ever see any girls ejaculated dale i remember some when i was a boy but i was only fourteen then never had much use for girls  id like to have a wife like that bo declared roy fervidly  there ensued a moments silence  roy youre a mormon an you already got a wife was dales reply  now milt have you lived so long in the woods thet you never heard of a mormon with two wives returned roy and then he laughed heartily  i never could stomach what i did hear pertainin to more than one wife for a man  wal my friend you go an get yourself one an see then if you wouldnt like to have two  i reckon one d be more than enough for milt dale  milt old man let me tell you thet i always envied you your freedom said roy earnestly but it aint life  you mean life is love of a woman  no thets only part i mean a sona boy thets like youthet you feel will go on with your life after youre gone  ive thought of thatthought it all out watchin the birds an animals mate in the woods if i have no son ill never live hereafter  wal replied roy hesitatingly i dont go in so deep as thet i mean a son goes on with your blood an your work  exactly an roy i envy you what you ve got because its out of all bounds for milt dale  those words sad and deep ended the conversation again the rumbling rushing stream dominated the forest an owl hooted dismally a horse trod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of teeth on grass   a voice pierced helens deep dreams and awaking she found bo shaking and calling her  are you dead came the gay voice  almost oh my backs broken replied helen the desire to move seemed clamped in a vise and even if that came she believed the effort would be impossible  roy called us said bo he said hurry i thought id die just sitting up and id give you a million dollars to lace my boots wait sister till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots  with heroic and violent spirit helen sat up to find that in the act her aches and pains appeared beyond number reaching for her boots she found them cold and stiff helen unlaced one and opening it wide essayed to get her sore foot down into it but her foot appeared swollen and the boot appeared shrunken she could not get it half on though she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms she groaned  bo laughed wickedly her hair was tousled her eyes dancing her cheeks red  be game she said stand up like a real western girl and pull your boot on  whether bos scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to helen but the fact was that she got into her boots walking and moving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired feeling the water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than any ice helen had ever felt it almost paralyzed her hands bo mumbled and blew like a porpoise they had to run to the fire before being able to comb their hair the air was wonderfully keen the dawn was clear bright with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise  all ready girls called roy reckon you can help yourselves milt aint comin in very fast with the hosses ill rustle off to help him weve got a hard day before us yesterday wasnt nowhere to what today ll be  but the suns going to shine implored bo  wal you bet rejoined roy as he strode off  helen and bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps half an hour then the horses came thudding down with dale and roy riding bareback  by the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up melting the frost and ice so that a dazzling bright mist full of rainbows shone under the trees  dale looked ranger over and tried the cinches of bos horse  whats your choicea long ride behind the packs with meor a short cut over the hills with roy he asked  i choose the lesser of two rides replied helen smiling  reckon that ll be easier but youll know youve had a ride said dale significantly  what was that we had yesterday asked bo archly  only thirty miles but cold an wet today will be fine for ridin  milt ill take a blanket an some grub in case you dont meet us tonight said roy an i reckon well split up here where ill have to strike out on thet short cut  bo mounted without a helping hand but helens limbs were so stiff that she could not get astride the high ranger without assistance the hunter headed up the slope of the canyon which on that side was not steep it was brown pine forest with here and there a clump of dark silverpointed evergreens that roy called spruce by the time this slope was surmounted helens aches were not so bad the saddle appeared to fit her better and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar she reflected however that she always had done pretty well uphill here it was beautiful forestland uneven and wilder they rode for a time along the rim with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below with its melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear  dale reined in and peered down at the pinemat  fresh deer sign all along here he said pointing  wal i seen thet long ago rejoined roy  helens scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in the pineneedles dark in color and sharply defined  we may never get a better chance said dale those deer are workin up our way get your rifle out  travel was resumed then with roy a little in advance of the packtrain presently he dismounted threw his bridle and cautiously peered ahead then turning he waved his sombrero the packanimals halted in a bunch dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to roys horse this point helen saw was at the top of an intersecting canuon dale dismounted without drawing his rifle from its saddlesheath and approached roy  buck an two does he said lowvoiced an theyve winded us but dont see us yet girls ride up closer  following the directions indicated by dales long arm helen looked down the slope it was open with tall pines here and there and clumps of silver spruce and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight presently bo exclaimed oh look i see i see then helens roving glance passed something different from green and gold and brown shifting back to it she saw a magnificent stag with noble spreading antlers standing like a statue his head up in alert and wild posture his color was gray beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more graceful build without horns  its downhill whispered dale an youre goin to overshoot  then helen saw that roy had his rifle leveled  oh dont she cried  dales remark evidently nettled roy he lowered the rifle  milt its me lookin over this gun how can you stand there an tell me im goin to shoot high i had a dead bead on him  roy you didnt allow for downhill hurry he sees us now  roy leveled the rifle and taking aim as before he fired the buck stood perfectly motionless as if he had indeed been stone the does however jumped with a start and gazed in fright in every direction  told you i seen where your bullet hit thet pinehalf a foot over his shoulder try again an aim at his legs  roy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger a puff of dust right at the feet of the buck showed where roys lead had struck this time with a single bound wonderful to see the big deer was out of sight behind trees and brush the does leaped after him  doggone the luck ejaculated roy red in the face as he worked the lever of his rifle never could shoot downhill nohow  his rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from bo  not for worlds would i have had you kill that beautiful deer she exclaimed  we wont have venison steak off him thats certain remarked dale dryly an maybe none off any deer if roy does the shootin  they resumed travel sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge of the intersecting canuon at length they rode down to the bottom where a tiny brook babbled through willows and they followed this for a mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream a dim trail overgrown with grass showed at this point  heres where we part said dale youll beat me into my camp but ill get there sometime after dark  hey milt i forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an the rest of your menagerie reckon they wont scare the girls especially old tom  you wont see tom till i get home replied dale  aint he corralled or tied up  no he has the run of the place  wal goodby then an rustle along  dale nodded to the girls and turning his horse he drove the packtrain before him up the open space between the stream and the wooded slope  roy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a feat to helen  guess id better cinch up he said as he threw a stirrup up over the pommel of his saddle you girls are goin to see wild country  whos old tom queried bo curiously  why hes milts pet cougar  cougar thats a panthera mountainlion didnt he say  shore is tom is a beauty an if he takes a likin to you hell love you play with you maul you half to death  bo was all eyes  dale has other pets too she questioned eagerly  i never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an squirrels an vermin of all kinds as tame as tame as cows too darn tame milt says but i cant figger thet you girls will never want to leave thet senaca of his  whats a senaca asked helen as she shifted her foot to let him tighten the cinches on her saddle  thets mexican for park i guess he replied these mountains are full of parks an say i dont ever want to see no prettier place till i get to heaven there ranger old boy thets tight  he slapped the horse affectionately and turning to his own he stepped and swung his long length up  it aint deep crossin here come on he called and spurred his bay  the stream here was wide and it looked deep but turned out to be deceptive  wal girls here beginneth the second lesson he drawled cheerily ride one behind the otherstick close to medo what i doan holler when you want to rest or if somethin goes bad  with that he spurred into the thicket bo went next and helen followed the willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch roy and the result was that a lowsweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard on the head it hurt and startled her and roused her mettle roy was keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well and he led up a slope to the open pine forest here the ride for several miles was straight level and open helen liked the forest today it was brown and green with patches of gold where the sun struck she saw her first birdbig blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse and little checkered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing several times roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle and often when he pointed helen was not quick enough to see  helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of yesterday so far she had been only barely conscious of sore places and aching bones these she would bear with she loved the wild and the beautiful both of which increased manifestly with every mile the sun was warm the air fragrant and cool the sky blue as azure and so deep that she imagined that she could look far up into it  suddenly roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short  look he called sharply  bo screamed  not thet way here aw hes gone  nell it was a bear i saw it oh not like circus bears at all cried bo  helen had missed her opportunity  reckon he was a grizzly an im jest as well pleased thet he loped off said roy altering his course somewhat he led to an old rotten log that the bear had been digging in after grubs there see his track he was a whopper shore enough  they rode on out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range gorge and ridge green and black as far as helen could see the ranges were bold and long climbing to the central uplift where a number of fringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of old baldy far as vision could see to the right lay one rolling forest of pine beautiful and serene somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert but it was not in sight  i see turkeys way down there said roy backing away well go down and around an mebbe ill get a shot  descent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush this slope consisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and many oaks helen was delighted to see the familiar trees although these were different from missouri oaks rugged and gnarled but not tall these trees spread wide branches the leaves of which were yellowing roy led into a grassy glade and leaping off his horse rifle in hand he prepared to shoot at something again bo cried out but this time it was in delight then helen saw an immense flock of turkeys apparently like the turkeys she knew at home but these had bronze and checks of white and they looked wild there must have been a hundred in the flock most of them hens a few gobblers on the far side began the flight running swiftly off helen plainly heard the thud of their feet roy shot oncetwicethree times then rose a great commotion and thumping and a loud roar of many wings dust and leaves whirling in the air were left where the turkeys had been  wal i got two said roy and he strode forward to pick up his game returning he tied two shiny plump gobblers back of his saddle and remounted his horse well have turkey tonight if milt gets to camp in time  the ride was resumed helen never would have tired riding through those oak groves brown and sear and yellow with leaves and acorns falling  bears have been workin in here already said roy i see tracks all over they eat acorns in the fall an mebbe well run into one yet  the farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees so that dodging branches was no light task ranger did not seem to care how close he passed a tree or under a limb so that he missed them himself but helen thereby got some additional bruises particularly hard was it when passing a tree to get her knee out of the way in time  roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation and in places covered with a thick scum but it had a current and an outlet proving it to be a huge spring roy pointed down at a muddy place  bearwallow he heard us comin look at thet little track cub track an look at these scratches on this tree higher n my head an old shebear stood up an scratched them  roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree  woodss full of big bears he said grinning an i take it particular kind of this old she rustlin off with her cub shebears with cubs are dangerous  the next place to stir helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom of this canuon beechtrees maples aspens overtopped by lofty pines made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown swirling current and leaves drifted down and stray flecks of golden sunlight lightened the gloom here was hard riding to and fro across the brook between huge mossy boulders and between aspens so close together that helen could scarce squeeze her knees through  once more roy climbed out of that canuon over a ridge into another down long wooded slopes and through scruboak thickets on and on till the sun stood straight overhead then he halted for a short rest unsaddled the horses to let them roll and gave the girls some cold lunch that he had packed he strolled off with his gun and upon returning resaddled and gave the word to start  that was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls the forest that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines so steep of slope as to make precarious travel mostly he kept to the bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail but it was necessary to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed and this crossing was work  the locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close knit they tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders ranger appeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less bos white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place on the other hand some of these steep slopes were comparatively free of underbrush great firs and pines loomed up on all sides the earth was soft and the hoofs sank deep toward the bottom of a descent ranger would brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches this mode facilitated travel but it frightened helen the climb out then on the other side had to be done on foot  after half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way helens strength was spent and her breath was gone she felt lightheaded she could not get enough air her feet felt like lead and her ridingcoat was a burden a hundred times hot and wet and throbbing she was compelled to stop always she had been a splendid walker and climber and here to break up the long ride she was glad to be on her feet but she could only drag one foot up after the other then when her nose began to bleed she realized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble her heart however did not hurt her though she was conscious of an oppression on her breast  at last roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest verdure that it appeared impossible to cross nevertheless he started down dismounting after a little way helen found that leading ranger down was worse than riding him he came fast and he would step right in her tracks she was not quick enough to get away from him twice he stepped on her foot and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and threw her flat when he began to slide near the bottom helen had to run for her life  oh nell isntthisgreat panted bo from somewhere ahead  boyourmindsgone panted helen in reply  roy tried several places to climb out and failed in each leading down the ravine for a hundred yards or more he essayed another attempt here there had been a slide and in part the earth was bare when he had worked up this he halted above and called  bad place keep on the up side of the hosses  this appeared easier said than done helen could not watch bo because ranger would not wait he pulled at the bridle and snorted  faster you come the better called roy  helen could not see the sense of that but she tried roy and bo had dug a deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide helen made the mistake of starting to follow in their tracks and when she realized this ranger was climbing fast almost dragging her and it was too late to get above helen began to labor she slid down right in front of ranger the intelligent animal with a snort plunged out of the trail to keep from stepping on her then he was above her  lookout down there yelled roy in warning get on the up side  but that did not appear possible the earth began to slide under ranger and that impeded helens progress he got in advance of her straining on the bridle  let go yelled roy  helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with ranger he snorted fiercely and rearing high in a mighty plunge he gained solid ground helen was buried to her knees but extricating herself she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther  bad cavein thet was roys comment when at last she joined him and bo at the top  roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go he rode to high ground and looked in all directions to helen one way appeared as wild and rough as another and all was yellow green and black under the westering sun roy rode a short distance in one direction then changed for another  presently he stopped  wal im shore turned round he said  youre not lost cried bo  reckon ive been thet for a couple of hours he replied cheerfully never did ride across here i had the direction but im blamed now if i can tell which way thet was  helen gazed at him in consternation  lost she echoed    chapter ix  a silence ensued fraught with poignant fear for helen as she gazed into bos whitening face she read her sisters mind bo was remembering tales of lost people who never were found  me an milt get lost every day said roy you dont suppose any man can know all this big country its nothin for us to be lost  oh i was lost when i was little said bo  wal i reckon itd been better not to tell you so offhand like replied roy contritely dont feel bad now all i need is a peek at old baldy then ill have my bearin come on  helens confidence returned as roy led off at a fast trot he rode toward the westering sun keeping to the ridge they had ascended until once more he came out upon a promontory old baldy loomed there blacker and higher and closer the dark forest showed round yellow bare spots like parks  not so far off the track said roy as he wheeled his horse well make camp in milts senaca tonight  he led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude where the character of the forest changed the trees were no longer pines but firs and spruce growing thin and exceedingly tall with few branches below the topmost foliage so dense was this forest that twilight seemed to have come  travel was arduous everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided and not a rod was there without a fallen tree the horses laboring slowly sometimes sank kneedeep into the brown duff gray moss festooned the treetrunks and an ambergreen moss grew thick on the rotting logs  helen loved this forest primeval it was so still so dark so gloomy so full of shadows and shade and a dank smell of rotting wood and sweet fragrance of spruce the great windfalls where trees were jammed together in dozens showed the savagery of the storms wherever a single monarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons jealous of one another fighting for place even the trees fought one another the forest was a place of mystery but its strife could be read by any eye the lightnings had split firs clear to the roots and others it had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk  time came however when the exceeding wildness of the forest in density and fallen timber made it imperative for helen to put all her attention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity so the pleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her thereafter travel became toil and the hours endless  roy led on and ranger followed while the shadows darkened under the trees she was reeling in her saddle half blind and sick when roy called out cheerily that they were almost there  whatever his idea was to helen it seemed many miles that she followed him farther out of the heavytimbered forest down upon slopes of low spruce like evergreen which descended sharply to another level where dark shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low murmur of falling water and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful park full of a thick rich golden light of fastfading sunset  smell the smoke said roy by solomon if milt aint here ahead of me  he rode on helens weary gaze took in the round senaca the circling black slopes leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the last flare of the sun then all the spirit left in her flashed up in thrilling wonder at this exquisite wild and colorful spot  horses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing with them roy led round a corner of the fringed bordering woodland and there under lofty trees shone a campfire huge gray rocks loomed beyond and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain wall over which poured a thin lacy waterfall as helen gazed in rapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the amphitheater darkened  dales tall form appeared  reckon youre late he said as with a comprehensive flash of eye he took in the three  milt i got lost replied roy  i feared as much you girls look like youd done better to ride with me went on dale as he offered a hand to help bo off she took it tried to get her foot out of the stirrups and then she slid from the saddle into dales arms he placed her on her feet and supporting her said solicitously a hundredmile ride in three days for a tenderfoot is somethin your uncle al wont believe come walk if it kills you  whereupon he led bo very much as if he were teaching a child to walk the fact that the voluble bo had nothing to say was significant to helen who was following with the assistance of roy  one of the huge rocks resembled a seashell in that it contained a hollow over which the widespreading shelf flared out it reached toward branches of great pines a spring burst from a crack in the solid rock the campfire blazed under a pine and the blue column of smoke rose just in front of the shelving rock packs were lying on the grass and some of them were open there were no signs here of a permanent habitation of the hunter but farther on were other huge rocks leaning cracked and forming caverns some of which perhaps he utilized  my camp is just back said dale as if he had read helens mind tomorrow well fix up comfortablelike round here for you girls  helen and bo were made as easy as blankets and saddles could make them and the men went about their tasks  nellisnt thisa dream murmured bo  no child its realterribly real replied helen now that were herewith that awful ride overwe can think  its so prettyhere yawned bo id just as lief uncle al didnt find us very soon  bo hes a sick man think what the worry will be to him  ill bet if he knows dale he wont be so worried  dale told us uncle al disliked him  pooh what difference does that make oh i dont know which i amhungrier or tireder  i couldnt eat tonight said helen wearily  when she stretched out she had a vague delicious sensation that that was the end of helen rayner and she was glad above her through the lacy fernlike pineneedles she saw blue sky and a pale star just showing twilight was stealing down swiftly the silence was beautiful seemingly undisturbed by the soft silky dreamy fall of water helen closed her eyes ready for sleep with the physical commotion within her body gradually yielding in some places her bones felt as if they had come out through her flesh in others throbbed deepseated aches her muscles appeared slowly to subside to relax with the quivering twinges ceasing one by one through muscle and bone through all her body pulsed a burning current  bos head dropped on helens shoulder sense became vague to helen she lost the low murmur of the waterfall and then the sound or feeling of some one at the campfire and her last conscious thought was that she tried to open her eyes and could not  when she awoke all was bright the sun shone almost directly overhead helen was astounded bo lay wrapped in deep sleep her face flushed with beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp helen threw down the blankets and then gathering couragefor she felt as if her back was brokenshe endeavored to sit up in vain her spirit was willing but her muscles refused to act it must take a violent spasmodic effort she tried it with shut eyes and succeeding sat there trembling the commotion she had made in the blankets awoke bo and she blinked her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight  hellonell do i have toget up she asked sleepily  can you queried helen  can i what bo was now thoroughly awake and lay there staring at her sister  whyget up  id like to know why not retorted bo as she made the effort she got one arm and shoulder up only to flop back like a crippled thing and she uttered the most piteous little moan im dead i knowi am  well if youre going to be a western girl youd better have spunk enough to move  ahuh ejaculated bo then she rolled over not without groans and once upon her face she raised herself on her hands and turned to a sitting posture wheres everybody oh nell its perfectly lovely here paradise  helen looked around a fire was smoldering no one was in sight wonderful distant colors seemed to strike her glance as she tried to fix it upon nearby objects a beautiful little green tent or shack had been erected out of spruce boughs it had a slanting roof that sloped all the way from a ridgepole to the ground half of the opening in front was closed as were the sides the spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in the same direction giving it a smooth compact appearance actually as if it had grown there  that leanto wasnt there last night inquired bo  i didnt see it leanto whered you get that name  its western my dear ill bet they put it up for us sure i see our bags inside lets get up it must be late  the girls had considerable fun as well as pain in getting up and keeping each other erect until their limbs would hold them firmly they were delighted with the spruce leanto it faced the open and stood just under the widespreading shelf of rock the tiny outlet from the spring flowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone to fall into a little pool the floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips of spruce boughs to about a foot in depth all laid one way smooth and springy and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating helen and bo opened their baggage and what with use of the cold water brush and comb and clean blouses they made themselves feel as comfortable as possible considering the excruciating aches then they went out to the campfire  helens eye was attracted by moving objects near at hand then simultaneously with bos cry of delight helen saw a beautiful doe approaching under the trees dale walked beside it  you sure had a long sleep was the hunters greeting i reckon you both look better  good morning or is it afternoon were just able to move about said helen  i could ride declared bo stoutly oh nell look at the deer its coming to me  the doe had hung back a little as dale reached the campfire it was a gray slender creature smooth as silk with great dark eyes it stood a moment long ears erect and then with a graceful little trot came up to bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand all about it except the beautiful soft eyes seemed wild and yet it was as tame as a kitten then suddenly as bo fondled the long ears it gave a start and breaking away ran back out of sight under the pines  what frightened it asked bo  dale pointed up at the wall under the shelving roof of rock there twenty feet from the ground curled up on a ledge lay a huge tawny animal with a face like that of a cat  shes afraid of tom replied dale recognizes him as a hereditary foe i guess i cant make friends of them  oh so thats tomthe pet lion exclaimed bo ugh no wonder that deer ran off  how long has he been up there queried helen gazing fascinated at dales famous pet  i couldnt say tom comes an goes replied dale but i sent him up there last night  and he was thereperfectly freeright over uswhile we slept burst out bo  yes an i reckon you slept the safer for that  of all things nell isnt he a monster but he doesnt look like a lionan african lion hes a panther i saw his like at the circus once  hes a cougar said dale the panther is long and slim tom is not only long but thick an round ive had him four years an he was a kitten no bigger n my fist when i got him  is he perfectly tamesafe asked helen anxiously  ive never told anybody that tom was safe but he is replied dale you can absolutely believe it a wild cougar wouldnt attack a man unless cornered or starved an tom is like a big kitten  the beast raised his great catlike face with its sleepy halfshut eyes and looked down upon them  shall i call him down inquired dale  for once bo did not find her voice  let usget a little more used to himat a distance replied helen with a little laugh  if he comes to you just rub his head an youll see how tame he is said dale reckon youre both hungry  not so very returned helen aware of his penetrating gray gaze upon her  well i am vouchsafed bo  soon as the turkeys done well eat my camp is round between the rocks ill call you  not until his broad back was turned did helen notice that the hunter looked different then she saw he wore a lighter cleaner suit of buckskin with no coat and instead of the highheeled horsemans boots he wore moccasins and leggings the change made him appear more lithe  nell i dont know what you think but i call him handsome declared bo  helen had no idea what she thought  lets try to walk some she suggested  so they essayed that painful task and got as far as a pine log some few rods from their camp this point was close to the edge of the park from which there was an unobstructed view  my what a place exclaimed bo with eyes wide and round  oh beautiful breathed helen  an unexpected blaze of color drew her gaze first out of the black spruce slopes shone patches of aspens gloriously red and gold and low down along the edge of timber troops of aspens ran out into the park not yet so blazing as those above but purple and yellow and white in the sunshine masses of silver spruce like trees in moonlight bordered the park sending out here and there an isolated tree sharp as a spear with underbranches close to the ground long goldengreen grass resembling halfripe wheat covered the entire floor of the park gently waving to the wind above sheered the black goldpatched slopes steep and unscalable rising to buttresses of dark ironhued rock and to the east circled the rows of cliffbench gray and old and fringed splitting at the top in the notch where the lacy slumberous waterfall like white smoke fell and vanished to reappear in wider sheet of lace only to fall and vanish again in the green depths  it was a verdant valley deepset in the mountain walls wild and sad and lonesome the waterfall dominated the spirit of the place dreamy and sleepy and tranquil it murmured sweetly on one breath of wind and lulled with another and sometimes died out altogether only to come again in soft strange roar  paradise park whispered bo to herself  a call from dale disturbed their raptures turning they hobbled with eager but painful steps in the direction of a larger campfire situated to the right of the great rock that sheltered their leanto no hut or house showed there and none was needed hidingplaces and homes for a hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs split off in bygone ages from the mountain wall above a few stately pines stood out from the rocks and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown brook this camp was only a step from the leanto round the corner of a huge rock yet it had been out of sight here indeed was evidence of a hunters homepelts and skins and antlers a neat pile of split firewood a long ledge of rock well sheltered and loaded with bags like a huge pantryshelf packs and ropes and saddles tools and weapons and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp  hyaryou git shouted dale and he threw a stick at something a bear cub scampered away in haste he was small and woolly and brown and he grunted as he ran soon he halted  thats bud said dale as the girls came up guess he near starved in my absence an now he wants everythin especially the sugar we dont have sugar often up here  isnt he dear oh i love him cried bo come back bud come buddie  the cub however kept his distance watching dale with bright little eyes  wheres mr roy asked helen  roys gone he was sorry not to say goodby but its important he gets down in the pines on ansons trail hell hang to anson an in case they get near pine hell ride in to see where your uncle is  what do you expect questioned helen gravely  most anythin he replied al i reckon knows now maybe hes rustlin into the mountains by this time if he meets up with anson well an good for roy wont be far off an sure if he runs across roy why theyll soon be here but if i were you i wouldnt count on seein your uncle very soon im sorry ive done my best it sure is a bad deal  dont think me ungracious replied helen hastily how plainly he had intimated that it must be privation and annoyance for her to be compelled to accept his hospitality you are goodkind i owe you much ill be eternally grateful  dale straightened as he looked at her his glance was intent piercing he seemed to be receiving a strange or unusual portent no need for him to say he had never before been spoken to like that  you may have to stay here with mefor weeksmaybe monthsif weve the bad luck to get snowed in he said slowly as if startled at this deduction youre safe here no sheepthief could ever find this camp ill take risks to get you safe into als hands but im goin to be pretty sure about what im doin sotheres plenty to eat an its a pretty place  pretty why its grand exclaimed bo ive called it paradise park  paradise park he repeated weighing the words youve named it an also the creek paradise creek ive been here twelve years with no fit name for my home till you said that  oh that pleases me returned bo with shining eyes  eat now said dale an i reckon youll like that turkey  there was a clean tarpaulin upon which were spread steaming fragrant pansroast turkey hot biscuits and gravy mashed potatoes as white as if prepared at home stewed dried apples and butter and coffee this bounteous repast surprised and delighted the girls when they had once tasted the roast wild turkey then milt dale had occasion to blush at their encomiums  i hopeuncle aldoesnt come for a month declared bo as she tried to get her breath there was a brown spot on her nose and one on each cheek suspiciously close to her mouth  dale laughed it was pleasant to hear him for his laugh seemed unused and deep as if it came from tranquil depths  wont you eat with us asked helen  reckon i will he said itll save time an hot grub tastes better  quite an interval of silence ensued which presently was broken by dale  here comes tom  helen observed with a thrill that the cougar was magnificent seen erect on allfours approaching with slow sinuous grace his color was tawny with spots of whitish gray he had bowlegs big and round and furry and a huge head with great tawny eyes no matter how tame he was said to be he looked wild like a dog he walked right up and it so happened that he was directly behind bo within reach of her when she turned  oh lord cried bo and up went both of her hands in one of which was a huge piece of turkey tom took it not viciously but nevertheless with a snap that made helen jump as if by magic the turkey vanished and tom took a closer step toward bo her expression of fright changed to consternation  he stole my turkey  tom come here ordered dale sharply the cougar glided round rather sheepishly now lie down an behave  tom crouched on allfours his head resting on his paws with his beautiful tawny eyes light and piercing fixed upon the hunter  dont grab said dale holding out a piece of turkey whereupon tom took it less voraciously  as it happened the little bear cub saw this transaction and he plainly indicated his opinion of the preference shown to tom  oh the dear exclaimed bo he means its not fair come budcome on  but bud would not approach the group until called by dale then he scrambled to them with every manifestation of delight bo almost forgot her own needs in feeding him and getting acquainted with him tom plainly showed his jealousy of bud and bud likewise showed his fear of the great cat  helen could not believe the evidence of her eyesthat she was in the woods calmly and hungrily partaking of sweet wildflavored meatthat a fullgrown mountain lion lay on one side of her and a baby brown bear sat on the otherthat a strange hunter a man of the forest there in his lonely and isolated fastness appealed to the romance in her and interested her as no one else she had ever met  when the wonderful meal was at last finished bo enticed the bear cub around to the camp of the girls and there soon became great comrades with him helen watching bo play was inclined to envy her no matter where bo was placed she always got something out of it she adapted herself she who could have a good time with almost any one or anything would find the hours sweet and fleeting in this beautiful park of wild wonders  but merely objective actionsmerely physical movements had never yet contented helen she could run and climb and ride and play with hearty and healthy abandon but those things would not suffice long for her and her mind needed food helen was a thinker one reason she had desired to make her home in the west was that by taking up a life of the open of action she might think and dream and brood less and here she was in the wild west after the three most strenuously active days of her career and still the same old giant revolved her mind and turned it upon herself and upon all she saw  what can i do she asked bo almost helplessly  why rest you silly retorted bo you walk like an old crippled woman with only one leg  helen hoped the comparison was undeserved but the advice was sound the blankets spread out on the grass looked inviting and they felt comfortably warm in the sunshine the breeze was slow languorous fragrant and it brought the low hum of the murmuring waterfall like a melody of bees helen made a pillow and lay down to rest the green pineneedles so thin and fine in their crisscross network showed clearly against the blue sky she looked in vain for birds then her gaze went wonderingly to the lofty fringed rim of the great amphitheater and as she studied it she began to grasp its remoteness how far away it was in the rarefied atmosphere a black eagle sweeping along looked of tiny size and yet he was far under the heights above how pleasant she fancied it to be up there and drowsy fancy lulled her to sleep  helen slept all afternoon and upon awakening toward sunset found bo curled beside her dale had thoughtfully covered them with a blanket also he had built a campfire the air was growing keen and cold  later when they had put their coats on and made comfortable seats beside the fire dale came over apparently to visit them  i reckon you cant sleep all the time he said an bein city girls youll get lonesome  lonesome echoed helen the idea of her being lonesome here had not occurred to her  ive thought that all out went on dale as he sat down indian fashion before the blaze its natural youd find time drag up here bein used to lots of people an goinson an work an all girls like  id never be lonesome here replied helen with her direct force  dale did not betray surprise but he showed that his mistake was something to ponder over  excuse me he said presently as his gray eyes held hers thats how i had it as i remember girlsan it doesnt seem long since i left homemost of them would die of lonesomeness up here then he addressed himself to bo how about you you see i figured youd be the one that liked it an your sister the one who wouldnt  i wont get lonesome very soon replied bo  im glad it worried me somenot ever havin girls as company before an in a day or so when youre rested ill help you pass the time  bos eyes were full of flashing interest and helen asked him how  it was a sincere expression of her curiosity and not doubtful or ironic challenge of an educated woman to a man of the forest but as a challenge he took it  how he repeated and a strange smile flitted across his face why by givin you rides an climbs to beautiful places an then if youre interested to show you how little socalled civilized people know of nature  helen realized then that whatever his calling hunter or wanderer or hermit he was not uneducated even if he appeared illiterate  ill be happy to learn from you she said  me too chimed in bo you cant tell too much to any one from missouri  he smiled and that warmed helen to him for then he seemed less removed from other people about this hunter there began to be something of the very nature of which he spokea stillness aloofness an unbreakable tranquillity a cold clear spirit like that in the mountain air a physical something not unlike the tamed wildness of his pets or the strength of the pines  ill bet i can tell you more n youll ever remember he said  what ll you bet retorted bo  well more roast turkey againstsay somethin nice when youre safe an home to your uncle als runnin his ranch  agreed nell you hear  helen nodded her head  all right well leave it to nell began dale half seriously now ill tell you first for the fun of passin time well ride an race my horses out in the park an well fish in the brooks an hunt in the woods theres an old silvertip around that you can see me kill an well climb to the peaks an see wonderful sights so much for that now if you really want to learnor if you only want me to tell youwell thats no matter only ill win the bet youll see how this park lies in the crater of a volcano an was once full of wateran how the snow blows in on one side in winter a hundred feet deep when theres none on the other an the treeshow they grow an live an fight one another an depend on one another an protect the forest from stormwinds an how they hold the water that is the fountains of the great rivers an how the creatures an things that live in them or on them are good for them an neither could live without the other an then ill show you my pets tame an untamed an tell you how its man that makes any creature wildhow easy they are to tamean how they learn to love you an theres the life of the forest the strife of ithow the bear lives an the cats an the wolves an the deer youll see how cruel nature is how savage an wild the wolf or cougar tears down the deerhow a wolf loves fresh hot blood an how a cougar unrolls the skin of a deer back from his neck an youll see that this cruelty of naturethis work of the wolf an cougaris what makes the deer so beautiful an healthy an swift an sensitive without his deadly foes the deer would deteriorate an die out an youll see how this principle works out among all creatures of the forest strife its the meanin of all creation an the salvation if youre quick to see youll learn that the nature here in the wilds is the same as that of menonly men are no longer cannibals trees fight to livebirds fightanimals fightmen fight they all live off one another an its this fightin that brings them all closer an closer to bein perfect but nothin will ever be perfect  but how about religion interrupted helen earnestly  nature has a religion an its to liveto growto reproduce each of its kind  but that is not god or the immortality of the soul declared helen  well its as close to god an immortality as nature ever gets  oh you would rob me of my religion  no i just talk as i see life replied dale reflectively as he poked a stick into the red embers of the fire maybe i have a religion i dont know but its not the kind you havenot the bible kind that kind doesnt keep the men in pine an snowdrop an all oversheepmen an ranchers an farmers an travelers such as ive knownthe religion they profess doesnt keep them from lyin cheatin stealin an killin i reckon no man who lives as i dowhich perhaps is my religionwill lie or cheat or steal or kill unless its to kill in selfdefense or like id do if snake anson would ride up here now my religion maybe is love of lifewild life as it was in the beginninan the wind that blows secrets from everywhere an the water that sings all day an night an the stars that shine constant an the trees that speak somehow an the rocks that arent dead im never alone here or on the trails theres somethin unseen but always with me an thats it call it god if you like but what stalls me iswhere was that spirit when this earth was a ball of fiery gas where will that spirit be when all life is frozen out or burned out on this globe an it hangs dead in space like the moon that time will come theres no waste in nature not the littlest atom is destroyed it changes thats all as you see this pine wood go up in smoke an feel somethin thats heat come out of it where does that go its not lost nothin is lost so the beautiful an savin thought is maybe all rock an wood water an blood an flesh are resolved back into the elements to come to life somewhere again sometime  oh what you say is wonderful but its terrible exclaimed helen he had struck deep into her soul  terrible i reckon he replied sadly  then ensued a little interval of silence  milt dale i lose the bet declared bo with earnestness behind her frivolity  id forgotten that reckon i talked a lot he said apologetically you see i dont get much chance to talk except to myself or tom years ago when i found the habit of silence settlin down on me i took to thinkin out loud an talkin to anythin  i could listen to you all night returned bo dreamily  do you readdo you have books inquired helen suddenly  yes i read tolerable well a good deal better than i talk or write he replied i went to school till i was fifteen always hated study but liked to read years ago an old friend of mine down here at pinewidow cassshe gave me a lot of old books an i packed them up here winters the time i read  conversation lagged after that except for desultory remarks and presently dale bade the girls good night and left them helen watched his tall form vanish in the gloom under the pines and after he had disappeared she still stared  nell called bo shrilly ive called you three times i want to go to bed  oh ii was thinking rejoined helen half embarrassed half wondering at herself i didnt hear you  i should smile you didnt retorted bo wish you could just have seen your eyes nell do you want me to tell you something  whyyes said helen rather feebly she did not at all when bo talked like that  youre going to fall in love with that wild hunter declared bo in a voice that rang like a bell  helen was not only amazed but enraged she caught her breath preparatory to giving this incorrigible sister a piece of her mind bo went calmly on  i can feel it in my bones  bo youre a little foola sentimental romancing gushy little fool retorted helen all you seem to hold in your head is some rot about love to hear you talk one would think theres nothing else in the world but love  bos eyes were bright shrewd affectionate and laughing as she bent their steady gaze upon helen  nell thats just it there is nothing else    chapter x  the night of sleep was so short that it was difficult for helen to believe that hours had passed bo appeared livelier this morning with less complaint of aches  nell youve got color exclaimed bo and your eyes are bright isnt the morning perfectly lovely couldnt you get drunk on that air i smell flowers and oh im hungry  bo our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your appetite holds said helen as she tried to keep her hair out of her eyes while she laced her boots  look theres a big doga hound  helen looked as bo directed and saw a hound of unusually large proportions black and tan in color with long drooping ears curiously he trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at them his head was noble his eyes shone dark and sad he seemed neither friendly nor unfriendly  hello doggie come right inwe wont hurt you called bo but without enthusiasm  this made helen laugh bo youre simply delicious she said youre afraid of that dog  sure wonder if hes dales of course he must be  presently the hound trotted away out of sight when the girls presented themselves at the campfire they espied their curious canine visitor lying down his ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground  i sent pedro over to wake you girls up said dale after greeting them did he scare you  pedro so thats his name no he didnt exactly scare me he did nell though shes an awful tenderfoot replied bo  hes a splendidlooking dog said helen ignoring her sisters sally i love dogs will he make friends  hes shy an wild you see when i leave camp he wont hang around he an tom are jealous of each other i had a pack of hounds an lost all but pedro on account of tom i think you can make friends with pedro try it  whereupon helen made overtures to pedro and not wholly in vain the dog was matured of almost stern aloofness and manifestly not used to people his deep winedark eyes seemed to search helens soul they were honest and wise with a strange sadness  he looks intelligent observed helen as she smoothed the long dark ears  that hound is nigh human responded dale come an while you eat ill tell you about pedro  dale had gotten the hound as a pup from a mexican sheepherder who claimed he was part california bloodhound he grew up becoming attached to dale in his younger days he did not get along well with dales other pets and dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley pedro was back in dales camp next day from that day dale began to care more for the hound but he did not want to keep him for various reasons chief of which was the fact that pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half the time to shift for himself that fall dale had need to go to the farthest village snowdrop where he left pedro with a friend then dale rode to show down and pine and the camp of the beemans and with them he trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles over into new mexico the snow was flying when dale got back to his camp in the mountains and there was pedro gaunt and worn overjoyed to welcome him home roy beeman visited dale that october and told that dales friend in snowdrop had not been able to keep pedro he broke a chain and scaled a tenfoot fence to escape he trailed dale to show down where one of dales friends recognizing the hound caught him and meant to keep him until dales return but pedro refused to eat it happened that a freighter was going out to the beeman camp and dales friend boxed pedro up and put him on the wagon pedro broke out of the box returned to show down took up dales trail to pine and then on to the beeman camp that was as far as roy could trace the movements of the hound but he believed and so did dale that pedro had trailed them out on the wildhorse hunt the following spring dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at whose camp he and the beemans had rested on the way into new mexico it appeared that after dale had left this camp pedro had arrived and another mexican herder had stolen the hound but pedro got away  an he was here when i arrived concluded dale smiling i never wanted to get rid of him after that hes turned out to be the finest dog i ever knew he knows what i say he can almost talk an i swear he can cry he does whenever i start off without him  how perfectly wonderful exclaimed bo arent animals great but i love horses best  it seemed to helen that pedro understood they were talking about him for he looked ashamed and swallowed hard and dropped his gaze she knew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners this story of dales however was stranger than any she had ever heard  tom the cougar put in an appearance then and there was scarcely love in the tawny eyes he bent upon pedro but the hound did not deign to notice him tom sidled up to bo who sat on the farther side of the tarpaulin tablecloth and manifestly wanted part of her breakfast  gee i love the look of him she said but when hes close he makes my flesh creep  beasts are as queer as people observed dale they take likes an dislikes i believe tom has taken a shine to you an pedro begins to be interested in your sister i can tell  wheres bud inquired bo  hes asleep or around somewhere now soon as i get the work done what would you girls like to do  ride declared bo eagerly  arent you sore an stiff  i am that but i dont care besides when i used to go out to my uncles farm near saint joe i always found riding to be a cure for aches  sure is if you can stand it an what will your sister like to do returned dale turning to helen  oh ill rest and watch you folksand dream replied helen  but after youve rested you must be active said dale seriously you must do things it doesnt matter what just as long as you dont sit idle  why queried helen in surprise why not be idle here in this beautiful wild place just to dream away the hoursthe days i could do it  but you mustnt it took me years to learn how bad that was for me an right now i would love nothin more than to forget my work my horses an petseverythin an just lay around seein an feelin  seeing and feeling yes that must be what i mean but whywhat is it there are the beauty and colorthe wild shaggy slopesthe gray cliffsthe singing windthe lulling waterthe cloudsthe sky and the silence loneliness sweetness of it all  its a driftin back what i love to do an yet fear most its what makes a lone hunter of a man an it can grow so strong that it binds a man to the wilds  how strange murmured helen but that could never bind me why i must live and fulfil my mission my work in the civilized world  it seemed to helen that dale almost imperceptibly shrank at her earnest words  the ways of nature are strange he said i look at it different natures just as keen to wean you back to a savage state as you are to be civilized an if nature won you would carry out her design all the better  this hunters talk shocked helen and yet stimulated her mind  mea savage oh no she exclaimed but if that were possible what would natures design be  you spoke of your mission in life he replied a womans mission is to have children the female of any species has only one missionto reproduce its kind an nature has only one missiontoward greater strength virility efficiencyabsolute perfection which is unattainable  what of mental and spiritual development of man and woman asked helen  both are direct obstacles to the design of nature nature is physical to create for limitless endurance for eternal life that must be natures inscrutable design an why she must fail  but the soul whispered helen  ah when you speak of the soul an i speak of life we mean the same you an i will have some talks while youre here i must brush up my thoughts  so must i it seems said helen with a slow smile she had been rendered grave and thoughtful but i guess ill risk dreaming under the pines  bo had been watching them with her keen blue eyes  nell itd take a thousand years to make a savage of you she said but a week will do for me  bo you were one before you left saint joe replied helen dont you remember that schoolteacher barnes who said you were a wildcat and an indian mixed he spanked you with a ruler  never he missed me retorted bo with red in her cheeks nell i wish youd not tell things about me when i was a kid  that was only two years ago expostulated helen in mild surprise  suppose it was i was a kid all right ill bet you bo broke up abruptly and tossing her head she gave tom a pat and then ran away around the corner of cliff wall  helen followed leisurely  say nell said bo when helen arrived at their little green ledgepole hut do you know that hunter fellow will upset some of your theories  maybe ill admit he amazes meand affronts me too im afraid replied helen what surprises me is that in spite of his evident lack of schooling hes not raw or crude hes elemental  sister dear wake up the mans wonderful you can learn more from him than you ever learned in your life so can i i always hated books anyway  when a little later dale approached carrying some bridles the hound pedro trotted at his heels  i reckon youd better ride the horse you had he said to bo  whatever you say but i hope you let me ride them all by and by  sure ive a mustang out there youll like but he pitches a little he rejoined and turned away toward the park the hound looked after him and then at helen  come pedro stay with me called helen  dale hearing her motioned the hound back obediently pedro trotted to her still shy and soberly watchful as if not sure of her intentions but with something of friendliness about him now helen found a soft restful seat in the sun facing the park and there composed herself for what she felt would be slow sweet idle hours pedro curled down beside her the tall form of dale stalked across the park out toward the straggling horses again she saw a deer grazing among them how erect and motionless it stood watching dale presently it bounded away toward the edge of the forest some of the horses whistled and ran kicking heels high in the air the shrill whistles rang clear in the stillness  gee look at them go exclaimed bo gleefully coming up to where helen sat bo threw herself down upon the fragrant pineneedles and stretched herself languorously like a lazy kitten there was something feline in her lithe graceful outline she lay flat and looked up through the pines  wouldnt it be great now she murmured dreamily half to herself if that las vegas cowboy would happen somehow to come and then an earthquake would shut us up here in this paradise valley so wed never get out  bo what would mother say to such talk as that gasped helen  but nell wouldnt it be great  it would be terrible  oh there never was any romance in you nell rayner replied bo that very thing has actually happened out here in this wonderful country of wild places you need not tell me sure its happened with the cliffdwellers and the indians and then white people every place i look makes me feel that nell youd have to see people in the moon through a telescope before youd believe that  im practical and sensible thank goodness  but for the sake of argument protested bo with flashing eyes suppose it might happen just to please me suppose we did get shut up here with dale and that cowboy we saw from the train shut in without any hope of ever climbing out what would you do would you give up and pine away and die or would you fight for life and whatever joy it might mean  selfpreservation is the first instinct replied helen surprised at a strange deep thrill in the depths of her id fight for life of course  yes well really when i think seriously i dont want anything like that to happen but just the same if it did happen i would glory in it  while they were talking dale returned with the horses  can you bridle an saddle your own horse he asked  no im ashamed to say i cant replied bo  time to learn then come on watch me first when i saddle mine  bo was all eyes while dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and then with slow plain action readjusted it next he smoothed the back of the horse shook out the blanket and folding it half over he threw it in place being careful to explain to bo just the right position he lifted his saddle in a certain way and put that in place and then he tightened the cinches  now you try he said  according to helens judgment bo might have been a western girl all her days but dale shook his head and made her do it over  that was better of course the saddle is too heavy for you to sling it up you can learn that with a light one now put the bridle on again dont be afraid of your hands he wont bite slip the bit in sideways there now lets see you mount  when bo got into the saddle dale continued you went up quick an light but the wrong way watch me  bo had to mount several times before dale was satisfied then he told her to ride off a little distance when bo had gotten out of earshot dale said to helen shell take to a horse like a duck takes to water then mounting he rode out after her  helen watched them trotting and galloping and running the horses round the grassy park and rather regretted she had not gone with them eventually bo rode back to dismount and fling herself down redcheeked and radiant with disheveled hair and curls damp on her temples how alive she seemed helens senses thrilled with the grace and charm and vitality of this surprising sister and she was aware of a sheer physical joy in her presence bo rested but she did not rest long she was soon off to play with bud then she coaxed the tame doe to eat out of her hand she dragged helen off for wild flowers curious and thoughtless by turns and at length she fell asleep quickly in a way that reminded helen of the childhood now gone forever  dale called them to dinner about four oclock as the sun was reddening the western rampart of the park helen wondered where the day had gone the hours had flown swiftly serenely bringing her scarcely a thought of her uncle or dread of her forced detention there or possible discovery by those outlaws supposed to be hunting for her after she realized the passing of those hours she had an intangible and indescribable feeling of what dale had meant about dreaming the hours away the nature of paradise park was inimical to the kind of thought that had habitually been hers she found the new thought absorbing yet when she tried to name it she found that after all she had only felt at the meal hour she was more than usually quiet she saw that dale noticed it and was trying to interest her or distract her attention he succeeded but she did not choose to let him see that she strolled away alone to her seat under the pine bo passed her once and cried tantalizingly  my nell but youre growing romantic  never before in helens life had the beauty of the evening star seemed so exquisite or the twilight so moving and shadowy or the darkness so charged with loneliness it was their environmentthe accompaniment of wild wolfmourn of the murmuring waterfall of this strange man of the forest and the unfamiliar elements among which he made his home   next morning her energy having returned helen shared bos lesson in bridling and saddling her horse and in riding bo however rode so fast and so hard that for helen to share her company was impossible and dale interested and amused yet anxious spent most of his time with bo it was thus that helen rode all over the park alone she was astonished at its size when from almost any point it looked so small the atmosphere deceived her how clearly she could see and she began to judge distance by the size of familiar things a horse looked at across the longest length of the park seemed very small indeed here and there she rode upon dark swift little brooks exquisitely clear and ambercolored and almost hidden from sight by the long grass these all ran one way and united to form a deeper brook that apparently wound under the cliffs at the west end and plunged to an outlet in narrow clefts when dale and bo came to her once she made inquiry and she was surprised to learn from dale that this brook disappeared in a hole in the rocks and had an outlet on the other side of the mountain sometime he would take them to the lake it formed  over the mountain asked helen again remembering that she must regard herself as a fugitive will it be safe to leave our hidingplace i forget so often why we are here  we would be better hidden over there than here replied dale the valley on that side is accessible only from that ridge an dont worry about bein found i told you roy beeman is watchin anson an his gang roy will keep between them an us  helen was reassured yet there must always linger in the background of her mind a sense of dread in spite of this she determined to make the most of her opportunity bo was a stimulus and so helen spent the rest of that day riding and tagging after her sister  the next day was less hard on helen activity rest eating and sleeping took on a wonderful new meaning to her she had really never known them as strange joys she rode she walked she climbed a little she dozed under her pinetree she worked helping dale at campfire tasks and when night came she said she did not know herself that fact haunted her in vague deep dreams upon awakening she forgot her resolve to study herself that day passed and then several more went swiftly before she adapted herself to a situation she had reason to believe might last for weeks and even months   it was afternoon that helen loved best of all the time of the day the sunrise was fresh beautiful the morning was windy fragrant the sunset was rosy glorious the twilight was sad changing and night seemed infinitely sweet with its stars and silence and sleep but the afternoon when nothing changed when all was serene when time seemed to halt that was her choice and her solace  one afternoon she had camp all to herself bo was riding dale had climbed the mountain to see if he could find any trace of tracks or see any smoke from campfire bud was nowhere to be seen nor any of the other pets tom had gone off to some sunny ledge where he could bask in the sun after the habit of the wilder brothers of his species pedro had not been seen for a night and a day a fact that helen had noted with concern however she had forgotten him and therefore was the more surprised to see him coming limping into camp on three legs  why pedro you have been fighting come here she called  the hound did not look guilty he limped to her and held up his right fore paw the action was unmistakable helen examined the injured member and presently found a piece of what looked like musselshell embedded deeply between the toes the wound was swollen bloody and evidently very painful pedro whined helen had to exert all the strength of her fingers to pull it out then pedro howled but immediately he showed his gratitude by licking her hand helen bathed his paw and bound it up  when dale returned she related the incident and showing the piece of shell she asked where did that come from are there shells in the mountains  once this country was under the sea replied dale ive found things that d make you wonder  under the sea ejaculated helen it was one thing to have read of such a strange fact but a vastly different one to realize it here among these lofty peaks dale was always showing her something or telling her something that astounded her  look here he said one day what do you make of that little bunch of aspens  they were on the farther side of the park and were resting under a pinetree the forest here encroached upon the park with its straggling lines of spruce and groves of aspen the little clump of aspens did not differ from hundreds helen had seen  i dont make anything particularly of it replied helen dubiously just a tiny grove of aspenssome very small some larger but none very big but its pretty with its green and yellow leaves fluttering and quivering  it doesnt make you think of a fight  fight no it certainly does not replied helen  well its as good an example of fight of strife of selfishness as you will find in the forest he said now come over you an bo an let me show you what i mean  come on nell cried bo with enthusiasm hell open our eyes some more  nothing loath helen went with them to the little clump of aspens  about a hundred altogether said dale theyre pretty well shaded by the spruces but they get the sunlight from east an south these little trees all came from the same seedlings theyre all the same age four of them stand say ten feet or more high an theyre as large around as my wrist heres one thats largest see how fullfoliaged he ishow he stands over most of the others but not so much over these four next to him they all stand close together very close you see most of them are no larger than my thumb look how few branches they have an none low down look at how few leaves do you see how all the branches stand out toward the east an southhow the leaves of course face the same way see how one branch of one tree bends aside one from another tree thats a fight for the sunlight here are onetwothree dead trees look i can snap them off an now look down under them here are little trees five feet highfour feet highdown to these only a foot high look how pale delicate fragile unhealthy they get so little sunshine they were born with the other trees but did not get an equal start position gives the advantage perhaps  dale led the girls around the little grove illustrating his words by action he seemed deeply in earnest  you understand its a fight for water an sun but mostly sun because if the leaves can absorb the sun the tree an roots will grow to grasp the needed moisture shade is deathslow death to the life of trees these little aspens are fightin for place in the sunlight it is a merciless battle they push an bend one anothers branches aside an choke them only perhaps half of these aspens will survive to make one of the larger clumps such as that one of fullgrown trees over there one season will give advantage to this saplin an next year to that one a few seasons advantage to one assures its dominance over the others but it is never sure of holdin that dominance an if wind or storm or a stronggrowin rival does not overthrow it then sooner or later old age will for there is absolute and continual fight what is true of these aspens is true of all the trees in the forest an of all plant life in the forest what is most wonderful to me is the tenacity of life  and next day dale showed them an even more striking example of this mystery of nature  he guided them on horseback up one of the thick verdantwooded slopes calling their attention at various times to the different growths until they emerged on the summit of the ridge where the timber grew scant and dwarfed at the edge of timberline he showed a gnarled and knotted sprucetree twisted out of all semblance to a beautiful spruce bent and stormblasted with almost bare branches all reaching one way the tree was a specter it stood alone it had little green upon it there seemed something tragic about its contortions but it was alive and strong it had no rivals to take sun or moisture its enemies were the snow and wind and cold of the heights  helen felt as the realization came to her the knowledge dale wished to impart that it was as sad as wonderful and as mysterious as it was inspiring at that moment there were both the sting and sweetness of lifethe pain and the joyin helens heart these strange facts were going to teach herto transform her and even if they hurt she welcomed them    chapter xi  ill ride you if it breaksmy neck panted bo passionately shaking her gloved fist at the gray pony  dale stood near with a broad smile on his face helen was within earshot watching from the edge of the park and she felt so fascinated and frightened that she could not call out for bo to stop the little gray mustang was a beauty cleanlimbed and racy with long black mane and tail and a fine spirited head there was a blanket strapped on his back but no saddle bo held the short halter that had been fastened in a hackamore knot round his nose she wore no coat her blouse was covered with grass and seeds and it was open at the neck her hair hung loose and disheveled one side of her face bore a stain of grass and dirt and a suspicion of blood the other was red and white her eyes blazed beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her cheeks as she began to strain on the halter pulling herself closer to the fiery pony the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and strong  bo had been defeated in her cherished and determined ambition to ride dales mustang and she was furious the mustang did not appear to be vicious or mean but he was spirited tricky mischievous and he had thrown her six times the scene of bos defeat was at the edge of the park where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall it also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang obviously placing him at a disadvantage dale did not bridle him because he had not been broken to a bridle and though it was harder for bo to try to ride him bareback there was less risk of her being hurt bo had begun in all eagerness and enthusiasm loving and petting the mustang which she named pony she had evidently anticipated an adventure but her smiling resolute face had denoted confidence pony had stood fairly well to be mounted and then had pitched and tossed until bo had slid off or been upset or thrown after each fall bo bounced up with less of a smile and more of spirit until now the western passion to master a horse had suddenly leaped to life within her it was no longer fun no more a daring circus trick to scare helen and rouse dales admiration the issue now lay between bo and the mustang  pony reared snorting tossing his head and pawing with front feet  pull him down yelled dale  bo did not have much weight but she had strength an she hauled with all her might finally bringing him down  now hold hard an take up rope an get in to him called dale good youre sure not afraid of him he sees that now hold him talk to him tell him youre goin to ride him pet him a little an when he quits shakin grab his mane an jump up an slide a leg over him then hook your feet under him hard as you can an stick on  if helen had not been so frightened for bo she would have been able to enjoy her other sensations creeping cold thrills chased over her as bo supple and quick slid an arm and a leg over pony and straightened up on him with a defiant cry pony jerked his head down brought his feet together in one jump and began to bounce bo got the swing of him this time and stayed on  youre ridin him yelled dale now squeeze hard with your knees crack him over the head with your rope thats the way hang on now an youll have him beat  the mustang pitched all over the space adjacent to dale and helen tearing up the moss and grass several times he tossed bo high but she slid back to grip him again with her legs and he could not throw her suddenly he raised his head and bolted dale answered bos triumphant cry but pony had not run fifty feet before he tripped and fell throwing bo far over his head as luck would have itgood luck dale afterward saidshe landed in a boggy place and the force of her momentum was such that she slid several yards face down in wet moss and black ooze  helen uttered a scream and ran forward bo was getting to her knees when dale reached her he helped her up and half led half carried her out of the boggy place bo was not recognizable from head to foot she was dripping black ooze  oh bo are you hurt cried helen  evidently bos mouth was full of mud  ppsutt ough whew she sputtered hurt no cant you see what i lit in dale the sunofagun didnt throw me he fell and i went over his head  right you sure rode him an he tripped an slung you a mile replied dale its lucky you lit in that bog  lucky with eyes and nose stopped up oooo im full of mud and my nicenew ridingsuit  bos tones indicated that she was ready to cry helen realizing bo had not been hurt began to laugh her sister was the funniestlooking object that had ever come before her eyes  nell raynerare youlaughingat me demanded bo in most righteous amaze and anger  me laughing nnever bo replied helen cant you see im justjust  see you idiot my eyes are full of mud flashed bo but i hear you illill get even  dale was laughing too but noiselessly and bo being blind for the moment could not be aware of that by this time they had reached camp helen fell flat and laughed as she had never laughed before when helen forgot herself so far as to roll on the ground it was indeed a laughing matter dales big frame shook as he possessed himself of a towel and wetting it at the spring began to wipe the mud off bos face but that did not serve bo asked to be led to the water where she knelt and with splashing washed out her eyes and then her face and then the bedraggled strands of hair  that mustang didnt break my neck but he rooted my face in the mud ill fix him she muttered as she got up please let me have the towel now well milt dale youre laughing  excuse me bo ihaw haw haw then dale lurched off holding his sides  bo gazed after him and then back at helen  i suppose if id been kicked and smashed and killed youd laugh she said and then she melted oh my pretty ridingsuit what a mess i must be a sight nell i rode that wild ponythe sunofagun i rode him thats enough for me you try it laugh all you want it was funny but if you want to square yourself with me help me clean my clothes   late in the night helen heard dale sternly calling pedro she felt some little alarm however nothing happened and she soon went to sleep again at the morning meal dale explained  pedro an tom were uneasy last night i think there are lions workin over the ridge somewhere i heard one scream  scream inquired bo with interest  yes an if you ever hear a lion scream you will think it a woman in mortal agony the cougar cry as roy calls it is the wildest to be heard in the woods a wolf howls he is sad hungry and wild but a cougar seems human an dyin an wild well saddle up an ride over there maybe pedro will tree a lion bo if he does will you shoot it  sure replied bo with her mouth full of biscuit  that was how they came to take a long slow steep ride under cover of dense spruce helen liked the ride after they got on the heights but they did not get to any point where she could indulge in her pleasure of gazing afar over the ranges dale led up and down and finally mostly down until they came out within sight of sparser wooded ridges with parks lying below and streams shining in the sun  more than once pedro had to be harshly called by dale the hound scented game  heres an old kill said dale halting to point at some bleached bones scattered under a spruce tufts of grayishwhite hair lay strewn around  what was it asked bo  deer of course killed there an eaten by a lion sometime last fall see even the skull is split but i could not say that the lion did it  helen shuddered she thought of the tame deer down at dales camp how beautiful and graceful and responsive to kindness  they rode out of the woods into a grassy swale with rocks and clumps of some green bushes bordering it here pedro barked the first time helen had heard him the hair on his neck bristled and it required stern calls from dale to hold him in dale dismounted  hyar pede you get back he ordered ill let you go presently girls youre goin to see somethin but stay on your horses  dale with the hound tense and bristling beside him strode here and there at the edge of the swale presently he halted on a slight elevation and beckoned for the girls to ride over  here see where the grass is pressed down all nice an round he said pointing a lion made that he sneaked there watchin for deer that was done this mornin come on now lets see if we can trail him  dale stooped now studying the grass and holding pedro suddenly he straightened up with a flash in his gray eyes  heres where he jumped  but helen could not see any reason why dale should say that the man of the forest took a long stride then another  an heres where that lion lit on the back of the deer it was a big jump see the sharp hoof tracks of the deer dale pressed aside tall grass to show dark rough fresh tracks of a deer evidently made by violent action  come on called dale walking swiftly youre sure goin to see somethin now heres where the deer bounded carryin the lion  what exclaimed bo incredulously  the deer was runnin here with the lion on his back ill prove it to you come on now pedro you stay with me girls its a fresh trail dale walked along leading his horse and occasionally he pointed down into the grass there see that thats hair  helen did see some tufts of grayish hair scattered on the ground and she believed she saw little dark separations in the grass where an animal had recently passed all at once dale halted when helen reached him bo was already there and they were gazing down at a wide flattened space in the grass even helens inexperienced eyes could make out evidences of a struggle tufts of graywhite hair lay upon the crushed grass helen did not need to see any more but dale silently pointed to a patch of blood then he spoke  the lion brought the deer down here an killed him probably broke his neck that deer ran a hundred yards with the lion see heres the trail left where the lion dragged the deer off  a welldefined path showed across the swale  girls youll see that deer pretty quick declared dale starting forward this work has just been done only a few minutes ago  how can you tell queried bo  look see that grass it has been bent down by the deer bein dragged over it now its springin up  dales next stop was on the other side of the swale under a spruce with low spreading branches the look of pedro quickened helens pulse he was wild to give chase fearfully helen looked where dale pointed expecting to see the lion but she saw instead a deer lying prostrate with tongue out and sightless eyes and bloody hair  girls that lion heard us an left hes not far said dale as he stooped to lift the head of the deer warm neck broken see the lions teeth an claw marks its a doe look here dont be squeamish girls this is only an hourly incident of everyday life in the forest see where the lion has rolled the skin down as neat as i could do it an hed just begun to bite in there when he heard us  what murderous work the sight sickens me exclaimed helen  it is nature said dale simply  lets kill the lion added bo  for answer dale took a quick turn at their saddlegirths and then mounting he called to the hound hunt him up pedro  like a shot the hound was off  ride in my tracks an keep close to me called dale as he wheeled his horse  were off squealed bo in wild delight and she made her mount plunge  helen urged her horse after them and they broke across a corner of the swale to the woods pedro was running straight with his nose high he let out one short bark he headed into the woods with dale not far behind helen was on one of dales best horses but that fact scarcely manifested itself because the others began to increase their lead they entered the woods it was open and fairly good going bos horse ran as fast in the woods as he did in the open that frightened helen and she yelled to bo to hold him in she yelled to deaf ears that was bos great riskshe did not intend to be careful suddenly the forest rang with dales encouraging yell meant to aid the girls in following him helens horse caught the spirit of the chase he gained somewhat on bo hurdling logs sometimes two at once helens blood leaped with a strange excitement utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless yet her natural fear and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish risk of this ride shared alike in her sum of sensations she tried to remember dales caution about dodging branches and snags and sliding her knees back to avoid knocks from trees she barely missed some frightful reaching branches she received a hard knock then another that unseated her but frantically she held on and slid back and at the end of a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging blow in the face from a farspreading branch of pine bo missed by what seemed only an inch a solid snag that would have broken her in two both pedro and dale got out of helens sight then helen as she began to lose bo felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left behind to get lost in the forest and she urged her horse dales yell pealed back then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than by sight wind and brush tore at her the air was heavily pungent with odor of pine helen heard a wild full bay of the hound ringing back full of savage eagerness and she believed pedro had roused out the lion from some covert it lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her horse on faster  then the swift pace slackened a windfall of timber delayed helen she caught a glimpse of dale far ahead climbing a slope the forest seemed full of his ringing yell helen strangely wished for level ground and the former swift motion next she saw bo working down to the right and dales yell now came from that direction helen followed got out of the timber and made better time on a gradual slope down to another park  when she reached the open she saw bo almost across this narrow open ground here helen did not need to urge her mount he snorted and plunged at the level and he got to going so fast that helen would have screamed aloud in mingled fear and delight if she had not been breathless  her horse had the bad luck to cross soft ground he went to his knees and helen sailed out of the saddle over his head soft willows and wet grass broke her fall she was surprised to find herself unhurt up she bounded and certainly did not know this new helen rayner her horse was coming and he had patience with her but he wanted to hurry helen made the quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it she would tell bo that but just then bo flashed into the woods out of sight helen fairly charged into that green foliage breaking brush and branches she broke through into open forest bo was inside riding down an aisle between pines and spruces at that juncture helen heard dales melodious yell near at hand coming into still more open forest with rocks here and there she saw dale dismounted under a pine and pedro standing with fore paws upon the treetrunk and then high up on a branch a huge tawny colored lion just like tom  bos horse slowed up and showed fear but he kept on as far as dales horse but helens refused to go any nearer she had difficulty in halting him presently she dismounted and throwing her bridle over a stump she ran on panting and fearful yet tingling all over up to her sister and dale  nell you did pretty good for a tenderfoot was bos greeting  it was a fine chase said dale you both rode well i wish you could have seen the lion on the ground he boundedgreat long bounds with his tail up in the airvery funny an pedro almost caught up with him that scared me because he would have killed the hound pedro was close to him when he treed an there he isthe yellow deerkiller hes a male an full grown  with that dale pulled his rifle from its saddlesheath and looked expectantly at bo but she was gazing with great interest and admiration up at the lion  isnt he just beautiful she burst out oh look at him spit just like a cat dale he looks afraid he might fall off  he sure does lions are never sure of their balance in a tree but i never saw one make a misstep he knows he doesnt belong there  to helen the lion looked splendid perched up there he was long and round and graceful and tawny his tongue hung out and his plump sides heaved showing what a quick hard run he had been driven to what struck helen most forcibly about him was something in his face as he looked down at the hound he was scared he realized his peril it was not possible for helen to watch him killed yet she could not bring herself to beg bo not to shoot helen confessed she was a tenderfoot  get down bo an lets see how good a shot you are said dale bo slowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a rueful smile at dale  ive changed my mind i said i would kill him but now i cant he looks soso different from what id imagined  dales answer was a rare smile of understanding and approval that warmed helens heart toward him all the same he was amused sheathing the gun he mounted his horse  come on pedro he called come i tell you he added sharply well girls we treed him anyhow an it was fun now well ride back to the deer he killed an pack a haunch to camp for our own use  will the lion go back to hishis kill i think you called it asked bo  ive chased one away from his kill half a dozen times lions are not plentiful here an they dont get overfed i reckon the balance is pretty even  this last remark made helen inquisitive and as they slowly rode on the backtrail dale talked  you girls bein tenderhearted an not knowin the life of the forest whats good an whats bad think it was a pity the poor deer was killed by a murderous lion but youre wrong as i told you the lion is absolutely necessary to the health an joy of wild lifeor deers wild life so to speak when deer were created or came into existence then the lion must have come too they cant live without each other wolves now are not particularly deerkillers they live off elk an anythin they can catch so will lions for that matter but i mean lions follow the deer to an fro from winter to summer feedingrounds where theres no deer you will find no lions well now if left alone deer would multiply very fast in a few years there would be hundreds where now theres only one an in time as the generations passed theyd lose the fear the alertness the speed an strength the eternal vigilance that is love of lifetheyd lose that an begin to deteriorate an disease would carry them off i saw one season of blacktongue among deer it killed them off an i believe that is one of the diseases of overproduction the lions now are forever on the trail of the deer they have learned wariness is an instinct born in the fawn it makes him keen quick active fearful an so he grows up strong an healthy to become the smooth sleek beautiful softeyed an wildlookin deer you girls love to watch but if it wasnt for the lions the deer would not thrive only the strongest an swiftest survive that is the meanin of nature there is always a perfect balance kept by nature it may vary in different years but on the whole in the long years it averages an even balance  how wonderfully you put it exclaimed bo with all her impulsiveness oh im glad i didnt kill the lion  what you say somehow hurts me said helen wistfully to the hunter i seei feel how truehow inevitable it is but it changes mymy feelings almost id rather not acquire such knowledge as yours this balance of naturehow tragichow sad  but why asked dale you love birds an birds are the greatest killers in the forest  dont tell me thatdont prove it implored helen it is not so much the love of life in a deer or any creature and the terrible clinging to life that gives me distress it is suffering i cant bear to see pain i can stand pain myself but i cant bear to see or think of it  well replied dale thoughtfully there you stump me again ive lived long in the forest an when a mans alone he does a heap of thinkin an always i couldnt understand a reason or a meanin for pain of all the bafflin things of life that is the hardest to understand an to forgivepain   that evening as they sat in restful places round the campfire with the still twilight fading into night dale seriously asked the girls what the days chase had meant to them his manner of asking was productive of thought both girls were silent for a moment  glorious was bos brief and eloquent reply  why asked dale curiously you are a girl youve been used to home people love comfort safety quiet  maybe that is just why it was glorious said bo earnestly i can hardly explain i loved the motion of the horse the feel of wind in my face the smell of the pine the sight of slope and forest glade and windfall and rocks and the black shade under the spruces my blood beat and burned my teeth clicked my nerves all quivered my heart sometimes at dangerous moments almost choked me and all the time it pounded hard now my skin was hot and then it was cold but i think the best of that chase for me was that i was on a fast horse guiding him controlling him he was alive oh how i felt his running  well what you say is as natural to me as if i felt it said dale i wondered youre certainly full of fire an helen what do you say  bo has answered you with her feelings replied helen i could not do that and be honest the fact that bo wouldnt shoot the lion after we treed him acquits her nevertheless her answer is purely physical you know mr dale how you talk about the physical i should say my sister was just a young wild highly sensitive hotblooded female of the species she exulted in that chase as an indian her sensations were inherited onescertainly not acquired by education bo always hated study the ride was a revelation to me i had a good many of bos feelingsthough not so strong but over against them was the opposition of reason of consciousness a newborn side of my nature confronted me strange surprising violent irresistible it was as if another side of my personality suddenly said here i am reckon with me now and there was no use for the moment to oppose that strange side ithe thinking helen rayner was powerless oh yes i had such thoughts even when the branches were stinging my face and i was thrilling to the bay of the hound once my horse fell and threw me you neednt look alarmed it was fine i went into a soft place and was unhurt but when i was sailing through the air a thought flashed this is the end of me it was like a dream when you are falling dreadfully much of what i felt and thought on that chase must have been because of what i have studied and read and taught the reality of it the action and flash were splendid but fear of danger pity for the chased lion consciousness of foolish risk of a reckless disregard for the serious responsibility i have takenall these worked in my mind and held back what might have been a sheer physical primitive joy of the wild moment  dale listened intently and after helen had finished he studied the fire and thoughtfully poked the red embers with his stick his face was still and serene untroubled and unlined but to helen his eyes seemed sad pensive expressive of an unsatisfied yearning and wonder she had carefully and earnestly spoken because she was very curious to hear what he might say  i understand you he replied presently an im sure surprised that i can ive read my booksan reread them but no one ever talked like that to me what i make of it is this youve the same blood in you thats in bo an blood is stronger than brain remember that blood is life it would be good for you to have it run an beat an burn as bos did your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before intellect was born in your ancestors instinct may not be greater than reason but its a million years older dont fight your instincts so hard if they were not good the god of creation would not have given them to you today your mind was full of selfrestraint that did not altogether restrain you couldnt forget yourself you couldnt feel only as bo did you couldnt be true to your real nature  i dont agree with you replied helen quickly i dont have to be an indian to be true to myself  why yes you do said dale  but i couldnt be an indian declared helen spiritedly i couldnt feel only as you say bo did i couldnt go back in the scale as you hint what would all my education amount tothough goodness knows its little enoughif i had no control over primitive feelings that happened to be born in me  youll have little or no control over them when the right time comes replied dale your sheltered life an education have led you away from natural instincts but theyre in you an youll learn the proof of that out here  no not if i lived a hundred years in the west asserted helen  but child do you know what youre talkin about  here bo let out a blissful peal of laughter  mr dale exclaimed helen almost affronted she was stirred i know myself at least  but you do not youve no idea of yourself youve education yes but not in nature an life an after all they are the real things answer me nowhonestly will you  certainly if i can some of your questions are hard to answer  have you ever been starved he asked  no replied helen  have you ever been lost away from home  no  have you ever faced deathreal stark an naked death close an terrible  no indeed  have you ever wanted to kill any one with your bare hands  oh mr dale youyou amaze me no no  i reckon i know your answer to my last question but ill ask it anyhow have you ever been so madly in love with a man that you could not live without him  bo fell off her seat with a high trilling laugh oh you two are great  thank heaven i havent been replied helen shortly  then you dont know anythin about life declared dale with finality  helen was not to be put down by that dubious and troubled as it made her  have you experienced all those things she queried stubbornly  all but the last one love never came my way how could it i live alone i seldom go to the villages where there are girls no girl would ever care for me i have nothin but all the same i understand love a little just by comparison with strong feelins ive lived  helen watched the hunter and marveled at his simplicity his sad and penetrating gaze was on the fire as if in its white heart to read the secret denied him he had said that no girl would ever love him she imagined he might know considerably less about the nature of girls than of the forest  to come back to myself said helen wanting to continue the argument you declared i didnt know myself that i would have no selfcontrol i will  i meant the big things of life he said patiently  what things  i told you by askin what had never happened to you i learned what will happen  those experiences to come to me breathed helen incredulously never  sister nell they sure willparticularly the lastnamed onethe mad love chimed in bo mischievously yet believingly  neither dale nor helen appeared to hear her interruption  let me put it simpler began dale evidently racking his brain for analogy his perplexity appeared painful to him because he had a great faith a great conviction that he could not make clear here i am the natural physical man livin in the wilds an here you come the complex intellectual woman remember for my arguments sake that youre here an suppose circumstances forced you to stay here youd fight the elements with me an work with me to sustain life there must be a great change in either you or me accordin to the others influence an cant you see that change must come in you not because of anythin superior in meim really inferior to youbut because of our environment youd lose your complexity an in years to come youd be a natural physical woman because youd live through an by the physical  oh dear will not education be of help to the western woman queried helen almost in despair  sure it will answered dale promptly what the west needs is women who can raise an teach children but you dont understand me you dont get under your skin i reckon i cant make you see my argument as i feel it you take my word for this though sooner or later you will wake up an forget yourself remember  nell ill bet you do too said bo seriously for her it may seem strange to you but i understand dale i feel what he means its a sort of shock nell were not what we seem were not what we fondly imagine we are weve lived too long with peopletoo far away from the earth you know the bible says something like this dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return where do we come from    chapter xii  days passed  every morning helen awoke with a wondering question as to what this day would bring forth especially with regard to possible news from her uncle it must come sometime and she was anxious for it something about this simple wild camp life had begun to grip her she found herself shirking daily attention to the clothes she had brought west they needed it but she had begun to see how superficial they really were on the other hand campfire tasks had come to be a pleasure she had learned a great deal more about them than had bo worry and dread were always impinging upon the fringe of her thoughtsalways vaguely present though seldom annoying they were like shadows in dreams she wanted to get to her uncles ranch to take up the duties of her new life but she was not prepared to believe she would not regret this wild experience she must get away from that in order to see it clearly and she began to have doubts of herself  meanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on bo leaned more and more toward utter reconciliation to it her eyes had a wonderful flash like blue lightning her cheeks were gold and brown her hands tanned dark as an indians  she could vault upon the gray mustang or for that matter clear over his back she learned to shoot a rifle accurately enough to win dales praise and vowed she would like to draw a bead upon a grizzly bear or upon snake anson  bo if you met that grizzly dale said has been prowling round camp lately youd run right up a tree declared helen one morning when bo seemed particularly boastful  dont fool yourself retorted bo  but ive seen you run from a mouse  sister couldnt i be afraid of a mouse and not a bear  i dont see how  well bears lions outlaws and other wild beasts are to be met with here in the west and my minds made up said bo in slownodding deliberation  they argued as they had always argued helen for reason and common sense and restraint bo on the principle that if she must fight it was better to get in the first blow  the morning on which this argument took place dale was a long time in catching the horses when he did come in he shook his head seriously  some varmints been chasin the horses he said as he reached for his saddle did you hear them snortin an runnin last night  neither of the girls had been awakened  i missed one of the colts went on dale an im goin to ride across the park  dales movements were quick and stern it was significant that he chose his heavier rifle and mounting with a sharp call to pedro he rode off without another word to the girls  bo watched him for a moment and then began to saddle the mustang  you wont follow him asked helen quickly  i sure will replied bo he didnt forbid it  but he certainly did not want us  he might not want you but ill bet he wouldnt object to me whatevers up said bo shortly  oh so you think exclaimed helen keenly hurt she bit her tongue to keep back a hot reply and it was certain that a bursting gush of anger flooded over her was she then such a coward did dale think this slip of a sister so wild and wilful was a stronger woman than she a moments silent strife convinced her that no doubt he thought so and no doubt he was right then the anger centered upon herself and helen neither understood nor trusted herself  the outcome proved an uncontrollable impulse helen began to saddle her horse she had the task half accomplished when bos call made her look up  listen  helen heard a ringing wild bay of the hound  thats pedro she said with a thrill  sure hes running we never heard him bay like that before  wheres dale  he rode out of sight across there replied bo pointing and pedros running toward us along that slope he must be a miletwo miles from dale  but dale will follow  sure but hed need wings to get near that hound now pedro couldnt have gone across there with him just listen  the wild note of the hound manifestly stirred bo to irrepressible action snatching up dales lighter rifle she shoved it into her saddlesheath and leaping on the mustang she ran him over brush and brook straight down the park toward the place pedro was climbing for an instant helen stood amazed beyond speech when bo sailed over a big log like a steeplechaser then helen answered to further unconsidered impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened without coat or hat she mounted the nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the saddle a strange trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins she wanted to scream for bo to wait bo was out of sight but the deep muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded helen an easy trail to follow in fact her horse needed no guiding he ran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park and suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang standing still bo was looking up and listening  there he is cried bo as the hound bayed ringingly closer to them this time and she spurred away  helens horse followed without urging he was excited his ears were up something was in the wind helen had never ridden along this broken end of the park and bo was not easy to keep up with she led across bogs brooks swales rocky little ridges through stretches of timber and groves of aspen so thick helen could scarcely squeeze through then bo came out into a large open offshoot of the park right under the mountain slope and here she sat her horse watching and listening helen rode up to her imagining once that she had heard the hound  look look bos scream made her mustang stand almost straight up  helen gazed up to see a big brown bear with a frosted coat go lumbering across an opening on the slope  its a grizzly hell kill pedro oh where is dale cried bo with intense excitement  bo that bear is running down wewe must getout of his road panted helen in breathless alarm  dale hasnt had time to be close oh i wish hed come i dont know what to do  ride back at least wait for him  just then pedro spoke differently in savage barks and following that came a loud growl and crashings in the brush these sounds appeared to be not far up the slope  nell do you hear pedros fighting the bear burst out bo her face paled her eyes flashed like blue steel the bear ll kill him  oh that would be dreadful replied helen in distress but what on earth can we do  hello dale called bo at the highest pitch of her piercing voice  no answer came a heavy crash of brush a rolling of stones another growl from the slope told helen that the hound had brought the bear to bay  nell im going up said bo deliberately  nono are you mad returned helen  the bear will kill pedro  he might kill you  you ride that way and yell for dale rejoined bo  what willyou do gasped helen  ill shoot at the bearscare him off if he chases me he cant catch me coming downhill dale said that  youre crazy cried helen as bo looked up the slope searching for open ground then she pulled the rifle from its sheath  but bo did not hear or did not care she spurred the mustang and he wild to run flung grass and dirt from his heels what helen would have done then she never knew but the fact was that her horse bolted after the mustang in an instant seemingly bo had disappeared in the gold and green of the forest slope helens mount climbed on a run snorting and heaving through aspens brush and timber to come out into a narrow long opening extending lengthwise up the slope  a sudden prolonged crash ahead alarmed helen and halted her horse she saw a shaking of aspens then a huge brown beast leaped as a cat out of the woods it was a bear of enormous size helens heart stoppedher tongue clove to the roof of her mouth the bear turned his mouth was open red and dripping he looked shaggy gray he let out a terrible bawl helens every muscle froze stiff her horse plunged high and sidewise wheeling almost in the air neighing his terror like a stone she dropped from the saddle she did not see the horse break into the woods but she heard him her gaze never left the bear even while she was falling and it seemed she alighted in an upright position with her back against a bush it upheld her the bear wagged his huge head from side to side then as the hound barked close at hand he turned to run heavily uphill and out of the opening  the instant of his disappearance was one of collapse for helen frozen with horror she had been unable to move or feel or think all at once she was a quivering mass of cold helpless flesh wet with perspiration sick with a shuddering retching internal convulsion her mind liberated from paralyzing shock the moment was as horrible as that in which the bear had bawled his frightful rage a stark icy black emotion seemed in possession of her she could not lift a hand yet all of her body appeared shaking there was a fluttering a strangling in her throat the crushing weight that surrounded her heart eased before she recovered use of her limbs then the naked and terrible thing was gone like a nightmare giving way to consciousness what blessed relief helen wildly gazed about her the bear and hound were out of sight and so was her horse she stood up very dizzy and weak thought of bo then seemed to revive her to shock different life and feeling throughout all her cold extremities she listened  she heard a thudding of hoofs down the slope then dales clear strong call she answered it appeared long before he burst out of the woods riding hard and leading her horse in that time she recovered fully and when he reached her to put a sudden halt upon the fiery ranger she caught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse the feel of the saddle seemed different dales piercing gray glance thrilled her strangely  youre white are you hurt he said  no i was scared  but he threw you  yes he certainly threw me  what happened  we heard the hound and we rode along the timber then we saw the beara monsterwhitecoated  i know its a grizzly he killed the coltyour pet hurry now what about bo  pedro was fighting the bear bo said hed be killed she rode right up here my horse followed i couldnt have stopped him but we lost bo right there the bear came out he roared my horse threw me and ran off pedros barking saved memy life i think oh that was awful then the bear went upthere and you came  bos followin the hound ejaculated dale and lifting his hands to his mouth he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope rang against the cliffs pealed and broke and died away then he waited listening from far up the slope came a faint wild cry highpitched and sweet to create strange echoes floating away to die in the ravines  shes after him declared dale grimly  bos got your rifle said helen oh we must hurry  you go back ordered dale wheeling his horse  no helen felt that word leave her lips with the force of a bullet  dale spurred ranger and took to the open slope helen kept at his heels until timber was reached here a steep trail led up dale dismounted  horse tracksbear tracksdog tracks he said bending over well have to walk up here itll save our horses an maybe time too  is bo riding up there asked helen eying the steep ascent  she sure is with that dale started up leading his horse helen followed it was rough and hard work she was lightly clad yet soon she was hot laboring and her heart began to hurt when dale halted to rest helen was just ready to drop the baying of the hound though infrequent inspirited her but presently that sound was lost dale said bear and hound had gone over the ridge and as soon as the top was gained he would hear them again  look there he said presently pointing to fresh tracks larger than those made by bos mustang elk tracks weve scared a big bull an hes right ahead of us look sharp an youll see him  helen never climbed so hard and fast before and when they reached the ridgetop she was all tuckered out it was all she could do to get on her horse dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the western end which was considerably higher in places open rocky ground split the green timber dale pointed toward a promontory  helen saw a splendid elk silhouetted against the sky he was a light gray over all his hindquarters with shoulders and head black his ponderous widespread antlers towered over him adding to the wildness of his magnificent poise as he stood there looking down into the valley no doubt listening for the bay of the hound when he heard dales horse he gave one bound gracefully and wonderfully carrying his antlers to disappear in the green  again on a bare patch of ground dale pointed down helen saw big round tracks toeing in a little that gave her a chill she knew these were grizzly tracks  hard riding was not possible on this ridge crest a fact that gave helen time to catch her breath at length coming out upon the very summit of the mountain dale heard the hound helens eyes feasted afar upon a wild scene of rugged grandeur before she looked down on this western slope at her feet to see bare gradual descent leading down to sparsely wooded bench and on to deepgreen canuon  ride hard now yelled dale i see bo an ill have to ride to catch her  dale spurred down the slope helen rode in his tracks and though she plunged so fast that she felt her hair stand up with fright she saw him draw away from her sometimes her horse slid on his haunches for a few yards and at these hazardous moments she got her feet out of the stirrups so as to fall free from him if he went down she let him choose the way while she gazed ahead at dale and then farther on in the hope of seeing bo at last she was rewarded far down the wooded bench she saw a gray flash of the little mustang and a bright glint of bos hair her heart swelled dale would soon overhaul bo and come between her and peril and on the instant though helen was unconscious of it then a remarkable change came over her spirit fear left her and a hot exalting incomprehensible something took possession of her  she let the horse run and when he had plunged to the foot of that slope of soft ground he broke out across the open bench at a pace that made the wind bite helens cheeks and roar in her ears she lost sight of dale it gave her a strange grim exultance she bent her eager gaze to find the tracks of his horse and she found them also she made out the tracks of bos mustang and the bear and the hound her horse scenting game perhaps and afraid to be left alone settled into a fleet and powerful stride sailing over logs and brush that open bench had looked short but it was long and helen rode down the gradual descent at breakneck speed she would not be left behind she had awakened to a heedlessness of risk something burned steadily within her a grim hard anger of joy when she saw far down another open gradual descent that dale had passed bo and that bo was riding the little mustang as never before then helen flamed with a madness to catch her to beat her in that wonderful chase to show her and dale what there really was in the depths of helen rayner  her ambition was to be shortlived she divined from the lay of the land ahead but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that would always blanch her cheeks and prick her skin in remembrance  the open ground was only too short that thundering pace soon brought helens horse to the timber here it took all her strength to check his headlong flight over deadfalls and between small jackpines helen lost sight of bo and she realized it would take all her wits to keep from getting lost she had to follow the trail and in some places it was hard to see from horseback  besides her horse was mettlesome thoroughly aroused and he wanted a free rein and his own way helen tried that only to lose the trail and to get sundry knocks from trees and branches she could not hear the hound nor dale the pines were small close together and tough they were hard to bend helen hurt her hands scratched her face barked her knees the horse formed a habit suddenly of deciding to go the way he liked instead of the way helen guided him and when he plunged between saplings too close to permit easy passage it was exceedingly hard on her that did not make any difference to helen once worked into a frenzy her blood stayed at high pressure she did not argue with herself about a need of desperate hurry even a blow on the head that nearly blinded her did not in the least retard her the horse could hardly be held and not at all in the few open places  at last helen reached another slope coming out upon canuon rim she heard dales clear call far down and bos answering peal high and piercing with its note of exultant wildness helen also heard the bear and the hound fighting at the bottom of this canuon  here helen again missed the tracks made by dale and bo the descent looked impassable she rode back along the rim then forward finally she found where the ground had been plowed deep by hoofs down over little banks helens horse balked at these jumps when she goaded him over them she went forward on his neck it seemed like riding straight downhill the mad spirit of that chase grew more stingingly keen to helen as the obstacles grew then once more the bay of the hound and the bawl of the bear made a demon of her horse he snorted a shrill defiance he plunged with fore hoofs in the air he slid and broke a way down the steep soft banks through the thick brush and thick clusters of saplings sending loose rocks and earth into avalanches ahead of him he fell over one bank but a thicket of aspens upheld him so that he rebounded and gained his feet the sounds of fight ceased but dales thrilling call floated up on the pinescented air  before helen realized it she was at the foot of the slope in a narrow canuonbed full of rocks and trees with a soft roar of running water filling her ears tracks were everywhere and when she came to the first open place she saw where the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into the water here he had fought pedro signs of that battle were easy to read helen saw where his huge tracks still wet led up the opposite sandy bank  then downstream helen did some more reckless and splendid riding on level ground the horse was great once he leaped clear across the brook every plunge every turn helen expected to come upon dale and bo facing the bear the canuon narrowed the streambed deepened she had to slow down to get through the trees and rocks quite unexpectedly she rode pellmell upon dale and bo and the panting pedro her horse plunged to a halt answering the shrill neighs of the other horses  dale gazed in admiring amazement at helen  say did you meet the bear again he queried blankly  no didntyoukill him panted helen slowly sagging in her saddle  he got away in the rocks rough country down here  helen slid off her horse and fell with a little panting cry of relief she saw that she was bloody dirty disheveled and wringing wet with perspiration her riding habit was torn into tatters every muscle seemed to burn and sting and all her bones seemed broken but it was worth all this to meet dales penetrating glance to see bos utter incredulous astonishment  nellrayner gasped bo  ifmy horse d beenany goodin the woods panted helen id not lostso much timeriding down this mountain and id caught youbeat you  girl did you ride down this last slope queried dale  i sure did replied helen smiling  we walked every step of the way and was lucky to get down at that responded dale gravely no horse should have been ridden down there why he must have slid down  we slidyes but i stayed on him  bos incredulity changed to wondering speechless admiration and dales rare smile changed his gravity  im sorry it was rash of me i thought youd go back but alls well that ends well helen did you wake up today  she dropped her eyes not caring to meet the questioning gaze upon her  maybea little she replied and she covered her face with her hands remembrance of his questionsof his assurance that she did not know the real meaning of lifeof her stubborn antagonismmade her somehow ashamed but it was not for long  the chase was great she said i did not know myself you were right  in how many ways did you find me right he asked  i think allbut one she replied with a laugh and a shudder im near starved nowi was so furious at bo that i could have choked her i faced that horrible brute oh i know what it is to fear death i was lost twice on the rideabsolutely lost thats all  bo found her tongue the last thing was for you to fall wildly in love wasnt it  according to dale i must add that to my new experiences of todaybefore i can know real life replied helen demurely  the hunter turned away let us go he said soberly    chapter xiii  after more days of riding the grassy level of that wonderfully gold and purple park and dreamily listening by day to the everlow and everchanging murmur of the waterfall and by night to the wild lonely mourn of a hunting wolf and climbing to the dizzy heights where the wind stung sweetly helen rayner lost track of time and forgot her peril  roy beeman did not return if occasionally dale mentioned roy and his quest the girls had little to say beyond a recurrent anxiety for the old uncle and then they forgot again paradise park lived in a little while at that season of the year would have claimed any one and ever afterward haunted sleeping or waking dreams  bo gave up to the wild life to the horses and rides to the many pets and especially to the cougar tom the big cat followed her everywhere played with her rolling and pawing kittenlike and he would lay his massive head in her lap to purr his content bo had little fear of anything and here in the wilds she soon lost that  another of dales pets was a halfgrown black bear named muss he was abnormally jealous of little bud and he had a welldeveloped hatred of tom otherwise he was a very goodtempered bear and enjoyed dales impartial regard tom however chased muss out of camp whenever dales back was turned and sometimes muss stayed away shifting for himself with the advent of bo who spent a good deal of time on the animals muss manifestly found the camp more attractive whereupon dale predicted trouble between tom and muss  bo liked nothing better than a roughandtumble frolic with the black bear muss was not very big nor very heavy and in a wrestling bout with the strong and wiry girl he sometimes came out second best it spoke well of him that he seemed to be careful not to hurt bo he never bit or scratched though he sometimes gave her sounding slaps with his paws whereupon bo would clench her gauntleted fists and sail into him in earnest  one afternoon before the early supper they always had dale and helen were watching bo teasing the bear she was in her most vixenish mood full of life and fight tom lay his long length on the grass watching with narrow gleaming eyes  when bo and muss locked in an embrace and went down to roll over and over dale called helens attention to the cougar  toms jealous its strange how animals are like people pretty soon ill have to corral muss or therell be a fight  helen could not see anything wrong with tom except that he did not look playful  during suppertime both bear and cougar disappeared though this was not remarked until afterward dale whistled and called but the rival pets did not return next morning tom was there curled up snugly at the foot of bos bed and when she arose he followed her around as usual but muss did not return  the circumstance made dale anxious he left camp taking tom with him and upon returning stated that he had followed musss track as far as possible and then had tried to put tom on the trail but the cougar would not or could not follow it dale said tom never liked a bear trail anyway cougars and bears being common enemies so whether by accident or design bo lost one of her playmates  the hunter searched some of the slopes next day and even went up on one of the mountains he did not discover any sign of muss but he said he had found something else  bo you girls want some more real excitement he asked  helen smiled her acquiescence and bo replied with one of her forceful speeches  dont mind bein good an scared he went on  you cant scare me bantered bo but helen looked doubtful  up in one of the parks i ran across one of my horsesa lame bay you havent seen well he had been killed by that old silvertip the one we chased hadnt been dead over an hour blood was still runnin an only a little meat eaten that bear heard me or saw me an made off into the woods but hell come back tonight im goin up there lay for him an kill him this time reckon youd better go because i dont want to leave you here alone at night  are you going to take tom asked bo  no the bear might get his scent an besides tom aint reliable on bears ill leave pedro home too  when they had hurried supper and dale had gotten in the horses the sun had set and the valley was shadowing low down while the ramparts were still golden the long zigzag trail dale followed up the slope took nearly an hour to climb so that when that was surmounted and he led out of the woods twilight had fallen a rolling park extended as far as helen could see bordered by forest that in places sent out straggling stretches of trees here and there like islands were isolated patches of timber  at ten thousand feet elevation the twilight of this clear and cold night was a rich and rare atmospheric effect it looked as if it was seen through perfectly clear smoked glass objects were singularly visible even at long range and seemed magnified in the west where the afterglow of sunset lingered over the dark ragged sprucespeared horizonline there was such a transparent golden line melting into vivid starfired blue that helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering admiration  dale spurred his horse into a lope and the spirited mounts of the girls kept up with him the ground was rough with tufts of grass growing close together yet the horses did not stumble their action and snorting betrayed excitement dale led around several clumps of timber up a long grassy swale and then straight westward across an open flat toward where the darkfringed forestline raised itself wild and clear against the cold sky the horses went swiftly and the wind cut like a blade of ice helen could barely get her breath and she panted as if she had just climbed a laborsome hill the stars began to blink out of the blue and the gold paled somewhat and yet twilight lingered it seemed long across that flat but really was short coming to a thin line of trees that led down over a slope to a deeper but still isolated patch of woods dale dismounted and tied his horse when the girls got off he haltered their horses also  stick close to me an put your feet down easy he whispered how tall and dark he loomed in the fading light helen thrilled as she had often of late at the strange potential force of the man stepping softly without the least sound dale entered this straggly bit of woods which appeared to have narrow byways and nooks then presently he came to the top of a wellwooded slope dark as pitch apparently but as helen followed she perceived the trees and they were thin dwarf spruce partly dead the slope was soft and springy easy to step upon without noise dale went so cautiously that helen could not hear him and sometimes in the gloom she could not see him then the chill thrills ran over her bo kept holding on to helen which fact hampered helen as well as worked somewhat to disprove bos boast at last level ground was reached helen made out a lightgray background crossed by black bars another glance showed this to be the dark treetrunks against the open park  dale halted and with a touch brought helen to a straining pause he was listening it seemed wonderful to watch him bend his head and stand as silent and motionless as one of the dark trees  hes not there yet dale whispered and he stepped forward very slowly helen and bo began to come up against thin dead branches that were invisible and then cracked then dale knelt down seemed to melt into the ground  youll have to crawl he whispered  how strange and thrilling that was for helen and hard work the ground bore twigs and dead branches which had to be carefully crawled over and lying flat as was necessary it took prodigious effort to drag her body inch by inch like a huge snake dale wormed his way along  gradually the wood lightened they were nearing the edge of the park helen now saw a strip of open with a high black wall of spruce beyond the afterglow flashed or changed like a dimming northern light and then failed dale crawled on farther to halt at length between two treetrunks at the edge of the wood  come up beside me he whispered  helen crawled on and presently bo was beside her panting with pale face and great staring eyes plain to be seen in the wan light  moons comin up were just in time the old grizzlys not there yet but i see coyotes look  dale pointed across the open neck of park to a dim blurred patch standing apart some little distance from the black wall  thats the dead horse whispered dale an if you watch close you can see the coyotes theyre gray an they move cant you hear them  helens excited ears so full of throbs and imaginings presently registered low snaps and snarls bo gave her arm a squeeze  i hear them theyre fighting oh gee she panted and drew a long full breath of unutterable excitement  keep quiet now an watch an listen said the hunter  slowly the black ragged forestline seemed to grow blacker and lift slowly the gray neck of park lightened under some invisible influence slowly the stars paled and the sky filled over somewhere the moon was rising and slowly that vague blurred patch grew a little clearer  through the tips of the spruce now seen to be rather close at hand shone a slender silver crescent moon darkening hiding shining again climbing until its exquisite sicklepoint topped the trees and then magically it cleared them radiant and cold while the eastern black wall shaded still blacker the park blanched and the borderline opposite began to stand out as trees  look look cried bo very low and fearfully as she pointed  not so loud whispered dale  but i see something  keep quiet he admonished  helen in the direction bo pointed could not see anything but moonblanched bare ground rising close at hand to a little ridge  lie still whispered dale im goin to crawl around to get a look from another angle ill be right back  he moved noiselessly backward and disappeared with him gone helen felt a palpitating of her heart and a prickling of her skin  oh my nell look whispered bo in fright i know i saw something  on top of the little ridge a round object moved slowly getting farther out into the light helen watched with suspended breath it moved out to be silhouetted against the skyapparently a huge round bristling animal frosty in color one instant it seemed hugethe next smallthen close at handand far away it swerved to come directly toward them suddenly helen realized that the beast was not a dozen yards distant she was just beginning a new experiencea real and horrifying terror in which her blood curdled her heart gave a tremendous leap and then stood still and she wanted to fly but was rooted to the spotwhen dale returned to her side  thats a pesky porcupine he whispered almost crawled over you he sure would have stuck you full of quills  whereupon he threw a stick at the animal it bounced straight up to turn round with startling quickness and it gave forth a rattling sound then it crawled out of sight  porcupine whispered bo pantingly it mightas wellhave beenan elephant  helen uttered a long eloquent sigh she would not have cared to describe her emotions at sight of a harmless hedgehog  listen warned dale very low his big hand closed over helens gauntleted one there you havethe real cry of the wild  sharp and cold on the night air split the cry of a wolf distant yet wonderfully distinct how wild and mournful and hungry how marvelously pure helen shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its music the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused again a sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life back into the dim remote past from which she had come  the cry was not repeated the coyotes were still and silence fell absolutely unbroken  dale nudged helen and then reached over to give bo a tap he was peering keenly ahead and his strained intensity could be felt helen looked with all her might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the coyotes skulk away out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods where they disappeared not only dales intensity but the very silence the wildness of the moment and place seemed fraught with wonderful potency bo must have felt it too for she was trembling all over and holding tightly to helen and breathing quick and fast  ahuh muttered dale under his breath  helen caught the relief and certainty in his exclamation and she divined then something of what the moment must have been to a hunter  then her roving alert glance was arrested by a looming gray shadow coming out of the forest it moved but surely that huge thing could not be a bear it passed out of gloom into silver moonlight helens heart bounded for it was a great frostycoated bear lumbering along toward the dead horse instinctively helens hand sought the arm of the hunter it felt like iron under a rippling surface the touch eased away the oppression over her lungs the tightness of her throat what must have been fear left her and only a powerful excitement remained a sharp expulsion of breath from bo and a violent jerk of her frame were signs that she had sighted the grizzly  in the moonlight he looked of immense size and that wild park with the gloomy blackness of forest furnished a fit setting for him helens quick mind so taken up with emotion still had a thought for the wonder and the meaning of that scene she wanted the bear killed yet that seemed a pity  he had a wagging rolling slow walk which took several moments to reach his quarry when at length he reached it he walked around with sniffs plainly heard and then a cross growl evidently he had discovered that his meal had been messed over as a whole the big bear could be seen distinctly but only in outline and color the distance was perhaps two hundred yards then it looked as if he had begun to tug at the carcass indeed he was dragging it very slowly but surely  look at that whispered dale if he aint strong reckon ill have to stop him  the grizzly however stopped of his own accord just outside of the shadowline of the forest then he hunched in a big frosty heap over his prey and began to tear and rend  jess was a mighty good horse muttered dale grimly too good to make a meal for a hog silvertip  then the hunter silently rose to a kneeling position swinging the rifle in front of him he glanced up into the low branches of the tree overhead  girls theres no tellin what a grizzly will do if i yell you climb up in this tree an do it quick  with that he leveled the rifle resting his left elbow on his knee the front end of the rifle reaching out of the shade shone silver in the moonlight man and weapon became still as stone helen held her breath but dale relaxed lowering the barrel  cant see the sights very well he whispered shaking his head remember nowif i yell you climb  again he aimed and slowly grew rigid helen could not take her fascinated eyes off him he knelt bareheaded and in the shadow she could make out the gleam of his clearcut profile stern and cold  a streak of fire and a heavy report startled her then she heard the bullet hit shifting her glance she saw the bear lurch with convulsive action rearing on his hind legs loud clicking snaps must have been a clashing of his jaws in rage but there was no other sound then again dales heavy gun boomed helen heard again that singular spatting thud of striking lead the bear went down with a flop as if he had been dealt a terrific blow but just as quickly he was up on allfours and began to whirl with hoarse savage bawls of agony and fury his action quickly carried him out of the moonlight into the shadow where he disappeared there the bawls gave place to gnashing snarls and crashings in the brush and snapping of branches as he made his way into the forest  sure hes mad said dale rising to his feet an i reckon hard hit but i wont follow him tonight  both the girls got up and helen found she was shaky on her feet and very cold  ohh wasntitwonwonderful cried bo  are you scared your teeth are chatterin queried dale  imcold  well it sure is cold all right he responded now the funs over youll feel it nell youre froze too  helen nodded she was indeed as cold as she had ever been before but that did not prevent a strange warmness along her veins and a quickened pulse the cause of which she did not conjecture  lets rustle said dale and led the way out of the wood and skirted its edge around to the slope there they climbed to the flat and went through the straggling line of trees to where the horses were tethered  up here the wind began to blow not hard through the forest but still strong and steady out in the open and bitterly cold dale helped bo to mount and then helen  imnumb she said ill fall offsure  no youll be warm in a jiffy he replied because well ride some goin back let ranger pick the way an you hang on  with rangers first jump helens blood began to run out he shot his lean dark head beside dales horse the wild park lay clear and bright in the moonlight with strange silvery radiance on the grass the patches of timber like spired black islands in a moonblanched lake seemed to harbor shadows and places for bears to hide ready to spring out as helen neared each little grove her pulses shook and her heart beat half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold and all seemed gloriousthe sailing moon white in a darkblue sky the white passionless stars so solemn so far away the beckoning fringe of forestland at once mysterious and friendly and the fleet horses running with soft rhythmic thuds over the grass leaping the ditches and the hollows making the bitter wind sting and cut coming up that park the ride had been long going back was as short as it was thrilling in helen experiences gathered realization slowly and it was this swift ride the horses neck and neck and all the wildness and beauty that completed the slow insidious work of years the tears of excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full all that pertained to this night got into her blood it was only to feel to live now but it could be understood and remembered forever afterward  dales horse a little in advance sailed over a ditch ranger made a splendid leap but he alighted among some grassy tufts and fell helen shot over his head she struck lengthwise her arms stretched and slid hard to a shocking impact that stunned her  bos scream rang in her ears she felt the wet grass under her face and then the strong hands that lifted her dale loomed over her bending down to look into her face bo was clutching her with frantic hands and helen could only gasp her breast seemed caved in the need to breathe was torture  nellyoure not hurt you fell light like a feather all grass here you cant be hurt said dale sharply  his anxious voice penetrated beyond her hearing and his strong hands went swiftly over her arms and shoulders feeling for broken bones  just had the wind knocked out of you went on dale it feels awful but its nothin  helen got a little air that was like hot pinpoints in her lungs and then a deeper breath and then full gasping respiration  i guessim not hurtnot a bit she choked out  you sure had a header never saw a prettier spill ranger doesnt do that often i reckon we were travelin too fast but it was fun dont you think  it was bo who answered oh glorious but gee i was scared  dale still held helens hands she released them while looking up at him the moment was realization for her of what for days had been a vague sweet uncertainty becoming near and strange disturbing and present this accident had been a sudden violent end to the wonderful ride but its effect the knowledge of what had got into her blood would never change and inseparable from it was this man of the forest    chapter xiv  on the next morning helen was awakened by what she imagined had been a dream of some one shouting with a start she sat up the sunshine showed pink and gold on the ragged spruce line of the mountain rims bo was on her knees braiding her hair with shaking hands and at the same time trying to peep out  and the echoes of a ringing cry were cracking back from the cliffs that had been dales voice  nell nell wake up called bo wildly oh some ones come horses and men  helen got to her knees and peered out over bos shoulder dale standing tall and striking beside the campfire was waving his sombrero away down the open edge of the park came a string of packburros with mounted men behind in the foremost rider helen recognized roy beeman  that first ones roy she exclaimed id never forget him on a horse bo it must mean uncle als come  sure were born lucky here we are safe and soundand all this grand camp trip look at the cowboys look oh maybe this isnt great babbled bo  dale wheeled to see the girls peeping out  its time youre up he called your uncle al is here  for an instant after helen sank back out of dales sight she sat there perfectly motionless so struck was she by the singular tone of dales voice she imagined that he regretted what this visiting cavalcade of horsemen meantthey had come to take her to her ranch in pine helens heart suddenly began to beat fast but thickly as if muffled within her breast  hurry now girls called dale  bo was already out kneeling on the flat stone at the little brook splashing water in a great hurry helens hands trembled so that she could scarcely lace her boots or brush her hair and she was long behind bo in making herself presentable when helen stepped out a short powerfully built man in coarse garb and heavy boots stood holding bos hands  wal wal you favor the rayners he was saying i remember your dad an a fine feller he was  beside them stood dale and roy and beyond was a group of horses and riders  uncle here comes nell said bo softly  aw the old cattleman breathed hard as he turned  helen hurried she had not expected to remember this uncle but one look into the brown beaming face with the blue eyes flashing yet sad and she recognized him at the same instant recalling her mother  he held out his arms to receive her  nell auchincloss all over again he exclaimed in deep voice as he kissed her id have knowed you anywhere  uncle al murmured helen i remember youthough i was only four  wal walthats fine he replied i remember you straddled my knee once an your hair was brighteran curly it aint neither now sixteen years an youre twenty now what a fine broadshouldered girl you are an nell youre the handsomest auchincloss i ever seen  helen found herself blushing and withdrew her hands from his as roy stepped forward to pay his respects he stood bareheaded lean and tall with neither his clear eyes nor his still face nor the proffered hand expressing anything of the proven quality of fidelity of achievement that helen sensed in him  howdy miss helen howdy bo he said you all both look fine an brown i reckon i was shore slow rustlin your uncle al up here but i was figgerin youd like milts camp for a while  we sure did replied bo archly  aw breathed auchincloss heavily lemme set down  he drew the girls to the rustic seat dale had built for them under the big pine  oh you must be tired howhow are you asked helen anxiously  tired wal if i am its jest this here minit when joe beeman rode in on me with thet news of youwal i jest fergot i was a wornout old

grave gaze his face changed swiftlyand all the serried years of toil and battle and privation showed with something that was not age nor resignation yet as tragic as both  wal never mind himnow he added slowly and the warmer light returned to his face dalecome here  the hunter stepped closer  i reckon i owe you more n i can ever pay said auchincloss with an arm around each niece  no al you dont

outfitthen well go sure youre goin with us  ill call the girls to breakfast replied dale and he moved away without answering auchinclosss query  helen divined that dale did not mean to go down to pine with them and the knowledge gave her a blank feeling of surprise had she expected him to go  come here jeff called al to one of his men  a short bowlegged horseman with dusty garb and sunbleached face hobbled forth from the group he was not young but he had a boyish grin and bright little eyes awkwardly he doffed his slouch sombrero  jeff shake hands with my nieces said al this s helen an your boss from now on an this s bo fer short her name was nancy but when she lay a baby in her cradle i called her bopeep an the names stuck girls this heres my foreman jeff mulvey whos been with me twenty years  the introduction caused embarrassment to all three principals particularly to jeff  jeff throw the packs an saddles fer a rest was als order to his foreman  nell reckon youll have fun bossin thet outfit chuckled al none of ems got a wife lot of scalawags they are no women would have them  uncle i hope ill never have to be their boss replied helen  wal youre goin to be right off declared al they aint a bad lot after all an i got a likely new man  with that he turned to bo and after studying her pretty face he asked in apparently severe tone did you send a cowboy named carmichael to ask me for a job  bo looked quite startled  carmichael why uncle i never heard that name before replied bo bewilderedly  ahuh reckoned the young rascal was lyin said auchincloss but i liked the fellars looks an so let him stay  then the rancher turned to the group of lounging riders  las vegas come here he ordered in a loud voice  helen thrilled at sight of a tall superbly built cowboy reluctantly detaching himself from the group he had a redbronze face young like a boys helen recognized it and the flowing red scarf and the swinging gun and the slow spurclinking gait no other than bos las vegas cowboy admirer  then helen flashed a look at bo which look gave her a delicious almost irresistible desire to laugh that young lady also recognized the reluctant individual approaching with flushed and downcast face helen recorded her first experience of bos utter discomfiture bo turned white then red as a rose  say my niece said she never heard of the name carmichael declared al severely as the cowboy halted before him helen knew her uncle had the repute of dealing hard with his men but here she was reassured and pleased at the twinkle in his eye  shore boss i cant help thet drawled the cowboy its good old texas stock  he did not appear shamefaced now but just as cool easy cleareyed and lazy as the day helen had liked his warm young face and intent gaze  texas you fellars from the pan handle are always hollerin texas i never seen thet texans had any one else beatsay from missouri returned al testily  carmichael maintained a discreet silence and carefully avoided looking at the girls  wal reckon well all call you las vegas anyway continued the rancher didnt you say my niece sent you to me for a job  whereupon carmichaels easy manner vanished  now boss shore my memorys pore he said i only says  dont tell me thet my memorys not pore replied al mimicking the drawl what you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for you  here carmichael stole a timid glance at bo the result of which was to render him utterly crestfallen not improbably he had taken bos expression to mean something it did not for helen read it as a mingling of consternation and fright her eyes were big and blazing a red spot was growing in each cheek as she gathered strength from his confusion  well didnt you demanded al  from the glance the old rancher shot from the cowboy to the others of his employ it seemed to helen that they were having fun at carmichaels expense  yes sir i did suddenly replied the cowboy  ahuh all right heres my niece now see thet she speaks the good word  carmichael looked at bo and bo looked at him their glances were strange wondering and they grew shy bo dropped hers the cowboy apparently forgot what had been demanded of him  helen put a hand on the old ranchers arm  uncle what happened was my fault she said the train stopped at las vegas this young man saw us at the open window he must have guessed we were lonely homesick girls getting lost in the west for he spoke to usnice and friendly he knew of you and he asked in what i took for fun if we thought you would give him a job and i replied just to tease bo that she would surely speak a good word for him  haw haw so thets it replied al and he turned to bo with merry eyes wal i kept this here las vegas carmichael on his sayso come on with your good word unless you want to see him lose his job  bo did not grasp her uncles bantering because she was seriously gazing at the cowboy but she had grasped something  hehe was the first personout westto speak kindly to us she said facing her uncle  wal thets a pretty good word but it aint enough responded al  subdued laughter came from the listening group carmichael shifted from side to side  hehe looks as if he might ride a horse well ventured bo  best hossman i ever seen agreed al heartily  andand shoot added bo hopefully  bo he packs thet gun low like jim wilson an all them texas gunfighters reckon thet aint no good word  thenill vouch for him said bo with finality  thet settles it auchincloss turned to the cowboy las vegas youre a stranger to us but youre welcome to a place in the outfit an i hope you wont never disappoint us  auchinclosss tone passing from jest to earnest betrayed to helen the old ranchers need of new and true men and hinted of trying days to come  carmichael stood before bo sombrero in hand rolling it round and round manifestly bursting with words he could not speak and the girl looked very young and sweet with her flushed face and shining eyes helen saw in the moment more than that little byplay of confusion  missmiss rayneri shoream obliged he stammered presently  youre very welcome she replied softly ii got on the next train he added  when he said that bo was looking straight at him but she seemed not to have heard  whats your name suddenly she asked  carmichael  i heard that but didnt uncle call you las vegas  shore but it wasnt my fault thet cowpunchin outfit saddled it on me right off they dont know no better shore i jest wont answer to thet handle nowmiss bomy real name is tom  i simply could not call youany name but las vegas replied bo very sweetly  butbeggin your pardonii dont like thet blustered carmichael  people often get called namesthey dont like she said with deep intent  the cowboy blushed scarlet helen as well as he got bos inference to that last audacious epithet he had boldly called out as the train was leaving las vegas she also sensed something of the disaster in store for mr carmichael just then the embarrassed young man was saved by dales call to the girls to come to breakfast  that meal the last for helen in paradise park gave rise to a strange and inexplicable restraint she had little to say bo was in the highest spirits teasing the pets joking with her uncle and roy and even poking fun at dale the hunter seemed somewhat somber roy was his usual dry genial self and auchincloss who sat near by was an interested spectator when tom put in an appearance lounging with his feline grace into the camp as if he knew he was a privileged pet the rancher could scarcely contain himself  dale its thet damn cougar he ejaculated  sure thats tom  he ought to be corralled or chained ive no use for cougars protested al  tom is as tame an safe as a kitten  ahuh wal you tell thet to the girls if you like but not me im an old hoss i am  uncle al tom sleeps curled up at the foot of my bed said bo  awwhat  honest injun she responded well isnt it so  helen smilingly nodded her corroboration then bo called tom to her and made him lie with his head on his stretched paws right beside her and beg for bits to eat  wal id never have believed thet exclaimed al shaking his big head dale its one on me ive had them big cats foller me on the trails through the woods moonlight an dark an ive heard em let out thet awful cry they aint any wild sound on earth thet can beat a cougars does this tom ever let out one of them wails  sometimes at night replied dale  wal excuse me hope you dont fetch the yaller rascal down to pine  i wont  whatll you do with this menagerie  dale regarded the rancher attentively reckon al ill take care of them  but youre goin down to my ranch  what for  al scratched his head and gazed perplexedly at the hunter wal aint it customary to visit friends  thanks al next time i ride down pine wayin the spring perhapsill run over an see how you are  spring ejaculated auchincloss then he shook his head sadly and a faraway look filmed his eyes reckon youd call some late  al youll get well now these girlsnowtheyll cure you reckon i never saw you look so good  auchincloss did not press his point farther at that time but after the meal when the other men came to see dales camp and pets helens quick ears caught the renewal of the subject  im askin youwill you come auchincloss said low and eagerly  no i wouldnt fit in down there replied dale  milt talk sense you cant go on forever huntin bear an tamin cats protested the old rancher  why not asked the hunter thoughtfully  auchincloss stood up and shaking himself as if to ward off his testy temper he put a hand on dales arm  one reason is youre needed in pine  how who needs me  i do im playin out fast an beasleys my enemy the ranch an all i got will go to nell thet ranch will have to be run by a man an held by a man do you savvy its a big job an im offerin to make you my foreman right now  al you sort of take my breath replied dale an im sure grateful but the fact is even if i could handle the job ii dont believe id want to  make yourself want to then thet d soon come youd get interested this country will develop i seen thet years ago the government is goin to chase the apaches out of here soon homesteaders will be flockin in big future dale you want to get in now an  here auchincloss hesitated then spoke lower  an take your chance with the girl ill be on your side  a slight vibrating start ran over dales stalwart form  alyoure plumb dotty he exclaimed  dotty me dotty ejaculated auchincloss then he swore in a minit ill tell you what you are  but al that talks sosolike an old fools  huh an why so  because thatwonderful girl would never look at me dale replied simply  i seen her lookin already declared al bluntly  dale shook his head as if arguing with the old rancher was hopeless  never mind thet went on al mebbe i am a dotty old foolspecially for takin a shine to you but i say againwill you come down to pine and be my foreman  no replied dale  milt ive no sonan imafraid of beasley this was uttered in an agitated whisper  al you make me ashamed said dale hoarsely i cant come ive no nerve  youve no what  al i dont know whats wrong with me but im afraid id find out if i came down there  ahuh its the girl  i dont know but im afraid so an i wont come  aw yes you will  helen rose with beating heart and tingling ears and moved away out of hearing she had listened too long to what had not been intended for her ears yet she could not be sorry she walked a few rods along the brook out from under the pines and standing in the open edge of the park she felt the beautiful scene still her agitation the following moments then were the happiest she had spent in paradise park and the profoundest of her whole life  presently her uncle called her  nell this here hunter wants to give you thet black hoss an i say you take him  ranger deserves better care than i can give him said dale he runs free in the woods most of the time id be obliged if shed have him an the hound pedro too  bo swept a saucy glance from dale to her sister  sure shell have ranger just offer him to me  dale stood there expectantly holding a blanket in his hand ready to saddle the horse carmichael walked around ranger with that appraising eye so keen in cowboys  las vegas do you know anything about horses asked bo  me wal if you ever buy or trade a hoss you shore have me there replied carmichael  what do you think of ranger went on bo  shore id buy him sudden if i could  mr las vegas youre too late asserted helen as she advanced to lay a hand on the horse  ranger is mine  dale smoothed out the blanket and folding it he threw it over the horse and then with one powerful swing he set the saddle in place  thank you very much for him said helen softly  youre welcome an im sure glad responded dale and then after a few deft strong pulls at the straps he continued there hes ready for you  with that he laid an arm over the saddle and faced helen as she stood patting and smoothing ranger helen strong and calm now in feminine possession of her secret and his as well as her composure looked frankly and steadily at dale he seemed composed too yet the bronze of his fine face was a trifle pale  but i cant thank youill never be able to repay youfor your service to me and my sister said helen  i reckon you neednt try dale returned an my service as you call it has been good for me  are you going down to pine with us  no  but you will come soon  not very soon i reckon he replied and averted his gaze  when  hardly before spring  spring that is a long time wont you come to see me sooner than that  if i can get down to pine  youre the first friend ive made in the west said helen earnestly  youll make many morean i reckon soon forget him you called the man of the forest  i never forget any of my friends and youve been thethe biggest friend i ever had  ill be proud to remember  but will you rememberwill you promise to come to pine  i reckon  thank you alls well then my friend goodby  goodby he said clasping her hand his glance was clear warm beautiful yet it was sad  auchinclosss hearty voice broke the spell then helen saw that the others were mounted bo had ridden up close her face was earnest and happy and grieved all at once as she bade goodby to dale the packburros were hobbling along toward the green slope helen was the last to mount but roy was the last to leave the hunter pedro came reluctantly  it was a merry singing train which climbed that brown odorous trail under the dark spruces helen assuredly was happy yet a pang abided in her breast  she remembered that halfway up the slope there was a turn in the trail where it came out upon an open bluff the time seemed long but at last she got there and she checked ranger so as to have a moments gaze down into the park  it yawned there a darkgreen and brightgold gulf asleep under a westering sun exquisite wild lonesome then she saw dale standing in the open space between the pines and the spruces he waved to her and she returned the salute  roy caught up with her then and halted his horse he waved his sombrero to dale and let out a piercing yell that awoke the sleeping echoes splitting strangely from cliff to cliff  shore milt never knowed what it was to be lonesome said roy as if thinking aloud but hell know now  ranger stepped out of his own accord and turning off the ledge entered the spruce forest helen lost sight of paradise park for hours then she rode along a shady fragrant trail seeing the beauty of color and wildness hearing the murmur and rush and roar of water but all the while her mind revolved the sweet and momentous realization which had thrilled herthat the hunter this strange man of the forest so deeply versed in nature and so unfamiliar with emotion aloof and simple and strong like the elements which had developed him had fallen in love with her and did not know it    chapter xv  dale stood with face and arm upraised and he watched helen ride off the ledge to disappear in the forest that vast spruce slope seemed to have swallowed her she was gone slowly dale lowered his arm with gesture expressive of a strange finality an eloquent despair of which he was unconscious  he turned to the park to his camp and the many duties of a hunter the park did not seem the same nor his home nor his work  i reckon this feelins natural he soliloquized resignedly but its sure queer for me thats what comes of makin friends nell an bo now they made a difference an a difference i never knew before  he calculated that this difference had been simply one of responsibility and then the charm and liveliness of the companionship of girls and finally friendship these would pass now that the causes were removed  before he had worked an hour around camp he realized a change had come but it was not the one anticipated always before he had put his mind on his tasks whatever they might be now he worked while his thoughts were strangely involved  the little bear cub whined at his heels the tame deer seemed to regard him with deep questioning eyes the big cougar padded softly here and there as if searching for something  you all miss themnowi reckon said dale well theyre gone an youll have to get along with me  some vague approach to irritation with his pets surprised him presently he grew both irritated and surprised with himselfa state of mind totally unfamiliar several times as old habit brought momentary abstraction he found himself suddenly looking around for helen and bo and each time the shock grew stronger they were gone but their presence lingered after his camp chores were completed he went over to pull down the leanto which the girls had utilized as a tent the spruce boughs had dried out brown and sear the wind had blown the roof awry the sides were leaning in as there was now no further use for this little habitation he might better pull it down dale did not acknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many times therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it  for the first time since roy and he had built the leanto he stepped inside nothing was more certain than the fact that he experienced a strange sensation perfectly incomprehensible to him the blankets lay there on the spruce boughs disarranged and thrown back by hurried hands yet still holding something of round folds where the slender forms had nestled a black scarf often worn by bo lay covering the pillow of pineneedles a red ribbon that helen had worn on her hair hung from a twig these articles were all that had been forgotten dale gazed at them attentively then at the blankets and all around the fragrant little shelter and he stepped outside with an uncomfortable knowledge that he could not destroy the place where helen and bo had spent so many hours  whereupon in studious mood dale took up his rifle and strode out to hunt his winter supply of venison had not yet been laid in action suited his mood he climbed far and passed by many a watching buck to slay which seemed murder at last he jumped one that was wild and bounded away this he shot and set himself a herculean task in packing the whole carcass back to camp burdened thus he staggered under the trees sweating freely many times laboring for breath aching with toil until at last he had reached camp there he slid the deer carcass off his shoulders and standing over it he gazed down while his breast labored it was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen but neither in stalking it nor making a wonderful shot nor in packing home a weight that would have burdened two men nor in gazing down at his beautiful quarry did dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter  im a little off my feed he mused as he wiped sweat from his heated face maybe a little dotty as i called al but thatll pass  whatever his state it did not pass as of old after a long days hunt he reclined beside the campfire and watched the golden sunset glows change on the ramparts as of old he laid a hand on the soft furry head of the pet cougar as of old he watched the gold change to red and then to dark and twilight fall like a blanket as of old he listened to the dreamy lulling murmur of the water fall the old familiar beauty wildness silence and loneliness were there but the old content seemed strangely gone  soberly he confessed then that he missed the happy company of the girls he did not distinguish helen from bo in his slow introspection when he sought his bed he did not at once fall to sleep always after a few moments of wakefulness while the silence settled down or the wind moaned through the pines he had fallen asleep this night he found different though he was tired sleep would not soon come the wilderness the mountains the park the campall seemed to have lost something even the darkness seemed empty and when at length dale fell asleep it was to be troubled by restless dreams  up with the keenedged steelybright dawn he went at the his tasks with the springy stride of the deerstalker  at the end of that strenuous day which was singularly full of the old excitement and action and danger and of new observations he was bound to confess that no longer did the chase suffice for him  many times on the heights that day with the wind keen in his face and the vast green billows of spruce below him he had found that he was gazing without seeing halting without object dreaming as he had never dreamed before  once when a magnificent elk came out upon a rocky ridge and whistling a challenge to invisible rivals stood there a target to stir any hunters pulse dale did not even raise his rifle into his ear just then rang helens voice milt dale you are no indian giving yourself to a hunters wildlife is selfish it is wrong you love this lonely life but it is not work work that does not help others is not a real mans work  from that moment conscience tormented him it was not what he loved but what he ought to do that counted in the sum of good achieved in the world old al auchincloss had been right dale was wasting strength and intelligence that should go to do his share in the development of the west now that he had reached maturity if through his knowledge of natures law he had come to see the meaning of the strife of men for existence for place for possession and to hold them in contempt that was no reason why he should keep himself aloof from them from some work that was needed in an incomprehensible world  dale did not hate work but he loved freedom to be alone to live with nature to feel the elements to labor and dream and idle and climb and sleep unhampered by duty by worry by restriction by the petty interests of menthis had always been his ideal of living cowboys riders sheepherders farmersthese toiled on from one place and one job to another for the little money doled out to them nothing beautiful nothing significant had ever existed in that for him he had worked as a boy at every kind of rangework and of all that humdrum waste of effort he had liked sawing wood best once he had quit a job of branding cattle because the smell of burning hide the bawl of the terrified calf had sickened him if men were honest there would be no need to scar cattle he had never in the least desired to own land and droves of stock and make deals with ranchmen deals advantageous to himself why should a man want to make a deal or trade a horse or do a piece of work to another mans disadvantage selfpreservation was the first law of life but as the plants and trees and birds and beasts interpreted that law merciless and inevitable as they were they had neither greed nor dishonesty they lived by the grand rule of what was best for the greatest number  but dales philosophy cold and clear and inevitable like nature itself began to be pierced by the human appeal in helen rayners words what did she mean not that he should lose his love of the wilderness but that he realize himself many chance words of that girl had depth he was young strong intelligent free from taint of disease or the fever of drink he could do something for others who if that mattered there for instance was poor old mrs cass aged and lame now there was al auchincloss dying in his boots afraid of enemies and wistful for his blood and his property to receive the fruit of his labors there were the two girls helen and bo new and strange to the west about to be confronted by a big problem of ranch life and rival interests dale thought of still more people in the little village of pineof others who had failed whose lives were hard who could have been made happier by kindness and assistance  what then was the duty of milt dale to himself because men preyed on one another and on the weak should he turn his back upon a socalled civilization or should he grow like them clear as a bell came the answer that his duty was to do neither and then he saw how the little village of pine as well as the whole world needed men like him he had gone to nature to the forest to the wilderness for his development and all the judgments and efforts of his future would be a result of that education  thus dale lying in the darkness and silence of his lonely park arrived at a conclusion that he divined was but the beginning of a struggle  it took long introspection to determine the exact nature of that struggle but at length it evolved into the paradox that helen rayner had opened his eyes to his duty as a man that he accepted it yet found a strange obstacle in the perplexing tumultuous sweet fear of ever going near her again  suddenly then all his thought revolved around the girl and thrown off his balance he weltered in a wilderness of unfamiliar strange ideas  when he awoke next day the fight was on in earnest in his sleep his mind had been active the idea that greeted him beautiful as the sunrise flashed in memory of auchinclosss significant words take your chance with the girl  the old rancher was in his dotage he hinted of things beyond the range of possibility that idea of a chance for dale remained before his consciousness only an instant stars were unattainable life could not be fathomed the secret of nature did not abide alone on the earththese theories were not any more impossible of proving than that helen rayner might be for him  nevertheless her strange coming into his life had played havoc the extent of which he had only begun to realize   for a month he tramped through the forest it was october a still golden fulfilling season of the year and everywhere in the vast dark green a glorious blaze of oak and aspen made beautiful contrast he carried his rifle but he never used it he would climb miles and go this way and that with no object in view yet his eye and ear had never been keener hours he would spend on a promontory watching the distance where the golden patches of aspen shone bright out of darkgreen mountain slopes he loved to fling himself down in an aspengrove at the edge of a senaca and there lie in that radiance like a veil of gold and purple and red with the white treetrunks striping the shade always whether there were breeze or not the aspenleaves quivered ceaselessly wonderfully like his pulses beyond his control often he reclined against a mossy rock beside a mountain stream to listen to watch to feel all that was there while his mind held a haunting darkeyed vision of a girl on the lonely heights like an eagle he sat gazing down into paradise park that was more and more beautiful but would never again be the same never fill him with content never be all and all to him  late in october the first snow fell it melted at once on the south side of the park but the north slopes and the rims and domes above stayed white  dale had worked quick and hard at curing and storing his winter supply of food and now he spent days chopping and splitting wood to burn during the months he would be snowedin he watched for the darkgray fastscudding stormclouds and welcomed them when they came once there lay ten feet of snow on the trails he would be snowedin until spring it would be impossible to go down to pine and perhaps during the long winter he would be cured of this strange nameless disorder of his feelings  november brought storms up on the peaks flurries of snow fell in the park every day but the sunny south side where dales camp lay retained its autumnal color and warmth not till late in winter did the snow creep over this secluded nook  the morning came at last piercingly keen and bright when dale saw that the heights were impassable the realization brought him a poignant regret he had not guessed how he had wanted to see helen rayner again until it was too late that opened his eyes a raging frenzy of action followed in which he only tired himself physically without helping himself spiritually  it was sunset when he faced the west looking up at the pink snowdomes and the darkgolden fringe of spruce and in that moment he found the truth  i love that girl i love that girl he spoke aloud to the distant white peaks to the winds to the loneliness and silence of his prison to the great pines and to the murmuring stream and to his faithful pets it was his tragic confession of weakness of amazing truth of hopeless position of pitiful excuse for the transformation wrought in him  dales struggle ended there when he faced his soul to understand himself was to be released from strain worry ceaseless importuning doubt and wonder and fear but the fever of unrest of uncertainty had been nothing compared to a sudden upflashing torment of love  with somber deliberation he set about the tasks needful and others that he might makehis campfires and meals the care of his pets and horses the mending of saddles and packharness the curing of buckskin for moccasins and huntingsuits so his days were not idle but all this work was habit for him and needed no application of mind  and dale like some men of lonely wilderness lives who did not retrograde toward the savage was a thinker love made him a sufferer  the surprise and shame of his unconscious surrender the certain hopelessness of it the long years of communion with all that was wild lonely and beautiful the wonderfully developed insight into natures secrets and the suddendawning revelation that he was no omniscient being exempt from the ruthless ordinary destiny of manall these showed him the strength of his manhood and of his passion and that the life he had chosen was of all lives the one calculated to make love sad and terrible  helen rayner haunted him in the sunlight there was not a place around camp which did not picture her lithe vigorous body her dark thoughtful eyes her eloquent resolute lips and the smile that was so sweet and strong at night she was there like a slender specter pacing beside him under the moaning pines every campfire held in its heart the glowing white radiance of her spirit  nature had taught dale to love solitude and silence but love itself taught him their meaning solitude had been created for the eagle on his crag for the blasted mountain fir lonely and gnarled on its peak for the elk and the wolf but it had not been intended for man and to live always in the silence of wild places was to become obsessed with selfto think and dreamto be happy which state however pursued by man was not good for him man must be given imperious longings for the unattainable  it needed then only the memory of an unattainable woman to render solitude passionately desired by a man yet almost unendurable dale was alone with his secret and every pine everything in that park saw him shaken and undone  in the dark pitchy deadness of night when there was no wind and the cold on the peaks had frozen the waterfall then the silence seemed insupportable many hours that should have been given to slumber were paced out under the cold white pitiless stars under the lonely pines  dales memory betrayed him mocked his restraint cheated him of any peace and his imagination sharpened by love created pictures fancies feelings that drove him frantic  he thought of helen rayners strong shapely brown hand in a thousand different actions it haunted him how quick and deft in campfire tasks how graceful and swift as she plaited her dark hair how tender and skilful in its ministration when one of his pets had been injured how eloquent when pressed tight against her breast in a moment of fear on the dangerous heights how expressive of unutterable things when laid on his arm  dale saw that beautiful hand slowly creep up his arm across his shoulder and slide round his neck to clasp there he was powerless to inhibit the picture and what he felt then was boundless unutterable no woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand and heretofore no such imaginings had ever crossed his mind yet deep in him somewhere hidden had been this waiting sweet and imperious need in the bright day he appeared to ward off such fancies but at night he was helpless and every fancy left him weaker wilder  when at the culmination of this phase of his passion dale who had never known the touch of a womans lips suddenly yielded to the illusion of helen rayners kisses he found himself quite mad filled with rapture and despair loving her as he hated himself it seemed as if he had experienced all these terrible feelings in some former life and had forgotten them in this life he had no right to think of her but he could not resist it imagining the sweet surrender of her lips was a sacrilege yet here in spite of will and honor and shame he was lost  dale at length was vanquished and he ceased to rail at himself or restrain his fancies he became a dreamy sadeyed campfire gazer like many another lonely man separated by chance or error from what the heart hungered most for but this great experience when all its significance had clarified in his mind immeasurably broadened his understanding of the principles of nature applied to life  love had been in him stronger than in most men because of his keen vigorous lonely years in the forest where health of mind and body were intensified and preserved how simple how natural how inevitable he might have loved any finespirited healthybodied girl like a tree shooting its branches and leaves its whole entity toward the sunlight so had he grown toward a womans love why because the thing he revered in nature the spirit the universal the life that was god had created at his birth or before his birth the three tremendous instincts of natureto fight for life to feed himself to reproduce his kind that was all there was to it but oh the mystery the beauty the torment and the terror of this third instinctthis hunger for the sweetness and the glory of a womans love    chapter xvi  helen rayner dropped her knitting into her lap and sat pensively gazing out of the window over the bare yellow ranges of her uncles ranch  the winter day was bright but steely and the wind that whipped down from the whitecapped mountains had a keen frosty edge a scant snow lay in protected places cattle stood bunched in the lee of ridges low sheets of dust scurried across the flats  the big livingroom of the ranchhouse was warm and comfortable with its red adobe walls its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed and its manycolored blankets bo rayner sat before the fire curled up in an armchair absorbed in a book on the floor lay the hound pedro his racy fine head stretched toward the warmth  did uncle call asked helen with a start out of her reverie  i didnt hear him replied bo  helen rose to tiptoe across the floor and softly parting some curtains she looked into the room where her uncle lay he was asleep sometimes he called out in his slumbers for weeks now he had been confined to his bed slowly growing weaker with a sigh helen returned to her windowseat and took up her work  bo the sun is bright she said the days are growing longer im so glad  nell youre always wishing time away for me it passes quickly enough replied the sister  but i love spring and summer and falland i guess i hate winter returned helen thoughtfully  the yellow ranges rolled away up to the black ridges and they in turn swept up to the cold white mountains helens gaze seemed to go beyond that snowy barrier and bos keen eyes studied her sisters earnest sad face  nell do you ever think of dale she queried suddenly  the question startled helen a slow blush suffused neck and cheek  of course she replied as if surprised that bo should ask such a thing  ii shouldnt have asked that said bo softly and then bent again over her book  helen gazed tenderly at that bright bowed head in this swiftflying eventful busy winter during which the management of the ranch had devolved wholly upon helen the little sister had grown away from her bo had insisted upon her own free will and she had followed it to the amusement of her uncle to the concern of helen to the dismay and bewilderment of the faithful mexican housekeeper and to the undoing of all the young men on the ranch  helen had always been hoping and waiting for a favorable hour in which she might find this wilful sister once more susceptible to wise and loving influence but while she hesitated to speak slow footsteps and a jingle of spurs sounded without and then came a timid knock bo looked up brightly and ran to open the door  oh its onlyyou she uttered in withering scorn to the one who knocked  helen thought she could guess who that was  how are youall asked a drawling voice  well mister carmichael if that interests youim quite ill replied bo freezingly  ill aw no now  its a fact if i dont die right off ill have to be taken back to missouri said bo casually  are you goin to ask me in queried carmichael bluntly its coldan ive got somethin to say to  to me well youre not backward i declare retorted bo  miss rayner i reckon it ll be strange to youfindin out i didnt come to see you  indeed no but what was strange was the deluded idea i hadthat you meant to apologize to melike a gentleman come in mr carmichael my sister is here  the door closed as helen turned round carmichael stood just inside with his sombrero in hand and as he gazed at bo his lean face seemed hard in the few months since autumn he had changedaged it seemed and the once young frank alert and careless cowboy traits had merged into the making of a man helen knew just how much of a man he really was he had been her mainstay during all the complex working of the ranch that had fallen upon her shoulders  wal i reckon you was deluded all rightif you thought id crawl like them other lovers of yours he said with cool deliberation  bo turned pale and her eyes fairly blazed yet even in what must have been her fury helen saw amaze and pain  other lovers i think the biggest delusion here is the way you flatter yourself replied bo stingingly  me flatter myself nope you dont savvy me im shore hatin myself these days  small wonder i certainly hate youwith all my heart  at this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see bo flaunt herself out of the room but he heard the door close and then slowly came toward helen  cheer up las vegas said helen smiling bos hottempered  miss nell im just like a dog the meaner she treats me the more i love her he replied dejectedly  to helens first instinct of liking for this cowboy there had been added admiration respect and a growing appreciation of strong faithful developing character carmichaels face and hands were red and chapped from winter winds the leather of wristbands belt and boots was all worn shiny and thin little streaks of dust fell from him as he breathed heavily he no longer looked the dashing cowboy ready for a dance or lark or fight  how in the world did you offend her so asked helen bo is furious i never saw her so angry as that  miss nell it was jest this way began carmichael shore bos knowed i was in love with her i asked her to marry me an she wouldnt say yes or no an mean as it soundsshe never run away from it thets shore weve had some quarrelstwo of them bad an this

time shed gone anywhere with me i shore was proud but thet dance was hell bo carried on somethin turrible an i  tell me what did she do demanded helen anxiously im responsible for her ive got to see

only was he sighed  then how can you say she wasnt true to you be reasonable  i reckon now miss nell thet no one can be in love an act reasonable rejoined the cowboy i dont know how to explain but the

whats happened  wal thet turner boy who rides for beasley he was hot after bo returned carmichael and he spoke as if memory hurt him reckon ive no use for turner hes a finelookin strappin big cowpuncher an calculated to win the girls he brags thet he can an i reckon hes right wal he was always hangin round bo an he stole one of my dances with bo i only had three an he comes up to say this

jackass an let them go but i wasnt mad at thet he was a better dancer than me an i wanted her to have a good time what started the hell was i seen him put his arm round her when it wasnt just time accordin to the dance an boshe didnt break any records gettin away from him she pushed him awayafter a littleafter i near died wal on the way home i had to tell her i shore did an she said what id love to forget thenthen miss nell i grabbed herit was outside here by the porch an all bright moonlighti grabbed her an hugged an kissed her good when i let her go i says sorta brave but i was plumb scaredi says wal are you goin to marry me now  he concluded with a gulp and looked at helen with woe in his eyes  oh what did bo do breathlessly queried helen  she slapped me he replied an then she says i did like you best but now i hate you an she slammed the door in my face  i think you made a great mistake said helen gravely  wal if i thought so id beg her forgiveness but i reckon i dont whats more i feel better than before im only a cowboy an never was much good till i met her then i braced i got to havin hopes studyin books an you know how ive been lookin into this ranchin game i stopped drinkin an saved my money wal she knows all thet once she said she was proud of me but it didnt seem to count big with her an if it cant count big i dont want it to count at all i reckon the madder bo is at me the more chance ive got she knows i love herthet id die for herthet im a changed man an she knows i never before thought of darin to touch her hand an she knows she flirted with turner  shes only a child replied helen and all this changethe westthe wildnessand you boys making much of herwhy its turned her head but bo will come out of it true blue she is good loving her heart is gold  i reckon i know an my faith cant be shook rejoined carmichael simply but she ought to believe thet shell make bad blood out here the west is the west any kind of girls are scarce an one like bolord we cowboys never seen none to compare with her shell make bad blood an some of it will be spilled  uncle al encourages her said helen apprehensively it tickles him to hear how the boys are after her oh she doesnt tell him but he hears and i who must stand in mothers place to her what can i do  miss nell are you on my side asked the cowboy wistfully he was strong and elemental caught in the toils of some power beyond him  yesterday helen might have hesitated at that question but today carmichael brought some proven quality of loyalty some strange depth of rugged sincerity as if she had learned his future worth  yes i am helen replied earnestly and she offered her hand  wal then it ll shore turn out happy he said squeezing her hand his smile was grateful but there was nothing in it of the victory he hinted at some of his ruddy color had gone an now i want to tell you why i come  he had lowered his voice is al asleep he whispered  yes replied helen he was a little while ago  reckon id better shut his door  helen watched the cowboy glide across the room and carefully close the door then return to her with intent eyes she sensed events in his look and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her brother  shore im the one thet fetches all the bad news to you he said regretfully  helen caught her breath there had indeed been many little calamities to mar her management of the ranchloss of cattle horses sheepthe desertion of herders to beasleyfailure of freighters to arrive when most neededfights among the cowboysand disagreements over longarranged deals  your uncle al makes a heap of this here jeff mulvey asserted carmichael  yes indeed uncle absolutely relies on jeff replied helen  wal i hate to tell you miss nell said the cowboy bitterly thet mulvey aint the man he seems  oh what do you mean  when your uncle dies mulvey is goin over to beasley an hes goin to take all the fellars wholl stick to him  could jeff be so faithlessafter so many years my uncles foreman oh how do you know  reckon i guessed long ago but wasnt shore miss nell theres a lot in the wind lately as poor old al grows weaker mulvey has been particular friendly to me an ive nursed him along cept i wouldnt drink an his pards have been particular friends with me too more an more as i loosened up you see they was shy of me when i first got here today the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft ground bud lewis whos bunked with me come out an tried to win me over to beasleysoon as auchincloss dies i palavered with bud an i wanted to know but bud would only say he was goin along with jeff an others of the outfit i told him id reckon over it an let him know he thinks ill come round  whywhy will these men leave me whenwhenoh poor uncle they bargain on his death but whytell me why  beasley has worked on themwon them over replied carmichael grimly after al dies the ranch will go to you beasley means to have it he an al was pards once an now beasley has most folks here believin he got the short end of thet deal hell have papersshorean hell have most of the men so hell just put you off an take possession thets all miss nell an you can rely on its bein true  ii believe youbut i cant believe suchsuch robbery possible gasped helen  its simple as two an two possession is law out here once beasley gets on the ground its settled what could you do with no men to fight for your property  but surely some of the men will stay with me  i reckon but not enough  then i can hire more the beeman boys and dale would come to help me  dale would come an hed help a heap i wish he was here replied carmichael soberly but theres no way to get him hes snowedup till may  i dare not confide in uncle said helen with agitation the shock might kill him then to tell him of the unfaithfulness of his old menthat would be cruel oh it cant be so bad as you think  i reckon it couldnt be no worse anmiss nell theres only one way to get out of itan thets the way of the west  how queried helen eagerly  carmichael lunged himself erect and stood gazing down at her he seemed completely detached now from that frank amiable cowboy of her first impressions the redness was totally gone from his face something strange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes  i seen beasley go in the saloon as i rode past suppose i go down there pick a quarrel with himan kill him  helen sat boltupright with a cold shock  carmichael youre not serious she exclaimed  serious i shore am thets the only way miss nell an i reckon its what al would want an between you an meit would be easier than ropin a calf these fellars round pine dont savvy guns now i come from where guns mean somethin an when i tell you i can throw a gun slick an fast why i shore aint braggin you neednt worry none about me miss nell  helen grasped that he had taken the signs of her shocked sensibility to mean she feared for his life but what had sickened her was the mere idea of bloodshed in her behalf  youdkill beasleyjust because there are rumors of histreachery gasped helen  shore itll have to be done anyhow replied the cowboy  no no its too dreadful to think of why that would be murder ii cant understand how you speak of itsoso calmly  reckon i aint doin it calmly im as mad as hell said carmichael with a reckless smile  oh if you are serious then i say nonono i forbid you i dont believe ill be robbed of my property  wal supposin beasley does put you offan takes possession what re you goin to say then demanded the cowboy in slow cool deliberation  id say the same then as now she replied  he bent his head thoughtfully while his red hands smoothed his sombrero  shore you girls havent been west very long he muttered as if apologizing for them an i reckon it takes time to learn the ways of a country  west or no west i wont have fights deliberately picked and men shot even if they do threaten me declared helen positively  all right miss nell shore i respect your wishes he returned but ill tell you this if beasley turns you an bo out of your homewal ill look him up on my own account  helen could only gaze at him as he backed to the door and she thrilled and shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her his love for bo and that which was inevitable in himself  reckon you might save us all some troublenow if youdjust get madan let me go after thet greaser  greaser do you mean beasley  shore hes a halfbreed he was born in magdalena where i heard folks say nary one of his parents was no good  that doesnt matter im thinking of humanity of law and order of what is right  wal miss nell ill wait till you get real mador till beasley  but my friend ill not get mad interrupted helen ill keep my temper  ill bet you dont he retorted mebbe you think youve none of bo in you but ill bet you could get so madonce you startedthet youd be turrible what ve you got them eyes for miss nell if you aint an auchincloss  he was smiling yet he meant every word helen felt the truth as something she feared  las vegas i wont bet but youyou will always come to mefirstif theres trouble  i promise he replied soberly and then went out  helen found that she was trembling and that there was a commotion in her breast carmichael had frightened her no longer did she hold doubt of the gravity of the situation she had seen beasley often several times close at hand and once she had been forced to meet him that time had convinced her that he had evinced personal interest in her and on this account coupled with the fact that riggs appeared to have nothing else to do but shadow her she had been slow in developing her intention of organizing and teaching a school for the children of pine riggs had become rather a doubtful celebrity in the settlements yet his bold apparent badness had made its impression from all reports he spent his time gambling drinking and bragging it was no longer news in pine what his intentions were toward helen rayner twice he had ridden up to the ranchhouse upon one occasion securing an interview with helen in spite of her contempt and indifference he was actually influencing her life there in pine and it began to appear that the other man beasley might soon direct stronger significance upon the liberty of her actions  the responsibility of the ranch had turned out to be a heavy burden it could not be managed at least by her in the way auchincloss wanted it done he was old irritable irrational and hard almost all the neighbors were set against him and naturally did not take kindly to helen  she had not found the slightest evidence of unfair dealing on the part of her uncle but he had been a hard driver then his shrewd farseeing judgment had made all his deals fortunate for him which fact had not brought a profit of friendship  of late since auchincloss had grown weaker and less dominating helen had taken many decisions upon herself with gratifying and hopeful results but the wonderful happiness that she had expected to find in the west still held aloof the memory of paradise park seemed only a dream sweeter and more intangible as time passed and fuller of vague regrets bo was a comfort but also a very considerable source of anxiety she might have been a help to helen if she had not assimilated western ways so swiftly helen wished to decide things in her own way which was as yet quite far from western so helen had been thrown more and more upon her own resources with the cowboy carmichael the only one who had come forward voluntarily to her aid  for an hour helen sat alone in the room looking out of the window and facing stern reality with a colder graver keener sense of intimacy than ever before to hold her property and to live her life in this community according to her ideas of honesty justice and law might well be beyond her powers today she had been convinced that she could not do so without fighting for them and to fight she must have friends that conviction warmed her toward carmichael and a thoughtful consideration of all he had done for her proved that she had not fully appreciated him she would make up for her oversight  there were no mormons in her employ for the good reason that auchincloss would not hire them but in one of his kindlier hours growing rare now he had admitted that the mormons were the best and the most sober faithful workers on the ranges and that his sole objection to them was just this fact of their superiority helen decided to hire the four beemans and any of their relatives or friends who would come and to do this if possible without letting her uncle know his temper now as well as his judgment was a hindrance to efficiency this decision regarding the beemans brought helen back to carmichaels fervent wish for dale and then to her own  soon spring would be at hand with its multiplicity of range tasks dale had promised to come to pine then and helen knew that promise would be kept her heart beat a little faster in spite of her businesscentered thoughts dale was there over the blacksloped snowytipped mountain shut away from the world helen almost envied him no wonder he loved loneliness solitude the sweet wild silence and beauty of paradise park but he was selfish and helen meant to show him that she needed his help when she recalled his physical prowess with animals and imagined what it must be in relation to men she actually smiled at the thought of beasley forcing her off her property if dale were there beasley would only force disaster upon himself then helen experienced a quick shock would dale answer to this situation as carmichael had answered it afforded her relief to assure herself to the contrary the cowboy was one of a bloodletting breed the hunter was a man of thought gentleness humanity this situation was one of the kind that had made him despise the littleness of men helen assured herself that he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy in all the relations of life which she had observed while with him but a doubt lingered in her mind she remembered his calm reference to snake anson and that caused a recurrence of the little shiver carmichael had given her when the doubt augmented to a possibility that she might not be able to control dale then she tried not to think of it any more it confused and perplexed her that into her mind should flash a thought that though it would be dreadful for carmichael to kill beasley for dale to do it would be a calamitya terrible thing helen did not analyze that strange thought she was as afraid of it as she was of the stir in her blood when she visualized dale  her meditation was interrupted by bo who entered the room rebelliouseyed and very lofty her manner changed which apparently owed its cause to the fact that helen was alone  is thatcowboy gone she asked  yes he left quite some time ago replied helen  i wondered if he made your eyes shineyour color burn so nell youre just beautiful  is my face burning asked helen with a little laugh so it is well bo youve no cause for jealousy las vegas cant be blamed for my blushes  jealous me of that wildeyed softvoiced twofaced cowpuncher i guess not nell rayner what d he say about me  bo he said a lot replied helen reflectively ill tell you presently first i want to ask youhas carmichael ever told you how hes helped me  no when i see himwhich hasnt been often latelyheiwell we fight nell has he helped you  helen smiled in faint amusement she was going to be sincere but she meant to keep her word to the cowboy the fact was that reflection had acquainted her with her indebtedness to carmichael  bo youve been so wild to ride halfbroken mustangsand carry on with cowboysand readand sewand keep your secrets that youve had no time for your sister or her troubles  nell burst out bo in amaze and pain she flew to helen and seized her hands what re you saying  its all true replied helen thrilling and softening this sweet sister once aroused would be hard to resist helen imagined she should hold to her tone of reproach and severity  sure its true cried bo fiercely but whats my fooling got to do with thethe rest you said nell are you keeping things from me  my dear i never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles  but iveive nursed unclesat up with himjust the same as you said bo with quivering lips  yes youve been good to him  weve no other troubles have we nell  you havent but i have responded helen reproachfully  whywhy didnt you tell me cried bo passionately what are they tell me now you must think me aa selfish hateful cat  bo ive had much to worry meand the worst is yet to come replied helen then she told bo how complicated and bewildering was the management of a big ranchwhen the owner was ill testy defective in memory and hard as steelwhen he had hoards of gold and notes but could not or would not remember his obligationswhen the neighbor ranchers had just claimswhen cowboys and sheepherders were discontented and wrangled among themselveswhen great herds of cattle and flocks of sheep had to be fed in winterwhen supplies had to be continually freighted across a muddy desert and lastly when an enemy rancher was slowly winning away the best hands with the end in view of deliberately taking over the property when the owner died then helen told how she had only that day realized the extent of carmichaels advice and help and laborhow indeed he had been a brother to herhow  but at this juncture bo buried her face in helens breast and began to cry wildly  iidont wantto hearany more she sobbed  well youve got to hear it replied helen inexorably i want you to know how hes stood by me  but i hate him  bo i suspect thats not true  i doi do  well you act and talk very strangely then  nell raynerareyouyou sticking up for thatthat devil  i am yes so far as it concerns my conscience rejoined helen earnestly i never appreciated him as he deservednot until now hes a man bo every inch of him ive seen him grow up to that in three months id never have gotten along without him i think hes fine manly big i  ill bethes made loveto you too replied bo woefully  talk sense said helen sharply he has been a brother to me but bo rayner if he had made love to me ii might have appreciated it more than you  bo raised her face flushed in part and also pale with tearwet cheeks and the telltale blaze in the blue eyes  ive been wild about that fellow but i hate him too she said with flashing spirit and i want to go on hating him so dont tell me any more  whereupon helen briefly and graphically related how carmichael had offered to kill beasley as the only way to save her property and how when she refused that he threatened he would do it anyhow  bo fell over with a gasp and clung to helen  ohnell oh now i love him more thanever she cried in mingled rage and despair  helen clasped her closely and tried to comfort her as in the old days not so very far back when troubles were not so serious as now  of course you love him she concluded i guessed that long ago and im glad but youve been wilfulfoolish you wouldnt surrender to it you wanted your fling with the other boys youreoh bo i fear you have been a sad little flirt  ii wasnt very bad tilltill he got bossy why nell he actedright offjust as if he owned me but he didnt and to show himii really did flirt with that turner fellow then hehe insulted me oh i hate him  nonsense bo you cant hate any one while you love him protested helen  much you know about that flashed bo you just can look here did you ever see a cowboy rope and throw and tie up a mean horse  yes i have  do you have any idea how strong a cowboy ishow his hands and arms are like iron  yes im sure i know that too  and how savage he is  yes  and how he goes at anything he wants to do  i must admit cowboys are abrupt responded helen with a smile  well miss rayner did you everwhen you were standing quiet like a ladydid you ever have a cowboy dive at you with a terrible lungegrab you and hold you so you couldnt move or breathe or screamhug you till all your bones crackedand kiss you so fierce and so hard that you wanted to kill him and die  helen had gradually drawn back from this blazingeyed eloquent sister and when the end of that remarkable question came it was impossible to reply  there i see you never had that done to you resumed bo with satisfaction so dont ever talk to me  ive heard his side of the story said helen constrainedly  with a start bo sat up straighter as if better to defend herself  oh so you have and i suppose youll take his parteven about thatthat bearish trick  no i think that rude and bold but bo i dont believe he meant to be either rude or bold from what he confessed to me i gather that he believed hed lose you outright or win you outright by that violence it seems girls cant play at love out here in this wild west he said there would be blood shed over you i begin to realize what he meant hes not sorry for what he did think how strange that is for he has the instincts of a gentleman hes kind gentle chivalrous evidently he had tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance he did that as a last resort in my opinion his motives were to force you to accept or refuse him and in case you refused him hed always have those forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his selfrespectwhen he thought of turner or any one else daring to be familiar with you bo i see through carmichael even if i dont make him clear to you youve got to be honest with yourself did that act of his win or lose you in other words do you love him or not  bo hid her face  oh nell it made me see how i loved himand that made me soso sick i hated him but nowthe hate is all gone    chapter xvii  when spring came at last and the willows drooped green and fresh over the brook and the range rang with bray of burro and whistle of stallion old al auchincloss had been a month in his grave  to helen it seemed longer the month had been crowded with work events and growing more hopeful duties so that it contained a world of living the uncle had not been forgotten but the innumerable restrictions to development and progress were no longer manifest beasley had not presented himself or any claim upon helen and she gathering confidence day by day began to believe all that purport of trouble had been exaggerated  in this time she had come to love her work and all that pertained to it the estate was large she had no accurate knowledge of how many acres she owned but it was more than two thousand the fine old rambling ranchhouse set like a fort on the last of the foothills corrals and fields and barns and meadows and the rolling green range beyond and innumerable sheep horses cattleall these belonged to helen to her everwondering realization and evergrowing joy still she was afraid to let herself go and be perfectly happy always there was the fear that had been too deep and strong to forget so soon  this bright fresh morning in march helen came out upon the porch to revel a little in the warmth of sunshine and the crisp pinescented wind that swept down from the mountains there was never a morning that she did not gaze mountainward trying to see with a folly she realized if the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge for all she could see it had not melted an inch and she would not confess why she sighed the desert had become green and fresh stretching away there far below her range growing dark and purple in the distance with vague buttes rising the air was full of soundnotes of blackbirds and the baas of sheep and blasts from the corrals and the clatter of light hoofs on the court below  bo was riding in from the stables helen loved to watch her on one of those fiery little mustangs but the sight was likewise given to rousing apprehensions this morning bo appeared particularly bent on frightening helen down the lane carmichael appeared waving his arms and helen at once connected him with bos manifest desire to fly away from that particular place since that day a month back when bo had confessed her love for carmichael she and helen had not spoken of it or of the cowboy the boy and girl were still at odds but this did not worry helen bo had changed much for the better especially in that she devoted herself to helen and to her work helen knew that all would turn out well in the end and so she had been careful of her rather precarious position between these two young firebrands  bo reined in the mustang at the porch steps she wore a buckskin ridingsuit which she had made herself and its soft gray with the touches of red beads was mightily becoming to her then she had grown considerably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to resemble a boy yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe red spots shone in her cheeks and her eyes held that everdangerous blaze  nell did you give me away to that cowboy she demanded  give you away exclaimed helen blankly  yes you know i told youawhile backthat i was wildly in love with him did you give me awaytell on me  she might have been furious but she certainly was not confused  why bo how could you no i did not replied helen  never gave him a hint  not even a hint you have my word for that why whats happened  he makes me sick  bo would not say any more owing to the near approach of the cowboy  mawnin miss nell he drawled i was just tellin this here miss bopeep rayner  dont call me that broke in bo with fire in her voice  wal i was just tellin her thet she wasnt goin off on any more of them long rides honest now miss nell it aint safe an  youre not my boss retorted bo  indeed sister i agree with him you wont obey me  reckon some ones got to be your boss drawled carmichael shore i aint hankerin for the job you could ride to kingdom come or off among the apachesor over here a waysat this he grinned knowinglyor anywheres for all i cared but im workin for miss nell an shes boss an if she says youre not to take them ridesyou wont savvy that miss  it was a treat for helen to see bo look at the cowboy  mister carmichael may i ask how you are going to prevent me from riding where i like  wal if youre goin worse locoed this way ill keep you offn a hoss if i have to rope you an tie you up by golly i will  his dry humor was gone and manifestly he meant what he said  wal she drawled it very softly and sweetly but venomously ifyouevertouchme again  at this he flushed then made a quick passionate gesture with his hand expressive of heat and shame  you an me will never get along he said with a dignity full of pathos i seen thet a month back when you changed suddenlike to me but nothin i say to you has any reckonin of mine im talkin for your sister its for her sake an your own i never told her an i never told you thet ive seen riggs sneakin after you twice on them desert rides wal i tell you now  the intelligence apparently had not the slightest effect on bo but helen was astonished and alarmed  riggs oh bo ive seen him myselfriding around he does not mean well you must be careful  if i ketch him again went on carmichael with his mouth lining hard im goin after him  he gave her a cool intent piercing look then he dropped his head and turned away to stride back toward the corrals  helen could make little of the manner in which her sister watched the cowboy pass out of sight  a month backwhen i changed suddenlike mused bo i wonder what he meant by that nell did i changeright after the talk you had with meabout him  indeed you did bo replied helen but it was for the better only he cant see it how proud and sensitive he is you wouldnt guess it at first bo your reserve has wounded him more than your flirting he thinks its indifference  maybe that ll be good for him declared bo does he expect me to fall on his neck hes that thickheaded why hes the locoed one not me  id like to ask you bo if youve seen how he has changed queried helen earnestly hes older hes worried either his heart is breaking for you or else he fears trouble for us i fear its both how he watches you bo he knows all you dowhere you go that about riggs sickens me  if riggs follows me and tries any of his fourflush desperado games hell have his hands full said bo grimly and that without my cowboy protector but i just wish riggs would do something then well see what las vegas tom carmichael cares then well see  bo bit out the last words passionately and jealously then she lifted her bridle to the spirited mustang  nell dont you fear for me she said i can take care of myself  helen watched her ride away all but willing to confess that there might be truth in what bo said then helen went about her work which consisted of routine duties as well as an earnest study to familiarize herself with continually new and complex conditions of ranch life every day brought new problems she made notes of all that she observed and all that was told her which habit she had found after a few weeks of trial was going to be exceedingly valuable to her she did not intend always to be dependent upon the knowledge of hired men however faithful some of them might be  this morning on her rounds she had expected developments of some kind owing to the presence of roy beeman and two of his brothers who had arrived yesterday and she was to discover that jeff mulvey accompanied by six of his coworkers and associates had deserted her without a word or even sending for their pay carmichael had predicted this helen had half doubted it was a relief now to be confronted with facts however disturbing she had fortified herself to withstand a great deal more trouble than had happened at the gateway of the main corral a huge inclosure fenced high with peeled logs she met roy beeman lasso in hand the same tall lean limping figure she remembered so well sight of him gave her an inexplicable thrilla flashing memory of an unforgettable night ride roy was to have charge of the horses on the ranch of which there were several hundred not counting many lost on range and mountain or the unbranded colts  roy took off his sombrero and greeted her this mormon had a courtesy for women that spoke well for him helen wished she had more employees like him  its jest as las vegas told us it d be he said regretfully mulvey an his pards lit out this mornin im sorry miss helen reckon thets all because i come over  i heard the news replied helen you neednt be sorry roy for im not im glad i want to know whom i can trust  las vegas says were shore in for it now  roy what do you think  i reckon so still las vegas is powerful cross these days an always lookin on the dark side with us boys now its sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof but miss helen if beasley forces the deal there will be serious trouble ive seen thet happen four or five years ago beasley rode some greasers off their farms an no one ever knowed if he had a just claim  beasley has no claim on my property my uncle solemnly swore that on his deathbed and i find nothing in his books or papers of those years when he employed beasley in fact beasley was never uncles partner the truth is that my uncle took beasley up when he was a poor homeless boy  so my old dad says replied roy but whats right dont always prevail in these parts  roy youre the keenest man ive met since i came west tell me what you think will happen  beeman appeared flattered but he hesitated to reply helen had long been aware of the reticence of these outdoor men  i reckon you mean cause an effect as milt dale would say responded roy thoughtfully  yes if beasley attempts to force me off my ranch what will happen  roy looked up and met her gaze helen remembered that singular stillness intentness of his face  wal if dale an john get here in time i reckon we can bluff thet beasley outfit  you mean my friendsmy men would confront beasleyrefuse his demandsand if necessary fight him off  i shore do replied roy  but suppose youre not all here beasley would be smart enough to choose an opportune time suppose he did put me off and take possession what then  then it d only be a matter of how soon dale or carmichaelor igot to beasley  roy i feared just that it haunts me carmichael asked me to let him go pick a fight with beasley asked me just as he would ask me about his work i was shocked and now you say daleand you  helen choked in her agitation  miss helen what else could you look for las vegas is in love with miss bo shore he told me so an dales in love with you why you couldnt stop them any more n you could stop the wind from blowin down a pine when it got ready now its some different with me im a mormon an im married but im dales pard these many years an i care a powerful sight for you an miss bo so i reckon id draw on beasley the first chance i got  helen strove for utterance but it was denied her roys simple statement of dales love had magnified her emotion by completely changing its direction she forgot what she had felt wretched about she could not look at roy  miss helen dont feel bad he said kindly shore youre not to blame your comin west hasnt made any difference in beasleys fate except mebbe to hurry it a little my dad is old an when he talks its like history he looks back on happenins wal its the nature of happenins that beasley passes away before his prime them of his breed dont live old in the west so i reckon you neednt feel bad or worry youve got friends  helen incoherently thanked him and forgetting her usual round of corrals and stables she hurried back toward the house deeply stirred throbbing and dimeyed with a feeling she could not control roy beeman had made a statement that had upset her equilibrium it seemed simple and natural yet momentous and staggering to hear that dale loved herto hear it spoken frankly earnestly by dales best friend was strange sweet terrifying but was it true her own consciousness had admitted it yet that was vastly different from a mans open statement no longer was it a dear dream a secret that seemed hers alone how she had lived on that secret hidden deep in her breast  something burned the dimness from her eyes as she looked toward the mountains and her sight became clear telescopic with its intensity magnificently the mountains loomed black inroads and patches on the slopes showed where a few days back all bad been white the snow was melting fast dale would soon be free to ride down to pine and that was an event helen prayed for yet feared as she had never feared anything   the noonday dinnerbell startled helen from a reverie that was a pleasant aftermath of her unrestraint how the hours had flown this morning at least must be credited to indolence  bo was not in the diningroom nor in her own room nor was she in sight from window or door this absence had occurred before but not particularly to disturb helen in this instance however she grew worried her nerves presaged strain there was an overcharge of sensibility in her feelings or a strange pressure in the very atmosphere she ate dinner alone looking her apprehension which was not mitigated by the expressive fears of old maria the mexican woman who served her  after dinner she sent word to roy and carmichael that they had better ride out to look for bo then helen applied herself resolutely to her books until a rapid clatter of hoofs out in the court caused her to jump up and hurry to the porch roy was riding in  did you find her queried helen hurriedly  wasnt no track or sign of her up the north range replied roy as he dismounted and threw his bridle an i was ridin back to take up her tracks from the corral an trail her but i seen las vegas comin an he waved his sombrero he was comin up from the south there he is now  carmichael appeared swinging into the lane he was mounted on helens big black ranger and he made the dust fly  wal hes seen her thets shore vouchsafed roy with relief as carmichael rode up  miss nell shes comin said the cowboy as he reined in and slid down with his graceful single motion then in a violent action characteristic of him he slammed his sombrero down on the porch and threw up both arms ive a hunch its come off  oh what exclaimed helen  now las vegas talk sense expostulated roy miss helen is shore nervous today has anythin happened  i reckon but i dont know what replied carmichael drawing a long breath folks i must be gettin old for i shore felt orful queer till i seen bo she was ridin down the ridge across the valley ridin some fast too an shell be here right off if she doesnt stop in the village  wal i hear her comin now said roy anif you asked me id say she was ridin some fast  helen heard the light swift rhythmic beat of hoofs and then out on the curve of the road that led down to pine she saw bos mustang white with lather coming on a dead run  las vegas do you see any apaches asked roy quizzingly  the cowboy made no reply but he strode out from the porch directly in front of the mustang bo was pulling hard on the bridle and had him slowing down but not controlled when he reached the house it could easily be seen that bo had pulled him to the limit of her strength which was not enough to halt him carmichael lunged for the bridle and seizing it hauled him to a standstill  at close sight of bo helen uttered a startled cry bo was white her sombrero was gone and her hair undone there were blood and dirt on her face and her ridingsuit was torn and muddy she had evidently sustained a fall roy gazed at her in admiring consternation but carmichael never looked at her at all apparently he was examining the horse well help me offsomebody cried bo peremptorily her voice was weak but not her spirit  roy sprang to help her off and when she was down it developed that she was lame  oh bo youve had a tumble exclaimed helen anxiously and she ran to assist roy they led her up the porch and to the door there she turned to look at carmichael who was still examining the spent mustang  tell himto come in she whispered  hey there las vegas called roy rustle hyar will you  when bo had been led into the sittingroom and seated in a chair carmichael entered his face was a study as slowly he walked up to bo  girl youaint hurt he asked huskily  its no fault of yours that im not crippledor dead or worse retorted bo you said the south range was the only safe ride for me and thereiit happened  she panted a little and her bosom heaved one of her gauntlets was gone and the bare band that was bruised and bloody trembled as she held it out  dear tell usare you badly hurt queried helen with hurried gentleness  not much ive had a spill replied bo but oh im madim boiling  she looked as if she might have exaggerated her doubt of injuries but certainly she had not overestimated her state of mind any blaze helen had heretofore seen in those quick eyes was tame compared to this one it actually leaped bo was more than pretty then manifestly roy was admiring her looks but carmichael saw beyond her charm and slowly he was growing pale  i rode out the south rangeas i was told began bo breathing hard and trying to control her feelings thats the ride you usually take nell and you betif youd taken it todayyoud not be here now about three miles out i climbed off the range up that cedar slope i always keep to high ground when i got up i saw two horsemen ride out of some broken rocks off to the east they rode as if to come between me and home i didnt like that i circled south about a mile farther on i spied another horseman and he showed up directly in front of me and came along slow that i liked still less it might have been accident but it looked to me as if those riders had some intent all i could do was head off to the southeast and ride you bet i did ride but i got into rough ground where id never been before it was slow going at last i made the cedars and here i cut loose believing i could circle ahead of those strange riders and come round through pine i had it wrong  here she hesitated perhaps for breath for she had spoken rapidly or perhaps to get better hold on her subject not improbably the effect she was creating on her listeners began to be significant roy sat absorbed perfectly motionless eyes keen as steel his mouth open carmichael was gazing over bos head out of the window and it seemed that he must know the rest of her narrative helen knew that her own wideeyed attention alone would have been allcompelling inspiration to bo rayner  sure i had it wrong resumed bo pretty soon heard a horse behind i looked back i saw a big bay riding down on me oh but he was running he just tore through the cedars  i was scared half out of my senses but i spurred and beat my mustang then began a race rough goingthick cedarswashes and gullies i had to make him runto keep my saddleto pick my way ohhh but it was glorious to race for funthats one thing to race for your life is another my heart was in my mouthchoking me i couldnt have yelled i was as cold as icedizzy sometimesblind othersthen my stomach turnedand i couldnt get my breath yet the wild thrills i had but i stuck on and held my own for several milesto the edge of the cedars there the big horse gained on me he came pounding closerperhaps as close as a hundred yardsi could hear him plain enough then i had my spill oh my mustang trippedthrew me way over his head i hit light but slid farand thats what scraped me so i know my knee is raw when i got to my feet the big horse dashed up throwing gravel all over meand his rider jumped off now who do you think he was  helen knew but she did not voice her conviction carmichael knew positively yet he kept silent roy was smiling as if the narrative told did not seem so alarming to him  wal the fact of you bein here safe an sound sorta makes no difference who thet sonofagun was he said  riggs harve riggs blazed bo the instant i recognized him i got over my scare and so mad i burned all through like fire i dont know what i said but it was wildand it was a whole lot you bet  you sure can ride he said  i demanded why he had dared to chase me and he said he had an important message for nell this was it tell your sister that beasley means to put her off an take the ranch if shell marry me ill block his deal if she wont marry me ill go in with beasley then he told me to hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except nell well here i amand i seem to have been breathing rather fast  she looked from helen to roy and from roy to las vegas her smile was for the latter and to any one not overexcited by her story that smile would have told volumes  wal ill be doggoned ejaculated roy feelingly  helen laughed  indeed the working of that mans mind is beyond me marry him to save my ranch i wouldnt marry him to save my life  carmichael suddenly broke his silence  bo did you see the other men  yes i was coming to that she replied i caught a glimpse of them back in the cedars the three were together or at least three horsemen were there they had halted behind some trees then on the way home i began to think even in my fury i had received impressions riggs was surprised when i got up ill bet he had not expected me to be who i was he thought i was nell i look bigger in this buckskin outfit my hair was up till i lost my hat and that was when i had the tumble he took me for nell another thing i rememberhe made some signsome motion while i was calling him names and i believe that was to keep those other men back i believe riggs had a plan with those other men to waylay nell and make off with her i absolutely know it  bo youre sosoyou jump at wild ideas so protested helen trying to believe in her own assurance but inwardly she was trembling  miss helen that aint a wild idee said roy seriously i reckon your sister is pretty close on the trail las vegas dont you savvy it thet way  carmichaels answer was to stalk out of the room  call him back cried helen apprehensively  hold on boy called roy sharply  helen reached the door simultaneously with roy the cowboy picked up his sombrero jammed it on his head gave his belt a vicious hitch that made the gunsheath jump and then in one giant step he was astride ranger  carmichael stay cried helen  the cowboy spurred the black and the stones rang under ironshod hoofs  bo call him back please call him back importuned helen in distress  i wont declared bo rayner her face shone whiter now and her eyes were like fiery flint that was her answer to a loving gentlehearted sister that was her answer to the call of the west  no use said roy quietly an i reckon id better trail him up  he too strode out and mounting his horse galloped swiftly away   it turned out that bo was more bruised and scraped and shaken than she had imagined one knee was rather badly cut which injury alone would have kept her from riding again very soon helen who was somewhat skilled at bandaging wounds worried a great deal over these sundry blotches on bos fair skin and it took considerable time to wash and dress them long after this was done and during the early supper and afterward bos excitement remained unabated the whiteness stayed on her face and the blaze in her eyes helen ordered and begged her to go to bed for the fact was bo could not stand up and her hands shook  go to bed not much she said i want to know what he does to riggs  it was that possibility which had helen in dreadful suspense if carmichael killed riggs it seemed to helen that the bottom would drop out of this structure of western life she had begun to build so earnestly and fearfully she did not believe that he would do so but the uncertainty was torturing  dear bo appealed helen you dont wantoh you do want carmichael toto kill riggs  no i dont but i wouldnt care if he did replied bo bluntly  do you thinkhe will  nell if that cowboy really loves me he read my mind right here before he left declared bo and he knew what i thought hed do  and whatsthat faltered helen  i want him to round riggs up down in the villagesomewhere in a crowd i want riggs shown up as the coward braggart fourflush that he is and insulted slapped kickeddriven out of pine  her passionate speech still rang throughout the room when there came footsteps on the porch helen hurried to raise the bar from the door and open it just as a tap sounded on the doorpost roys face stood white out of the darkness his eyes were bright and his smile made helens fearful query needless  how are youall this evenin he drawled as he came in  a fire blazed on the hearth and a lamp burned on the table by their light bo looked white and eagereyed as she reclined in the big armchair  what d he do she asked with all her amazing force  wal now aint you goin to tell me how you are  roy im all bunged up i ought to be in bed but i just couldnt sleep till i hear what las vegas did id forgive anything except him getting drunk  wal i shore can ease your mind on thet replied roy he never drank a drop  roy was distractingly slow about beginning the tale any child could have guessed he was eager to tell for once the hard intent quietness the soul of labor pain and endurance so plain in his face was softened by pleasurable emotion he poked at the burning logs with the toe of his boot helen observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no spurs then he had gone to his quarters after whatever had happened down in pine  where is he asked bo  who riggs wal i dont know but i reckon hes somewhere out in the woods nursin himself  not riggs first tell me where he is  shore then you must mean las vegas i just left him down at the cabin he was gettin ready for bed early as it is all tired out he was an thet white you wouldnt have knowed him but he looked happy at thet an the last words he said more to himself than to me i reckon was im some locoed gent but if she doesnt call me tom now shes no good  bo actually clapped her hands notwithstanding that one of them was bandaged  call him tom i should smile i will she declared in delight hurry nowwhat d  its shore powerful strange how he hates thet handle las vegas went on roy imperturbably  roy tell me what he didwhat tom didor ill scream cried bo  miss helen did you ever see the likes of thet girl asked roy appealing to helen  no roy i never did agreed helen but pleaseplease tell us what has happened  roy grinned and rubbed his hands together in a dark delight almost fiendish in its sudden revelation of a gulf of strange emotion deep within him whatever had happened to riggs had not been too much for roy beeman helen remembered hearing her uncle say that a real westerner hated nothing so hard as the swaggering desperado the makebelieve gunman who pretended to sail under the true wild and reckoning colors of the west  roy leaned his lithe tall form against the stone mantelpiece and faced the girls  when i rode out after las vegas i seen him way down the road began roy rapidly an i seen another man ridin down into pine from the other side thet was riggs only i didnt know it then las vegas rode up to the store where some fellars was hangin round an he spoke to them when i come up they was all headin for turners saloon i seen a dozen hosses hitched to the rails las vegas rode on but i got off at turners an went in with the bunch whatever it was las vegas said to them fellars shore they didnt give him away pretty soon more men strolled into turners an there got to be most twenty altogether i reckon jeff mulvey was there with his pards they had been drinkin sorta free an i didnt like the way mulvey watched me so i went out an into the store but kept alookin for las vegas he wasnt in sight but i seen riggs ridin up now turners is where riggs hangs out an does his braggin he looked powerful deep an thoughtful dismounted slow without seein the unusual number of hosses there an then he slouches into turners no more n a minute after las vegas rode down there like a streak an just as quick he was off an through thet door  roy paused as if to gain force or to choose his words his tale now appeared all directed to bo who gazed at him spellbound a fascinated listener  before i got to turners dooran thet was only a little waysi heard las vegas yell did you ever hear him wal hes got the wildest yell of any cowpuncher i ever beard quicklike i opened the door an slipped in there was riggs an las vegas alone in the center of the big saloon with the crowd edgin to the walls an slidin back of the bar riggs was whiter n a dead man i didnt hear an i dont know what las vegas yelled at him but riggs knew an so did the gang all of a sudden every man there shore seen in las vegas what riggs had always bragged he was thet time comes to every man like riggs  what d you call me he asked his jaw shakin  i aint called you yet answered las vegas i just whooped  what dye want  you scared my girl  the hell ye say whos she blustered riggs an he began to take quick looks round but he never moved a hand there was somethin tight about the way he stood las vegas had both arms half out stretched as if he meant to leap but he wasnt i never seen las vegas do thet but when i seen him then i understood it  you know an you threatened her an her sister go for your gun called las vegas low an sharp  thet put the crowd right an nobody moved riggs turned green then i almost felt sorry for him he began to shake so hed dropped a gun if he had pulled one  hyar youre offsome mistakei aint seen no gurlsi  shut up an draw yelled las vegas his voice just pierced holes in the roof an it might have been a bullet from the way riggs collapsed every man seen in a second more thet riggs wouldnt an couldnt draw he was afraid for his life he was not what he had claimed to be i dont know if he had any friends there but in the west good men an bad men all alike have no use for riggss kind an thet stony quiet broke with hawhaw it shore was as pitiful to see riggs as it was fine to see las vegas  when he dropped his arms then i knowed there would be no gunplay an then las vegas got red in the face he slapped riggs with one hand then with the other an he began to cuss him i shore never knowed thet nicespoken las vegas carmichael could use such language it was a stream of the baddest names known out here an lots i never heard of now an then i caught somethin like lowdown an sneak an fourflush an longhaired skunk but for the most part they was just the cussedest kind of names an las vegas spouted them till he was black in the face an foamin at the mouth an hoarser n a bawlin cow  when he got out of breath from cussin he punched riggs all about the saloon threw him outdoors knocked him down an kicked him till he got kickin him down the road with the whole hawhawed gang behind an he drove him out of town    chapter xviii  for two days bo was confined to her bed suffering considerable pain and subject to fever during which she talked irrationally some of this talk afforded helen as vast an amusement as she was certain it would have lifted tom carmichael to a seventh heaven  the third day however bo was better and refusing to remain in bed she hobbled to the sittingroom where she divided her time between staring out of the window toward the corrals and pestering helen with questions she tried to make appear casual but helen saw through her case and was in a state of glee what she hoped most for was that carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for bo it was that kind of treatment the young lady needed and now was the great opportunity helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint  neither this day nor the next however did he put in an appearance at the house though helen saw him twice on her rounds he was busy as usual and greeted her as if nothing particular had happened  roy called twice once in the afternoon and again during the evening he grew more likable upon longer acquaintance this last visit he rendered bo speechless by teasing her about another girl carmichael was going to take to a dance bos face showed that her vanity could not believe this statement but that her intelligence of young men credited it with being possible roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind he made a dry casual little remark about the snow never melting on the mountains during the latter part of march and the look with which he accompanied this remark brought a blush to helens cheek  after roy had departed bo said to helen confound that fellow he sees right through me  my dear youre rather transparent these days murmured helen  you neednt talk he gave you a dig retorted bo he just knows youre dying to see the snow melt  gracious i hope im not so bad as that of course i want the snow melted and spring to come and flowers  hal ha ha taunted bo nell rayner do you see any green in my eyes spring to come yes the poet said in the spring a young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love but that poet meant a young woman  helen gazed out of the window at the white stars  nell have you seen himsince i was hurt continued bo with an effort  him who  oh whom do you suppose i mean tom she responded and the last word came with a burst  tom whos he ah you mean las vegas yes ive seen him  well did he ask aabout me  i believe he did ask how you weresomething like that  humph nell i dont always trust you after that she relapsed into silence read awhile and dreamed awhile looking into the fire and then she limped over to kiss helen good night and left the room  next day she was rather quiet seeming upon the verge of one of the dispirited spells she got infrequently early in the evening just after the lights had been lit and she had joined helen in the sittingroom a familiar step sounded on the loose boards of the porch  helen went to the door to admit carmichael he was cleanshaven dressed in his dark suit which presented such marked contrast from his ridinggarb and he wore a flower in his buttonhole nevertheless despite all this style he seemed more than usually the cool easy careless cowboy  evenin miss helen he said as he stalked in evenin miss bo how are youall  helen returned his greeting with a welcoming smile  good eveningtom said bo demurely  that assuredly was the first time she had ever called him tom as she spoke she looked distractingly pretty and tantalizing but if she had calculated to floor carmichael with the initial halfpromising wholly mocking use of his name she had reckoned without cause the cowboy received that greeting as if he had heard her use it a thousand times or had not heard it at all helen decided if he was acting a part he was certainly a clever actor he puzzled her somewhat but she liked his look and his easy manner and the something about him that must have been his unconscious sense of pride he had gone far enough perhaps too far in his overtures to bo  how are you feelin he asked  im better today she replied with downcast eyes but im lame yet  reckon that bronc piled you up miss helen said there shore wasnt any joke about the cut on your knee now a fellars knee is a bad place to hurt if he has to keep on ridin  oh ill be well soon hows sam i hope he wasnt crippled  thet samwhy hes so tough he never knowed he had a fall  tomii want to thank you for giving riggs what he deserved  she spoke it earnestly eloquently and for once she had no sly little intonation or pert allurement such as was her wont to use on this infatuated young man  aw you heard about that replied carmichael with a wave of his hand to make light of it nothin much it had to be done an shore i was afraid of roy hed been bad an so would any of the other boys im sorta lookin out for all of them you know actin as miss helens foreman now  helen was unutterably tickled the effect of his speech upon bo was stupendous he had disarmed her he had with the finesse and tact and suavity of a diplomat removed himself from obligation and the detachment of self the casual thing be apparently made out of his magnificent championship was bewildering and humiliating to bo she sat silent for a moment or two while helen tried to fit easily into the conversation it was not likely that bo would long be at a loss for words and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her wonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a twinkling anyway plain it was that a lesson had sunk deep she looked startled hurt wistful and finally sweetly defiant  butyou told riggs i was your girl thus bo unmasked her battery and helen could not imagine how carmichael would ever resist that and the soft arch glance which accompanied it  helen did not yet know the cowboy any more than did bo  shore i had to say thet i had to make it strong before thet gang i reckon it was presumin of me an i shore apologize  bo stared at him and then giving a little gasp she drooped  wal i just run in to say howdy an to inquire after youall said carmichael im goin to the dance an as flo lives out of town a ways id shore better rustle good night miss bo i hope youll be ridin sam soon an good night miss helen  bo roused to a very friendly and laconic little speech much overdone carmichael strode out and helen bidding him goodby closed the door after him  the instant he had departed bos transformation was tragic  flo he meant flo stubbsthat ugly crosseyed bold little frump  bo expostulated helen the young lady is not beautiful i grant but shes very nice and pleasant i liked her  nell rayner men are no good and cowboys are the worst declared bo terribly  why didnt you appreciate tom when you had him asked helen  bo had been growing furious but now the allusion in past tense to the conquest she had suddenly and amazingly found dear quite broke her spirit it was a very pale unsteady and miserable girl who avoided helens gaze and left the room  next day bo was not approachable from any direction helen found her a victim to a multiplicity of moods ranging from woe to dire dark broodings from them to wistfulness and at last to a pride that sustained her  late in the afternoon at helens leisure hour when she and bo were in the sittingroom horses tramped into the court and footsteps mounted the porch opening to a loud knock helen was surprised to see beasley and out in the court were several mounted horsemen helens heart sank this visit indeed had been foreshadowed  afternoon miss rayner said beasley doffing his sombrero ive called on a little business deal will you see me  helen acknowledged his greeting while she thought rapidly she might just as well see him and have that inevitable interview done with  come in she said and when he had entered she closed the door my sister mr beasley  how d you do miss said the rancher in bluff loud voice  bo acknowledged the introduction with a frigid little bow  at close range beasley seemed a forceful personality as well as a rather handsome man of perhaps thirtyfive heavy of build swarthy of skin and sloeblack of eye like that of the mexicans whose blood was reported to be in him he looked crafty confident and selfcentered if helen had never heard of him before that visit she would have distrusted him  id called sooner but i was waitin for old jose the mexican who herded for me when i was pardner to your uncle said beasley and he sat down to put his huge gloved hands on his knees  yes queried helen interrogatively  jose rustled over from magdalena an now i can back up my claim miss rayner this hyar ranch ought to be mine an is mine it wasnt so big or so well stocked when al auchincloss beat me out of it i reckon ill allow for thet ive papers an old jose for witness an i calculate youll pay me eighty thousand dollars or else ill take over the ranch  beasley spoke in an ordinary matteroffact tone that certainly seemed sincere and his manner was blunt but perfectly natural  mr beasley your claim is no news to me responded helen quietly ive heard about it and i questioned my uncle he swore on his deathbed that he did not owe you a dollar indeed he claimed the indebtedness was yours to him i could find nothing in his papers so i must repudiate your claim i will not take it seriously  miss rayner i cant blame you for takin als word against mine said beasley an your stand is natural but youre a stranger here an you know nothin of stock deals in these ranges it aint fair to speak bad of the dead but the truth is thet al auchincloss got his start by stealin sheep an unbranded cattle thet was the start of every rancher i know it was mine an we none of us ever thought of it as rustlin  helen could only stare her surprise and doubt at this statement  talks cheap anywhere an in the west talk aint much at all continued beasley im no talker i jest want to tell my case an make a deal if youll have it i can prove more in black an white an with witness than you can thets my case the deal id make is this lets marry an settle a bad deal thet way  the mans direct assumption absolutely without a qualifying consideration for her womans attitude was amazing ignorant and base but helen was so well prepared for it that she hid her disgust  thank you mr beasley but i cant accept your offer she replied  would you take time an consider he asked spreading wide his huge gloved hands  absolutely no  beasley rose to his feet he showed no disappointment or chagrin but the bold pleasantness left his face and slight as that change was it stripped him of the only redeeming quality he showed  thet means ill force you to pay me the eighty thousand or put you off he said  mr beasley even if i owed you that how could i raise so enormous a sum i dont owe it and i certainly wont be put off my property you cant put me off  an why cant i he demanded with lowering dark gaze  because your claim is dishonest and i can prove it declared helen forcibly  who re you goin to prove it tothet im dishonest  to my mento your mento the people of pineto everybody theres not a person who wont believe me  he seemed curious discomfited surlily annoyed and yet fascinated by her statement or else by the quality and appearance of her as she spiritedly defended her cause  an how re you goin to prove all thet he growled  mr beasley do you remember last fall when you met snake anson with his gang up in the woodsand hired him to make off with me asked helen in swift ringing words  the dark olive of beasleys bold face shaded to a dirty white  whaat he jerked out hoarsely  i see you remember well milt dale was hidden in the loft of that cabin where you met anson he heard every word of your deal with the outlaw  beasley swung his arm in sudden violence so hard that he flung his glove to the floor as he stooped to snatch it up he uttered a sibilant hiss then stalking to the door he jerked it open and slammed it behind him his loud voice hoarse with passion preceded the scrape and crack of hoofs   shortly after supper that day when helen was just recovering her composure carmichael presented himself at the open door bo was not there in the dimming twilight helen saw that the cowboy was pale somber grim  oh whats happened cried helen  roys been shot it come off in turners saloon but he aint dead we packed him over to widow casss an he said for me to tell you hed pull through  shot pull through repeated helen in slow unrealizing exclamation she was conscious of a deep internal tumult and a cold checking of blood in all her external body  yes shot replied carmichael fiercely  an whatever he says i reckon he wont pull through  o heaven how terrible burst out helen he was so goodsuch a man what a pity oh he must have met that in my behalf tell me what happened who shot him  wal i dont know an thets whats made me hoppin mad i wasnt there when it come off an he wont tell me  why not  i dont know thet either i reckoned first it was because he wanted to get even but after thinkin it over i guess he doesnt want me lookin up any one right now for fear i might get hurt an youre goin to need your friends thets all i can make of roy  then helen hurriedly related the event of beasleys call on her that afternoon and all that had occurred  wal the halfbreed sonofagreaser ejaculated carmichael in utter confoundment he wanted you to marry him  he certainly did i must say it was aa rather abrupt proposal  carmichael appeared to be laboring with speech that had to be smothered behind his teeth at last he let out an explosive breath  miss nell ive shore felt in my bones thet im the boy slated to brand thet big bull  oh he must have shot roy he left here in a rage  i reckon you can coax it out of roy fact is all i could learn was thet roy come in the saloon alone beasley was there an riggs  riggs interrupted helen  shore riggs he come back again but hed better keep out of my way an jeff mulvey with his outfit turner told me he heard an argument an then a shot the gang cleared out leavin roy on the floor i come in a little later roy was still layin there nobody was doin anythin for him an nobody had i hold that against turner wal i got help an packed roy over to widow casss roy seemed all right but he was too bright an talky to suit me the bullet hit his lung thets shore an he lost a sight of blood before we stopped it thet skunk turner might have lent a hand an if roy croaks i reckon ill  tom why must you always be reckoning to kill somebody demanded helen angrily  cause somebodys got to be killed round here thets why he snapped back  even soshould you risk leaving bo and me without a friend asked helen reproachfully  at that carmichael wavered and lost something of his sullen deadliness  aw miss nell im only mad if youll just be patient with mean mebbe coax me but i cant see no other way out  lets hope and pray said helen earnestly you spoke of my coaxing roy to tell who shot him when can i see him  tomorrow i reckon ill come for you fetch bo along with you weve got to play safe from now on an what do you say to me an hal sleepin here at the ranchhouse  indeed id feel safer she replied there are rooms please come  allright an now ill be goin to fetch hal shore wish i hadnt made you pale an scared like this   about ten oclock next morning carmichael drove helen and bo into pine and tied up the team before widow casss cottage  the peach and appletrees were mingling blossoms of pink and white a drowsy hum of bees filled the fragrant air rich darkgreen alfalfa covered the small orchard flat a wood fire sent up a lazy column of blue smoke and birds were singing sweetly  helen could scarcely believe that amid all this tranquillity a man lay perhaps fatally injured assuredly carmichael had been somber and reticent enough to rouse the gravest fears  widow cass appeared on the little porch a gray bent worn but cheerful old woman whom helen had come to know as her friend  my land im thet glad to see you miss helen she said an youve fetched the little lass as ive not got acquainted with yet  good morning mrs cass howhow is roy replied helen anxiously scanning the wrinkled face  roy now dont you look so scared roys most ready to git on his hoss an ride home if i let him he knowed you was acomin an he made me hold a lookinglass for him to shave hows thet fer a man with a bullethole through him you cant kill them mormons nohow  she led them into a little sittingroom where on a couch underneath a window roy beeman lay he was wide awake and smiling but haggard he lay partly covered with a blanket his gray shirt was open at the neck disclosing bandages  morningirls he drawled shore is good of you now comin down  helen stood beside him bent over him in her earnestness as she greeted him she saw a shade of pain in his eyes and his immobility struck her but he did not seem badly off bo was pale roundeyed and apparently too agitated to speak carmichael placed chairs beside the couch for the girls  wal whats ailin you this nice mornin asked roy eyes on the cowboy  huh would you expect me to be wearin the smile of a fellar goin to be married retorted carmichael  shore you havent made up with bo yet returned roy  bo blushed rosy red and the cowboys face lost something of its somber hue  i allow its none of your ddarn bizness if she aint made up with me he said  las vegas youre a wonder with a hoss an a rope an i reckon with a gun but when it comes to girls you shore aint there  im no mormon by golly come ma cass lets get out of here so they can talk  folks i was jest agoin to say thet roys got fever an he oughtnt t talk too much said the old woman then she and carmichael went into the kitchen and closed the door  roy looked up at helen with his keen eyes more kindly piercing than ever  my brother john was here hed just left when you come he rode home to tell my folks im not so bad hurt an then hes goin to ride a beeline into the mountains  helens eyes asked what her lips refused to utter  hes goin after dale i sent him i reckoned weall sorta needed sight of thet doggone hunter  roy had averted his gaze quickly to bo  dont you agree with me lass  i sure do replied bo heartily  all within helen had been stilled for the moment of her realization and then came swell and beat of heart and inconceivable chafing of a tide at its restraint  can johnfetch dale outwhen the snows so deep she asked unsteadily  shore hes takin two hosses up to the snowline then if necessary hell go over the pass on snowshoes but i bet him dale would ride out snows about gone except on the north slopes an on the peaks  thenwhen may iwe expect to see dale  three or four days i reckon i wish he was here now miss helen theres trouble afoot  i realize that im ready did las vegas tell you about beasleys visit to me  no you tell me replied roy  briefly helen began to acquaint him with the circumstances of that visit and before she had finished she made sure roy was swearing to himself  he asked you to marry him jerusalem thet id never have reckoned thelowdown coyote of a greaser wal miss helen when i met up with senor beasley last night he was shore spoilin from somethin now i see what thet was an i reckon i picked out the bad time  for what roy what did you do  wal id made up my mind awhile back to talk to beasley the first chance i had an thet was it i was in the store when i seen him go into turners so i followed it was most dark beasley an riggs an mulvey an some more were drinkin an powwowin so i just braced him right then  roy oh the way you boys court danger  but miss helen thets the only way to be afraid makes more danger beasley peared civil enough first off him an me kept edgin off an his pards kept edgin after us till we got over in a corner of the saloon i dont know all i said to him shore i talked a heap i told him what my old man thought an beasley knowed as well as i thet my old mans not only the oldest inhabitant hereabouts but hes the wisest too an he wouldnt tell a lie wal i used all his sayins in my argument to show beasley thet if he didnt haul up short hed end almost as short beasleys thickheaded an powerful conceited vain as a peacock he couldnt see an he got mad i told him he was rich enough without robbin you of your ranch anwal i shore put up a big talk for your side by this time he an his gang had me crowded in a corner an from their looks i begun to get cold feet but i was in it an had to make the best of it the argument worked down to his pinnin me to my word that id fight for you when thet fight come off an i shore told him for my own sake i wished it d come off quick thenwalthen somethin did come off quick  roy then he shot you exclaimed helen passionately  now miss helen i didnt say who done it replied roy with his engaging smile  tell me thenwho did  wal i reckon i shant tell you unless you promise not to tell las vegas thet cowboy is plumb off his head he thinks he knows who shot me an ive been lyin somethin scandalous you see if he learnsthen hell go gunnin an miss helen thet texan is bad he might get plugged as i didan there would be another man put off your side when the big trouble comes  roy i promise you i will not tell las vegas replied helen earnestly  wal thenit was riggs roy grew still paler as he confessed this and his voice almost a whisper expressed shame and hate thet fourflush did it shot me from behind beasley i had no chance i couldnt even see him draw but when i fell an lay there an the others dropped back then i seen the smokin gun in his hand he looked powerful important an beasley began to cuss him an was cussin him as they all run out  oh coward the despicable coward cried helen  no wonder tom wants to find out exclaimed bo low and deep ill bet he suspects riggs  shore he does but i wouldnt give him no satisfaction  roy you know that riggs cant last out here  wal i hope he lasts till i get on my feet again  there you go hopeless all you boys you must spill blood murmured helen shudderingly  dear miss helen dont take on so im like daleno man to hunt up trouble but out here theres a sort of unwritten lawan eye for an eyea tooth for a tooth i believe in god almighty an killin is against my religion but riggs shot methe same as shootin me in the back  roy im only a womani fear fainthearted and unequal to this west  wait till somethin happens to you supposin beasley comes an grabs you with his own dirty big paws an after maulin you some throws you out of your home or supposin riggs chases you into a corner  helen felt the start of all her physical beinga violent leap of blood but she could only judge of her looks from the grim smile of the wounded man as he watched her with his keen intent eyes  my friend anythin can happen he said but lets hope it wont be the worst  he had begun to show signs of weakness and helen rising at once said that she and bo had better leave him then but would come to see him the next day at her call carmichael entered again with mrs cass and after a few remarks the visit was terminated carmichael lingered in the doorway  wal cheer up you old mormon he called  cheer up yourself you cross old bachelor retorted roy quite unnecessarily loud cant you raise enough nerve to make up with bo  carmichael evacuated the doorway as if he had been spurred he was quite red in the face while he unhitched the team and silent during the ride up to the ranchhouse there he got down and followed the girls into the sitting room he appeared still somber though not sullen and had fully regained his composure  did you find out who shot roy he asked abruptly of helen  yes but i promised roy i would not tell replied helen nervously she averted her eyes from his searching gaze intuitively fearing his next query  was it thetriggs  las vegas dont ask me i will not break my promise  he strode to the window and looked out a moment and presently when he turned toward bo he seemed a stronger loftier more impelling man with all his emotions under control  bo will you listen to meif i swear to speak the truthas i know it  why certainly replied bo with the color coming swiftly to her face  roy doesnt want me to know because he wants to meet thet fellar himself an i want to know because i want to stop him before he can do more dirt to us or our friends thets roys reason an mine an im askin you to tell me  but tomi oughtnt replied bo haltingly  did you promise roy not to tell  no  or your sister  no i didnt promise either  wal then you tell me i want you to trust me in this here matter but not because i love you an once had a wild dream you might care a little for me  ohtom faltered bo  listen i want you to trust me because im the one who knows whats best i wouldnt lie an i wouldnt say so if i didnt know shore i swear dale will back me up but he cant be here for some days an thet gang has got to be bluffed you ought to see this i reckon youve been quick in savvyin western ways i couldnt pay you no higher compliment bo rayner now will you tell me  yes i will replied bo with the blaze leaping to her eyes  oh boplease dontplease dont wait implored helen  boits between you an me said carmichael  tom ill tell you whispered bo it was a lowdown cowardly trick roy was surroundedand shot from behind beasleyby that fourflush riggs    chapter xix  the memory of a woman had ruined milt dales peace had confounded his philosophy of selfsufficient lonely happiness in the solitude of the wilds had forced him to come face to face with his soul and the fatal significance of life  when he realized his defeat that things were not as they seemed that there was no joy for him in the coming of spring that he had been blind in his free sensorial indian relation to existence he fell into an inexplicably strange state a despondency a gloom as deep as the silence of his home dale reflected that the stronger an animal the keener its nerves the higher its intelligence the greater must be its suffering under restraint or injury he thought of himself as a high order of animal whose great physical need was action and now the incentive to action seemed dead he grew lax he did not want to move he performed his diminishing duties under compulsion  he watched for spring as a liberation but not that he could leave the valley he hated the cold he grew weary of wind and snow he imagined the warm sun the park once more green with grass and bright with daisies the return of birds and squirrels and deer to heir old haunts would be the means whereby he could break this spell upon him then he might gradually return to past contentment though it would never be the same  but spring coming early to paradise park brought a fever to dales blooda fire of unutterable longing it was good perhaps that this was so because he seemed driven to work climb tramp and keep ceaselessly on the move from dawn till dark action strengthened his lax muscles and kept him from those motionless senseless hours of brooding he at least need not be ashamed of longing for that which could never be histhe sweetness of a womana home full of light joy hope the meaning and beauty of children but those dark moods were sinkings into a pit of hell  dale had not kept track of days and weeks he did not know when the snow melted off three slopes of paradise park all he knew was that an age had dragged over his head and that spring had come during his restless waking hours and even when he was asleep there seemed always in the back of his mind a growing consciousness that soon he would emerge from this trial a changed man ready to sacrifice his chosen lot to give up his lonely life of selfish indulgence in lazy affinity with nature and to go wherever his strong hands might perform some real service to people nevertheless he wanted to linger in this mountain fastness until his ordeal was overuntil he could meet her and the world knowing himself more of a man than ever before  one bright morning while he was at his campfire the tame cougar gave a low growling warning dale was startled tom did not act like that because of a prowling grizzly or a straying stag presently dale espied a horseman riding slowly out of the straggling spruces and with that sight dales heart gave a leap recalling to him a divination of his future relation to his kind never had he been so glad to see a man  this visitor resembled one of the beemans judging from the way he sat his horse and presently dale recognized him to be john  at this juncture the jaded horse was spurred into a trot soon reaching the pines and the camp  howdy there you ole barhunter called john waving his hand  for all his hearty greeting his appearance checked a like response from dale the horse was mud to his flanks and john was mud to his knees wet bedraggled worn and white this hue of his face meant more than fatigue  howdy john replied dale  they shook hands john wearily swung his leg over the pommel but did not at once dismount his clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon the hunter  miltwhat n hells wrong he queried  why  bust me if you aint changed so i hardly knowed you youve been sickall alone here  do i look sick  wal i should smile thin an pale an down in the mouth milt what ails you  ive gone to seed  youve gone off your head jest as roy said livin alone here you overdid it milt an you look sick  john my sickness is here replied dale soberly as he laid a hand on his heart  lung trouble ejaculated john with thet chest an up in this air get out  nonot lung trouble said dale  i savvy had a hunch from roy anyhow  what kind of a hunch  easy now dale ole man dont you reckon im ridin in on you pretty early look at thet hoss john slid off and waved a hand at the drooping beast then began to unsaddle him wal he done great we bogged some comin over an i climbed the pass at night on the frozen snow  youre welcome as the flowers in may john what month is it  by spades are you as bad as thet lets see its the twentythird of march  march well im beat ive lost my reckoninan a lot more maybe  thar declared john slapping the mustang you can jest hang up here till my next trip milt how re your hosses  wintered fine  wal thets good well need two big strong hosses right off  what for queried dale sharply he dropped a stick of wood and straightened up from the campfire  youre goin to ride down to pine with methets what for  familiarly then came back to dale the quiet intent suggestiveness of the beemans in moments foreboding trial  at this certain assurance of johns too significant to be doubted dales thought of pine gave slow birth to a strange sensation as if he had been dead and was vibrating back to life  tell what you got to tell he broke out  quick as a flash the mormon replied roys been shot but he wont die he sent for you bad deals afoot beasley means to force helen rayner out an steal her ranch  a tremor ran all through dale it seemed another painful yet thrilling connection between his past and this vaguely calling future his emotions had been broodings dreams longings this thing his friend said had the sting of real life  then old als dead he asked  long agoi reckon around the middle of february the property went to helen shes been doin fine an many folks say its a pity shell lose it  she wont lose it declared dale how strange his voice sounded to his own ears it was hoarse and unreal as if from disuse  wal weall have our idees i say she will my father says so carmichael says so  whos he  reckon you remember thet cowpuncher who came up with roy an auchincloss after the girlslast fall  yes they called him laslas vegas i liked his looks  humph youll like him a heap when you know him hes kept the ranch goin for miss helen all along but the deals comin to a head beasleys got thick with thet riggs you remember him  yes  wal hes been hangin out at pine all winter watchin for some chance to get at miss helen or bo everybodys seen thet an jest lately he chased bo on hossbackgave the kid a nasty fall roy says riggs was after miss helen but i think one or tother of the girls would do thet varmint wal thet sorta started goinson carmichael beat riggs an drove him out of town but he come back beasley called on miss helen an offered to marry her sos not to take the ranch from her he said  dale awoke with a thundering curse  shore exclaimed john id say the sameonly im religious dont thet beadyeyed greasers gall make you want to spit all over yourself my gawd but roy was mad roys powerful fond of miss helen an bo wal then roy first chance he got braced beasley an give him some straight talk beasley was foamin at the mouth roy said it was then riggs shot roy shot him from behind beasley when roy wasnt lookin an riggs brags of bein a gunfighter mebbe thet wasnt a bad shot for him  i reckon replied dale as he swallowed hard now just what was roys message to me  wal i cant remember all roy said answered john dubiously but roy shore was excited an dead in earnest he says tell milt whats happened tell him helen rayners in more danger than she was last fall tell him ive seen her look away acrost the mountains toward paradise park with her heart in her eyes tell him she needs him most of all  dale shook all over as with an attack of ague he was seized by a whirlwind of passionate terrible sweetness of sensation when what he wildly wanted was to curse roy and john for their simpleminded conclusions  royscrazy panted dale  wal now miltthets downright surprisin of you roys the levelheadest of any fellars i know  man if he made me believe himan it turned out untrueidid kill him replied dale  untrue do you think roy beeman would lie  but johnyou fellows cant see my case nell rayner wants meneeds me it cant be true  wal my lovesick pardit jest is true exclaimed john feelingly thets the hell of lifenever knowin but here its joy for you you can believe roy beeman about women as quick as youd trust him to track your lost hoss roys married three girls i reckon hell marry some more roys only twentyeight an he has two big farms he said hed seen nell rayners heart in her eyes lookin for youan you can jest bet your life thets true an he said it because he means you to rustle down there an fight for thet girl  illgo said dale in a shaky whisper as he sat down on a pine log near the fire he stared unseeingly at the bluebells in the grass by his feet while storm after storm possessed his breast they were fierce and brief because driven by his will in those few moments of contending strife dale was immeasurably removed from that dark gulf of self which had made his winter a nightmare and when he stood erect again it seemed that the old earth had a stirring electrifying impetus for his feet something black bitter melancholy and morbid always unreal to him had passed away forever the great moment had been forced upon him he did not believe roy beemans preposterous hint regarding helen but he had gone back or soared onward as if by magic to his old true self   mounted on dales strongest horses with only a light pack an ax and their weapons the two men had reached the snowline on the pass by noon that day tom the tame cougar trotted along in the rear  the crust of the snow now half thawed by the sun would not hold the weight of a horse though it upheld the men on foot they walked leading the horses travel was not difficult until the snow began to deepen then progress slackened materially john had not been able to pick out the line of the trail so dale did not follow his tracks an old blaze on the trees enabled dale to keep fairly well to the trail and at length the height of the pass was reached where the snow was deep here the horses labored plowing through foot by foot when finally they sank to their flanks they had to be dragged and goaded on and helped by thick flat bunches of spruce boughs placed under their hoofs it took three hours of breaking toil to do the few hundred yards of deep snow on the height of the pass the cougar did not have great difficulty in following though it was evident he did not like such traveling  that behind them the horses gathered heart and worked on to the edge of the steep descent where they had all they could do to hold back from sliding and rolling fast time was made on this slope at the bottom of which began a dense forest with snow still deep in places and windfalls hard to locate the men here performed herculean labors but they got through to a park where the snow was gone the ground however soft and boggy in places was more treacherous than the snow and the travelers had to skirt the edge of the park to a point opposite and then go on through the forest when they reached bare and solid ground just before dark that night it was high time for the horses were ready to drop and the men likewise  camp was made in an open wood darkness fell and the men were resting on bough beds feet to the fire with tom curled up close by and the horses still drooping where they had been unsaddled morning however discovered them grazing on the long bleached grass john shook his head when he looked at them  you reckoned to make pine by nightfall how far is itthe way youll go  fifty mile or thereabouts replied dale  wal we cant ride it on them critters  john wed do more than that if we had to  they were saddled and on the move before sunrise leaving snow and bog behind level parks and level forests led one after another to long slopes and steep descents all growing sunnier and greener as the altitude diminished squirrels and grouse turkeys and deer and less tame denizens of the forest grew more abundant as the travel advanced in this game zone however dale had trouble with tom the cougar had to be watched and called often to keep him off of trails  tom doesnt like a long trip said dale but im goin to take him some way or other he may come in handy  sic him onto beasleys gang replied john some men are powerful scared of cougars but i never was  nor me though ive had cougars give me a darn uncanny feelin  the men talked but little dale led the way with tom trotting noiselessly beside his horse john followed close behind they loped the horses across parks trotted through the forests walked slow up what few inclines they met and slid down the soft wet pinematted descents so they averaged from six to eight miles an hour the horses held up well under that steady travel and this without any rest at noon  dale seemed to feel himself in an emotional trance yet despite this the same old sensorial perceptions crowded thick and fast upon him strangely sweet and vivid after the past dead months when neither sun nor wind nor cloud nor scent of pine nor anything in nature could stir him his mind his heart his soul seemed steeped in an intoxicating wine of expectation while his eyes and ears and nose had never been keener to register the facts of the forestland he saw the black thing far ahead that resembled a burned stump but he knew was a bear before it vanished he saw gray flash of deer and wolf and coyote and the red of fox and the small wary heads of old gobblers just sticking above the grass and he saw deep tracks of game as well as the slowrising blades of bluebells where some softfooted beast had just trod and he heard the melancholy notes of birds the twitter of grouse the sough of the wind the light dropping of pinecones the near and distant bark of squirrels the deep gobble of a turkey close at hand and the challenge from a rival far away the cracking of twigs in the thickets the murmur of running water the scream of an eagle and the shrill cry of a hawk and always the soft dull steady pads of the hoofs of the horses  the smells too were the sweet stinging ones of spring warm and pleasantthe odor of the clean fresh earth cutting its way through that thick strong fragrance of pine the smell of logs rotting in the sun and of fresh new grass and flowers along a brook of snowwater  i smell smoke said dale suddenly as he reined in and turned for corroboration from his companion  john sniffed the warm air  wal youre more of an injun than me he replied shaking his head  they traveled on and presently came out upon the rim of the last slope a long league of green slanted below them breaking up into straggling lines of trees and groves that joined the cedars and these in turn stretched on and down in grayblack patches to the desert that glittering and bare with streaks of somber hue faded in the obscurity of distance  the village of pine appeared to nestle in a curve of the edge of the great forest and the cabins looked like tiny white dots set in green  look there said dale pointing  some miles to the right a gray escarpment of rock cropped out of the slope forming a promontory and from it a thin pale column of smoke curled upward to be lost from sight as soon as it had no background of green  thets your smoke shore enough replied john thoughtfully now i jest wonder whos campin there no water near or grass for hosses  john that points been used for smoke signals many a time  was jest thinkin of thet same shall we ride around there an take a peek  no but well remember that if beasleys got his deep scheme goin hell have snake ansons gang somewhere close  roy said thet same wal its some three hours till sundown the hosses keep up i reckon im fooled for well make pine all right but old tom there hes tired or lazy  the big cougar was lying down panting and his halfshut eyes were on dale  toms only lazy an fat he could travel at this gait for a week but lets rest a halfhour an watch that smoke before movin on we can make pine before sundown   when travel had been resumed halfway down the slope dales sharp eyes caught a broad track where shod horses had passed climbing in a long slant toward the promontory he dismounted to examine it and john coming up proceeded with alacrity to get off and do likewise dale made his deductions after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse waiting for john  wal what d you make of these here tracks asked that worthy  some horses an a pony went along here yesterday an today a single horse made that fresh track  wal milt for a hunter you aint so bad at hoss tracks observed john but how many hosses went yesterday  i couldnt make outseveralmaybe four or five  six hosses an a colt or little mustang unshod to be strictcorrect wal supposin they did what s it mean to us  i dont know as id thought anythin unusual if it hadnt been for that smoke we saw off the rim an then this here fresh track made along today looks queer to me  wish roy was here replied john scratching his head milt ive a hunch if he was hed foller them tracks  maybe but we havent time for that we can backtrail them though if they keep clear as they are here an well not lose any time either  that broad track led straight toward pine down to the edge of the cedars where amid some jagged rocks evidences showed that men had camped there for days here it ended as a broad trail but from the north came the single fresh track made that very day and from the east more in a line with pine came two tracks made the day before and these were imprints of big and little hoofs manifestly these interested john more than they did dale who had to wait for his companion  milt it aint a coltsthet little track avowed john  why notan what if it isnt queried dale  wal it aint because a colt always straggles back an from one side to tother this little track keeps close to the big one an by george it was made by a led mustang  john resembled roy beeman then with that leaping intent fire in his gray eyes dales reply was to spur his horse into a trot and call sharply to the lagging cougar  when they turned into the broad blossombordered road that was the only thoroughfare of pine the sun was setting red and gold behind the mountains the horses were too tired for any more than a walk natives of the village catching sight of dale and beeman and the huge gray cat following like a dog called excitedly to one another a group of men in front of turners gazed intently down the road and soon manifested signs of excitement dale and his comrade dismounted in front of widow casss cottage and dale called as he strode up the little path mrs cass came out she was white and shaking but appeared calm at sight of her john beeman drew a sharp breath  wal now he began hoarsely and left off  hows roy queried dale  lord knows im glad to see you boys milt youre thin an strangelookin roys had a little setback he got a shock today an it throwed him off feveran now hes out of his head it wont do no good for you to waste time seein him take my word for it hes all right but theres others asfor the lands sakes milt dale you fetched thet cougar back dont let him near me  tom wont hurt you mother said dale as the cougar came padding up the path you were sayin somethinabout others is miss helen safe hurry  ride up to see heran waste no more time here  dale was quick in the saddle followed by john but the horses had to be severely punished to force them even to a trot and that was a lagging trot which now did not leave torn behind  the ride up to auchinclosss ranchhouse seemed endless to dale natives came out in the road to watch after he had passed stern as dale was in dominating his feelings he could not wholly subordinate his mounting joy to a waiting terrible anticipation of catastrophe but no matter what awaitednor what fateful events might hinge upon this nameless circumstance about to be disclosed the wonderful and glorious fact of the present was that in a moment he would see helen rayner  there were saddled horses in the courtyard but no riders a mexican boy sat on the porch bench in the seat where dale remembered he had encountered al auchincloss the door of the big sittingroom was open the scent of flowers the murmur of bees the pounding of hoofs came vaguely to dale his eyes dimmed so that the ground when he slid out of his saddle seemed far below him he stepped upon the porch his sight suddenly cleared a tight fullness at his throat made incoherent the words he said to the mexican boy but they were understood as the boy ran back around the house dale knocked sharply and stepped over the threshold  outside john true to his habits was thinking even in that moment of suspense about the faithful exhausted horses as he unsaddled them he talked fer soft an fat hosses winterin high up wal youve done somethin  then dale heard a voice in another room a step a creak of the door it opened a woman in white appeared he recognized helen but instead of the rich brown bloom and darkeyed beauty so hauntingly limned on his memory he saw a white beautiful face strained and quivering in anguish and eyes that pierced his heart he could not speak  oh my friendyouve come she whispered  dale put out a shaking hand but she did not see it she clutched his shoulders as if to feel whether or not he was real and then her arms went up round his neck  oh thank god i knew you would come she said and her head sank to his shoulder  dale divined what he had suspected helens sister had been carried off yet while his quick mind grasped helens broken spiritthe unbalance that was reason for this marvelous and glorious acthe did not take other meaning of the embrace to himself he just stood there transported charged like a tree struck by lightning making sure with all his keen senses so that he could feel forever how she was clinging round his neck her face over his bursting heart her quivering form close pressed to his  itsbo he said unsteadily  she went riding yesterdayandnevercameback replied helen brokenly  ive seen her trail shes been taken into the woods ill find her ill fetch her back he replied rapidly  with a shock she seemed to absorb his meaning with another shock she raised her faceleaned back a little to look at him  youll find herfetch her back  yes he answered instantly  with that ringing word it seemed to dale she realized how she was standing he felt her shake as she dropped her arms and stepped back while the white anguish of her face was flooded out by a wave of scarlet but she was brave in her confusion her eyes never fell though they changed swiftly darkening with shame amaze and with feelings he could not read  im almostout of my head she faltered  no wonder i saw that but now you must get clearheaded ive no time to lose  he led her to the door  john its bo thats gone he called since yesterday send the boy to get me a bag of meat an bread you run to the corral an get me a fresh horse my old horse ranger if you can find him quick an rustle  without a word john leaped bareback on one of the horses he had just unsaddled and spurred him across the courtyard  then the big cougar seeing helen got up from where he lay on the porch and came to her  oh its tom cried helen and as he rubbed against her knees she patted his head with trembling hand you big beautiful pet oh how i remember oh how bo would love to  wheres carmichael interrupted dale out huntin bo  yes it was he who missed her first he rode everywhere yesterday last night when he came back he was wild ive not seen him today he made all the other men but hal and joe stay home on the ranch  right an john must stay too declared dale but its strange carmichael ought to have found the girls tracks she was ridin a pony  bo rode sam hes a little bronc very strong and fast  i come across his tracks howd carmichael miss them  he didnt he found themtrailed them all along the north range thats where he forbade bo to go you see theyre in love with each other theyve been at odds neither will give in bo disobeyed him theres hard ground off the north range so he said he was able to follow her tracks only so far  were there any other tracks along with hers  no  miss helen i found them way southeast of pine up on the slope of the mountain there were seven other horses makin that trailwhen we run across it on the way down we found a camp where men had waited an bos pony led by a rider on a big horse come into that camp from the eastmaybe north a little an that tells the story  riggs ran her downmade off with her cried helen passionately oh the villain he had men in waiting thats beasleys work they were after me  it may not be just what you said but thats close enough an bos in a bad fix you must face that an try to bear up underfears of the worst  my friend you will save her  ill fetch her back alive or dead  dead oh my god helen cried and closed her eyes an instant to open them burning black but bo isnt dead i know thati feel it shell not die very easy shes a little savage she has no fear shed fight like a tigress for her life shes strong you remember how strong she can stand anything unless they murder her outright shell livea long timethrough any ordeal so i beg you my friend dont lose an hourdont ever give up  dale trembled under the clasp of her hands loosing his own from her clinging hold he stepped out on the porch at that moment john appeared on ranger coming at a gallop  nell ill never come back without her said dale i reckon you can hopeonly be prepared thats all its hard but these damned deals are common out here in the west  suppose beasley comeshere exclaimed helen and again her hand went out toward him  if he does you refuse to get off replied dale but dont let him or his greasers put a dirty hand on you should he threaten forcewhy pack some clothesan your valuablesan go down to mrs casss an wait till i come back  waittill youcome back she faltered slowly turning white again her dark eyes dilated miltyoure like las vegas youll kill beasley  dale heard his own laugh very cold and strange foreign to his ears a grim deadly hate of beasley vied with the tenderness and pity he felt for this distressed girl it was a sore trial to see her leaning there against the doorto be compelled to leave her alone abruptly be stalked off the porch tom followed him the black horse whinnied his recognition of dale and snorted at sight of the cougar just then the mexican boy returned with a bag dale tied this with the small pack behind the saddle  john you stay here with miss helen said dale an if carmichael comes back keep him too an tonight if any one rides into pine from the way we come you be sure to spot him  ill do thet milt responded john  dale mounted and turning for a last word to helen he felt the words of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her standing white and brokenhearted with her hands to her bosom he could not look twice  come on there you tom he called to the cougar reckon on this track youll pay me for all my trainin of you  oh my friend came helens sad voice almost a whisper to his throbbing ears heaven help youto save her i  then ranger started and dale heard no more he could not look back his eyes were full of tears and his breast ached by a tremendous effort he shifted that emotioncalled on all the spiritual energy of his being to the duty of this grim task before him  he did not ride down through the village but skirted the northern border and worked round to the south where coming to the trail he had made an hour past he headed on it straight for the slope now darkening in the twilight the big cougar showed more willingness to return on this trail than he had shown in the coming ranger was fresh and wanted to go but dale held him in  a cool wind blew down from the mountain with the coming of night against the brightening stars dale saw the promontory lift its bold outline it was miles away it haunted him strangely calling a night and perhaps a day separated him from the gang that held bo rayner prisoner dale had no plan as yet he had only a motive as great as the love he bore helen rayner  beasleys evil genius had planned this abduction riggs was a tool a cowardly knave dominated by a stronger will snake anson and his gang had lain in wait at that cedar camp had made that broad hoof track leading up the mountain beasley had been there with them that very day all this was as assured to dale as if he had seen the men  but the matter of dales recovering the girl and doing it speedily strung his mental strength to its highest pitch many outlines of action flashed through his mind as he rode on peering keenly through the night listening with practised ears all were rejected and at the outset of every new branching of thought he would gaze down at the gray form of the cougar long graceful heavy as he padded beside the horse from the first thought of returning to help helen rayner he had conceived an undefined idea of possible value in the qualities of his pet tom had performed wonderful feats of trailing but he had never been tried on men dale believed he could make him trail anything yet he had no proof of this one fact stood out of all dales conjectures and it was that he had known men and brave men to fear cougars  far up on the slope in a little hollow where water ran and there was a little grass for ranger to pick dale haltered him and made ready to spend the night he was sparing with his food giving tom more than he took himself curled close up to dale the big cat went to sleep  but dale lay awake for long  the night was still with only a faint moan of wind on this sheltered slope dale saw hope in the stars he did not seem to have promised himself or helen that he could save her sister and then her property he seemed to have stated something unconsciously settled outside of his thinking strange how this certainty was not vague yet irreconcilable with any plans he created behind it somehow nameless with inconceivable power surged all his wonderful knowledge of forest of trails of scents of night of the nature of men lying down to sleep in the dark lonely woods of the nature of this great cat that lived its every action in accordance with his will  he grew sleepy and gradually his mind stilled with his last conscious thought a portent that he would awaken to accomplish his desperate task    chapter xx  young burt possessed the keenest eyes of any man in snake ansons gang for which reason he was given the post as lookout from the lofty promontory his instructions were to keep sharp watch over the open slopes below and to report any sight of a horse  a cedar fire with green boughs on top of dead wood sent up a long pale column of smoke this signalfire had been kept burning since sunrise  the preceding night camp had been made on a level spot in the cedars back of the promontory but manifestly anson did not expect to remain there long for after breakfast the packs had been made up and the horses stood saddled and bridled they were restless and uneasy tossing bits and fighting flies the sun now halfway to meridian was hot and no breeze blew in that sheltered spot  shady jones had ridden off early to fill the waterbags and had not yet returned anson thinner and scalier and more snakelike than ever was dealing a greasy dirty deck of cards his opponent being the squareshaped blackvisaged moze in lieu of money the gamblers wagered with cedarberries each of which berries represented a pipeful of tobacco jim wilson brooded under a cedartree his unshaven face a dirty dusthue a smoldering fire in his light eyes a sullen set to his jaw every little while he would raise his eyes to glance at riggs and it seemed that a quick glance was enough riggs paced to and fro in the open coatless and hatless his blackbroadcloth trousers and embroidered vest dusty and torn an enormous gun bumped awkwardly in its sheath swinging below his hip riggs looked perturbed his face was sweating freely yet it was far from red in color he did not appear to mind the sun or the flies his eyes were staring dark wild shifting in gaze from everything they encountered but often that gaze shot back to the captive girl sitting under a cedar some yards from the man  bo rayners little booted feet were tied together with one end of a lasso and the other end trailed off over the ground her hands were free her ridinghabit was dusty and disordered her eyes blazed defiantly out of a small pale face  harve riggs i wouldnt be standing in those cheap boots of yours for a million dollars she said sarcastically riggs took no notice of her words  you pack that gunsheath wrong end out what have you got the gun for anyhow she added tauntingly  snake anson let out a hoarse laugh and mozes black visage opened in a huge grin jim wilson seemed to drink in the girls words sullen and somber he bent his lean head very still as if listening  youd better shut up said riggs darkly  i will not shut up declared bo  then ill gag you he threatened  gag me why you dirty lowdown twobit of a bluff she exclaimed hotly id like to see you try it ill tear that long hair of yours right off your head  riggs advanced toward her with his hands clutching as if eager to throttle her the girl leaned forward her face reddening her eyes fierce  you damned little cat muttered riggs thickly ill gag youif you dont stop squallin  come on i dare you to lay a hand on me harve riggs im not the least afraid of you cant you savvy that youre a liar a fourflush a sneak why youre not fit to wipe the feet of any of these outlaws  riggs took two long strides and bent over her his teeth protruding in a snarl and he cuffed her hard on the side of the head  bos head jerked back with the force of the blow but she uttered no cry  are you goin to keep your jaw shut he demanded stridently and a dark tide of blood surged up into his neck  i should smile im not retorted bo in cool deliberate anger of opposition youve roped meand youve struck me now get a clubstand off thereout of my reachand beat me oh if i only knew cuss words fit for youid call you them  snake anson had stopped playing cards and was watching listening with halfdisgusted halfamused expression on his serpentlike face jim wilson slowly rose to his feet if any one had observed him it would have been to note that he now seemed singularly fascinated by this scene yet all the while absorbed in himself once he loosened the neckband of his blouse  riggs swung his arm more violently at the girl but she dodged  you dog she hissed oh if i only had a gun  her face then with its dead whiteness and the eyes of flame held a tragic impelling beauty that stung anson into remonstrance  aw riggs dont beat up the kid he protested thet wont do any good let her alone  but shes got to shut up replied riggs  how n hell air you goin to shet her up mebbe if you get out of her sight shell be quiet how about thet girl  anson gnawed his drooping mustache as he eyed bo  have i made any kick to you or your men yet she queried  it strikes me you aint replied anson  you wont hear me make any so long as im treated decent said bo i dont know what youve got to do with riggs he ran me downroped medragged me to your camp now ive a hunch youre waiting for beasley  girl your hunch s correct said anson  well do you know im the wrong girl  whats thet i reckon youre nell rayner who got left all old auchinclosss property  no im bo rayner nell is my sister she owns the ranch beasley wanted her  anson cursed deep and low under his sharp bristling eyebrows he bent cunning green eyes upon riggs  say you is what this kid says so  yes shes nell rayners sister replied riggs doggedly  ahuh wal why in the hell did you drag her into my camp an off up here to signal beasley he aint wantin her he wants the girl who owns the ranch did you take one fer the othersame as thet day we was with you  guess i must have replied riggs sullenly  but you knowed her from her sister afore you come to my camp  riggs shook his head he was paler now and sweating more freely the dank hair hung wet over his forehead his manner was that of a man suddenly realizing he had gotten into a tight place  oh hes a liar exclaimed bo with contemptuous ring in her voice he comes from my country he has known nell and me for years  snake anson turned to look at wilson  jim now hyars a queer deal this feller has rung in on us i thought thet kid was pretty young dont you remember beasley told us nell rayner was a handsome woman  wal pard anson if this heah gurl aint handsome my eyes have gone pore drawled wilson  ahuh so your texas chilvaree over the ladies is some operatin retorted anson with fine sarcasm but thet aint tellin me what you think  wal i aint tellin you what i think yet but i know thet kid aint nell rayner for ive seen her  anson studied his righthand man for a moment then taking out his tobaccopouch he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely to roll a cigarette he put it between his thin lips and apparently forgot to light it for a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and some scant sagebrush riggs took to pacing up and down wilson leaned as before against the cedar the girl slowly recovered from her excess of anger  kid see hyar said anson addressing the girl if riggs knowed you wasnt nell an fetched you along anyhowwhat d he do thet fur  he chased mecaught me then he saw some one after us and he hurried to your camp he was afraidthe cur  riggs heard her reply for he turned a malignant glance upon her  anson i fetched her because i know nell rayner will give up anythin on earth for her he said in loud voice  anson pondered this statement with an air of considering its apparent sincerity  dont you believe him declared bo rayner bluntly hes a liar hes doublecrossing beasley and all of you  riggs raised a shaking hand to clench it at her keep still or it ll be the worse for you  riggs shut up yourself put in anson as he leisurely rose mebbe it aint occurred to you thet she might have some talk interestin to me an im runnin this hyar camp  now kid talk up an say what you like  i said he was doublecrossing you all replied the girl instantly why im surprised youd be caught in his company my uncle al and my sweetheart carmichael and my friend daletheyve all told me what western men are even down to outlaws robbers cutthroat rascals like you and i know the west well enough now to be sure that fourflush doesnt belong here and cant last here he went to dodge city once and when he came back he made a bluff at being a bad man he was a swaggering bragging drinking gunfighter he talked of the men hed shot of the fights hed had he dressed like some of those gunthrowing gamblers he was in love with my sister nell she hated him he followed us out west and he has hung on our actions like a sneaking indian why nell and i couldnt even walk to the store in the village he rode after me out on the rangechased me for that carmichael called riggss bluff down in turners saloon dared him to draw cussed him every name on the range slapped and beat and kicked him drove him out of pine and now whatever he has said to beasley or you its a dead sure bet hes playing his own game thats to get hold of nell and if not herthen me oh im out of breathand im out of names to call him if i talked foreverid never beable todo him justice but lend mea guna minute  jim wilsons quiet form vibrated with a start anson with his admiring smile pulled his gun and taking a couple of steps forward held it out butt first she stretched eagerly for it and he jerked it away  hold on there yelled riggs in alarm  damme jim if she didnt mean bizness exclaimed the outlaw  wal nowsee heah miss would you bore himif you hed a gun inquired wilson with curious interest there was more of respect in his demeanor than admiration  no i dont want his cowardly blood on my hands replied the girl but id make him danceid make him run  shore you can handle a gun  she nodded her answer while her eyes flashed hate and her resolute lips twitched  then wilson made a singularly swift motion and his gun was pitched butt first to within a foot of her hand she snatched it up cocked it aimed it all before anson could move but he yelled  drop thet gun you little devil  riggs turned ghastly as the big blue gun lined on him he also yelled but that yell was different from ansons  run or dance cried the girl  the big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand she took both hands and called derisively as she fired again the second bullet hit at riggss feet scattering the dust and fragments of stone all over him he bounded heretherethen darted for the rocks a third time the heavy gun spoke and this bullet must have ticked riggs for he let out a hoarse bawl and leaped sheer for the protection of a rock  plug him shoot off a leg yelled snake anson whooping and stamping as riggs got out of sight  jim wilson watched the whole performance with the same quietness that had characterized his manner toward the girl then as riggs disappeared wilson stepped forward and took the gun from the girls trembling hands she was whiter than ever but still resolute and defiant wilson took a glance over in the direction riggs had hidden and then proceeded to reload the gun snake ansons roar of laughter ceased rather suddenly  hyar jim she might have held up the whole gang with thet gun he protested  i reckon she aint nothin agin us replied wilson  ahuh you know a lot about wimmen now dont you but thet did my heart good jim what n earth would you have did if thet d been you instead of riggs  the query seemed important and amazing wilson pondered  shore id stood therestockstillan never moved an eyewinker  an let her shoot ejaculated anson nodding his long head me too  so these rough outlaws inured to all the violence and baseness of their dishonest calling rose to the challenging courage of a slip of a girl she had the one thing they respectednerve  just then a halloo from the promontory brought anson up with a start muttering to himself he strode out toward the jagged rocks that hid the outlook moze shuffled his burly form after anson  miss it shore was grandthet performance of mister gunman riggs remarked jim wilson attentively studying the girl  much obliged to you for lending me your gun she replied ii hope i hit hima little  wal if you didnt sting him then jim wilson knows nothin about lead  jim wilson are you the manthe outlaw my uncle al knew  reckon i am miss fer i knowed al shore enough what d he say aboot me  i remember once he was telling me about snake ansons gang he mentioned you said you were a real gunfighter and what a shame it was you had to be an outlaw  wal an so old al spoke thet nice of me its tolerable likely ill remember an now miss can i do anythin for you  swift as a flash she looked at him  what do you mean  wal shore i dont mean much im sorry to say nothin to make you look like thet i hev to be an outlaw shore as youre born butmebbe theres a difference in outlaws  she understood him and paid him the compliment not to voice her sudden upflashing hope that he might be one to betray his leader  please take this rope off my feet let me walk a little let me have aa little privacy that fool watched every move i made i promise not to run away and oh im thirsty  shore youve got sense he freed her feet and helped her get up therell be some fresh water any minit now if youll wait  then he turned his back and walked over to where riggs sat nursing a bulletburn on his leg  say riggs im takin the responsibility of loosin the girl for a little spell she cant get away an there aint any sense in bein mean  riggs made no reply and went on rolling down his trousers leg lapped a fold over at the bottom and pulled on his boot then he strode out toward the promontory halfway there he encountered anson tramping back  beasleys comin one way an shadys comin another well be off this hot point of rock by noon said the outlaw leader  riggs went on to the promontory to look for himself  wheres the girl demanded anson in surprise when he got back to the camp  wal shes walkin round between heah an pine drawled wilson  jim you let her loose  shore i did shes been hawgtied all the time an she said shed not run off id take thet girls word even to a sheepthief  ahuh so would i for all of thet but jim somethins workin in you aint you sort of rememberin a time when you was youngan mebbe knowed pretty kids like this one  wal if i am it ll shore turn out bad fer somebody  anson gave him a surprised stare and suddenly lost the bantering tone  ahuh so thets how its workin he replied and flung himself down in the shade  young burt made his appearance then wiping his sallow face his deepset hungry eyes upon which his comrades set such store roved around the camp  whars the gurl he queried  jim let her go out fer a stroll replied anson  i seen jim was gittin softy over her haw haw haw  but snake anson did not crack a smile the atmosphere appeared not to be congenial for jokes a fact burt rather suddenly divined riggs and moze returned from the promontory the latter reporting that shady jones was riding up close then the girl walked slowly into sight and approached to find a seat within ten yards of the group they waited in silence until the expected horseman rode up with waterbottles slung on both sides of his saddle his advent was welcome all the men were thirsty wilson took water to the girl before drinking himself  thets an allfired hot ride fer water declared the outlaw shady who somehow fitted his name in color and impression an boss if its the same to you i wont take it agin  cheer up shady well be rustlin back in the mountains before sundown said anson  hang me if that aint the cheerfulest news ive hed in some days hey moze  the blackfaced moze nodded his shaggy head  im sick an sore of this deal broke out burt evidently encouraged by his elders ever since last fall weve been hangin roundtill jest lately freezin in campsno moneyno drinkno grub wuth havin all on promises  not improbably this young and reckless member of the gang had struck the note of discord wilson seemed most detached from any sentiment prevailing there some strong thoughts were revolving in his brain  burt you aint insinuatin thet i made promises inquired anson ominously  no boss i aint you allus said we might hit it rich but them promises was made to you an it d be jest like thet greaser to go back on his word now we got the gurl  son it happens we got the wrong one our longhaired pard hyarmister riggshim with the big gunhe waltzes up with this sassy kid instead of the woman beasley wanted  burt snorted his disgust while shady jones roundly swearing pelted the smoldering campfire with stones then they all lapsed into surly silence the object of their growing scorn riggs sat a little way apart facing none of them but maintaining as bold a front as apparently he could muster  presently a horse shot up his ears the first indication of scent or sound imperceptible to the men but with this cue they all except wilson sat up attentively soon the crack of ironshod hoofs on stone broke the silence riggs nervously rose to his feet and the others still excepting wilson one by one followed suit in another moment a rangy bay horse trotted out of the cedars up to the camp and his rider jumped off nimbly for so heavy a man  howdy beasley was ansons greeting  hello snake old man replied beasley as his bold snapping black eyes swept the group he was dusty and hot and wet with sweat yet evidently too excited to feel discomfort i seen your smoke signal first off an jumped my hoss quick but i rode north of pine before i headed round this way did you corral the girl or did riggs sayyou look queer whats wrong here you havent signaled me for nothin  snake anson beckoned to bo  come out of the shade let him look you over  the girl walked out from under the spreading cedar that had hidden her from sight  beasley stared aghasthis jaw dropped  thets the kid sister of the woman i wanted he ejaculated  so weve jest been told  astonishment still held beasley  told he echoed suddenly his big body leaped with a start who got her who fetched her  why mister gunman riggs hyar replied anson with a subtle scorn  riggs you got the wrong girl shouted beasley you made thet mistake once before whatre you up to  i chased her an when i got her seein it wasnt nell raynerwhyi kept her anyhow replied riggs an ive got a word for your ear alone  man youre crazyqueerin my deal thet way roared beasley you heard my plans riggs this girlstealin cant be done twice was you drinkin or locoed or what  beasley he was giving you the doublecross cut in bo rayners cool voice  the rancher stared speechlessly at her then at anson then at wilson and last at riggs when his brown visage shaded dark with rush of purple blood with one lunge he knocked riggs flat then stood over him with a convulsive hand at his gun  you whitelivered cardsharp ive a notion to bore you they told me you had a deal of your own an now i believe it  yesi had replied riggs cautiously getting up he was ghastly but i wasnt doublecrossin you your deal was to get the girl away from home so you could take possession of her property an i wanted her  what for did you fetch the sister then demanded beasley his big jaw bulging  because ive a plan to  plan hell youve spoiled my plan an ive seen about enough of you beasley breathed hard his lowering gaze boded an uncertain will toward the man who had crossed him his hand still hung low and clutching  beasley tell them to get my horse i want to go home said bo rayner  slowly beasley turned her words enjoined a silence what to do with her now appeared a problem  i had nothin to do with fetchin you here an ill have nothin to do with sendin you back or whatevers done with you declared beasley  then the girls face flashed white again and her eyes changed to fire  youre as big a liar as riggs she cried passionately and youre a thief a bully who picks on defenseless girls oh we know your game milt dale heard your plot with this outlaw anson to steal my sister you ought to be hangedyou halfbreed greaser  ill cut out your tongue hissed beasley  yes ill bet you would if you had me alone but these outlawsthese sheepthievesthese tools you hire are better than you and riggs what do you suppose carmichael will do to you carmichael hes my sweetheartthat cowboy you know what he did to riggs have you brains enough to know what hell do to you  hell not do much growled beasley but the thick purplish blood was receding from his face your cowpuncher  bah she interrupted and she snapped her fingers in his face hes from texas hes from texas  supposin he is from texas demanded beasley in angry irritation whats thet texans are all over theres jim wilson snake ansons righthand man hes from texas but thet aint scarin any one  he pointed toward wilson who shifted uneasily from foot to foot the girls flaming glance followed his hand  are you from texas she asked  yes miss i aman i reckon i dont deserve it replied wilson it was certain that a vague shame attended his confession  oh i believed even a bandit from texas would fight for a helpless girl she replied in withering scorn of disappointment  jim wilson dropped his head if any one there suspected a serious turn to wilsons attitude toward that situation it was the keen outlaw leader  beasley youre courtin death he broke in  you bet you are added bo with a passion that made her listeners quiver youve put me at the mercy of a gang of outlaws you may force my sister out of her home but your day will come tom carmichael will kill you  beasley mounted his horse sullen livid furious he sat shaking in the saddle to glare down at the outlaw leader  snake thets no fault of mine the deals miscarried i was square i made my offer for the workin out of my plan it aint been done now theres hell to pay an im through  beasley i reckon i couldnt hold you to anythin replied anson slowly but if you was square you aint square now weve hung around an tried hard my men are all sore an were broke with no outfit to speak of me an you never fell out before but i reckon we might  do i owe you any moneyaccordin to the deal demanded beasley  no you dont responded anson sharply  then thets square i wash my hands of the whole deal make riggs pay up hes got money an hes got plans go in with him  with that beasley spurred his horse wheeled and rode away the outlaws gazed after him until he disappeared in the cedars  whatd you expect from a greaser queried shady jones  anson didnt i say so added burt  the blackvisaged moze rolled his eyes like a mad bull and jim wilson studiously examined a stick he held in his hands riggs showed immense relief  anson stake me to some of your outfit an ill ride off with the girl he said eagerly  whered you go now queried anson curiously  riggs appeared at a loss for a quick answer his wits were no more equal to this predicament than his nerve  youre no woodsman an onless youre plumb locoed youd never risk goin near pine or show down therell be real trackers huntin your trail  the listening girl suddenly appealed to wilson  dont let him take me offalonein the woods she faltered that was the first indication of her weakening  jim wilson broke into gruff reply im not bossin this gang  but youre a man she importuned  riggs you fetch along your precious firebrand an come with us said anson craftily im particular curious to see her brand you  snake lemme take the girl back to pine said jim wilson  anson swore his amaze  its sense continued wilson weve shore got our own troubles an keepin her ll only add to them ive a hunch now you know i aint often givin to buckin your sayso but this deal aint tastin good to me thet girl ought to be sent home  but mebbe theres somethin in it for us her sister d pay to git her back  wal i shore hope youll recollect i offeredthets all concluded wilson  jim if we wanted to git rid of her wed let riggs take her off remonstrated the outlaw leader he was perturbed and undecided wilson worried him  the long texan veered around full faced what subtle transformation in him  like hell we would he said  it could not have been the tone that caused anson to quail he might have been leader here but he was not the greater man his face clouded  break camp he ordered  riggs had probably not heard that last exchange between anson and wilson for he had walked a few rods aside to get his horse  in a few moments when they started off burt jones and moze were in the lead driving the packhorses anson rode next the girl came between him and riggs and significantly it seemed jim wilson brought up the rear  this start was made a little after the noon hour they zigzagged up the slope took to a deep ravine and followed it up to where it headed in the level forest from there travel was rapid the packhorses being driven at a jogtrot once when a troop of deer burst out of a thicket into a glade to stand with ears high young burt halted the cavalcade his wellaimed shot brought down a deer then the men rode on leaving him behind to dress and pack the meat the only other halt made was at the crossing of the first water a clear swift brook where both horses and men drank thirstily here burt caught up with his comrades  they traversed glade and park and wended a crooked trail through the deepening forest and climbed bench after bench to higher ground while the sun sloped to the westward lower and redder sunset had gone and twilight was momentarily brightening to the afterglow when anson breaking his silence of the afternoon ordered a halt  the place was wild dismal a shallow vale between dark slopes of spruce grass firewood and water were there in abundance all the men were off throwing saddles and packs before the tired girl made an effort to get down riggs observing her made a not ungentle move to pull her off she gave him a sounding slap with her gloved hand  keep your paws to yourself she said no evidence of exhaustion was there in her spirit  wilson had observed this byplay but anson had not  what come off he asked  wal the honorable gunman riggs jest got caressed by the ladyas he was doin the elegant replied moze who stood nearest  jim was you watchin queried anson his curiosity had held through the afternoon  he tried to yank her off an she biffed him replied wilson  that riggs is jest daffy or plain locoed said snake in an aside to moze  boss you mean plain cussed mark my words hell hoodoo this outfit jim was figgerin correct  hoodoo cursed anson under his breath  many hands made quick work in a few moments a fire was burning brightly water was boiling pots were steaming the odor of venison permeated the cool air the girl had at last slipped off her saddle to the ground where she sat while riggs led the horse away she sat there apparently forgotten a pathetic droop to her head  wilson had taken an ax and was vigorously wielding it among the spruces one by one they fell with swish and soft crash then the sliding ring of the ax told how he was slicing off the branches with long sweeps presently he appeared in the semidarkness dragging halftrimmed spruces behind him he made several trips the last of which was to stagger under a huge burden of spruce boughs these he spread under a low projecting branch of an aspen then he leaned the bushy spruces slantingly against this branch on both sides quickly improvising a vshaped shelter with narrow aperture in front next from one of the packs he took a blanket and threw that inside the shelter then touching the girl on the shoulder he whispered  when youre ready slip in there an dont lose no sleep by worryin fer ill be layin right here  he made a motion to indicate his length across the front of the narrow aperture  oh thank you maybe you really are a texan she whispered back  mebbe was his gloomy reply    chapter xxi  the girl refused to take food proffered her by riggs but she ate and drank a little that wilson brought her then she disappeared in the spruce leanto  whatever loquacity and companionship had previously existed in snake ansons gang were not manifest in this camp each man seemed preoccupied as if pondering the dawn in his mind of an ill omen not clear to him yet and not yet dreamed of by his fellows they all smoked then moze and shady played cards awhile by the light of the fire but it was a dull game in which either seldom spoke riggs sought his blanket first and the fact was significant that he lay down some distance from the spruce shelter which contained bo rayner presently young burt went off grumbling to his bed and not long afterward the cardplayers did likewise  snake anson and jim wilson were left brooding in silence beside the dying campfire  the night was dark with only a few stars showing a fitful wind moaned unearthly through the spruce an occasional thump of hoof sounded from the dark woods no cry of wolf or coyote or cat gave reality to the wildness of forestland  by and by those men who had rolled in their blankets were breathing deep and slow in heavy slumber  jim i take it this hyar riggs has queered our deal said snake anson in low voice  i reckon replied wilson  an im feared hes queered this hyar white mountain country fer us  shore i aint got so far as thet what d ye mean snake  damme if i savvy was the gloomy reply i only know what was bad looks growin wuss last fallan winteran now its near april weve got no outfit to make a long stand in the woods jim jest how strong is thet beasley down in the settlements  ive a

theres them mormons theyll be hell when they wake up suppose carmichael got thet hunter dale an them hawkeyed beemans on our trail  wal wed cash inquick replied anson gruffly  then why didnt you let me take the gurl back home  wal come to think of thet jim im sore an i need moneyan i knowed youd never take a dollar from her sister an ive made up my mind to git somethin out of her  snake youre no fool how ll you do thet same an do it quick  aint reckoned it out yet  wal you got aboot tomorrer an thets all returned wilson gloomily  jim whats ailin you  ill let you figger thet out  wal somethin ails the whole gang declared anson savagely with them its nothin to eatno whiskyno money to bet withno tobacco but thets not whats ailin you jim wilson nor me  wal what is then queried wilson  with me its a strange feelin thet my days over on these ranges i cant explain but it jest feels so somethin in the air i dont like them dark shadows out there under the spruces savvy an as fer you jimwal you allus was half decent an my gangs got too lowdown fer you  snake did i ever fail you  no you never did youre the best pard i ever knowed in the years weve rustled together we never had a contrary word till i let beasley fill my ears with his promises thets my fault but jim its too late  it mightnt have been too late yesterday  mebbe not but it is now an ill hang on to the girl or git her worth in gold declared the outlaw grimly  snake ive seen stronger gangs than yours come an go them big bend gangs in my countrythem rustlersthey were all bad men you have no likes of them gangs out heah if they didnt get wiped out by rangers or cowboys why they jest naturally wiped out themselves thets a law i recognize in relation to gangs like them an as for yourswhy anson it wouldnt hold water against one real gunslinger  ahuh then if we ran up agin carmichael or some such fellarwould you be suckin your finger like a baby  wal i wasnt takin count of myself i was takin generalities  aw what

the roughest woods an wait our chance to work south  shore but snake you aint takin no count of the feelins of the menan of mine an yours ill bet you my hoss thet in a day or so this gang will go to pieces  im feared you spoke whats been crowdin to git in my mind replied anson then he threw up his hands in a strange gesture of resignation the outlaw was brave but all men of the wilds recognized a force stronger than themselves he sat there resembling a brooding snake with basilisk eyes upon the fire at length he arose and without another word to his comrade he walked wearily to where lay the dark quiet forms of the sleepers  jim wilson remained beside the flickering fire he was reading something in the red embers perhaps the past shadows were on his face not all from the fading flames or the towering spruces ever and anon he raised his head to listen not apparently that he expected any unusual sound but as if involuntarily indeed as anson had said there was something nameless in the air the black forest breathed heavily in fitful moans of wind it had its secrets the glances wilson threw on all sides betrayed that any hunted man did not love the dark night though it hid him wilson seemed fascinated by the life inclosed there by the black circle of spruce he might have been reflecting on the strange reaction happening to every man in that group since a girl had been brought among them nothing was clear however the forest kept its secret as did the melancholy wind the outlaws were sleeping like tired beasts with their dark secrets locked in their hearts  after a while wilson put some sticks on the red embers then pulled the end of a log over them a blaze sputtered up changing the dark circle and showing the sleepers with their set shadowed faces upturned wilson gazed on all of them a sardonic smile on his lips and then his look fixed upon the sleeper apart from the othersriggs it might have been the false light of flame and shadow that created wilsons expression of dark and terrible hate or it might have been the truth expressed in that lonely unguarded hour from the depths of a man born in the southa man who by his inheritance of race had reverence for all womanhoodby whose strange wild outlawed bloody life of a gunfighter he must hate with the deadliest hate this type that aped and mocked his fame  it was a long gaze wilson rested upon riggsas strange and secretive as the forest wind moaning down the great aislesand when that dark gaze was withdrawn wilson stalked away to make his bed with the stride of one ill whom spirit had liberated force  he laid his saddle in front of the spruce shelter where the girl had entered and his tarpaulin and blankets likewise and then wearily stretched his long length to rest  the campfire blazed up showing the exquisite green and brownflecked festooning of the spruce branches symmetrical and perfect yet so irregular and then it burned out and died down leaving all in the dim gray starlight the horses were not moving around the moan of night wind had grown fainter the low hum of insects was dying away even the tinkle of the brook had diminished and that growth toward absolute silence continued yet absolute silence was never attained life abided in the forest only it had changed its form for the dark hours   ansons gang did not bestir themselves at the usual early sunrise hour common to all woodsmen hunters or outlaws to whom the break of day was welcome these companionsanson and riggs includedmight have hated to see the dawn come it meant only another meager meal then the weary packing and the long long ride to nowhere in particular and another meager mealall toiled for without even the necessities of satisfactory living and assuredly without the thrilling hopes that made their life significant and certainly with a growing sense of approaching calamity  the outlaw leader rose surly and crossgrained he had to boot burt to drive him out for the horses riggs followed him shady jones did nothing except grumble wilson by common consent always made the sourdough bread and he was slow about it this morning anson and moze did the rest of the work without alacrity the girl did not appear  is she dead growled anson  no she aint replied wilson looking up shes sleepin let her sleep shed shore be a sight better off if she was daid  ahuh so would all of this hyar outfit was ansons response  wal snaake i shore reckon well all be thet there soon drawled wilson in his familiar cool and irritating tone that said so much more than the content of the words  anson did not address the texas member of his party again  burt rode bareback into camp driving half the number of the horses riggs followed shortly with several more but three were missed one of them being ansons favorite he would not have budged without that horse during breakfast he growled about his lazy men and after the meal tried to urge them off riggs went unwillingly burt refused to go at all  nix i footed them hills all im agoin to he said an from now on i rustle my own hoss  the leader glared his reception of this opposition perhaps his sense of fairness actuated him once more for he ordered shady and moze out to do their share  jim youre the best tracker in this outfit suppose you go suggested anson you allus used to be the first one off  times has changed snake was the imperturbable reply  wal wont you go demanded the leader impatiently  i shore wont  wilson did not look or intimate in any way that he would not leave the girl in camp with one or any or all of ansons gang but the truth was as significant as if he had shouted it the slowthinking moze gave wilson a sinister look  boss aint it funny how a pretty wench began shady jones sarcastically  shut up you fool broke in anson come on ill help rustle them hosses  after they had gone burt took his rifle and strolled off into the forest then the girl appeared her hair was down her face pale with dark shadows she asked for water to wash her face wilson pointed to the brook and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean scarf from his pack and carried them to her  upon her return to the campfire she looked very different with her hair arranged and the red stains in her cheeks  miss air you hungry asked wilson  yes i am she replied  he helped her to portions of bread venison and gravy and a cup of coffee evidently she relished the meat but she had to force down the rest  where are they all she asked  rustlin the hosses  probably she divined that he did not want to talk for the fleeting glance she gave him attested to a thought that his voice or demeanor had changed presently she sought a seat under the aspentree out of the sun and the smoke continually blowing in her face and there she stayed a forlorn little figure for all the resolute lips and defiant eyes  the texan paced to and fro beside the campfire with bent head and hands locked behind him but for the swinging gun he would have resembled a lanky farmer coatless and hatless with his brown vest open his trousers stuck in the top of the high boots  and neither he nor the girl changed their positions relatively for a long time at length however after peering into the woods and listening he remarked to the girl that he would be back in a moment and then walked off around the spruces  no sooner had he disappearedin fact so quickly afterward that it presupposed design instead of accidentthan riggs came running from the opposite side of the glade he ran straight to the girl who sprang to her feet  i hidtwo of thehorses he panted husky with excitement ill taketwo saddles you grab some grub well run for it  no she cried stepping back  but its not safefor ushere he said hurriedly glancing all around ill take youhome i swear not safei tell youthis gangs after me hurry  he laid hold of two saddles one with each hand the moment had reddened his face brightened his eyes made his action strong  im saferhere with this outlaw gang she replied  you wont come his color began to lighten then and his face to distort he dropped his hold on the saddles  harve riggs id rather become a toy and a rag for these ruffians than spend an hour alone with you she flashed at him in unquenchable hate  ill drag you  he seized her but could not hold her breaking away she screamed  help  that whitened his face drove him to frenzy leaping forward he struck her a hard blow across the mouth it staggered her and tripping on a saddle she fell his hands flew to her throat ready to choke her but she lay still and held her tongue then he dragged her to her feet  hurry nowgrab that packan follow me again riggs laid hold of the two saddles a desperate gleam baleful and vainglorious flashed over his face he was living his one great adventure  the girls eyes dilated they looked beyond him her lips opened  scream again an ill kill you he cried hoarsely and swiftly the very opening of her lips had terrified riggs  reckon one scream was enough spoke a voice slow but without the drawl easy and cool yet incalculable in some terrible sense  riggs wheeled with inarticulate cry wilson stood a few paces off with his gun half leveled low down his face seemed as usual only his eyes held a quivering light intensity like boiling molten silver  girl what made thet blood on your mouth  riggs hit me she whispered then at something she feared or saw or divined she shrank back dropped on her knees and crawled into the spruce shelter  wal riggs id invite you to draw if thet d be any use said wilson this speech was reflective yet it hurried a little  riggs could not draw nor move nor speak he seemed turned to stone except his jaw which slowly fell  harve riggs gunman from down missouri way continued the voice of incalculable intent reckon youve looked into a heap of gunbarrels in your day shore wal look in this heah one  wilson deliberately leveled the gun on a line with riggss starting eyes  wasnt you heard to brag in turners saloonthet you could see lead cominan dodge it shore you must be swift dodge this heah bullet  the gun spouted flame and boomed one of riggss starting popping eyesthe right onewent out like a lamp the other rolled horribly then set in blank dead fixedness riggs swayed in slow motion until a lost balance felled him heavily an inert mass  wilson bent over the prostrate form strange violent contrast to the cool scorn of the preceding moment hissing spitting as if poisoned by passion he burst with the hate that his character had forbidden him to express on a living counterfeit wilson was shaken as if by a palsy he choked over passionate incoherent invective it was class hate first then the hate of real manhood for a craven then the hate of disgrace for a murder no man so fair as a gunfighter in the western creed of an even break  wilsons terrible cataclysm of passion passed straightening up he sheathed his weapon and began a slow pace before the fire not many moments afterward he jerked his head high and listened horses were softly thudding through the forest soon anson rode into sight with his men and one of the strayed horses it chanced too that young burt appeared on the other side of the glade he walked quickly as one who anticipated news  snake anson as he dismounted espied the dead man  jimi thought i heard a shot  the others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate form with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted by sight of sudden death  that emotion was only momentary  shot his lamp out ejaculated moze  wonder how gunman riggs liked thet plumb center peg exclaimed shady jones with a hard laugh  back of his head all gone gasped young burt not improbably he had not seen a great many bulletmarked men  jimthe longhaired fool didnt try to draw on you exclaimed snake anson astounded  wilson neither spoke nor ceased his pacing  what was it over added anson curiously  he hit the gurl replied wilson  then there were longdrawn exclamations all around and glance met glance  jim you saved me the job continued the outlaw leader an im much obliged fellars search riggs an well divvy thet all right jim  shore an you can have my share  they found banknotes in the mans pocket and considerable gold worn in a moneybelt around his waist shady jones appropriated his boots and moze his gun then they left him as he had fallen  jim youll have to track them lost hosses two still missin an one of thems mine called anson as wilson paced to the end of his beat  the girl heard anson for she put her head out of the spruce shelter and called riggs said hed hid two of the horses they must be close he came that way  howdy kid thets good news replied anson his spirits were rising he must hev wanted you to slope with him  yes i wouldnt go  an then he hit you  yes  wal recallin your talk of yestiddy i cant see as mister riggs lasted much longer hyar than hed hev lasted in texas weve some of thet great country right in our outfit  the girl withdrew her white face  its break camp boys was the leaders order a couple of you look up them hosses theyll be hid in some thick spruces the rest of us ll pack   soon the gang was on the move heading toward the height of land and swerving from it only to find soft and grassy ground that would not leave any tracks  they did not travel more than a dozen miles during the afternoon but they climbed bench after bench until they reached the timbered plateau that stretched in sheer black slope up to the peaks here rose the great and gloomy forest of firs and pines with the spruce overshadowed and thinned out the last hour of travel was tedious and toilsome a zigzag winding breaking climbing hunt for the kind of campsite suited to ansons fancy he seemed to be growing strangely irrational about selecting places to camp at last for no reason that could have been manifest to a good woodsman he chose a gloomy bowl in the center of the densest forest that had been traversed the opening if such it could have been called was not a park or even a glade a dark cliff with strange holes rose to one side but not so high as the lofty pines that brushed it along its base babbled a brook running over such formation of rock that from different points near at hand it gave forth different sounds some singing others melodious and one at least of a hollow weird deep sound not loud but strangely penetrating  sure spooky i say observed shady sentiently  the little uplift of mood coincident with the rifling of riggss person had not worn over to this evening camp what talk the outlaws indulged in was necessary and conducted in low tones the place enjoined silence  wilson performed for the girl very much the same service as he had the night before only he advised her not to starve herself she must eat to keep up her strength she complied at the expense of considerable effort  as it had been a backbreaking day in which all of them except the girl had climbed miles on foot they did not linger awake long enough after supper to learn what a wild weird and pitchblack spot the outlaw leader had chosen the little spaces of open ground between the hugetrunked pinetrees had no counterpart up in the lofty spreading foliage not a star could blink a wan ray of light into that stygian pit the wind cutting down over abrupt heights farther up sang in the pineneedles as if they were strings vibrant with chords dismal creaks were audible they were the forest sounds of branch or tree rubbing one another but which needed the corrective medium of daylight to convince any human that they were other than ghostly then despite the wind and despite the changing murmur of the brook there seemed to be a silence insulating them as deep and impenetrable as the darkness  but the outlaws who were fugitives now slept the sleep of the weary and heard nothing they awoke with the sun when the forest seemed smoky in a golden gloom when light and bird and squirrel proclaimed the day  the horses had not strayed out of this basin during the night a circumstance that anson was not slow to appreciate  it aint no cheerful camp but i never seen a safer place to hole up in he remarked to wilson  wal yesif any place is safe replied that ally dubiously  we can watch our back tracks there aint any other way to git in hyar thet i see  snake we was tolerable fair sheeprustlers but were no good woodsmen  anson grumbled his disdain of this comrade who had once been his mainstay then he sent burt out to hunt fresh meat and engaged his other men at cards as they now had the means to gamble they at once became absorbed wilson smoked and divided his thoughtful gaze between the gamblers and the drooping figure of the girl the morning air was keen and she evidently not caring to be near her captors beside the campfire had sought the only sunny spot in this gloomy dell a couple of hours passed the sun climbed high the air grew warmer once the outlaw leader raised his head to scan the heavytimbered slopes that inclosed the camp  jim them hosses are strayin off he observed  wilson leisurely rose and stalked off across the small open patches in the direction of the horses they had grazed around from the right toward the outlet of the brook here headed a ravine dense and green two of the horses had gone down wilson evidently heard them though they were not in sight and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of them and drive them back the invisible brook ran down over the rocks with murmur and babble he halted with instinctive action he listened forest sounds soft lulling came on the warm pinescented breeze it would have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls he moved on cautiously and turned into a little open mossy spot brownmatted and odorous full of ferns and bluebells in the middle of this deep in the moss he espied a huge round track of a cougar he bent over it suddenly he stiffened then straightened guardedly at that instant he received a hard prod in the back throwing up his hands he stood still then slowly turned a tall hunter in gray buckskin grayeyed and squarejawed had him covered with a cocked rifle and beside this hunter stood a monster cougar snarling and blinking    chapter xxii  howdy dale drawled wilson reckon youre a little previous on me  sssssh not so loud said the hunter in low voice youre jim wilson  shore am say dale you showed up soon or did you jest happen to run acrost us  ive trailed you wilson im after the girl  i knowed thet when i seen you  the cougar seemed actuated by the threatening position of his master and he opened his mouth showing great yellow fangs and spat at wilson the outlaw apparently had no fear of dale or the cocked rifle but that huge snarling cat occasioned him uneasiness  wilson ive heard you spoken of as a white outlaw said dale  mebbe i am but shore ill be a scared one in a minit dale hes goin to jump me  the cougar wont jump you unless i make him wilson if i let you go will you get the girl for me  wal lemme see supposin i refuse queried wilson shrewdly  then one way or another its all up with you  reckon i aint

slip menot in these woods i could run off your horsespick you off one by oneor turn the cougar loose on you at night  shore its your game anson dealt himself this hand between you an me dale i never liked the deal  who shot riggs i found his body  wal yours truly was around when thet come off replied wilson with an involuntary little shudder some thought made him sick  the girl is she safeunharmed queried dale hurriedly  shes shore jest as safe an sound as when she was home dale shes the gamest kid thet ever breathed why no one could hev ever made me believe a girl a kid like her could hev the nerve shes got nothins happened to her cept riggs hit her in the mouth i killed him for thet an so help me god i believe its been workin in me to save her somehow now itll not be so hard  but how demanded dale  lemme see wal ive got to sneak her out of camp an meet you thets all  it must be done quick  but dale listen remonstrated wilson earnestly too quick ll be as bad as too slow snake is sore these days gittin sorer all the time he might savvy somethin if i aint careful an kill the girl or do her harm i know these fellars theyre all ready to go to pieces an shore i must play safe shore itd be safer to have a plan  wilsons shrewd light eyes gleamed with an idea he was about to lower one of his upraised hands evidently to point to the cougar when he thought better of that  ansons scared of cougars mebbe we can scare him an the gang so it d be easy to sneak the girl off can you make thet big brute do tricks rush the camp at night an squall an chase off the horses  ill guarantee to scare anson out of ten years growth replied dale  shore its a go then resumed wilson as if glad ill post the girlgive her a hunch to do her part you sneak up tonight jest before dark ill hev the gang worked up an then you put the cougar to his tricks whatever you want when the gang gits wild ill grab the girl an pack her off down heah or somewheres aboot an whistle fer you but mebbe thet aint so good if thet cougar comes pilin into camp he might jump me instead of one of the gang an another hunch he might slope up on me in the dark when i was tryin to find you shore thet aint appealin to me  wilson this cougar is a pet replied dale you think hes dangerous but hes not no more than a kitten he only looks fierce he has never been hurt by a person an hes never fought anythin himself but deer an bear i can make him trail any scent but the truth is i couldnt make him hurt you or anybody all the same he can be made to scare the hair off any one who doesnt know him  shore thet settles me ill be havin a grand joke while them fellars is scared to death dale you can depend on me an im beholdin to you fer what ll square me some with myself tonight an if it wont work then tomorrer night shore  dale lowered the rifle the big cougar spat again wilson dropped his hands and stepping forward split the green wall of intersecting spruce branches then he turned up the ravine toward the glen once there in sight of his comrades his action and expression changed  hosses all thar jim asked anson as he picked up his cards  shore they act awful queer them hosses replied wilson theyre afraid of somethin  ahuh silvertip mebbe muttered anson jim you jest keep watch of them hosses wed be done if some tarnal varmint stampeded them  reckon im elected to do all the work now

moze who appeared loser  wal thet gurl would starve if it wasnt fer me replied wilson genially and he walked over toward her beginning to address her quite loudly as he approached wal miss im elected cook an id shore like to heah what you fancy fer dinner  the outlaws heard for they guffawed again haw haw if jim aint funny exclaimed anson  the girl looked up amazed wilson was winking at her and when he got near he began to speak rapidly and low  i jest met dale down in the woods with his pet cougar hes after you im goin to help him git you safe away now you do your part i want you to pretend youve gone crazy savvy act out of your head shore i dont care what you do or say only act crazy an dont be scared were goin to scare the gang so ill hev a chance to sneak you away tonight or tomorrowshore  before he began to speak she was pale sad dull of eye swiftly with his words she was transformed and when he had ended she did not appear the same girl she gave him one blazing flash of comprehension and nodded her head rapidly  yes i understand ill do it she whispered  the outlaw turned slowly away with the most abstract air confounded amid his shrewd acting and he did not collect himself until halfway back to his comrades then beginning to hum an old darky tune he stirred up and replenished the fire and set about preparation for the midday meal but he did not miss anything going on around him he saw the girl go into her shelter and come out with her hair all down over her face wilson back to his comrades grinned his glee and he wagged his head as if he thought the situation was developing  the gambling outlaws however did not at once see the girl preening herself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle  busted ejaculated anson with a curse as he slammed down his cards if i aint hoodooed im a twobit of a gambler  sartin youre hoodooed said shady jones in scorn is thet jest dawnin on you  boss you play like a cow stuck in the mud remarked moze laconically  fellars it aint funny declared anson with pathetic gravity im jest gittin on to myself somethins wrong since way last fall no lucknothin but the wust end of everythin i aint blamin anybody im the boss its me thets off  snake shore it was the gurl deal you made rejoined wilson who had listened i told you our troubles hev only begun an i can see the windup look  wilson pointed to where the girl stood her hair flying wildly all over her face and shoulders she was making most elaborate bows to an old stump sweeping the ground with her tresses in her obeisance  anson started he grew utterly astounded his amaze was ludicrous and the other two men looked to stare to equal their leaders bewilderment  what n hells come over her asked anson dubiously must hev perked up but she aint feelin thet gay  wilson tapped his forehead with a significant finger  shore i was scared of her this mawnin he whispered  naw exclaimed anson incredulously  if she haint queer i never seen no queer wimmin vouchsafed shady jones and it would have been judged by the way he wagged his head that he had been all his days familiar with women  moze looked beyond words and quite alarmed  i seen it comin declared wilson very much excited but i was scared to say so youall made fun of me aboot her now i shore wish i had spoken up  anson nodded solemnly he did not believe the evidence of his sight but the facts seemed stunning as if the girl were a dangerous and incomprehensible thing he approached her step by step wilson followed and the others appeared drawn irresistibly  hey tharkid called anson hoarsely  the girl drew her slight form up haughtily through her spreading tresses her eyes gleamed unnaturally upon the outlaw leader but she deigned not to reply  hey tharyou rayner girl added anson lamely whats ailin you  my lord did you address me she asked loftily  shady jones got over his consternation and evidently extracted some humor from the situation as his dark face began to break its strain  aww breathed anson heavily  ophelia awaits your command my lord ive been gathering flowers she said sweetly holding up her empty hands as if they contained a bouquet  shady jones exploded in convulsed laughter but his merriment was not shared and suddenly it brought disaster upon him the girl flew at him  why do you croak you toad i will have you whipped and put in irons you scullion she cried passionately  shady underwent a remarkable change and stumbled in his backward retreat then she snapped her fingers in mozes face  you black devil get hence avaunt  anson plucked up courage enough to touch her  aww now ophelyar  probably he meant to try to humor her but she screamed and he jumped back as if she might burn him she screamed shrilly in wild staccato notes  you you she pointed her finger at the outlaw leader you brute to women you ran off from your wife  anson turned plumcolor and then slowly white the girl must have sent a random shot home  and now the devils turned you into a snake a long scaly snake with green eyes uugh youll crawl on your belly soonwhen my cowboy finds you and hell tramp you in the dust  she floated away from them and began to whirl gracefully arms spread and hair flying and then apparently oblivious of the staring men she broke into a low sweet song next she danced around a pine then danced into her little green inclosure from which presently she sent out the most doleful moans  aww what a shame burst out anson thet fine healthy nervy kid clean gone daffy crazy n a bedbug  shore its a shame protested wilson but its wuss for us lord if we was hoodooed before what will we be now didnt i tell you snake anson you was warned ask shady an mozethey see whats up  no luck ll ever come our way agin predicted shady mournfully  it beats me boss it beats me muttered moze  a crazy woman on my hands if thet aint the last straw broke out anson tragically as he turned away ignorant superstitious worked upon by things as they seemed the outlaw imagined himself at last beset by malign forces when he flung himself down upon one of the packs his big redhaired hands shook shady and moze resembled two other men at the end of their ropes  wilsons tense face twitched and he averted it as apparently he fought off a paroxysm of some nature just then anson swore a thundering oath  crazy or not ill git gold out of thet kid he roared  but man talk sense are you gittin daffy too i declare this outfits been eatin loco you cant git gold fer her said wilson deliberately  why cant i  cause were tracked we cant make no dickers why in another day or so well be dodgin lead  tracked whar d you git thet idee as soon as this queried anson lifting his head like a striking snake his men likewise betrayed sudden interest  shore its no idee i aint seen any one but i feel it in my senses i hear somebody comina step on our trailall the timenight in particular reckon theres a big posse after us  wal if i see or hear anythin ill knock the girl on the head an well dig out of hyar replied anson sullenly  wilson executed a swift forward motion violent and passionate so utterly unlike what might have been looked for from him that the three outlaws gaped  then youll shore hev to knock jim wilson on the haid first he said in voice as strange as his action  jim you wouldnt go back on me implored anson with uplifted hands in a dignity of pathos  im losin my haid too an you shore might as well knock it in an youll hev to before ill stand you murderin thet pore little gurl youve drove crazy  jim i was only mad replied anson fer thet matter im growin daffy myself aw we all need a good stiff drink of whisky  so he tried to throw off gloom and apprehension but he failed his comrades did not rally to his help wilson walked away nodding his head  boss let jim alone whispered shady its orful the way you buck agin himwhen you seen hes stirred up jims true blue but you gotta be careful  moze corroborated this statement by gloomy nods  when the cardplaying was resumed anson did not join the game and both moze and shady evinced little of that wholehearted obsession which usually attended their gambling anson lay at length his head in a saddle scowling at the little shelter where the captive girl kept herself out of sight at times a faint song or laugh very unnatural was wafted across the space wilson plodded at the cooking and apparently heard no sounds presently he called the men to eat which office they surlily and silently performed as if it was a favor bestowed upon the cook  snake hadnt i ought to take a bite of grub over to the gurl asked wilson  do you hev to ask me thet snapped anson shes gotta be fed if we hev to stuff it down her throat  wal i aint stuck on the job replied wilson but ill tackle it seein youall got cold feet  with plate and cup be reluctantly approached the little leanto and kneeling he put his head inside the girl quickeyed and alert had evidently seen him coming at any rate she greeted him with a cautious smile  jim was i pretty good she whispered  miss you was shore the finest aktress i ever seen he responded in a low voice but you dam near overdid it im goin to tell anson youre sick nowpoisoned or somethin awful then well wait till night dale shore will help us out  oh im on fire to get away she exclaimed jim wilson ill never forget you as long as i live  he seemed greatly embarrassed  walmissiill do my best licks but i aint gamblin none on results be patient keep your nerve dont get scared i reckon between me an dale youll git away from heah  withdrawing his head he got up and returned to the campfire where anson was waiting curiously  i left the grub but she didnt touch it seems sort of sick to me like she was poisoned  jim didnt i hear you talkin asked anson  shore i was coaxin her reckon she aint so ranty as she was but she shore is doubledup an sickish  wuss an wuss all the time said anson between his teeth an wheres burt hyar its noon an he left early he never was no woodsman hes got lost  either thet or hes run into somethin replied wilson thoughtfully  anson doubled a huge fist and cursed deep under his breaththe reaction of a man whose accomplices and partners and tools whose luck whose faith in himself had failed him he flung himself down under a tree and after a while when his rigidity relaxed he probably fell asleep moze and shady kept at their game wilson paced to and fro sat down and then got up to bunch the horses again walked around the dell and back to camp the afternoon hours were long and they were waiting hours the act of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did  at sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague thick twilight anson rolled over yawned and sat up as he glanced around evidently seeking burt his face clouded  no sign of burt he asked  wilson expressed a mild surprise wal snake you aint expectin burt now  i am course i am why not demanded anson any other time wed look fer him wouldnt we  any other time aint now burt wont ever come back wilson spoke it with a positive finality  ahuh some more of them queer feelins of yournoperatin again hey them onnatural kind thet you cant explain hey  ansons queries were bitter and rancorous  yes an snake i tax you with this heah aint any of them queer feelins operatin in you  no rolled out the leader savagely but his passionate denial was a proof that he lied from the moment of this outburst which was a fierce clinging to the old brave instincts of his character unless a sudden change marked the nature of his fortunes he would rapidly deteriorate to the breakingpoint and in such brutal unrestrained natures as his this breakingpoint meant a desperate stand a desperate forcing of events a desperate accumulation of passions that stalked out to deal and to meet disaster and blood and death  wilson put a little wood on the fire and he munched a biscuit no one asked him to cook no one made any effort to do so one by one each man went to the pack to get some bread and meat  then they waited as men who knew not what they waited for yet hated and dreaded it  twilight in that glen was naturally a strange veiled condition of the atmosphere it was a merging of shade and light which two seemed to make gray creeping shadows  suddenly a snorting and stamping of the horses startled the men  somethin scared the hosses said anson rising come on  moze accompanied him and they disappeared in the gloom more trampling of hoofs was heard then a cracking of brush and the deep voices of men at length the two outlaws returned leading three of the horses which they haltered in the open glen  the campfire light showed ansons face dark and serious  jim them hosses are wilder n deer he said i ketched mine an moze got two but the rest worked away whenever we come close some varmint has scared them bad we all gotta rustle out thar quick  wilson rose shaking his head doubtfully and at that moment the quiet air split to a piercing horrid neigh of a terrified horse prolonged to a screech it broke and ended then followed snorts of fright pound and crack and thud of hoofs and crash of brush then a gathering thumping crashing roar split by piercing sounds  stampede yelled anson and he ran to hold his own horse which he had haltered right in camp it was big and wildlooking and now reared and plunged to break away anson just got there in time and then it took all his weight to pull the horse down not until the crashing snorting pounding melee had subsided and died away over the rim of the glen did anson dare leave his frightened favorite  gone our horses are gone did you hear em he exclaimed blankly  shore theyre a cutup an crippled bunch by now replied wilson  boss well never git ern back not n a hundred years declared moze  thet settles us snake anson stridently added shady jones them hosses are gone you can kiss your hand to them they wasnt hobbled they hed an orful scare they split on thet stampede an theyll never git together  see what youve fetched us to  under the force of this triple arraignment the outlaw leader dropped to his seat staggered and silenced in fact silence fell upon all the men and likewise enfolded the glen  night set in jetblack dismal lonely without a star faintly the wind moaned weirdly the brook babbled through its strange chords to end in the sound that was hollow it was never the samea rumble as if faint distant thundera deep gurgle as of water drawn into a vortexa rolling as of a stone in swift current the black cliff was invisible yet seemed to have many weird faces the giant pines loomed spectral the shadows were thick moving changing flickering lights from the campfire circled the huge trunks and played fantastically over the brooding men this campfire did not burn or blaze cheerily it had no glow no sputter no white heart no red living embers one by one the outlaws as if with common consent tried their hands at making the fire burn aright what little wood had been collected was old it would burn up with false flare only to die quickly  after a while not one of the outlaws spoke or stirred not one smoked their gloomy eyes were fixed on the fire each one was concerned with his own thoughts his own lonely soul unconsciously full of a doubt of the future that brooding hour severed him from comrade  at night nothing seemed the same as it was by day with success and plenty with fullblooded action past and more in store these outlaws were as different from their present state as this black night was different from the bright day they waited for wilson though he played a deep game of deceit for the sake of the helpless girland thus did not have haunting and superstitious fears on her accountwas probably more conscious of impending catastrophe than any of them  the evil they had done spoke in the voice of nature out of the darkness and was interpreted by each according to his hopes and fears fear was their predominating sense for years they had lived with some species of fearof honest men or vengeance of pursuit of starvation of lack of drink or gold of blood and death of stronger men of luck of chance of fate of mysterious nameless force wilson was the type of fearless spirit but he endured the most gnawing and implacable fear of allthat of himselfthat he must inevitably fall to deeds beneath his manhood  so they hunched around the campfire brooding because hope was at lowest ebb listening because the weird black silence with its moan of wind and hollow laugh of brook compelled them to hear waiting for sleep for the hours to pass for whatever was to come  and it was anson who caught the first intimation of an impending doom    chapter xxiii  listen  anson whispered tensely his poise was motionless his eyes roved everywhere he held up a shaking bludgy finger to command silence  a third and stranger sound accompanied the low weird moan of the wind and the hollow mockery of the brookand it seemed a barely perceptible exquisitely delicate wail or whine it filled in the lulls between the other sounds  if thets some varmint hes close whispered anson  but shore its far off said wilson  shady jones and moze divided their opinions in the same way  all breathed freer when the wail ceased relaxing to their former lounging positions around the fire an impenetrable wall of blackness circled the pale space lighted by the campfire and this circle contained the dark somber group of men in the center the dying campfire and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on the outer edge the horses scarcely moved from their tracks and their erect alert heads attested to their sensitiveness to the peculiarities of the night  then at an unusually quiet lull the strange sound gradually arose to a wailing whine  its thet crazy wench cryin declared the outlaw leader  apparently his allies accepted that statement with as much relief as they had expressed for the termination of the sound  shore thet must be it agreed jim wilson gravely  well git a lot of sleep with thet gurl whinin all night growled shady jones  she gives me the creeps said moze  wilson got up to resume his pondering walk head bent hands behind his back a grim realistic figure of perturbation  jimset down you make me nervous said anson irritably  wilson actually laughed but low as if to keep his strange mirth well confined  snake ill bet you my hoss an my gun agin a biscuit thet in aboot six seconds more or less ill be stampedin like them hosses  ansons lean jaw dropped the other two outlaws stared with round eyes wilson was not drunk they evidently knew but what he really was appeared a mystery  jim wilson are you showin yellow queried anson hoarsely  mebbe the lord only knows but listen heah snake youve seen an heard people croak  you mean cash indie  shore  wal yesa couple or so replied anson grimly  but you never seen no one die of shockof an orful scare  no i reckon i never did  i have an thets whats ailin jim wilson and he resumed his dogged steps  anson and his two comrades exchanged bewildered glances with one another  ahuh say whats thet got to do with us hyar asked anson presently  thet gurl is dyin retorted wilson in a voice cracking like a whip  the three outlaws stiffened in their seats incredulous yet irresistibly swayed by emotions that stirred to this dark lonely illomened hour  wilson trudged to the edge of the lighted circle muttering to himself and came back again then he trudged farther this time almost out of sight but only to return the third time he vanished in the impenetrable wall of light the three men scarcely moved a muscle as they watched the place where he had disappeared in a few moments he came stumbling back  shore shes almost gone he said dismally it took my nerve but i felt of her face thet orful wail is her breath chokin in her throat like a deathrattle only long instead of short  wal if shes gotta croak its good she gits it over quick replied anson i aint hed sleep fer three nights  an what i need is whisky  snake thets gospel youre spoutin remarked shady jones morosely  the direction of sound in the glen was difficult to be assured of but any man not stirred to a high pitch of excitement could have told that the difference in volume of this strange wail must have been caused by different distances and positions also when it was loudest it was most like a whine but these outlaws heard with their consciences  at last it ceased abruptly  wilson again left the group to be swallowed up by the night his absence was longer than usual but he returned hurriedly  shes daid he exclaimed solemnly thet innocent kidwho never harmed no onean whod make any man better fer seein hershes daid anson youve shore a heap to answer fer when your time comes  whats eatin you demanded the leader angrily her blood aint on my hands  it shore is shouted wilson shaking his hand at anson an youll hev to take your medicine i felt thet comin all along an i feel some more  aw shes jest gone to sleep declared anson shaking his long frame as he rose gimme a light  boss youre plumb off to go near a dead gurl thets jest died crazy protested shady jones  off haw haw who aint off in this outfit id like to know anson possessed himself of a stick blazing at one and and with this he stalked off toward the leanto where the girl was supposed to be dead his gaunt figure lighted by the torch certainly fitted the weird black surroundings and it was seen that once near the girls shelter he proceeded more slowly until he halted he bent to peer inside  shes gone he yelled in harsh shaken accents  than the torch burned out leaving only a red glow he whirled it about but the blaze did not rekindle his comrades peering intently lost sight of his tall form and the end of the redended stick darkness like pitch swallowed him for a moment no sound intervened again the moan of wind the strange little mocking hollow roar dominated the place then there came a rush of something perhaps of air like the soft swishing of spruce branches swinging aside dull thudding footsteps followed it anson came running back to the fire his aspect was wild his face pale his eyes were fierce and starting from their sockets he had drawn his gun  didyesee er hearanythin he panted peering back then all around and at last at his man  no an i shore was lookin an listenin replied wilson  boss there wasnt nothin declared moze  i aint so sartin said shady jones with doubtful staring eyes i believe i heerd a rustlin  she wasnt there ejaculated anson in wondering awe shes gone my torch went out i couldnt see an jest then i felt somethin was passin fast i jerked round all was black an yet if i didnt see a big gray streak im crazier n thet gurl but i couldnt swear to anythin but a rushin of wind i felt thet  gone exclaimed wilson in great alarm fellars if thets so then mebbe she wasnt daid an she wandered off  but she was daid her heart hed quit beatin ill swear to thet  i move to break camp said shady jones gruffly and he stood up moze seconded that move by an expressive flash of his black visage  jim if shes deadan gonewhat n hells come off huskily asked anson it only seems thet way were all worked up lets talk sense  anson shore theres a heap you an me dont know replied wilson the world come to an end once wal it can come to another end i tell you i aint surprised  thar cried anson whirling with his gun leaping out  something huge shadowy gray against the black rushed behind the men and trees and following it came a perceptible acceleration of the air  shore snake there wasnt nothin said wilson presently  i heerd whispered shady jones  it was only a breeze blowin thet smoke rejoined moze  id bet my soul somethin went back of me declared anson glaring into the void  listen an lets make shore suggested wilson  the guilty agitated faces of the outlaws showed plain enough in the flickering light for each to see a convicting dread in his fellow like statues they stood watching and listening  few sounds stirred in the strange silence now and then the horses heaved heavily but stood still a dismal dreary note of the wind in the pines vied with a hollow laugh of the brook and these low sounds only fastened attention upon the quality of the silence a breathing lonely spirit of solitude permeated the black dell like a pit of unplumbed depths the dark night yawned an evil conscience listening there could have heard the most peaceful beautiful and mournful sounds of nature only as strains of a calling hell  suddenly the silent oppressive surcharged air split to a short piercing scream  ansons big horse stood up straight pawing the air and came down with a crash the other horses shook with terror  wasnttheta cougar whispered anson thickly  thet was a womans scream replied wilson and he appeared to be shaking like a leaf in the wind  theni figgered rightthe kids alivewonderin aroundan she let out thet orful scream said anson  wonderin round yesbut shes daid  my gawd it aint possible  wal if she aint wonderin round daid shes almost daid replied wilson and he began to whisper to himself  if id only knowed what thet deal meant id hev plugged beasley instead of listenin an i ought to hev knocked thet kid on the head an made sartin shed croaked if she goes screamin round thet way  his voice failed as there rose a thin splitting highpointed shriek somewhat resembling the first scream only less wild it came apparently from the cliff  from another point in the pitchblack glen rose the wailing terrible cry of a woman in agony wild haunting mournful wail  ansons horse loosing the halter plunged back almost falling over a slight depression in the rocky ground the outlaw caught him and dragged him nearer the fire the other horses stood shaking and straining moze ran between them and held them shady jones threw green brush on the fire with sputter and crackle a blaze started showing wilson standing tragically his arms out facing the black shadows  the strange live shriek was not repeated but the cry like that of a woman in her deaththroes pierced the silence again it left a quivering ring that softly died away then the stillness clamped down once more and the darkness seemed to thicken the men waited and when they had begun to relax the cry burst out appallingly close right behind the trees it was humanthe personification of pain and terrorthe tremendous struggle of precious life against horrible death so pure so exquisite so wonderful was the cry that the listeners writhed as if they saw an innocent tender beautiful girl torn frightfully before their eyes it was full of suspense it thrilled for death its marvelous potency was the wild notethat beautiful and ghastly note of selfpreservation  in sheer desperation the outlaw leader fired his gun at the black wall whence the cry came then he had to fight his horse to keep him from plunging away following the shot was an interval of silence the horses became tractable the men gathered closer to the fire with the halters still held firmly  if it was a cougarthet d scare him off said anson  shore but it aint a cougar replied wilson wait an see  they all waited listening with ears turned to different points eyes roving everywhere afraid of their very shadows once more the moan of wind the mockery of brook deep gurgle laugh and babble dominated the silence of the glen  boss lets shake this spooky hole whispered moze  the suggestion attracted anson and he pondered it while slowly shaking his head  weve only three hosses an mine ll take ridinafter them squalls replied the leader weve got packs too an hell aint nothin on this place fer bein dark  no matter lets go ill walk an lead the way said moze eagerly i got sharp eyes you fellars can ride an carry a pack well git out of here an come back in daylight fer the rest of the outfit  anson im keen fer thet myself declared shady jones  jim what dye say to thet queried anson rustlin out of this black hole  shore its a grand idee agreed wilson  thet was a cougar avowed anson gathering courage as the silence remained unbroken but jest the same it was as tough on me as if it hed been a woman screamin over a blade twistin in her gizzards  snake shore you seen a woman heah lately deliberately asked wilson  reckon i did thet kid replied anson dubiously  wal you seen her go crazy didnt you  yes  an she wasnt heah when you went huntin fer her  correct  wal if thets so what do you want to blab about cougars for  wilsons argument seemed incontestable shady and moze nodded gloomily and shifted restlessly from foot to foot anson dropped his head  no matterif we only dont hear he began suddenly to grow mute  right upon them from some place just out the circle of light rose a scream by reason of its proximity the most piercing and agonizing yet heard simply petrifying the group until the peal passed ansons huge horse reared and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap straight out he struck anson with thudding impact knocking him over the rocks into the depression back of the campfire and plunging after him wilson had made a flying leap just in time to avoid being struck and he turned to see anson go down there came a crash a groan and then the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up apparently he had rolled over his master  help fellars yelled wilson quick to leap down over the little bank and in the dim light to grasp the halter the three men dragged the horse out and securely tied him close to a tree that done they peered down into the depression ansons form could just barely be distinguished in the gloom he lay stretched out another groan escaped him  shore im scared hes hurt said wilson  hoss rolled right on top of him an thet hosss heavy declared moze  they got down and knelt beside their leader in the darkness his face looked dull gray his breathing was not right  snake old man you ainthurt asked wilson with a tremor in his voice receiving no reply he said to his comrades lay hold an well heft him up where we can see  the three men carefully lifted anson up on the bank and laid him near the fire in the light anson was conscious his face was ghastly blood showed on his lips  wilson knelt beside him the other outlaws stood up and with one dark gaze at one another damned ansons chance of life and on the instant rose that terrible distressing scream of acute agonylike that of a woman being dismembered shady jones whispered something to moze then they stood up gazing down at their fallen leader  tell me where youre hurt asked wilson  hesmashedmy chest said anson in a broken strangled whisper  wilsons deft hands opened the outlaws shirt and felt of his chest  no shore your breastbone aint smashed replied wilson hopefully and he began to run his hand around one side of ansons body and then the other abruptly he stopped averted his gaze then slowly ran the hand all along that side ansons ribs had been broken and crushed in by the weight of the horse he was bleeding at the mouth and his slow painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth which showed that the broken bones had penetrated the lungs an injury sooner or later fatal  pard you busted a rib or two said wilson  aw jimit must bewuss n thet he whispered imin orfulpain an i cantgit anybreath  mebbe youll be better said wilson with a cheerfulness his face belied  moze bent close over anson took a short scrutiny of that ghastly face at the bloodstained lips and the lean hands plucking at nothing then he jerked erect  shady hes goin to cash lets clear out of this  im yours pertickler previous replied jones  both turned away they untied the two horses and led them up to where the saddles lay swiftly the blankets went on swiftly the saddles swung up swiftly the cinches snapped anson lay gazing up at wilson comprehending this move and wilson stood strangely grim and silent somehow detached coldly from that self of the past few hours  shady you grab some bread an ill pack a bunk of meat said moze both men came near the fire into the light within ten feet of where the leader lay  fellarsyou aintslopin he whispered in husky amaze  boss we air thet same we cant do you no good an this hole aint healthy replied moze  shady jones swung himself astride his horse all about him sharp eager strung  moze ill tote the grub an you lead out of hyar till we git past the wust timber he said  aw mozeyou wouldnt leavejim hyaralone implored anson  jim can stay till he rots retorted moze ive hed enough of this hole  but mozeit aint square panted anson jim wouldntleave me id stickby you ill make itall up to you  snake youre goin to cash sardonically returned moze  a current leaped all through ansons stretched frame his ghastly face blazed that was the great and the terrible moment which for long had been in abeyance wilson had known grimly that it would come by one means or another anson had doggedly and faithfully struggled against the tide of fatal issues moze and shady jones deep locked in their selfcentered motives had not realized the inevitable trend of their dark lives  anson prostrate as he was swiftly drew his gun and shot moze without sound or movement of hand moze fell then the plunge of shadys horse caused ansons second shot to miss a quick third shot brought no apparent result but shadys cursing resort to his own weapon he tried to aim from his plunging horse his bullets spattered dust and gravel over anson then wilsons long arm stretched and his heavy gun banged shady collapsed in the saddle and the frightened horse throwing him plunged out of the circle of light thudding hoofs crashings of brush quickly ceased  jimdid yougit him whispered anson  shore did snake was the slow halting response jim wilson must have sustained a sick shudder as he replied sheathing his gun he folded a blanket and put it under ansons head  jimmy feetair orful cold whispered anson  wal its gittin chilly replied wilson and taking a second blanket he laid that over ansons limbs snake im feared shady hit you once  ahuh but not so id caremuchif i hedno wuss hurt  you lay still now reckon shadys hoss stopped out heah a ways an ill see  jimi aint heerdthet scream fera little  shore its gone reckon now thet was a cougar  i knowed it  wilson stalked away into the darkness that inky wall did not seem so impenetrable and black after he had gotten out of the circle of light he proceeded carefully and did not make any missteps he groped from tree to tree toward the cliff and presently brought up against a huge flat rock as high as his head here the darkness was blackest yet he was able to see a light form on the rock  miss are you thereall right he called softly  yes but im scared to death she whispered in reply  shore it wound up sudden come now i reckon your troubles over  he helped her off the rock and finding her unsteady on her feet he supported her with one arm and held the other out in front of him to feel for objects foot by foot they worked out from under the dense shadow of the cliff following the course of the little brook it babbled and gurgled and almost drowned the low whistle wilson sent out the girl dragged heavily upon him now evidently weakening at length he reached the little open patch at the head of the ravine halting here he whistled an answer came from somewhere behind him and to the right wilson waited with the girl hanging on his arm  dales heah he said an dont you keel over nowafter all the nerve you hed  a swishing of brush a step a soft padded footfall a looming dark figure and a long low gray shape stealthily movingit was the last of these that made wilson jump  wilson came dales subdued voice  heah ive got her dale safe an sound replied wilson stepping toward the tall form and he put the drooping girl into dales arms  bo bo youre all right dales deep voice was tremulous  she roused up to seize

my life  wilson moved away out toward the pale glow of light under the black pines    chapter xxiv  as helen rayner watched dale ride away on a quest perilous to him and which meant almost life or death for her it was surpassing strange that she could think of nothing except the thrilling tumultuous moment when she had put her arms round his neck  it did not matter that dalesplendid fellow that he washad made the ensuing moment free of shame by taking her action as he had taken itthe fact that she had actually done it was enough how utterly impossible for her to anticipate her impulses or to understand them once they were acted upon confounding realization then was that when dale returned with her sister helen knew she would do the same thing over again  if i doi wont be twofaced about it she soliloquized and a hot blush flamed her cheeks  she watched dale until he rode out of sight  when he had gone worry and dread replaced this other confusing emotion she turned to the business of meeting events before supper she packed her valuables and books papers and clothes together with bos and had them in readiness so if she was forced to vacate the premises she would have her personal possessions  the mormon boys and several other of her trusted men slept in their tarpaulin beds on the porch of the ranchhouse that night so that helen at least would not be surprised but the day came with its manifold duties undisturbed by any event and it passed slowly with the leaden feet of listening watching vigilance  carmichael did not come back nor was there news of him to be had the last known of him had been late the afternoon of the preceding day when a sheepherder had seen him far out on the north range headed for the hills the beemans reported that roys condition had improved and also that there was a subdued excitement of suspense down in the village  this second lonely night was almost unendurable for helen when she slept it was to dream horrible dreams when she lay awake it was to have her heart leap to her throat at a rustle of leaves near the window and to be in torture of imagination as to poor bos plight a thousand times helen said to herself that beasley could have had the ranch and welcome if only bo had been spared helen absolutely connected her enemy with her sisters disappearance riggs might have been a means to it  daylight was not attended by so many fears there were things to do that demanded attention and thus it was that the next morning shortly before noon she was recalled to her perplexities by a shouting out at the corrals and a galloping of horses somewhere near from the window she saw a big smoke  fire that must be one of the barnsthe old one farthest out she said gazing out of the window some careless mexican with his everlasting cigarette  helen resisted an impulse to go out and see what had happened she had decided to stay in the house but when footsteps sounded on the porch and a rap on the door she unhesitatingly opened it four mexicans stood close one of them quick as thought flashed a hand in to grasp her and in a single motion pulled her across the threshold  no hurt senora he said and pointedmaking motions she must go  helen did not need to be told what this visit meant many as her conjectures had been however she had not thought of beasley subjecting her to this outrage and her blood boiled  how dare you she said trembling in her effort to control her temper but class authority voice availed nothing with these swarthy mexicans they grinned another laid hold of helen with dirty brown hand she shrank from the contact  let go she burst out furiously and instinctively she began to struggle to free herself then they all took hold of her helens dignity might never have been a burning choking rush of blood was her first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her inheritance from the auchinclosses she who had resolved never to lay herself open to indignity now fought like a tigress the mexicans jabbering in their excitement had all they could do until they lifted her bodily from the porch they handled her as if she had been a halfempty sack of corn one holding each hand and foot they packed her with dress disarranged and half torn off down the path to the lane and down the lane to the road there they stood upright and pushed her off her property  through halfblind eyes helen saw them guarding the gateway ready to prevent her entrance she staggered down the road to the village it seemed she made her way through a red dimnessthat there was a congestion in her brainthat the distance to mrs casss cottage was insurmountable but she got there to stagger up the path to hear the old womans cry dizzy faint sick with a blackness enveloping all she looked at helen felt herself led into the sittingroom and placed in the big chair  presently sight and clearness of mind returned to her she saw roy white as a sheet questioning her with terrible eyes the old woman hung murmuring over her trying to comfort her as well as fasten the disordered dress  four greaserspacked me downthe hillthrew me off my ranchinto the road panted helen  she seemed to tell this also to her own consciousness and to realize the mighty wave of danger that shook her whole body  if id knowni would have killed them  she exclaimed that fullvoiced and hard with dry hot eyes on her friends roy reached out to take her hand speaking huskily helen did not distinguish what he said the frightened old woman knelt with unsteady fingers fumbling over the rents in helens dress the moment came when helens quivering began to subside when her blood quieted to let her reason sway when she began to do battle with her rage and slowly to take fearful stock of this consuming peril that had been a sleeping tigress in her veins  oh miss helen you looked so turrible i made sure you was hurted the old woman was saying  helen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists at the one stocking that hung down over her shoetop at the rent which had bared her shoulder to the profane gaze of those grinning beadyeyed mexicans  my bodysnot hurt she whispered  roy had lost some of his whiteness and where his eyes had been fierce they were now kind  wal miss nell its lucky no harms done now if youll only see this whole deal clear not let it spoil your sweet way of lookin an hopin if you can only see whats raw in this westan love it jest the same  helen only half divined his meaning but that was enough for a future reflection the west was beautiful but hard in the faces of these friends she began to see the meaning of the keen sloping lines and shadows of pain of a lean naked truth cut as from marble  for the lands sakes tell us all about it importuned mrs cass  whereupon helen shut her eyes and told the brief narrative of her expulsion from her home  shore weall expected thet said roy an its jest as well youre here with a whole skin beasleys in possession now an i reckon wed all sooner hev you away from thet ranch  but roy i wont let beasley stay there cried helen  miss nell shore by the time this here pine has growed big enough fer law youll hev gray in thet pretty hair you cant put beasley off with your honest an rightful claim al auchincloss was a hard driver he made enemies an he made some he didnt kill the evil men do lives after them an youve got to suffer fer als sins though al was as good as any man who ever prospered in these parts  oh what can i do i wont give up ive been robbed cant the people help me must i meekly sit with my hands crossed while that halfbreed thiefoh its unbelievable  i reckon youll jest hev to be patient fer a few days said roy calmly itll all come right in the end  roy youve had this deal as you call it all worked out in mind for a long time exclaimed helen  shore an i aint missed a reckonin yet  then what will happenin a few days  nell rayner are you goin to hev some spunk an not lose your nerve again or go wild out of your head  ill try to be brave butbut i must be prepared she replied tremulously  wal theres dale an las vegas an me fer beasley to reckon with an miss nell his chances fer long life are as pore as his chances fer heaven  but roy i dont believe in deliberate taking of life replied helen shuddering thats against my religion i wont allow it andthenthink dale all of youin danger  girl how re you ever goin to help yourself shore you might hold dale back if you love him an swear you wont give yourself to him an i reckon id respect your religion if you was goin to suffer through me but not dale nor younor bonor love or heaven or hell can ever stop thet cowboy las vegas  oh if dale brings bo back to mewhat will i care for my ranch murmured helen  reckon youll only begin to care when thet happens your big hunter has got to be put to work replied roy with his keen smile   before noon that day the baggage helen had packed at home was left on the porch of widow casss cottage and helens anxious need of the hour was satisfied she was made comfortable in the old womans one spare room and she set herself the task of fortitude and endurance  to her surprise many of mrs casss neighbors came unobtrusively to the back door of the little cottage and made sympathetic inquiries they appeared a subdued and apprehensive group and whispered to one another as they left helen gathered from their visits a conviction that the wives of the men dominated by beasley believed no good could come of this highhanded taking over of the ranch indeed helen found at the end of the day that a strength had been borne of her misfortune  the next day roy informed her that his brother john had come down the preceding night with the news of beasleys descent upon the ranch not a shot had been fired and the only damage done was that of the burning of a hayfilled barn this had been set on fire to attract helens men to one spot where beasley had ridden down upon them with three times their number he had boldly ordered them off the land unless they wanted to acknowledge him boss and remain there in his service the three beemans had stayed having planned that just in this event they might be valuable to helens interests beasley had ridden down into pine the same as upon any other day roy reported also news which had come in that morning how beasleys crowd had celebrated late the night before  the second and third and fourth days endlessly wore away and helen believed they had made her old at night she lay awake most of the time thinking and praying but during the afternoon she got some sleep she could think of nothing and talk of nothing except her sister and dales chances of saving her  well shore you pay dale a pore compliment finally protested the patient roy i tell youmilt dale can do anythin he wants to do in the woods you can believe thet  but i reckon hell run chances after he comes back  this significant speech thrilled helen with its assurance of hope and made her blood curdle at the implied peril awaiting the hunter  on the afternoon of the fifth day helen was abruptly awakened from her nap the sun had almost set she heard voicesthe shrill cackling notes of old mrs cass high in excitement a deep voice that made helen tingle all over a girls laugh broken but happy there were footsteps and stamping of hoofs dale had brought bo back helen knew it she grew very weak and had to force herself to stand erect her heart began to pound in her very ears a sweet and perfect joy suddenly flooded her soul she thanked god her prayers had been answered then suddenly alive with sheer mad physical gladness she rushed out  she was just in time to see roy beeman stalk out as if he had never been shot and with a yell greet a big grayclad grayfaced mandale  howdy roy glad to see you up said dale how the quiet voice steadied helen she beheld bo bo looking the same except a little pale and disheveled then bo saw her and leaped at her into her arms  nell im here safeall right never was so happy in my life ohh talk about your adventures nell you dear old mother to meive had eenough forever  bo was wild with joy and by turns she laughed and cried but helen could not voice her feelings her eyes were so dim that she could scarcely see dale when he loomed over her as she held bo but he found the hand she put shakily out  nell reckon its been harderon you his voice was earnest and halting she felt his searching gaze upon her face mrs cass said you were here an i know why  roy led them all indoors  milt one of the neighbor boys will take care of thet hoss he said as dale turned toward the dusty and weary ranger whered you leave the cougar  i sent him home replied date  laws now milt if this aint grand cackled mrs cass weve worried some here an miss helen near starved ahopin fer you  mother i reckon the girl an i are nearer starved than anybody you know replied dale with a grim laugh  fer the lands sake ill be fixin supper this minit  nell why are you here asked bo suspiciously  for answer helen led her sister into the spare room and closed the door bo saw the baggage her expression changed the old blaze leaped to the telltale eyes  hes done it she cried hotly  dearestthank god ive got youback again murmured helen finding her voice nothing else matters ive prayed only for that  good old nell whispered bo and she kissed and embraced helen you really mean that i know but nix for yours truly im back alive and kicking you bet wheres mywheres tom  bo not a word has been heard of him for five days hes searching for you of course  and youve beenbeen put off the ranch  well rather replied helen and in a few trembling words she told the story of her eviction  bo uttered a wild word that had more force than elegance but it became her passionate resentment of this outrage done her sister  oh does tom carmichael know this she added breathlessly  how could he  when he finds out thenoh wont there be hell im glad i got here first nell my boots havent been off the whole blessed time help me and oh for some soap and hot water and some clean clothes nell old girl i wasnt raised right for these western deals too luxurious  and then helen had her ears filled with a rapidfire account of running horses and riggs and outlaws and beasley called boldly to his teeth and a long ride and an outlaw who was a heroa fight with riggsblood and deathanother long ridea wild camp in black woodsnightlonely ghostly soundsand day againplota great actress lost to the worldopheliasnakes and ansonshoodooed outlawsmournful moans and terrible criescougarstampedefight and shots more blood and deathwilson heroanother tom carmichaelfallen in love with outlaw gunfighter ifblack night and dale and horse and rides and starved and oh nell he was from texas  helen gathered that wonderful and dreadful events had hung over the bright head of this beloved little sister but the bewilderment occasioned by bos fluent and remarkable utterance left only that last sentence clear  presently helen got a word in to inform bo that mrs cass had knocked twice for supper and that welcome news checked bos flow of speech when nothing else seemed adequate  it was obvious to helen that roy and dale had exchanged stories roy celebrated this reunion by sitting at table the first time since he had been shot and despite helens misfortune and the suspended waiting balance in the air the occasion was joyous old mrs cass was in the height of her glory she sensed a romance here and true to her sex she radiated to it  daylight was still lingering when roy got up and went out on the porch his keen ears had heard something helen fancied she herself had heard rapid hoofbeats  dale come out called roy sharply  the hunter moved with his swift noiseless agility helen and bo followed halting in the door  thets las vegas whispered dale  to helen it seemed that the cowboys name changed the very atmosphere  voices were heard at the gate one that harsh and quick sounded like carmichaels and a spirited horse was pounding and scattering gravel then a lithe figure appeared striding up the path it was carmichaelyet not the carmichael helen knew she heard bos strange little cry a corroboration of her own impression  roy might never have been shot judging from the way he stepped out and dale was almost as quick carmichael reached themgrasped them with swift hard hands  boysi jest rode in an they said youd found her  shore las vegas dale fetched her home safe an sound there she is  the cowboy thrust aside the two men and with a long stride he faced the porch his piercing eyes on the door all that helen could think of his look was that it seemed terrible bo stepped outside in front of helen probably she would have run straight into carmichaels arms if some strange instinct had not withheld her helen judged it to be fear she found her heart lifting painfully  bo he yelled like a savage yet he did not in the least resemble one  ohtom cried bo falteringly she half held out her arms  you girl that seemed to be his piercing query like the quivering blade in his eyes two more long strides carried him close up to her and his look chased the red out of bos cheek then it was beautiful to see his face marvelously change until it was that of the well remembered las vegas magnified in all his old spirit  aw the exclamation was a tremendous sigh i shore am glad  that beautiful flash left his face as he wheeled to the men he wrung dales hand long and hard and his gaze confused the older man  riggs he said and in the jerk of his frame as he whipped out the word disappeared the strange fleeting signs of his kindlier emotion  wilson killed him replied dale  jim wilsonthat old texas ranger reckon he lent you a hand  my friend he saved bo replied dale with emotion my old cougar an mewe just hung round  you made wilson help you cut in the hard voice  yes but he killed riggs before i come up an i reckon hed done well by bo if id never got there  how about the gang  all snuffed out i reckon except wilson  somebody told me beasley hed ran miss helen off the ranch thet so  yes four of his greasers packed her down the hillmost tore her clothes off so roy tells me  four greasers shore it was beasleys deal clean through  yes riggs was led he had an itch for a bad name you know but beasley made the plan it was nell they wanted instead of bo  abruptly carmichael stalked off down the darkening path his silver heelplates ringing his spurs jingling  hold on carmichael called dale taking a step  oh tom cried bo  shore folks callin wont be no use if anythin would be said roy las vegas has hed a look at red liquor  hes been drinking oh that accounts he nevernever even touched me  for once helen was not ready to comfort bo a mighty tug at her heart had sent her with flying uneven steps toward dale he took another stride down the path and another  daleohplease stop she called very low  he halted as if he had run sharply into a bar across the path when he turned helen had come close twilight was deep there in the shade of the peachtrees but she could see his face the hungry flaring eyes  ii havent thanked youyetfor bringing bo home she whispered  nell never mind that he said in surprise if you mustwhy wait ive got to catch up with that cowboy  no let me thank you now she whispered and stepping closer she put her arms up meaning to put them round his neck that action must be her selfpunishment for the other time she had done it yet it might also serve to thank him but strangely her hands got no farther than his breast and fluttered there to catch hold of the fringe of his buckskin jacket she felt a heave of his deep chest  ii do thank youwith all my heart she said softly i owe you nowfor myself and hermore than i can ever repay  nell im your friend he replied hurriedly dont talk of repayin me let me go nowafter las vegas  what for she queried suddenly  i mean to line up beside himat the baror wherever he goes returned dale  dont tell me that i know youre going straight to meet beasley  nell if you hold me up any longer i reckon ill have to runor never get to beasley before that cowboy  helen locked her fingers in the fringe of his jacketleaned closer to him all her being responsive to a bursting gust of blood over her  ill not let you go she said  he laughed and put his great hands over hers what re you sayin girl you cant stop me  yes i can dale i dont want you to risk your life  he stared at her and made as if to tear her hands from their hold  listenpleaseohplease she implored if you go deliberately to kill beasleyand do itthat will be murder its against my religion i would be unhappy all my life  but child youll be ruined all your life if beasley is not dealt withas men of his breed are always dealt with in the west he remonstrated and in one quick move he had freed himself from her clutching fingers  helen with a move as swift put her arms round his neck and clasped her hands tight  milt im finding myself she said the other day when i didthisyou made an excuse for me im not twofaced now  she meant to keep him from killing beasley if she sacrificed every last shred of her pride and she stamped the look of his face on her heart of hearts to treasure always the thrill the beat of her pulses almost obstructed her thought of purpose  nell just nowwhen youre overcomerash with feelinsdont say to mea worda  he broke down huskily  my first friendmyoh dale i know you love me she whispered and she hid her face on his breast there to feel a tremendous tumult  oh dont you she cried in low smothered voice as his silence drove her farther on this mad yet glorious purpose  if you need to be toldyesi reckon i do love you nell rayner he replied  it seemed to helen that he spoke from far off she lifted her face her heart on her lips  if you kill beasley ill never marry you she said  whos expectin you to he asked with low hoarse laugh do you think you have to marry me to square accounts thiss the only time you ever hurt me nell rayner im shamed you could think id expect youout of gratitude  ohyouyou are as dense as the forest where you live she cried and then she shut her eyes again the better to remember that transfiguration of his face the better to betray herself  mani love you full and deep yet tremulous the words burst from her heart that had been burdened with them for many a day  then it seemed in the throbbing riot of her senses that she was lifted and swung into his arms and handled with a great and terrible tenderness and hugged and kissed with the hunger and awkwardness of a bear and held with her feet off the ground and rendered blind dizzy rapturous and frightened and utterly torn asunder from her old calm thinking self  he put her downreleased her  nothin could have made me so happy as what you said he finished with a strong sigh of unutterable wondering joy  then you will not go toto meet  helens happy query froze on her lips  ive got to go he rejoined with his old quiet voice hurry in to bo an dont worry try to think of things as i taught you up in the woods  helen heard his soft padded footfalls swiftly pass away she was left there alone in the darkening twilight suddenly cold and stricken as if turned to stone  thus she stood an agelong moment until the upflashing truth galvanized her into action then she flew in pursuit of dale the truth was that in spite of dales early training in the east and the long years of solitude which had made him wonderful in thought and feeling he had also become a part of this raw bold and violent west  it was quite dark now and she had run quite some distance before she saw dales tall dark form against the yellow light of turners saloon  somehow in that poignant moment when her flying feet kept pace with her heart helen felt in herself a force opposing itself against this raw primitive justice of the west she was one of the first influences emanating from civilized life from law and order in that flash of truth she saw the west as it would be some future time when through women and children these wild frontier days would be gone forever also just as clearly she saw the present need of men like roy beeman and dale and the fireblooded carmichael beasley and his kind must be killed but helen did not want her lover her future husband and the probable father of her children to commit what she held to be murder  at the door of the saloon she caught up with dale  miltohwaitwait she panted  she heard him curse under his breath as he turned they were alone in the yellow flare of light horses were champing bits and drooping before the rails  you go back ordered dale sternly his face was pale his eyes were gleaming  no not tillyou take meor carry me she replied resolutely with all a womans positive and inevitable assurance  then he laid hold of her with ungentle hands his violence especially the look on his face terrified helen rendered her weak but nothing could have shaken her resolve she felt victory her sex her love and her presence would be too much for dale  as he swung helen around the low hum of voices inside the saloon suddenly rose to sharp hoarse roars accompanied by a scuffling of feet and crashing of violently sliding chairs or tables dale let go of helen and leaped toward the door but a silence inside quicker and stranger than the roar halted him helens heart contracted then seemed to cease beating there was absolutely not a perceptible sound even the horses appeared like dale to have turned to statues  two thundering shots annihilated this silence then quickly came a lighter shotthe smash of glass dale ran into the saloon the horses began to snort to rear to pound a low muffled murmur terrified helen even as it drew her dashing at the door she swung it in and entered  the place was dim bluehazed smelling of smoke dale stood just inside the door on the floor lay two men chairs and tables were overturned a motley dark shirtsleeved booted and belted crowd of men appeared hunched against the opposite wall with pale set faces turned to the bar turner the proprietor stood at one end his face livid his hands aloft and shaking carmichael leaned against the middle of the bar he held a gun low down it was smoking  with a gasp helen flashed her eyes back to dale he had seen herwas reaching an arm toward her then she saw the man lying almost at her feet jeff mulveyher uncles old foreman his face was awful to behold a smoking gun lay near his inert hand the other man had fallen on his face his garb proclaimed him a mexican he was not yet dead then helen as she felt dales arm encircle her looked farther because she could not prevent itlooked on at that strange figure against the barthis boy who had been such a friend in her hour of needthis naive and frank sweetheart of her sisters  she saw a man nowwild white intense as fire with some terrible cool kind of deadliness in his mien his left elbow rested upon the bar and his hand held a glass of red liquor the big gun low down in his other hand seemed as steady as if it were a fixture  heahs to thethalfbreed beasley an his outfit  carmichael drank while his flaming eyes held the crowd then with savage action of terrible passion he flung the glass at the quivering form of the still living mexican on the floor  helen felt herself slipping all seemed to darken around her she could not see dale though she knew he held her then she fainted    chapter xxv  las vegas carmichael was a product of his day  the pan handle of texas the old chisholm trail along which were driven the great cattle herds northward fort dodge where the cowboys conflicted with the cardsharpsthese hard places had left their marks on carmichael to come from texas was to come from fighting stock and a cowboys life was strenuous wild violent and generally brief the exceptions were the fortunate and the swiftest men with guns and they drifted from south to north and west taking with them the reckless chivalrous vitriolic spirit peculiar to their breed  the pioneers and ranchers of the frontier would never have made the west habitable had it not been for these wild cowboys these harddrinking hardriding hardliving rangers of the barrens these easy cool laconic simple young men whose blood was tinged with fire and who possessed a magnificent and terrible effrontery toward danger and death  las vegas ran his horse from widow casss cottage to turners saloon and the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door las vegass entrance was a leap then he stood still with the door ajar and the horse pounding and snorting back all the men in that saloon who saw the entrance of las vegas knew what it portended no thunderbolt could have more quickly checked the drinking gambling talking crowd they recognized with kindred senses the nature of the man and his arrival for a second the bluehazed room was perfectly quiet then men breathed moved rose and suddenly caused a quick sliding crash of chairs and tables  the cowboys glittering eyes flashed to and fro and then fixed on mulvey and his mexican companion that glance singled out these two and the sudden rush of nervous men proved it mulvey and the sheepherder were left alone in the center of the floor  howdy jeff wheres your boss asked las vegas his voice was cool friendly his manner was easy natural but the look of him was what made mulvey pale and the mexican livid  reckon hes home replied mulvey  home whats he call home now  hes hangin out hyar at auchinclosss replied mulvey his voice was not strong but his eyes were steady watchful  las vegas quivered all over as if stung a flame that seemed white and red gave his face a singular hue  jeff you worked for old al a long time an ive heard of your differences said las vegas thet aint no mix of mine but you doublecrossed miss helen  mulvey made no attempt to deny this he gulped slowly his hands appeared less steady and he grew paler again las vegass words signified less than his look and that look now included the mexican  pedro youre one of beasleys old hands said las vegas accusingly anyou was one of them four greasers thet  here the cowboy choked and bit over his words as if they were a material poison the mexican showed his guilt and cowardice he began to jabber  shet up hissed las vegas with a savage and significant jerk of his arm as if about to strike but that action was read for its true meaning pellmell the crowd split to rush each way and leave an open space behind the three  las vegas waited but mulvey seemed obstructed the mexican looked dangerous through his fear his fingers twitched as if the tendons running up into his arms were being pulled  an instant of suspensemore than long enough for mulvey to be tried and found wantingand las vegas with laugh and sneer turned his back upon the pair and stepped to the bar his call for a bottle made turner jump and hold it out with shaking hands las vegas poured out a drink while his gaze was intent on the scarred old mirror hanging behind the bar  this turning his back upon men he had just dared to draw showed what kind of a school las vegas had been trained in if those men had been worthy antagonists of his class he would never have scorned them as it was when mulvey and the mexican jerked at their guns las vegas swiftly wheeled and shot twice mulveys gun went off as he fell and the mexican doubled up in a heap on the floor then las vegas reached around with his left hand for the drink he had poured out  at this juncture dale burst into the saloon suddenly to check his impetus to swerve aside toward the bar and halt the door had not ceased swinging when again it was propelled inward this time to admit helen rayner white and wideeyed  in another moment then las vegas had spoken his deadly toast to beasleys gang and had fiercely flung the glass at the writhing mexican on the floor also dale had gravitated toward the reeling helen to catch her when she fainted  las vegas began to curse and striding to dale he pushed him out of the saloon   what re you doin heah he yelled stridently hevnt you got thet girl to think of then do it you big indian lettin her run after you heahriskin herself thet way you take care of her an bo an leave this deal to me  the cowboy furious as he was at dale yet had keen swift eyes for the horses near at hand and the men out in the dim light dale lifted the girl into his arms and turning without a word stalked away to disappear in the darkness las vegas holding his gun low returned to the barroom if there had been any change in the crowd it was slight the tension had relaxed turner no longer stood with hands up  youall go on with your fun called the cowboy with a sweep of his gun but itd be risky fer any one to start leavin  with that he backed against the bar near where the black bottle stood turner walked out to begin righting tables and chairs and presently the crowd with some caution and suspense resumed their games and drinking it was significant that a wide berth lay between them and the door from time to time turner served liquor to men who called for it  las vegas leaned with back against the bar after a while he sheathed his gun and reached around for the bottle he drank with his piercing eyes upon the door no one entered and no one went out the games of chance there and the drinking were not enjoyed it was a hard scenethat smoky long illsmelling room with its dim yellow lights and dark evil faces with the stealthystepping turner passing to and fro and the dead mulvey staring in horrible fixidity at the ceiling and the mexican quivering more and more until he shook violently then lay still and with the drinking somber waiting cowboy more fiery and more flaming with every drink listening for a step that did not come  time passed and what little change it wrought was in the cowboy drink affected him but he did not become drunk it seemed that the liquor he drank was consumed by a mounting fire it was fuel to a driving passion he grew more sullen somber brooding redder of eye and face more crouching and restless at last when the hour was so late that there was no probability of beasley appearing las vegas flung himself out of the saloon  all lights of the village had now been extinguished the tired horses drooped in the darkness las vegas found his horse and led him away down the road and out a lane to a field where a barn stood dim and dark in the starlight morning was not far off he unsaddled the horse and turning him loose went into the barn here he seemed familiar with his surroundings for he found a ladder and climbed to a loft where he threw himself on the hay  he rested but did not sleep at daylight he went down and brought his horse into the barn sunrise found las vegas pacing to and fro the short length of the interior and peering out through wide cracks between the boards then during the succeeding couple of hours he watched the occasional horseman and wagon and herder that passed on into the village  about the breakfast hour las vegas saddled his horse and rode back the way he had come the night before at turners he called for something to eat as well as for whisky after that he became a listening watching machine he drank freely for an hour then he stopped he seemed to be drunk but with a different kind of drunkenness from that usual in drinking men savage fierce sullen he was one to avoid turner waited on him in evident fear  at length las vegass condition became such that action was involuntary he could not stand still nor sit down stalking out he passed the store where men slouched back to avoid him and he went down the road wary and alert as if he expected a rifleshot from some hidden enemy upon his return down that main thoroughfare of the village not a person was to be seen he went in to turners the proprietor was there at his post nervous and pale las vegas did not order any more liquor  turner i reckon ill bore you next time i run in heah he said and stalked out  he had the stores the road the village to himself and he patrolled a beat like a sentry watching for an indian attack  toward noon a single man ventured out into the road to accost the cowboy  las vegas im tellin youall the greasers air leavin the range he said  howdy abe replied las vegas what n hell you talkin about  the man repeated his information and las vegas spat out frightful curses  abeyou heah what beasleys doin  yes hes with his menup at the ranch reckon he cant put off ridin down much longer  that was where the west spoke beasley would be forced to meet the enemy who had come out singlehanded against him long before this hour a braver man would have come to face las vegas beasley could not hire any gang to bear the brunt of this situation this was the test by which even his own men must judge him all of which was to say that as the wildness of the west had made possible his crimes so it now held him responsible for them  abe if thetgreaser dont rustle down heah im goin after him  sure but dont be in no hurry replied abe  im waltzin to slow music gimme a smoke  with fingers that slightly trembled abe rolled a cigarette lit it from his own and handed it to the cowboy  las vegas i reckon i hear hosses he said suddenly  me too replied las vegas with his head high like that of a listening deer apparently he forgot the cigarette and also his friend abe hurried back to the store where he disappeared  las vegas began his stalking up and down and his action now was an exaggeration of all his former movements a rational ordinary mortal from some eastern community happening to meet this redfaced cowboy would have considered him drunk or crazy probably las vegas looked both but all the same he was a marvelously keen and strung and efficient instrument to meet the portending issue how many thousands of times on the trails and in the widestreeted little towns all over the west had this stalk of the cowboys been perpetrated violent bloody tragic as it was it had an importance in that pioneer day equal to the use of a horse or the need of a plow  at length pine was apparently a deserted village except for las vegas who patrolled his long beat in many wayshe lounged while he watched he stalked like a mountaineer he stole along indian fashion stealthily from tree to tree from corner to corner he disappeared in the saloon to reappear at the back he slipped round behind the barns to come out again in the main road and time after time he approached his horse as if deciding to mount  the last visit he made into turners saloon he found no one there savagely he pounded on the bar with his gun he got no response then the longpentup rage burst with wild whoops he pulled another gun and shot at the mirror the lamps he shot the neck off a bottle and drank till he choked his neck corded bulging and purple his only slow and deliberate action was the reloading of his gun then he crashed through the doors and with a wild yell leaped sheer into the saddle hauling his horse up high and goading him to plunge away  men running to the door and windows of the store saw a streak of dust flying down the road and then they trooped out to see it disappear the hour of suspense ended for them las vegas had lived up to the code of the west had dared his man out had waited far longer than needful to prove that man a coward whatever the issue now beasley was branded forever that moment saw the decline of whatever power he had wielded he and his men might kill the cowboy who had ridden out alone to face him but that would not change the brand  the preceding night beasley bad been finishing a late supper at his newly acquired ranch when buck weaver one of his men burst in upon him with news of the death of mulvey and pedro  whos in the outfit how many he had questioned quickly  its a oneman outfit boss replied weaver  beasley appeared astounded he and his men had prepared to meet the friends of the girl whose property he had taken over and because of the superiority of his own force he had anticipated no bloody or extended feud this amazing circumstance put the case in very much more difficult form  one man he ejaculated  yep thet cowboy las vegas an boss he turns out to be a gunslinger from texas i was in turners hed jest happened to step in the other room when las vegas come bustin in on his hoss an jumped off fust thing he called jeff an pedro they both showed yaller an then damn if thet cowboy didnt turn his back on them an went to the bar fer a drink but he was lookin in the mirror an when jeff an pedro went fer their guns why he whirled quick as lightnin an bored them both i sneaked out an  why didnt you bore him roared beasley  buck weaver steadily eyed his boss before he replied i aint takin shots at any fellar from behind doors an as fer meetin las vegasexcoose me boss ive still a hankerin fer sunshine an red liquor besides i aint got nothin agin las vegas if hes rustled over here at the head of a crowd to put us off id fight jest as wed all fight but you see we figgered wrong its between you an las vegas you oughter seen him throw thet hunter dale out of turners  dale did he come queried beasley  he got there just after the cowboy plugged jeff an thet bigeyed girl she came runnin in too an she keeled over in dales arms las vegas shoved him outcussed him so hard we all heerd so beasley there aint no fight comin off as we figgered on  beasley thus heard the west speak out of the mouth of his own man and grim sardonic almost scornful indeed were the words of buck weaver this rider had once worked for al auchincloss and had deserted to beasley under mulveys leadership mulvey was dead and the situation was vastly changed  beasley gave weaver a dark lowering glance and waved him away from the door weaver sent back a doubtful scrutinizing gaze then slouched out that gaze beasley had not encountered before  it meant as weavers cronies meant as beasleys longfaithful riders and the people of the range and as the spirit of the west meant that beasley was expected to march down into the village to face his single foe  but beasley did not go instead he paced to and fro the length of helen rayners long sittingroom with the nervous energy of a man who could not rest many times he hesitated and at others he made sudden movements toward the door only to halt long after midnight he went to bed but not to sleep he tossed and rolled all night and at dawn arose gloomy and irritable  he cursed the mexican servingwomen who showed their displeasure at his authority and to his amaze and rage not one of his men came to the house he waited and waited then he stalked off to the corrals and stables carrying a rifle with him the men were there in a group that dispersed somewhat at his advent not a mexican was in sight  beasley ordered the horses to be saddled and all hands to go down into the village with him that order was disobeyed beasley stormed and raged his riders sat or lounged with lowered faces an unspoken hostility seemed present those who had been longest with him were least distant and strange but still they did not obey at length beasley roared for his mexicans  boss we gotta tell you thet every greaser on the ranch hes slopedgone these two hourson the way to magdalena said buck weaver  of all these suddenuprising perplexities this latest was the most astounding beasley cursed with his questioning wonder  boss they was sure scared of thet gunslingin cowboy from texas replied weaver imperturbably  beasleys dark swarthy face changed its hue what of the subtle reflection in weavers slow speech one of the men came out of a corral leading beasleys saddled and bridled horse this fellow dropped the bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word no one spoke the presence of the horse was significant with a snarling muttered curse beasley took up his rifle and strode back to the ranchhouse  in his rage and passion he did not realize what his men had known for hoursthat if he had stood any chance at all for their respect as well as for his life the hour was long past  beasley avoided the open paths to the house and when he got there he nervously poured out a drink evidently something in the fiery liquor frightened him for he threw the bottle aside it was as if that bottle contained a courage which was false  again he paced the long sittingroom growing more and more wroughtup as evidently he grew familiar with the singular state of affairs twice the pale servingwoman called him to dinner  the diningroom was light and pleasant and the meal fragrant and steaming was ready for him but the women had disappeared beasley seated himselfspread out his big hands on the table  then a slight rustlea clink of spurstartled him he twisted his head  howdy beasley said las vegas who had appeared as if by magic  beasleys frame seemed to swell as if a flood had been loosed in his veins sweatdrops stood out on his pallid face  whatyouwant he asked huskily  wal now my boss miss helen says seein i am foreman heah thet itd be nice an proper fer me to drop in an eat with youthe last time replied the cowboy his drawl was slow and cool his tone was friendly and pleasant but his look was that of a falcon ready to drive deep its beak  beasleys reply was loud incoherent hoarse  las vegas seated himself across from beasley  eat or not its shore all the same to me said las vegas and he began to load his plate with his left hand his right hand rested very lightly with just the tips of his vibrating fingers on the edge of the table and he never for the slightest fraction of a second took his piercing eyes off beasley  wal my halfbreed greaser guest it shore roils up my blood to see you sittin therethinkin youve put my boss miss helen

radiance his right hand began to quiver more and more  illdoubleit panted beasley illmake overhalf the ranchall the stock  swaller thet yelled las vegas with terrible strident ferocity  listenman i takeit back ill give upauchinclosss ranch beasley was now a shaking whispering frenzied man ghastly white with rolling eyes  las vegass left fist pounded hard on the table  greaser come on he thundered  then beasley with desperate frantic action jerked for his gun    chapter xxvi  for helen rayner that brief dark period of expulsion from her home had become a thing of the past almost forgotten  two months had flown by on the wings of love and work and the joy of finding her place there in the west all her old men had been only too glad of the opportunity to come back to her and under dale and roy beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch  helen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of rooms and adding a new section only once had she ventured into the old diningroom where las vegas carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner for beasley she made a storeroom of it and a place she would never again enter  helen was happy almost too happy she thought and therefore made more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of life carmichael had ridden out of pine ostensibly on the trail of the mexicans who had executed beasleys commands the last seen of him had been reported from show down where he had appeared redeyed and dangerous like a hound on a scent then two months had flown by without a word  dale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboys absence it would be just like las vegas never to be heard of again also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his drunken savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by his friends bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than helen but bo grew more restless wilder and more wilful than ever helen thought she guessed bos secret and once she ventured a hint concerning carmichaels return  if tom doesnt come back pretty soon ill marry milt dale retorted bo tauntingly  this fired helens cheeks with red  but child she protested half angry half grave milt and i are engaged  sure only youre so slow theres many a slipyou know  bo i tell you tom will come back replied helen earnestly i feel it there was something fine in that cowboy he understood me better than you or milt either and he was perfectly wild in love with you  oh was he  very much more than you deserved bo rayner  then occurred one of bos sweet bewildering unexpected transformations her defiance resentment rebelliousness vanished from a softly agitated face  oh nell i know that you just watch me if i ever get another chance at him thenmaybe hed never drink again  bo be happyand be good dont ride off any moredont tease the boys itll all come right in the end  bo recovered her equanimity quickly enough  humph you can afford to be cheerful youve got a man who cant live when youre out of his sight hes like a fish on dry land and youwhy once you were an old pessimist  bo was not to be consoled or changed helen could only sigh and pray that her convictions would be verified   the first day of july brought an early thunderstorm just at sunrise it roared and flared and rolled away leaving a gorgeous golden cloud pageant in the sky and a fresh sweetly smelling glistening green range that delighted helens eye  birds were twittering in the arbors and bees were humming in the flowers from the fields down along the brook came a blended song of swampblackbird and meadowlark a clarionvoiced burro split the air with his coarse and homely bray the sheep were bleating and a soft baa of little lambs came sweetly to helens ears she went her usual rounds with more than usual zest and thrill everywhere was color activity life the wind swept warm and pinescented down from the mountain heights now black and bold and the great green slopes seemed to call to her  at that very moment she came suddenly upon dale in his shirtsleeves dusty and hot standing motionless gazing at the distant mountains helens greeting startled him  ii was just looking away yonder he said smiling she thrilled at the clear wonderful light of his eyes  so was ia moment ago she replied wistfully do you miss the forestvery much  nell i miss nothing but id like to ride with you under the pines once more  well go she cried  when he asked eagerly  ohsoon and then with flushed face and downcast eyes she passed on for long helen had cherished a fond hope that she might be married in paradise park where she had fallen in love with dale and had realized herself but she had kept that hope secret dales eager tone his flashing eyes had made her feel that her secret was there in her telltale face  as she entered the lane leading to the house she encountered one of the new stableboys driving a packmule  jim whose pack is that she asked  maam i dunno but i heard him tell roy he reckoned his name was mud replied the boy smiling  helens heart gave a quick throb that sounded like las vegas she hurried on and upon entering the courtyard she espied roy beeman holding the halter of a beautiful wildlooking mustang there was another horse with another man who was in the act of dismounting on the far side when he stepped into better view helen recognized las vegas and he saw her at the same instant  helen did not look up again until she was near the porch she had dreaded this meeting yet she was so glad that she could have cried aloud  miss helen i shore am glad to see you he said standing bareheaded before her the same young frankfaced cowboy she had seen first from the train  tom she exclaimed and offered her hands  he wrung them hard while he looked at her the swift womans glance helen gave in return seemed to drive something dark and doubtful out of her heart this was the same boy she had knownwhom she had liked so wellwho had won her sisters love helen imagined facing him thus was like awakening from a vague nightmare of doubt carmichaels face was clean fresh young with its healthy tan it wore the old glad smile cool easy and natural his eyes were like dalespenetrating clear as crystal without a shadow what had evil drink blood to do with the real inherent nobility of this splendid specimen of western hardihood wherever he had been whatever he had done during that long absence he had returned long separated from that wild and savage character she could now forget perhaps there would never again be call for it  hows my girl he asked just as naturally as if he had been gone a few days on some errand of his employers  bo oh shes wellfine ii rather think shell be glad to see you replied helen warmly  an hows thet big indian dale he drawled  well tooim sure  reckon i got back heah in time to see youall married  ii assure you ino one around here has been married yet replied helen with a blush  thet shore is fine was some worried he said lazily ive been chasin wild hosses over in new mexico an i got after this heah blue roan he kept me chasin him fer a spell ive fetched him back for bo  helen looked at the mustang roy was holding to be instantly delighted he was a roan almost blue in color neither large nor heavy but powerfully built cleanlimbed and racy with a long mane and tail black as coal and a beautiful head that made helen love him at once  well im jealous declared helen archly i never did see such a pony  i reckoned youd never ride any hoss but ranger said las vegas  no i never will but i can be jealous anyhow cant i  shore an i reckon if you say youre goin to have himwal bo d be funny he drawled  i reckon she would be funny retorted helen she was so happy that she imitated his speech she wanted to hug him it was too good to be truethe return of this cowboy he understood her he had come back with nothing that could alienate her he had apparently forgotten the terrible role he had accepted and the doom he had meted out to her enemies that moment was wonderful for helen in its revelation of the strange significance of the west as embodied in this cowboy he was great but he did not know that  then the door of the livingroom opened and a sweet high voice pealed out  roy oh what a mustang whose is he  wal bo if all i hear is so he belongs to you replied roy with a huge grin  bo appeared in the door she stepped out upon the porch she saw the cowboy the excited flash of her pretty face vanished as she paled  bo i shore am glad to see you drawled las vegas as he stepped forward sombrero in hand helen could not see any sign of confusion in him but indeed she saw gladness then she expected to behold bo run right into the cowboyss arms it appeared however that she was doomed to disappointment  tom im glad to see you she replied  they shook hands as old friends  youre lookin right fine he said  oh im well and how have you been these six months she queried  reckon i though it was longer he drawled wal im pretty tiptop now but i was laid up with heart trouble for a spell  heart trouble she echoed dubiously  shore i ate too much over heah in new mexico  its no news to mewhere your hearts located laughed bo then she ran off the porch to see the blue mustang she walked round and round him clasping her hands in sheer delight  bo hes a plumb dandy said roy never seen a prettier hoss hell run like a streak an hes got good eyes hell be a pet some day but i reckon hell always be spunky  bo ventured to step closer and at last got a hand on the mustang and then another she smoothed his quivering neck and called softly to him until he submitted to her hold  whats his name she asked  blue somethin or other replied roy  tom has my new mustang a name asked bo turning to the cowboy  shore  what then  wal i named him bluebo answered las vegas with a smile  blueboy  nope hes named after you an i chased him roped him broke him all myself  very well bluebo he is then and hes a wonderful darling horse oh nell just look at him tom i cant thank you enough  reckon i dont want any thanks drawled the cowboy but see heah bo you shore got to live up to conditions before you ride him  what exclaimed bo who was startled by his slow cool meaning tone of voice  helen delighted in looking at las vegas then he had never appeared to better advantage so cool careless and assured he seemed master of a situation in which his terms must be accepted yet he might have been actuated by a cowboy motive beyond the power of helen to divine  bo rayner drawled las vegas thet blue mustang will be yours an you can ride himwhen youre mrs tom carmichael  never had he spoken a softer more drawling speech nor gazed at bo more mildly roy seemed thunderstruck helen endeavored heroically to restrain her delicious bursting glee bos wide eyes stared at her loverdarkeneddilated suddenly she left the mustang to confront the cowboy where he lounged on the porch steps  do you mean that she cried  shore do  bah its only a magnificent bluff she retorted youre only in fun its youryour darned nerve  why bo began las vegas reproachfully you shore know im not the fourflusher kind never got away with a bluff in my life an im jest in daid earnest aboot this heah  all the same signs were not wanting in his mobile face that he was almost unable to restrain his mirth  helen realized then that bo saw through the cowboythat the ultimatum was only one of his tricks  it is a bluff and i call you declared bo ringingly  las vegas suddenly awoke to consequences he essayed to speak but she was so wonderful then so white and blazingeyed that he was stricken mute  ill ride bluebo this afternoon deliberately stated the girl  las vegas had wit enough to grasp her meaning and he seemed about to collapse  very well you can make me mrs tom carmichael todaythis morningjust before dinner go get a preacher to marry usand make yourself look a more presentable bridegroomunless it was only a bluff  her imperiousness changed as the tremendous portent of her words seemed to make las vegas a blank stone image of a man with a wildrose color suffusing her face she swiftly bent over him kissed him and flashed away into the house her laugh pealed back and it thrilled helen so deep and strange was it for the wilful sister so wild and merry and full of joy  it was then that roy beeman recovered from his paralysis to let out such a roar of mirth as to frighten the horses helen was laughing and crying too but laughing mostly las vegas carmichael was a sight for the gods to behold bos kiss had unclamped what had bound him the sudden truth undeniable insupportable glorious made him a madman  bluffshe called meride bluebo safternoon he raved reaching wildly for helen mrstomcarmichaelbefore dinnerpreacherpresentable bridegroom aw im drunk again iwho swore off forever  no tom youre just happy said helen  between her and roy the cowboy was at length persuaded to accept the situation and to see his wonderful opportunity  nownow miss helenwhatd bo mean by prepresentable bridegroom

preacher replied roy now earnestly you didnt know thet but i am an i can marry you an bo as good as any one an tighter n most  las vegas reached for his friend as a drowning man might have reached for solid rock  roy can you really marry themwith my bibleand the service of my church asked helen a happy hope flushing her face  wal indeed i can ive married more n one couple whose religion wasnt mine  bbbeforedddinner burst out las vegas like a stuttering idiot  i reckon come on now an make yourself presenttible said roy miss helen you tell bo thet its all settled  he picked up the halter on the blue mustang and turned away toward the corrals las vegas put the bridle of his horse over his arm and seemed to be following in a trance with his dazed rapt face held high  bring dale called helen softly after them   so it came about as naturally as it was wonderful that bo rode the blue mustang before the afternoon ended  las vegas disobeyed his first orders from mrs tom carmichael and rode out after her toward the greenrising range helen seemed impelled to follow she did not need to ask dale the second time they rode swiftly but never caught up with bo and las vegas whose riding resembled their happiness  dale read helens mind or else his own thoughts were in harmony with hers for he always seemed to speak what she was thinking and as they rode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare a few days to visit his old camp  and take boand tom oh of all things id like to she replied  yesan roy too added dale significantly  of course said helen lightly as if she had not caught his meaning but she turned her eyes away while her heart thumped disgracefully and all her body was aglow will tom and bo go  it was tom who got me to ask you replied dale john an hal can look after the men while were gone  ohso tom put it in your head i guessmaybei wont go  it is always in my mind nell he said with his slow seriousness im goin to work all my life for you but ill want to an need to go back to the woods often an if you ever stoop to marry mean make me the richest of menyoull have to marry me up there where i fell in love with you  ah did las vegas tom carmichael say that too inquired helen softly  nell do you want to know what las vegas said  by all means  he said thisan not an hour ago milt old hoss let me give you a hunch im a man of family nowan ive been a devil with the wimmen in my day i can see through em dont marry nell rayner in or near the house where i killed beasley shed remember an dont let her remember thet day go off into the woods paradise park bo an me will go with you  helen gave him her hand while they walked the horses homeward in the long sunset shadows in the fullness of that happy hour she had time for a grateful wonder at the keen penetration of the cowboy carmichael dale had saved her life but it was las vegas who had saved her happiness   not many days later when again the afternoon shadows were slanting low helen rode out upon the promontory where the dim trail zigzagged far above paradise park  roy was singing as he drove the packburros down the slope bo and las vegas were trying to ride the trail two abreast so they could hold hands dale had dismounted to stand beside helens horse as she gazed down the shaggy black slopes to the beautiful wild park with its gray meadows and shining ribbons of brooks  it was july and there were no goldenred glorious flames and blazes of color such as lingered in helens memory black spruce slopes and green pines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark outcroppings of rockthese colors and forms greeted her gaze with all the old enchantment wildness beauty and loneliness were there the same as ever immutable like the spirit of those heights  helen would fain have lingered longer but the others called and ranger impatiently snorted his sense of the grass and water far below and she knew that when she climbed there again to the wide outlook she would be another woman  nell come on said dale as he led on its better to look up   the sun had just sunk behind the ragged fringe of mountainrim when those three strong and efficient men of the open had pitched camp and had prepared a bountiful supper then roy beeman took out the little worn bible which helen had given him to use when he married bo and as he opened it a light changed his dark face  come helen an dale he said  they arose to stand before him and he married them there under the great stately pines with the fragrant blue smoke curling upward and the wind singing through the branches while the waterfall murmured its low soft dreamy music and from the dark slope came the wild lonely cry of a wolf full of the hunger for life and a mate  let us pray said roy as he closed the bible and knelt with them  there is only one god an him i beseech in my humble office for the woman an man i have just wedded in holy bonds bless them an watch them an keep them through all the comin years bless the sons of this strong man of the woods an make them like him with love an understandin of the source from which life comes bless the daughters of this woman an send with them more of her love an soul which must be the softenin an the salvation of the hard west o lord blaze the dim dark trail for them through the unknown forest of life o lord lead the way across the naked range of the future no mortal knows we ask in thy name amen  when the preacher stood up again and raised the couple from their kneeling posture it seemed that a grave and solemn personage had left him this young man was again the darkfaced cleareyed roy droll and dry with the enigmatic smile on his lips  mrs dale he said taking her hands i wish you joy an now after this here my crownin service in your behalfi reckon ill claim a reward  then he kissed her bo came next with her warm and loving felicitations and the cowboy with characteristic action also made at helen  nell shore its the only chance ill ever have to kiss you he drawled because when this heah big indian once finds out what kissin is  las vegas then proved how swift and hearty he could be upon occasions all this left helen red and confused and unutterably happy she appreciated dales state his eyes reflected the precious treasure which manifestly he saw but realization of ownership had not yet become demonstrable  then with gay speech and happy laugh and silent look these five partook of the supper when it was finished roy made known his intention to leave they all protested and coaxed but to no avail he only laughed and went on saddling his horse  roy please stay implored helen the days almost ended youre tired  nope ill never be no third party when theres only two  but there are four of us  didnt i just make you an dale one an mrs dale you forget ive been married more n once  helen found herself confronted by an unanswerable side of the argument las vegas rolled on the grass in his mirth dale looked strange  roy then thats why youre so nice said bo with a little devil in her eyes do you know i had my mind made up if tom hadnt come around i was going to make up to you roy i sure was what number wife would i have been  it always took bo to turn the tables on anybody roy looked mightily embarrassed and the laugh was on him he did not face them again until he had mounted  las vegas ive done my best for youhitched you to thet blueeyed girl the best i know how he declared but i shore aint guaranteein nothin youd better build a corral for her  why roy you shore dont savvy the way to break these wild ones drawled las vegas bo will be eatin out of my hand in about a week  bos blue eyes expressed an eloquent doubt as to this extraordinary claim  goodby friends said roy and rode away to disappear in the spruces  thereupon bo and las vegas forgot roy and dale and helen the camp chores to be done and everything else except themselves helens first wifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her husband with the work of cleaning up after the sumptuous supper before they had finished a sound startled them it came from roy evidently high on the darkening slope and was a long mellow pealing halloo that rang on the cool air burst the dreamy silence and rapped across from slope to slope and cliff to cliff to lose its power and die away hauntingly in the distant recesses  dale shook his head as if he did not care to attempt a reply to that beautiful call silence once again enfolded the park and twilight seemed to be born of the air drifting downward  nell do you miss anythin asked dale  no nothing in all the world she murmured i am happier than i ever dared pray to be  i dont mean people or things i mean my pets  ah i had forgotten milt where are they  gone back to the wild he said they had to live in my absence an ive been away long  just then the brooding silence with its soft murmur of falling water and faint sigh of wind in the pines was broken by a piercing scream high quivering like that of a woman in exquisite agony  thats tom exclaimed dale  ohi was soso frightened whispered helen  bo came running with las vegas at her heels  milt that was your tame cougar cried bo excitedly oh ill never forget him ill hear those cries in my dreams  yes it was tom said dale thoughtfully but i never heard him cry just like that  oh call him in  dale whistled and called but tom did not come then the hunter stalked off in the gloom to call from different points under the slope after a while he returned without the cougar and at that moment from far up the dark ravine drifted down the same wild cry only changed by distance strange and tragic in its meaning  he scented us he remembers but hell never come back said dale   helen felt stirred anew with the convictions of dales deep knowledge of life and nature and her imagination seemed to have wings how full and perfect her trust her happiness in the realization that her love and her future her children and perhaps grandchildren would come under the guidance of such a man only a little had she begun to comprehend the secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature ages before men had lived on the earth there had been the creatures of the wilderness and the holes of the rocks and the nests of the trees and rain frost heat dew sunlight and night storm and calm the honey of the wildflower and the instinct of the beeall the beautiful and multiple forms of life with their inscrutable design to know something of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of earthperhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven for whatever breathed and moved was a part of that creation the coo of the dove the lichen on the mossy rock the mourn of a hunting wolf and the murmur of the waterfall the evergreen and growing tips of the spruces and the thunderbolts along the battlements of the heightsthese one and all must be actuated by the great spiritthat incalculable thing in the universe which had produced man and soul  and there in the starlight under the widegnarled pines sighing low with the wind helen sat with dale on the old stone that an avalanche of a million years past had flung from the rampart above to serve as camptable and bench for lovers in the wilderness the sweet scent of spruce mingled with the fragrance of woodsmoke blown in their faces how white the stars and calm and true how they blazed their single task a coyote yelped off on the south slope dark now as midnight a bit of weathered rock rolled and tapped from shelf to shelf and the wind moaned helen felt all the sadness and mystery and nobility of this lonely fastness and full on her heart rested the supreme consciousness that all would some day be well with the troubled world beyond  nell ill homestead this park said dale then itll always be ours  homestead whats that murmured helen dreamily the word sounded sweet  the government will give land to men who locate an build replied dale well run up a log cabin  and come here often paradise park whispered helen  dales first kisses were on her lips then hard and cool and clean like the life of the man singularly exalting to her completing her womans strange and unutterable joy of the hour and rendering her mute  bos melodious laugh and her voice with its old mockery of torment drifted softly on the night breeze and the cowboys aw bo drawling his reproach and longing was all that the tranquil waiting silence needed  paradise park was living again one of its romances love was no stranger to that lonely fastness helen heard in the whisper of the wind through the pine the oldearth story beautiful ever new and yet eternal she thrilled to her depths the sparpointed spruces stood up black and clear against the noble stars all that vast solitude breathed and waited charged full with its secret ready to reveal itself to her tremulous soul
