45562249	the secret places of the heart   by h g wells   1922    contents       chapter       1 the consultation       2 lady hardy       3 the departure       4 at maidenhead       5 in the land of the forgotten peoples       6 the encounter at stonehenge       7 companionship       8 full moon       9 the last days of sir richmond hardy     the secret places of the heart     chapter the first  the consultation  section 1  the maid was a young woman of great natural calmness she was accustomed to let in visitors who had this air of being annoyed and finding one umbrella too numerous for them it mattered nothing to her that the gentleman was asking for dr martineau as if he was asking for something with an unpleasant taste almost imperceptibly she relieved him of his umbrella and juggled his hat and coat on to a massive mahogany stand what name sir she asked holding open the door of the consulting room  hardy said the gentleman and then yielding it reluctantly with its distasteful threeyearold honour sir richmond hardy  the door closed softly behind him and he found himself in undivided possession of the large indifferent apartment in which the nervous and mental troubles of the outer world eddied for a time on their way to the distinguished specialist a bowl of daffodils a handsome bookcase containing bound victorian magazines and antiquated medical works some paintings of scotch scenery three big armchairs a buhl clock and a bronze dancing faun by their want of any collective idea enhanced rather than mitigated the promiscuous disregard of the room he drifted to the midmost of the three windows and stared out despondently at harley street  for a minute or so he remained as still and limp as an empty jacket on its peg and then a gust of irritation stirred him  damned fool i was to come here he said damned fool  rush out of the place  ive given my name  he heard the door behind him open and for a moment pretended not to hear then he turned round i dont see what you can do for me he said  im sure i dont said the doctor people come here and talk  there was something reassuringly inaggressive about the figure that confronted sir richmond dr martineaus height wanted at least three inches of sir richmonds five feet eleven he was humanly plump his face was round and pink and cheerfully wistful a little suggestive of the full moon of what the full moon might be if it could get fresh air and exercise either his tailor had made his trousers too short or he had braced them too high so that he seemed to have grown out of them quite recently sir richmond had been dreading an encounter with some dominating and mesmeric personality this amiable presence dispelled his preconceived resistances  dr martineau a little out of breath as though he had been running upstairs with his hands in his trouser pockets seemed intent only on disavowals people come here and talk it does them good and sometimes i am able to offer a suggestion  talking to someone who understands a little he expanded the idea  im jangling damnablyoverwork  not overwork dr martineau corrected not overwork overwork never hurt anyone fatigue stops that a man can workgood straightforward work without internal resistance until he dropsand never hurt himself you must be working against friction  friction im like a machine without oil im grinding to death and its so damned important i shouldnt break down its vitally important  he stressed his words and reinforced them with a quivering gesture of his upraised clenched hand my tempers in rags i explode at any little thing im raw i cant work steadily for ten minutes and i cant leave off working  your name said the doctor is familiar sir richmond hardy in the papers what is it  fuel  of course the fuel commission stupid of me we certainly cant afford to have you ill  i am ill but you cant afford to have me absent from that commission  your technical knowledge  technical knowledge be damned those men mean to corner the national fuel supply and waste it for their profits thats what im up against you dont know the job i have to do you dont know what a commission of that sort is the moral tangle of it you dont know how its possibilities and limitations are canvassed and schemed about long before a single member is appointed old cassidy worked the whole thing with the prime minister i can see that now as plain as daylight i might have seen it at first three experts whod been got at they thought id been got at two labour men whod do anything you wanted them to do provided you called them levelheaded wagstaffe the socialist art critic who could be trusted to play the fool and make nationalization look silly and the rest mine owners railway managers oil profiteers financial adventurers  he was fairly launched its the blind folly of it in the days before the war it was different then there was abundance a little grabbing or cornering was all to the good all to the good it prevented things being used up too fast and the world was running by habit the inertia was tremendous you could take all sorts of liberties but all this is altered were living in a different world the public wont stand things it used to stand its a new public itswild itll smash up the show if they go too far everything short and running shorterfood fuel material but these people go on they go on as though nothing had changed strikes russia nothing will warn them there are men on that commission who would steal the brakes off a mountain railway just before they went down in it its a struggle with suicidal imbeciles its but im talking i didnt come here to talk fuel  you think there may be a smashup  i lie awake at night thinking of it  a social smashup  economic social yes dont you  a social smashup seems to me altogether a possibility all sorts of people i find think that said the doctor all sorts of people lie awake thinking of it  i wish some of my damned committee would  the doctor turned his eyes to the window i lie awake too he said and seemed to reflect but he was observing his patient acutelywith his ears  but you see how important it is said sir richmond and left his sentence unfinished  ill do what i can for you said the doctor and considered swiftly what line of talk he had best follow  section 2  this sense of a coming smash is epidemic said the doctor its at the back of all sorts of mental trouble it is a new state of mind before the war it was abnormala phase of neurasthenia now it is almost the normal state with whole classes of intelligent people intelligent i say the others always have been casual and adventurous and always will be a loss of confidence in the general background of life so that we seem to float over abysses  we do said sir richmond  and we have nothing but the old habits and ideas acquired in the days of our assurance there is a discord a jarring  the doctor pursued his train of thought a new raw and dreadful sense of responsibility for the universe accompanied by a realization that the job is overwhelmingly too big for us  weve got to stand up to the job said sir richmond anyhow what else is there to do we may keep things together ive got to do my bit and if only i could hold myself at it i could beat those fellows but thats where the devil of it comes in never have i been so desirous to work well in my life and never have i been so slack and weakwilled and inaccurate sloppy indolent vicious  the doctor was about to speak but sir richmond interrupted him whats got hold of me whats got hold of me i used to work well enough its as if my will had come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands ive lost my unity im not a man but a mob ive got to recover my vigour at any cost  again as the doctor was about to speak the word was taken out of his mouth and what i think of it dr martineau is this its fatigue its mental and moral fatigue too much effort on too high a level and too austere one strains and fags flags flags i meant to say one strains and flags and then the lower stuff in one the subconscious stuff takes control  there was a flavour of popularized psychoanalysis about this and the doctor drew in the corners of his mouth and gave his head a critical slant mm but this only made sir richmond raise his voice and quicken his speech i want he said a good tonic a pickmeup a stimulating harmless drug of some sort thats indicated anyhow to begin with something to pull me together as people say bring me up to the scratch again  i dont like the use of drugs said the doctor  the expectation of sir richmonds expression changed to disappointment but thats not reasonable he cried thats not reasonable thats superstition call a thing a drug and condemn it everything is a drug everything that affects you food stimulates or tranquillizes drink noise is a stimulant and quiet an opiate what is life but response to stimulants or reaction after them when im exhausted i want food when im overactive and sleepless i want tranquillizing when im dispersed i want pulling together  but we dont know how to use drugs the doctor objected  but you ought to know  dr martineau fixed his eye on a first floor window sill on the opposite side of harley street his manner suggested a lecturer holding on to his theme  a day will come when we shall be able to manipulate drugsall sorts of drugsand work them in to our general way of living i have no prejudice against them at all a time will come when we shall correct our moods get down to our reserves of energy by their help suspend fatigue put off sleep during long spells of exertion at some sudden crisis for example when we shall know enough to know just how far to go with this that or the other stuff and how to wash out its after effects i quite agree with youin principle but that time hasnt come yet decades of research yet if we tried that sort of thing now we should be like children playing with poisons and explosives its out of the question  ive been taking a few little things already easton syrup for example  strychnine it carries you for a time and drops you by the way has it done you any goodany nett good it hasi can seebroken your sleep  the doctor turned round again to his patient and looked up into his troubled face  given physiological trouble i dont mind resorting to a drug given structural injury i dont mind surgery but except for any little mischief your amateur drugging may have done you do not seem to me to be either sick or injured youve no trouble either of structure or material you areworriedill in your mind and otherwise perfectly sound its the current of your thoughts fermenting if the trouble is in the mental sphere why go out of the mental sphere for a treatment talk and thought these are your remedies cool deliberate thought youre unravelled you say it yourself drugs will only make this or that unravelled strand behave disproportionately you dont want that you want to take stock of yourself as a wholefind out where you stand  but the fuel commission  is it sitting now  adjourned till after whitsuntide but theres heaps of work to be done  still he added this is my one chance of any treatment  the doctor made a little calculation three weeks its scarcely time enough to begin  youre certain that no regimen of carefully planned and chosen tonics  dismiss the idea dismiss it he decided to take a plunge ive just been thinking of a little holiday for myself but id like to see you through this and if i am to see you through there ought to be some sort of beginning now in this three weeks suppose  sir richmond leapt to his thought im free to go anywhere  golf would drive a man of your composition mad  it would  thats that still the country must be getting beautiful again nowafter all the rain we have had i have a little twoseater i dont know the repair people promise to release it before friday  but i have a choice of two very comfortable little cars why not be my guest  that might be more convenient  id prefer my own car  then what do you say  i agree peripatetic treatment  south and west we could talk on the road in the evenings by the wayside we might make the beginnings of a treatment  a simple tour nothing elaborate you wouldnt bring a man  i always drive myself  section 3  theres something very pleasant said the doctor envisaging his own rash proposal in travelling along roads you dont know and seeing houses and parks and villages and towns for which you do not feel in the slightest degree responsible they hide all their troubles from the road their backyards are tucked away out of sight they show a brave face theres none of the nasty selfbetrayals of the railway approach and everything will be fresh still there will still be a lot of appleblossomand bluebells and all the while we can be getting on with your affair  he was back at the window now i want the holiday myself he said  he addressed sir richmond over his shoulder have you noted how fagged and unstable everybody is getting everybody intelligent i mean  its an infernally worrying time  exactly everybody suffers  its no good going on in the old ways  it isnt and its a frightful strain to get into any new ways so here we are  a man the doctor expanded isnt a creature in vacuo hes himself and his world hes a surface of contact a system of adaptations between his essential self and his surroundings well our surroundings have becomehow shall i put ita landslide the war which seemed such a definable catastrophe in 1914 was after all only the first loud crack and smash of the collapse the war is over andnothing is over this peace is a farce reconstruction an exploded phrase the slide goes onit goes if anything faster without a sign of stopping and all our poor little adaptations which we have been elaborating and trusting all our lives one after another they fail us we are stripped we have to begin all over again im fiftyseven and i feel at times nowadays like a chicken new hatched in a thunderstorm  the doctor walked towards the bookcase and turned  everybody is like thatit isntwhat are you going to do it isntwhat am i going to do itswhat are we all going to do lord how safe and established everything was in 1910 say we talked of this great war that was coming but nobody thought it would come we had been born in peace comparatively speaking we had been brought up in peace there was talk of wars there were warslittle warsthat altered nothing material consols used to be at 112 and you fed your household on ten shillings a head a week you could run over all europe barring turkey and russia without even a passport you could get to italy in a day never were life and comfort so safefor respectable people and we were respectable people that was the world that made us what we are that was the sheltering and friendly greenhouse in which we grew we fitted our minds to that and here we are with the greenhouse falling in upon us lump by lump smash and clatter the wild winds of heaven tearing in through the gaps  upstairs on dr martineaus desk lay the typescript of the opening chapters of a book that was intended to make a great splash in the world his psychology of a new age he had his metaphors ready  we said this system will always go on we neednt bother about it we just planned our lives accordingly it was like a bird building its nest of frozen snakes my father left me a decent independence i developed my position i have lived between here and the hospital doing good work enormously interested prosperous mildly distinguished i had been born and brought up on the good ship civilization i assumed that someone else was steering the ship all right i never knew i never enquired  nor did i said sir richmond but  and nobody was steering the ship the doctor went on nobody had ever steered the ship it was adrift  i realized that i  it is a new realization always hitherto men have lived by faithas children do as the animals do at the back of the healthy mind human or animal has been this persuasion this is all right this will go on if i keep the rule if i do so and so all will be well i need not trouble further things are cared for  if we could go on like that said sir richmond  we cant that faith is dead the warand the peacehave killed it  the doctors round face became speculative his resemblance to the full moon increased he seemed to gaze at remote things it may very well be that man is no more capable of living out of that atmosphere of assurance than a tadpole is of living out of water his mental existence may be conditional on that deprived of it he may become incapable of sustained social life he may become frantically selfseekingincoherent a stampede human sanity maydisperse  thats our trouble the doctor completed our fundamental trouble all our confidences and our accustomed adaptations are destroyed we fit together no longer we areloose we dont know where we are nor what to do the psychology of the former time fails to give safe responses and the psychology of the new age has still to develop  section 4  that is all very well said sir richmond in the resolute voice of one who will be pent no longer that is all very well as far as it goes but it does not cover my case i am not suffering from inadaptation i have adapted i have thought things out i thinkmuch as you do much as you do so its not that but mind you i am perfectly clear where i am where we are what is happening to us all is the breakup of the entire system agreed we have to make another system or perish amidst the wreckage i see that clearly science and plan have to replace custom and tradition in human affairs soon very soon granted granted we used to say all that even before the war now we mean it weve muddled about in the old ways overlong some new sort of world planned and scientific has to be got going civilization renewed rebuilding civilizationwhile the premises are still occupied and busy its an immense enterprise but it is the only thing to be done in some ways its an enormously attractive enterprise inspiring it grips my imagination i think of the other men who must be at work working as i do rather in the dark as yet with whom i shall presently join up the attempt may fail all things human may fail but on the other hand it may succeed i never had such faith in anything as i have in the rightness of the work i am doing now i begin at that but here is where my difficulty comes in the top of my brain my innermost self says all that i have been saying butthe rest of me wont follow the rest of me refuses to attend forgets straggles misbehaves  exactly  the word irritated sir richmond not exactly at all amazingly if you like i have this unlimited faith in our present tremendous necessityfor workfor devotion i believe my share the work i am doing is essential to the whole thingand i work sluggishly i work reluctantly i work damnably  exact the doctor checked himself all that is explicable indeed it is listen for a moment to me consider what you are consider what we are consider what a man is before you marvel at his ineptitudes of will face the accepted facts here is a creature not ten thousand generations from the ape his ancestor not ten thousand and that ape again not a score of thousands from the monkey his forebear a mans body his bodily powers are just the body and powers of an ape a little improved a little adapted to novel needs that brings me to my point can his mind and will be anything better for a few generations a few hundreds at most knowledge and wide thought have flared out on the darknesses of life but the substance of man is ape still he may carry a light in his brain but his instincts move in the darkness out of that darkness he draws his motives  or fails to draw them said sir richmond  or fails and that is where these new methods of treatment come in we explore that failure together what the psychoanalyst doesand i will confess that i owe much to the psychoanalystwhat he does is to direct thwarted disappointed and perplexed people to the realities of their own nature which they have been accustomed to ignore and forget they come to us with high ambitions or lovely illusions about themselves torn shredded spoilt they are morally denuded dreams they hate pursue them abhorrent desires draw them they are the prey of irresistible yet uncongenial impulses they succumb to black despairs the first thing we ask them is this what else could you expect  what else could i expect sir richmond repeated looking down on him hm  the wonder is not that you are sluggish reluctantly unselfish inattentive spasmodic the wonder is that you are ever anything else do you realize that a few million generations ago everything that stirs in us everything that exalts human life selfdevotions heroisms the utmost triumphs of art the lovefor love it isthat makes you and me care indeed for the fate and welfare of all this round world was latent in the body of some little lurking beast that crawled and hid among the branches of vanished and forgotten mesozoic trees a petty egglaying bristlecovered beast it was with no more of the rudiments of a soul than bare hunger weak lust and fear people always seem to regard that as a curious fact of no practical importance it isnt its a vital fact of the utmost practical importance that is what you are made of why should you expectbecause a war and a revolution have shocked youthat you should suddenly be able to reach up and touch the sky  hm said sir richmond have i been touching the sky  you are trying to play the part of an honest rich man  i dont care to see the whole system go smash  exactly said the doctor before he could prevent himself  but is it any good to tell a man that the job he is attempting is above himthat he is just a hairy reptile twice removedand all that sort of thing  well it saves him from hoping too much and being too greatly disappointed it recalls him to the proportions of the job he gets something done by not attempting everything  and it clears him up we get him to look into himself to see directly and in measurable terms what it is that puts him wrong and holds him back hes no longer vaguely incapacitated he knows  thats diagnosis thats not treatment  treatment by diagnosis to analyze a mental knot is to untie it  you propose that i shall spend my time until the commission meets in thinking about myself i wanted to forget myself  like a man who tries to forget that his petrol is running short and a cylinder missing fire no come back to the question of what you are said the doctor a creature of the darkness with new lights lit and halfblinded by science and the possibilities of controlling the world that it opens out in that light your will is all for service you care more for mankind than for yourself you begin to understand something of the self beyond your self but it is a partial and a shaded light as yet a little area about you it makes clear the rest is still the old darknessof millions of intense and narrow animal generations you are like someone who awakens out of an immemorial sleep to find himself in a vast chamber in a great and ancient house a great and ancient house high amidst frozen and lifeless mountainsin a sunless universe you are not alone in it you are not lord of all you survey your leadership is disputed the darkness even of the room you are in is full of ancient and discarded but quite unsubjugated powers and purposes they thrust ambiguous limbs and claws suddenly out of the darkness into the light of your attention they snatch things out of your hand they trip your feet and jog your elbow they crowd and cluster behind you wherever your shadow falls they creep right up to you creep upon you and struggle to take possession of you the souls of apes monkeys reptiles and creeping things haunt the passages and attics and cellars of this living house in which your consciousness has awakened  the doctor gave this quotation from his unpublished book the advantages of an abrupt break and a pause  sir richmond shrugged his shoulders and smiled and you propose a vermin hunt in the old tenement  the modern man has to be master in his own house he has to take stock and know what is there  three weeks of self vivisection  to begin with three weeks of perfect honesty with yourself as an opening it will take longer than that if we are to go through with the job  it is a considerableprocess  it is  yet you shrink from simple things like drugs  selfknowledgewithout anaesthetics  has this sort of thing ever done anyone any good at all  it has turned hundreds back to sanity and steady work  how frank are we going to be how full are we going to be anyhowwe can break off at any time well try it well try it and so for this journey into the west of england andif we can get thereim not sure that we can get thereinto the secret places of my heart     chapter the second  lady hardy  the patient left the house with much more self possession than he had shown when entering it dr martineau had thrust him back from his intenser prepossessions to a more generalized view of himself had made his troubles objective and detached him from them he could even find something amusing now in his situation he liked the immense scope of the theoretical duet in which they had indulged he felt that most of it was entirely trueand in some untraceable manner absurd there were entertaining possibilities in the prospect of the doctor drawing him outhe himself partly assisting and partly resisting  he was a man of extensive reservations his private life was in some respects exceptionally private  i dont confide do i even confide in myself i imagine i do is there anything in myself that i havent looked squarely in the face how much are we going into even as regards facts  does it really help a manto see himself  such thoughts engaged him until he found himself in his study his desk and his writing table were piled high with a heavy burthen of work still a little preoccupied with dr martineaus exposition he began to handle this confusion  at half past nine he found himself with three hours of good work behind him it had seemed like two he had not worked like this for many weeks this is very cheering he said and unexpected can old moonface have hypnotized me anyhow perhaps ive only imagined i was ill dinner he looked at his watch and was amazed at the time good lord ive been at it three hours what can have happened funny i didnt hear the gong  he went downstairs and found lady hardy reading a magazine in a diningroom armchair and finely poised between devotion and martyrdom a shadow of vexation fell athwart his mind at the sight of her  id no idea it was so late he said i heard no gong  after you swore so at poor bradley i ordered that there should be no gongs when we were alone i did come up to your door about half past eight i crept up but i was afraid i might upset you if i came in  but youve not waited  ive had a mouthful of soup lady hardy rang the bell  ive done some work at last said sir richmond astride on the hearthrug  im glad said lady hardy without gladness i waited for three hours  lady hardy was a frail little blueeyed woman with uneven shoulders and a delicate sweet profile hers was that type of face that under even the most pleasant and luxurious circumstances still looks bravely and patiently enduring her refinement threw a tinge of coarseness over his eager consumption of his excellent clear soup  whats this fish bradley he asked  turbot sir richmond  dont you have any he asked his wife  ive had a little fish said lady hardy  when bradley was out of the room sir richmond remarked i saw that nerves man dr martineau today he wants me to take a holiday  the quiet patience of the ladys manner intensified she said nothing a flash of resentment lit sir richmonds eyes when he spoke again he seemed to answer unspoken accusations dr martineaus idea is that he should come with me  the lady adjusted herself to a new point of view  but wont that be reminding you of your illness and worries  he seems a good sort of fellow im inclined to like him hell be as good company as anyone this tournedos looks excellent have some  i had a little bird said lady hardy when i found you werent coming  but i saydont wait here if youve dined bradley can see to me  she smiled and shook her head with the quiet conviction of one who knew her duty better perhaps ill have a little ice pudding when it comes she said  sir richmond detested eating alone in an atmosphere of observant criticism and he did not like talking with his mouth full to an unembarrassed interlocutor who made no conversational leads of her own after a few mouthfuls he pushed his plate away from him then lets have up the ice pudding he said with a faint note of bitterness  but have you finished  the ice pudding he exploded wrathfully the ice pudding  lady hardy sat for a moment a picture of meek distress then her delicate eyebrows raised and the corners of her mouth drooping she touched the button of the silver tablebell     chapter the third  the departure  section 1  no wise man goes out upon a novel expedition without misgivings and between their first meeting and the appointed morning both sir richmond hardy and dr martineau were the prey of quite disagreeable doubts about each other themselves and the excursion before them at the time of their meeting each had been convinced that he gauged the other sufficiently for the purposes of the proposed tour afterwards each found himself trying to recall the other with greater distinctness and able to recall nothing but queer ominous and minatory traits the doctors impression of the great fuel specialist grew ever darker leaner taller and more impatient sir richmond took on the likeness of a monster obdurate and hostile he spread upwards until like the djinn out of the bottle he darkened the heavens and he talked too much he talked ever so much too much sir richmond also thought that the doctor talked too much in addition he read into his imperfect memory of the doctors face an expression of protruded curiosity what was all this problem of motives and inclinations that they were going into so gaily he had merely consulted the doctor on a simple straightforward need for a nervous tonicthat was what he had neededa tonic instead he had engaged himself forhe scarcely knew whatan indiscreet indelicate and altogether undesirable experiment in confidences  both men were considerably reassured when at last they set eyes on each other again indeed each was surprised to find something almost agreeable in the appearance of the other dr martineau at once perceived that the fierceness of sir richmond was nothing more than the fierceness of an overwrought man and sir richmond realized at a glance that the curiosity of dr martineaus bearing had in it nothing personal or base it was just the fine alertness of the scientific mind  sir richmond had arrived nearly forty minutes late and it would have been evident to a much less highly trained observer than dr martineau that some dissension had arisen between the little ladylike cream and black charmeuse car and its owner there was a faint air of resentment and protest between them as if sir richmond had been in some way rude to it  the cap of the radiator was adorned with a little brass figure of a flying mercury frozen in a sprightly attitude its stiff bound and its fixed heavenward stare was highly suggestive of a forced and tactful disregard of current unpleasantness  nothing was said however to confirm or dispel this suspicion of a disagreement between the man and the car sir richmond directed and assisted dr martineaus man to adjust the luggage at the back and dr martineau watched the proceedings from his dignified front door he was wearing a suit of fawn tweeds a fawn homburg hat and a light burberry with just that effect of special preparation for a holiday which betrays the habitually busy man sir richmonds brown gauntness was he noted greatly set off by his suit of grey there had certainly been some sort of quarrel sir richmond was explaining the straps to dr martineaus butler with the coldness a man betrays when he explains the uncongenial habits of some unloved intimate and when the moment came to start and the little engine did not immediately respond to the electric starter he said oh come up you  his voice sank at the last word as though it was an entirely confidential communication to the little car and it was an extremely low and disagreeable word so dr martineau decided that it was not his business to hear it  it was speedily apparent that sir richmond was an experienced and excellent driver he took the charmeuse out into the traffic of baker street and westward through brisk and busy streets and roads to brentford and hounslow smoothly and swiftly making a score of unhesitating and accurate decisions without apparent thought there was very little conversation until they were through brentford near shepherds bush sir richmond had explained this is not my own particular car that was butted into at the garage this morning and its radiator cracked so i had to fall back on this its quite a good little car in its way my wife drives it at times it has one or two constitutional weaknessesincidental to the makegearbox over the back axle for examplegets all the vibration whole machine rather on the flimsy side still  he left the topic at that  dr martineau said something of no consequence about its being a very comfortable little car  somewhere between brentford and hounslow sir richmond plunged into the matter between them i dont know how deep we are going into these psychological probings of yours he said but i doubt very much if we shall get anything out of them  probably not said dr martineau  after all what i want is a tonic i dont see that there is anything positively wrong with me a certain lack of energy  lack of balance corrected the doctor you are wasting energy upon internal friction  but isnt that inevitable no machine is perfectly efficient no man either there is always a waste waste of the type waste of the individual idiosyncrasy this little car for instance isnt pulling as she ought to pullshe never does shes low in her class so with myself there is a natural and necessary high rate of energy waste moods of apathy and indolence are natural to me damn that omnibus all over the road  we dont deny the imperfection began the doctor  one has to fit oneself to ones circumstances said sir richmond opening up another line of thought  we dont deny the imperfection the doctor stuck to it these new methods of treatment are based on the idea of imperfection we begin with that i began with that last tuesday  sir richmond too was sticking to his argument a man and for that matter the world he lives in is a tangle of accumulations your psychoanalyst starts it seems to me with a notion of stripping down to something fundamental the ape before was a tangle of accumulations just as we are so it was with his forebears so it has always been all life is an endless tangle of accumulations  recognize it said the doctor  and then said sir richmond controversially  recognize in particular your own tangle  is my particular tangle very different from the general tangle oh damn this feeble little engine i am a creature of undecided will urged on by my tangled heredity to do a score of entirely incompatible things mankind all life is that  but our concern is the particular score of incompatible things you are urged to do we examine and weighwe weigh  the doctor was still saying these words when a violent and ultimately disastrous struggle began between sir richmond and the little charmeuse car the doctor stopped in midsentence  it was near taplow station that the mutual exasperation of man and machine was brought to a crisis by the clumsy emergence of a laundry cart from a side road sir richmond was obliged to pull up smartly and stopped his engine it refused an immediate obedience to the electric starter then it picked up raced noisily disengaged great volumes of bluish smoke and displayed an unaccountable indisposition to run on any gear but the lowest sir richmond thought aloud unpleasing thoughts he addressed the little car as a person he referred to ancient disputes and temperamental incompatibilities his anger betrayed him a coarse illbred man the little car quickened under his reproaches there were some moments of hope dashed by the necessity of going dead slow behind an interloping van sir richmond did not notice the outstretched arm of the driver of the van and stalled his engine for a second time the electric starter refused its office altogether  for some moments sir richmond sat like a man of stone  i must wind it up he said at last in a profound and awful voice i must wind it up  i get out dont i asked the doctor unanswered and did so sir richmond after a grim search and the displacement and replacement of the luggage produced a handle from the locker at the back of the car and prepared to wind  there was a little difficulty come up he said and the small engine roared out like a stage lion  the two gentlemen resumed their seats the car started and then by an unfortunate inadvertency sir richmond pulled the gear lever over from the first speed to the reverse there was a metallic clangour beneath the two gentlemen and the car slowed down and stopped although the engine was still throbbing wildly and the dainty veil of blue smoke still streamed forward from the back of the car before a gentle breeze the doctor got out almost precipitately followed by a gaunt madman mouthing vileness who had only a minute or so before been a decent british citizen he made some blind lunges at the tremulous but obdurate car but rather as if he looked for offences and accusations than for displacements to adjust quivering and refusing the little car was extraordinarily like some recalcitrant little old aristocratic lady in the hands of revolutionaries and this made the behaviour of sir richmond seem even more outrageous than it would otherwise have done he stopped the engine he went down on his hands and knees in the road to peer up at the gearbox then without restoring the spark he tried to wind up the engine again he spun the little handle with an insane violence faster and faster foras it seemed to the doctorthe better part of a minute beads of perspiration appeared upon his brow and ran together he bared his teeth in a snarl his hat slipped over one eye he groaned with rage then using the starting handle as a club he assailed the car he smote the brazen mercury from its foothold and sent it and a part of the radiator cap with it flying across the road he beat at the wings of the bonnet until they bent in under his blows finally he hurled the startinghandle at the windscreen and smashed it the startinghandle rattled over the bonnet and fell to the ground  the paroxysm was over ten seconds later this cataclysmal lunatic had reverted to sanitya rather sheepish sanity  he thrust his hands into his trouser pockets and turned his back on the car he remarked in a voice of melancholy detachment it was a mistake to bring that coupe  dr martineau had assumed an attitude of trained observation on the side path his hands rested on his hips and his hat was a little on one side he was inclined to agree with sir richmond i dont know he considered you wanted some such blowoff as this  did i  the energy you have that car must be somebodys whipping boy  the devil it is said sir richmond turning round sharply and staring at it as if he expected it to display some surprising and yet familiar features then he looked questioningly and suspiciously at his companion  these outbreaks do nothing to amend the originating grievance said the doctor no and at times they are even costly but they certainly lift a burthen from the nervous system and now i suppose we have to get that little ruin to maidenhead  little ruin repeated sir richmond no theres lots of life in the little beast yet  he reflected shell have to be towed he felt in his breast pocket somewhere i have the rac order paper the badge that will get you home we shall have to hail some passing car to take it into maidenhead  dr martineau offered and sir richmond took and lit a cigarette  for a little while conversation hung fire then for the first time dr martineau heard his patient laugh  amazing savage said sir richmond amazing savage  he pointed to his handiwork the little car looks ruffled well it may  he became grave again i suppose i ought to apologize  dr martineau weighed the situation as between doctor and patient he said no  oh said sir richmond turned to a new point of view but where the patient ends and the host begins im really very sorry he reverted to his original train of thought which had not concerned dr martineau at all after all the little car was only doing what she was made to do  section 2  the affair of the car effectively unsealed sir richmonds mind hitherto dr martineau had perceived the possibility and danger of a defensive silence or of a still more defensive irony but now that sir richmond had once given himself away he seemed prepared to give himself away to an unlimited extent he embarked upon an apologetic discussion of the choleric temperament  he began as they stood waiting for the relief car from the maidenhead garage you were talking of the ghosts of apes and monkeys that suddenly come out from the darkness of the subconscious  you meanwhen we first met at harley street  that last apparition of mine seems to have been a gorilla at least  the doctor became precise gorillaesque we are not descended from gorillas  queer thing a fit of rage is  its one of natures cruder expedients crude but i doubt if it is fundamental there doesnt seem to be rage in the vegetable world and even among the animals no it is not universal he ran his mind over classes and orders wasps and bees certainly seem to rage but if one comes to think most of the invertebrata show very few signs of it  im not so sure said sir richmond ive never seen a snail in a towering passion or an oyster slamming its shell behind it but these are sluggish things oysters sulk which is after all a smouldering sort of rage and take any more active invertebrate take a spider not a smashing and swearing sort of rage perhaps but a disciplined coldblooded malignity crabs fight a conger eel in a boat will rage dangerously  a vertebrate yes but even among the vertebrata who has ever seen a furious rabbit  dont the bucks fight questioned sir richmond  dr martineau admitted the point  ive always had these fits of passion as far back as i can remember i was a kicking screaming child i threw things i once threw a fork at my elder brother and it stuck in his forehead doing no serious damagehappily there were whole days of wrathdays as i remember them perhaps they were only hours ive never thought before what a peculiar thing all this raging is in the world why do we rage they used to say it was the devil if it isnt the devil then what the devil is it after all he went on as the doctor was about to answer his question as you pointed out it isnt the lowlier things that rage its the higher things and us  the devil nowadays the doctor reflected after a pause so far as man is concerned is understood to be the ancestral ape and more particularly the old male ape  but sir richmond was away on another line of thought life itself flaring out brooking no contradiction he came round suddenly to the doctors qualification why male dont little girls smash things just as much  they dont said dr martineau not nearly as much  sir richmond went off at a tangent again i suppose you have watched any number of babies  not nearly as many as a general practitioner would do theres a lot of rage about most of them at first male or female  queer little eddies of fury recentlyit happensive been seeing one a spit of red wrath clenching its fists and squalling threats at a damned disobedient universe  the doctor was struck by an idea and glanced quickly and questioningly at his companions profile  blind driving force said sir richmond musing  isnt that after all what we really are he asked the doctor essentiallyrage a rage in dead matter making it alive  schopenhauer footnoted the doctor boehme  plain fact said sir richmond no rageno go  but rage without discipline  discipline afterwards the rage first  but rage against what and for what  against the universe and for thats more difficult what is the little beast squalling itself crimson for ultimately  what is it clutching after in the long run what will it get  yours the car in distress what sent this asked an unheeded voice  of course if you were to say desire said dr martineau then you would be in line with the psychoanalysts they talk of libido meaning a sort of fundamental desire jung speaks of it at times almost as if it were the universal driving force  no said sir richmond in love with his new idea not desire desire would have a definite direction and that is just what this driving force hasnt its rage  yours the car in distress what sent this the voice repeated it was the voice of a mechanic in an overland car he was holding up the blue request for assistance that sir richmond had recently filled in  the two philosophers returned to practical matters  section 3  for half an hour after the departure of the little charmeuse car with sir richmond and dr martineau the brass mercury lay unheeded in the dusty roadside grass then it caught the eye of a passing child  he was a bright little boy of five from the moment when he caught the gleam of brass he knew that he had made the find of his life but his nurse was a timorous foolish thing you did ought to of left it there masterrarry she said  findings aint keepings nowadays not by no manner of means masterrarry  yewd look silly if a policeman came along arsting people if they seen a goldennimage  arst yer ow you come by it and look pretty straight at you  all of which grumblings master harry treated with an experienced disregard he knew definitely that he would never relinquish this bright and lovely possession again it was the first beautiful thing he had ever possessed he was the darling of fond and indulgent parents and his nursery was crowded with hideous rag and sawdust dolls golliwogs comic penguins comic lions comic elephants and comic policemen and every variety of suchlike humorous idiocy and visual beastliness this figure solid delicate and gracious was a thing of a different order  there was to be much conflict and distress tears and wrath before the affinity of that cleanlimbed shining figure and his small soul was recognized but he carried his point at last the mercury became his inseparable darling his symbol his private god the one dignified and serious thing in a little life much congested by the quaint the burlesque and all the smiling dull condescensions of adult love     chapter the fourth  at maidenhead  section 1  the little charmeuse was towed to hospital and the two psychiatrists took up their quarters at the radiant hotel with its pleasant lawns and graceful landing stage at the bend towards the bridge sir richmond after some trying work at the telephone got into touch with his own proper car a man would bring the car down in two days time at latest and afterwards the detested coupe could go back to london the day was still young and after lunch and coffee upon a sunny lawn a boat seemed indicated sir richmond astonished the doctor by going to his room reappearing dressed in tennis flannels and looking very well in them it occurred to the doctor as a thing hitherto unnoted that sir richmond was not indifferent to his personal appearance the doctor had no flannels but he had brought a brown holland umbrella lined with green that he had acquired long ago in algiers and this served to give him something of the riverside quality  the day was full of sunshine and the river had a maytime animation pink geraniums vivid green lawns gay awnings bright glass white paint and shining metal set the tone of maidenhead life at lunch there had been five or six small tables with quietly affectionate couples who talked in undertones a tableful of brightcoloured jews who talked in overtones and a family party from the midlands badly smitten with shyness who did not talk at all a resort of honeymoon couples said the doctor and then rather knowingly temporary honeymoons i fancy in one or two of the cases  decidedly temporary said sir richmond considering the companyin most of the cases anyhow the two in the corner might be married you never know nowadays  he became reflective  after lunch and coffee he rowed the doctor up the river towards cliveden  the last time i was here he said returning to the subject i was here on a temporary honeymoon  the doctor tried to look as though he had not thought that could be possible  i know my maidenhead fairly well said sir richmond aquatic activities such as rowing punting messing about with a boathook tying up buzzing about in motor launches fouling other peoples boats are merely the stage business of the drama the ruling interests of this place are lovelargely illicitand persistent drinking dont you think the bridge charming from here  i shouldnt have thoughtdrinking said dr martineau after he had done justice to the bridge over his shoulder  yes the place has a floating population of quiet industrious soakers the incurable river man and the river girl end at that  dr martineau encouraged sir richmond by an appreciative silence  if we are to explore the secret places of the heart sir richmond went on we shall have to give some attention to this maidenhead side of life it is very material to my case i haveas i have saidbeen here this place has beauty and charm these piledup woods behind which my lords astor and desborough keep their state this shining mirror of the water brown and green and sky blue this fringe of reeds and scented rushes and forgetmenot and lilies and these perpetually posing white swans they make a picture a little artificial it is true one feels the presence of a conservancy board planting the rushes and industriously nicking the swans but none the less delightful and this setting has appealed to a number of people as an invitation as in a way a promise they come here responsive to that promise of beauty and happiness they conceive of themselves here rowing swiftly and gracefully punting beautifully brandishing boathooks with ease and charm they look to meet under pleasant or romantic circumstances other possessors and worshippers of grace and beauty here there will be glowing evenings warm moonlight distant voices singingthere is your desire doctor the desire you say is the driving force of life but reality mocks it boats bump and lead to coarse ungracious quarrels rowing can be curiously fatiguing punting involves dreadful indignities the romance here tarnishes very quickly romantic encounters fail to occur in our impatience we resort toaccosting chilly mists arise from the water and the magic of distant singing is provided even excessively by boatloads of cadswith collecting dishes when the weather keeps warm there presently arises an extraordinary multitude of gnats and when it does not there is a need for stimulants that is why the dreamers who come here first for a light delicious brush with love come down at last to the thamesside barmaid with her array of spirits and cordials as the quintessence of all desire  i say said the doctor you tear the place to pieces  the desires of the place said sir richmond  im using the place as a symbol  he held his sculls awash rippling in the water  the real force of life the rage of life isnt here he said its down underneath sulking and smouldering every now and then it strains and cracks the surface this stretch of the thames this pleasure stretch has in fact a curiously quarrelsome atmosphere people scold and insult one another for the most trivial things for passing too close for taking the wrong side for tying up or floating loose most of these notice boards on the bank show a thoroughly nasty spirit people on the banks jeer at anyone in the boats you hear people quarrelling in boats in the hotels as they walk along the towing path there is remarkably little happy laughter here the rage you see is hostile to this place the rage breaks through the people who drift from one pub to another drinking the people who fuddle in the riverside hotels are the last fugitives of pleasure trying to forget the rage  isnt it that there is some greater desire at the back of the human mind the doctor suggested which refuses to be content with pleasure as an end  what greater desire asked sir richmond disconcertingly  oh the doctor cast about  there is no such greater desire said sir richmond you cannot name it it is just blind drive i admit its discontent with pleasure as an endbut has it any end of its own at the most you can say that the rage in life is seeking its desire and hasnt found it  let us help in the search said the doctor with an afternoon smile under his green umbrella go on  section 2  since our first talk in harley street said sir richmond i have been trying myself over in my mind we can drift down this backwater  big these trees are said the doctor with infinite approval  i am astonished to discover what a bundle of discordant motives i am i do not seem to deserve to be called a personality i cannot discover even a general direction much more am i like a taxicab in which all sorts of aims and desires have travelled to their destination and got out are we all like that  a bundle held together by a name and address and a certain thread of memory said the doctor and considered more than that more than that we have leading ideas associations possessions liabilities  we build ourselves a prison of circumstances that keeps us from complete dispersal  exactly said the doctor and there is also something a consistency that we call character  it changes  consistently with itself  i have been trying to recall my sexual history said sir richmond going off at a tangent my sentimental education i wonder if it differs very widely from yours or most mens  some men are more eventful in these matters than others said the doctorit soundedwistfully  they have the same jumble of motives and traditions i suspect whether they are eventful or not the brakes may be strong or weak but the drive is the same i cant remember much of the beginnings of curiosity and knowledge in these matters can you  not much said the doctor no  your psychoanalysts tell a story of fears suppressions monstrous imaginations symbolic replacements i dont remember much of that sort of thing in my own case it may have faded out of my mind there were probably some uneasy curiosities a grotesque dream or so perhaps i cant recall anything of that sort distinctly now i had a very lively interest in women even when i was still quite a little boy and a certainwhat shall i call itimaginative slavishnessnot towards actual women but towards something magnificently feminine my first love  sir richmond smiled at some secret memory my first love was britannia as depicted by tenniel in the cartoons in punch i must have been a very little chap at the time of the britannia affair i just clung to her in my imagination and did devoted things for her then i recall a little later a secret abject adoration for the white goddesses of the crystal palace not for any particular one of them that i can rememberfor all of them but i dont remember anything very monstrous or incestuous in my childish imaginationssuch things as freud i understand lays stress upon if there was an oedipus complex or anything of that sort in my case it has been very completely washed out again perhaps a child which is brought up in a proper nursery of its own and sees a lot of pictures of the nude human body and so on gets its mind shifted off any possible concentration upon the domestic aspect of sex i got to definite knowledge pretty early by the time i was eleven or twelve  normally  what is normally decently anyhow here again i may be forgetting much secret and shameful curiosity i got my ideas into definite form out of a little straightforward physiological teaching and some dissecting of rats and mice my schoolmaster was a capable sane man in advance of his times and my people believed in him i think much of this distorted perverse stuff that grows up in peoples minds about sex and develops into evil vices and still more evil habits is due to the mystery we make about these things  not entirely said the doctor  largely what child under a modern upbringing ever goes through the stuffy horrors described in james joyces portrait of the artist as a young man  ive not read it  a picture of the catholic atmosphere a young soul shut up in darkness and ignorance to accumulate filth in the name of purity and decency and under threats of hell fire  horrible  quite a study of intolerable tensions the tensions that make young people write unclean words in secret places  yes we certainly ventilate and sanitate in those matters nowadays where nothing is concealed nothing can explode  on the whole i came up to adolescence pretty straight and clean said sir richmond what stands out in my memory now is this idea of a sort of woman goddess who was very lovely and kind and powerful and wonderful that ruled my secret imaginations as a boy but it was very much in my mind as i grew up  the mother complex said dr martineau as a passing botanist might recognize and name a flower  sir richmond stared at him for a moment  it had not the slightest connexion with my mother or any mother or any particular woman at all far better to call it the goddess complex  the connexion is not perhaps immediately visible said the doctor  there was no connexion said sir richmond the women of my adolescent dreams were stripped and strong and lovely they were great creatures they came it was clearly traceable from pictures sculptureand from a definite response in myself to their beauty my mother had nothing whatever to do with that the women and girls about me were fussy bunches of clothes that i am sure i never even linked with that dream world of love and worship  were you coeducated  no but i had a couple of sisters one older one younger than myself and there were plenty of girls in my circle i thought some of them prettybut that was a different affair i know that i didnt connect them with the idea of the loved and worshipped goddesses at all because i remember when i first saw the goddess in a real human being and how amazed i was at the discovery i was a boy of twelve or thirteen my people took me one summer to dymchurch in romney marsh in those days before the automobile had made the marsh accessible to the hythe and folkestone crowds it was a little old forgotten silent windbitten village crouching under the lee of the great sea wall at low water there were miles of sand as smooth and shining as the skin of a savage brown woman shining and with a texturethe very same and one day as i was mucking about by myself on the beach boy fashionthere were some ribs of a wrecked boat buried in the sand near a groin and i was busy with thema girl ran out from a tent high up on the beach and across the sands to the water she was dressed in a tight bathing dress and not in the clumsy skirts and frills that it was the custom to inflict on women in those days her hair was tied up in a blue handkerchief she ran swiftly and gracefully intent upon the white line of foam ahead i can still remember how the sunlight touched her round neck and cheek as she went past me she was the loveliest most shapely thing i have ever seento this day she lifted up her arms and thrust through the dazzling white and green breakers and plunged into the water and swam she swam straight out for a long way as it seemed to me and presently came in and passed me again on her way back to her tent light and swift and sure the very prints of her feet on the sand were beautiful suddenly i realized that there could be living people in the world as lovely as any goddess she wasnt in the least out of breath  that was my first human love and i love that girl still i doubt sometimes whether i have ever loved anyone else i kept the thing very secret i wonder now why i have kept the thing so secret until now i have never told a soul about it i resorted to all sorts of tortuous devices and excuses to get a chance of seeing her again without betraying what it was i was after  dr martineau retained a simple fondness for a story  and did you meet her again  never of course i may have seen her as a dressedup person and not recognized her a day or so later i was stabbed to the heart by the discovery that the tent she came out of had been taken away  she had gone  for ever  sir richmond smiled brightly at the doctors disappointment  section 3  i was never wholehearted and simple about sexual things sir richmond resumed presently never i do not think any man is we are too much plasteredup things too much the creatures of a tortuous and complicated evolution  dr martineau under his green umbrella nodded his conceded agreement  thiswhat shall i call itthis dream of women grew up in my mind as i grew upas something independent of and much more important than the reality of women it came only very slowly into relation with that that girl on the dymchurch beach was one of the first links but she ceased very speedily to be realshe joined the women of dreamland at last altogether she became a sort of legendary incarnation i thought of these dream women not only as something beautiful but as something exceedingly kind and helpful the girls and women i met belonged to a different creation  sir richmond stopped abruptly and rowed a few long strokes  dr martineau sought information  i suppose he said there was a sensuous element in these dreamings  certainly a very strong one it didnt dominate but it was a very powerful undertow  was there any tendency in all this imaginative stuff to concentrate to group itself about a single figure the sort of thing that victorians would have called an ideal  not a bit of it said sir richmond with conviction there was always a tremendous lot of variety in my mind in fact the thing i liked least in the real world was the way it was obsessed by the idea of pairing off with one particular set and final person i liked to dream of a blonde goddess in her own venusberg one day and the next i would be off over the mountains with an armed brunhild  you had little thought of children  as a young man  yes  none at all i cannot recall a single philoprogenitive moment these dream women were all conceived of and i was conceived of as being concerned in some tremendous enterprisesomething quite beyond domesticity it kept us relatedgave us dignity certainly it wasnt babies  all this is very interesting very interesting from the scientific point of view a priori it is not what one might have expected reasoning from the idea that all instincts and natural imaginations are adapted to a biological end and seeing that sex is essentially a method of procreation one might reasonably expect a convergence if not a complete concentration upon the idea of offspring it is almost as if there were other ends to be served it is clear that nature has not worked this impulse out to any sight of its end has not perhaps troubled to do so the instinct of the male for the female isnt primarily for offspringnot even in the most intelligent and farseeing types the desire just points to glowing satisfactions and illusions quite equally i think the desire of the female for the male ignores its end nature has set about this business in a cheap sort of way she is like some pushful advertising tradesman she isnt frank with us she just humbugs us into what she wants with us all very well in the early stone agewhen the poor dear things never realized that their mutual endearments meant all the troubles and responsibilities of parentage but now  he shook his head sideways and twirled the green umbrella like an animated halo around his large broadminded face  sir richmond considered desire has never been the chief incentive of my relations with women never so far as i can analyze the thing it has been a craving for a particular sort of life giving companionship  that i take it is natures device to keep the lovers together in the interest of the more or less unpremeditated offspring  a poor device if that is its end it doesnt keep parents together more often it tears them apart the wife or the mistress so soon as she is encumbered with children becomes all too manifestly not the companion goddess  sir richmond brooded over his sculls and thought  throughout my life i have been an exceedingly busy man i have done a lot of scientific work and some of it has been very good work and very laborious work ive travelled much ive organized great business developments you might think that my time has been fairly well filled without much philandering and all the time all the time ive beenabout womenlike a thirsty beast looking for water always always all through my life  dr martineau waited through another silence  i was very grave about it at first i married young i married very simply and purely i was not one of those young men who sow a large crop of wild oats i was a fairly decent youth it suddenly appeared to me that a certain smiling and dainty girl could make herself into all the goddesses of my dreams i had but to win her and this miracle would occur of course i forget now the exact things i thought and felt then but surely i had some such persuasion or why should i have married her my wife was seven years younger than myselfa girl of twenty she was charming she is charming she is a wonderfully intelligent and understanding woman she has made a home for mea delightful home i am one of those men who have no instinct for home making i owe my home and all the comfort and dignity of my life to her ability i have no excuse for any misbehaviourso far as she is concerned none at all by all the rules i should have been completely happy but instead of my marriage satisfying me it presently released a storm of longcontrolled desires and imprisoned cravings a voice within me became more and more urgent this will not do this is not love where are your goddesses this is not love and i was unfaithful to my wife within four years of my marriage it was a sudden overpowering impulse but i suppose the ground had been preparing for a long time i forget now all the emotions of that adventure i suppose at the time it seemed beautiful and wonderful i do not excuse myself still less do i condemn myself i put the facts before you so it was  there were no children by your marriage  your line of thought doctor is too philoprogenitive we have had three my daughter was married two years ago she is in america one little boy died when he was three the other is in india taking up the mardipore power scheme again now that he is out of the army no it is simply that i was hopelessly disappointed with everything that a good woman and a decent marriage had to give me pure disappointment and vexation the anticlimax to an immense expectation built up throughout an imaginative boyhood and youth and early manhood i was shocked and ashamed at my own disappointment i thought it mean and base nevertheless this orderly household into which i had placed my life these almost methodical connubialities  he broke off in midsentence  dr martineau shook his head disapprovingly  no he said it wasnt fair to your wife  it was shockingly unfair i have always realized that ive done what i could to make things up to her heaven knows what counter disappointments she has concealed but it is no good arguing about rights and wrongs now this is not an apology for my life i am telling you what happened  not for me to judge said dr martineau go on  by marrying i had got nothing that my soul craved for i had satisfied none but the most transitory desires and i had incurred a tremendous obligation that obligation didnt restrain me from making desperate lunges at something vaguely beautiful that i felt was necessary to me but it did cramp and limit these lunges so my story flops down into the comedy of the lying cramped intrigues of a respectable married mani was still driven by my dream of some extravagantly beautiful inspiration called love and i sought it like an area sneak gods what a story it is when one brings it all together i couldnt believe that the glow and sweetness i dreamt of were not in the worldsomewhere hidden away from me i seemed to catch glimpses of the dear lost thing now in the corners of a smiling mouth now in dark eyes beneath a black smoke of hair now in a slim form seen against the sky often i cared nothing for the woman i made love to i cared for the thing she seemed to be hiding from me  sir richmonds voice altered  i dont see what possible good it can do to talk over these things he began to row and rowed perhaps a score of strokes then he stopped and the boat drove on with a whisper of water at the bow and over the outstretched oar blades  what a muddle and mockery the whole thing is he cried what a fumbling old fool old mother nature has been she drives us into indignity and dishonour and she doesnt even get the children which are her only excuse for her mischief see what a fantastic thing i am when you take the machine to pieces i have been a busy and responsible man throughout my life i have handled complicated public and industrial affairs not unsuccessfully and discharged quite big obligations fully and faithfully and all the time hidden away from the public eye my life has been laced by the thread of thesewhat can one call themlove adventures how many you ask i dont know never have i been a wholehearted lover never have i been able to leave love alone never has love left me alone  and as i am made said sir richmond with sudden insistence as i am madei do not believe that i could go on without these affairs i know that you will be disposed to dispute that  dr martineau made a reassuring noise  these affairs are at once unsatisfying and vitally necessary it is only latterly that i have begun to perceive this women make life for me whatever they touch or see or desire becomes worth while and otherwise it is not worth while whatever is lovely in my world whatever is delightful has been so conveyed to me by some woman without the vision they give me i should be a hard dry industry in the world a worker ant a soulless rage making much valuing nothing  he paused  you are i think abnormal considered the doctor  not abnormal excessive if you like without women i am a wasting fever of distressful toil without them there is no kindness in existence no rest no sort of satisfaction the world is a battlefield trenches barbed wire rain mud logical necessity and utter desolationwith nothing whatever worth fighting for whatever justifies effort whatever restores energy is hidden in women  an access of sex said dr martineau this is a phase  it is how i am made said sir richmond  a brief silence fell upon that dr martineau persisted it isnt how you are made we are getting to something in all this it is i insist a mood of how you are made a distinctive and indicative mood  sir richmond went on almost as if he soliloquized  i would go through it all again there are times when the love of women seems the only real thing in the world to me and always it remains the most real thing i do not know how far i may be a normal man or how far i may not be so to speak abnormally male but to me life has very little personal significance and no value or power until it has a woman as intermediary before life can talk to me and say anything that matters a woman must be present as a medium i dont mean that it has no significance mentally and logically i mean that irrationally and emotionally it has no significance works of art for example bore me literature bores me scenery bores me even the beauty of a woman bores me unless i find in it some association with a womans feeling it isnt that i cant tell for myself that a picture is fine or a mountain valley lovely but that it doesnt matter a rap to me whether it is or whether it isnt until there is a feminine response a sexual motif if you like to call it that coming in whatever there is of loveliness or pride in life doesnt live for me until somehow a woman comes in and breathes upon it the breath of life i cannot even rest until a woman makes holiday for me only one thing can i do without women and that is work joylessly but effectively and latterly for some reason that it is up to you to discover doctor even the power of work has gone from me  section 4  this afternoon brings back to me very vividly my previous visit here it was perhaps a dozen or fifteen years ago we rowed down this same backwater i can see my companions handshe had very pretty hands with rosy palmstrailing in the water and her shadowed face smiling quietly under her sunshade with little faint streaks of sunlight reflected from the ripples dancing and quivering across it she was one of those people who seem always to be happy and to radiate happiness  by ordinary standards said sir richmond she was a thoroughly bad lot she had about as much morality in the narrower sense of the word as a monkey and yet she stands out in my mind as one of the most honest women i have ever met she was certainly one of the kindest part of that effect of honesty may have been due to her open brow her candid blue eyes the smiling frankness of her manner butno she was really honest  we drifted here as we are doing now she pulled at the sweet rushes and crushed them in her hand she adds a remembered brightness to this afternoon  honest friendly of all the women i have known this woman who was here with me came nearest to being my friend you know what we call virtue in a woman is a tremendous handicap to any real friendliness with a man until she gets to an age when virtue and fidelity are no longer urgent practical concerns a good woman by the very definition of feminine goodness isnt truly herself over a vast extent of her being she is reserved she suppresses a vast amount of her being holds back denies hides on the other hand there is a frankness and honesty in openly bad women arising out of the admitted fact that they are bad that they hide no treasure from you they have no peculiarly precious and delicious secrets to keep and no poverty to conceal intellectually they seem to be more manly and vigorous because they are as people say unsexed many old women thoroughly respectable old women have the same quality because they have gone out of the personal sex business havent you found that  i have never said the doctor known what you call an openly bad womanat least at all intimately  sir richmond looked with quick curiosity at his companion you have avoided them  they dont attract me  they repel you  for me said the doctor for any friendliness a woman must be modest my habits of thought are oldfashioned i suppose but the mere suggestion about a woman that there were no barriers no reservation that in any fashion she might more than meet me half way  his facial expression completed his sentence  now i wonder whispered sir richmond and hesitated for a moment before he carried the great research into the explorers country you are afraid of women he said with a smile to mitigate the impertinence  i respect them  an element of fear  well i am afraid of them then put it that way if you like anyhow i do not let myself go with them i have never let myself go  you lose something you lose a reality of insight  there was a thoughtful interval  having found so excellent a friend said the doctor why did you ever part from her  sir richmond seemed indisposed to answer but dr martineaus face remained slantingly interrogative he had found the effective counterattack and he meant to press it i was jealous of her sir richmond admitted i couldnt stand that side of it  section 5  after a meditative silence the doctor became briskly professional again  you care for your wife he said you care very much for your wife she is as you say your great obligation and you are a man to respect obligations i grasp that then you tell me of these women who have come and gone about them too you are perfectly frank there remains someone else sir richmond stared at his physician  well he said and laughed i didnt pretend to have made my autobiography anything more than a sketch  no but there is a special person the current person  i havent dilated on my present situation i admit  from some little things that have dropped from you i should say there is a child  that said sir richmond after a brief pause is a good guess  not older than three  two years and a half  you and this lady who is i guess young are separated at any rate you cant go to her that leaves you at loose ends because for some time for two or three years at least you have ceased to behow shall i put itan emotional wanderer  i begin to respect your psychoanalysis  hence your overwhelming sense of the necessity of feminine companionship for weary men i guess she is a very jolly companion to be with amusing restfulinteresting  hm said sir richmond i think that is a fair description when she cares that is when she is in good form  which she isnt at present hazarded the doctor he exploded a mine of longpent exasperation  she is the clumsiest hand at keeping well that i have ever known health is a womans primary duty but she is incapable of the most elementary precautions she is maddeningly receptive to every infection at the present moment when i am ill when i am in urgent need of help and happiness she has let that wretched child get measles and she herself wont let me go near her because she has got something disfiguring something nobody else could ever have or think of having called carbuncle carbuncle  it is very painful said dr martineau no doubt it is said sir richmond  no doubt it is his voice grew bitter he spoke with deliberation a perfectly aimless useless illnessand as painful as it can be  he spoke as if he slammed a door viciously and indeed he had slammed a door the doctor realized that for the present there was no more selfdissection to be got from sir richmond  for some time sir richmond had been keeping the boat close up to the foaming weir to the left of the lock by an occasional stroke now with a general air of departure he swung the boat round and began to row down stream towards the bridge and the radiant hotel  time we had tea he said  section 6  after tea dr martineau left sir richmond in a chair upon the lawn brooding darklyapparently over the crime of the carbuncle the doctor went to his room ostensibly to write a couple of letters and put on a dinner jacket but really to make a few notes of the afternoons conversation and meditate over his impressions while they were fresh  his room proffered a comfortable armchair and into this he sank a number of very discrepant things were busy in his mind he had experienced a disconcerting personal attack there was a whirl of active resentment in the confusion  apologetics of a rake he tried presently  a common type stripped of his intellectual dressing every third manufacturer from the midlands or the north has some such undertow of affairs a physiological uneasiness an imaginative laxity the temptations of the trip to londonweakness masquerading as a psychological necessity the lady of the carbuncle seems to have got rather a hold upon him she has kept him in order for three or four years  the doctor scrutinized his own remarks with a judicious expression  i am not being fair he ruffled me even if it is true as i said that every third manufacturer from the midlands is in much the same case as he is that does not dismiss the case it makes it a more important one much more important it makes it a type case with the exceptional quality of being selfexpressive almost too selfexpressive  sir richmond does after all make out a sort of case for himself  a valid case  the doctor sat deep in his chair frowning judicially with the fingers of one hand apposed to the fingers of the other he makes me bristle because all his life and ideas challenge my way of living but if i eliminate the personal element  he pulled a sheet of notepaper towards him and began to jot down notes with a silvercased pencil soon he discontinued writing and sat tapping his pencilcase on the table the amazing selfishness of his attitude i do not think that oncenot oncehas he judged any woman except as a contributor to his energy and peace of mind except in the case of his wife  for her his habit of respect was formed before his ideas developed  that i think explains her  what was his phrase about the unfortunate young woman with the carbuncle totally useless and unnecessary illness was it  now has a man any right by any standards to use women as this man has used them  by any standards  the doctor frowned and nodded his head slowly with the corners of his mouth drawn in  for some years now an intellectual reverie had been playing an increasing part in the good doctors life he was writing this book of his writing it very deliberately and laboriously the psychology of a new age but much more was he dreaming and thinking about this book its publication was to mark an epoch in human thought and human affairs generally and create a considerable flutter of astonishment in the doctors own little world it was to bring home to people some various aspects of one very startling proposition that human society had arrived at a phase when the complete restatement of its fundamental ideas had become urgently necessary a phase when the slow inadequate partial adjustments to two centuries of changing conditions had to give place to a rapid reconstruction of new fundamental ideas and it was a fact of great value in the drama of these secret dreams that the directive force towards this fundamentally reconstructed world should be the pen of an unassuming harley street physician hitherto not suspected of any great excesses of enterprise  the written portions of this book were already in a highly polished state they combined a limitless freedom of proposal with a smooth urbanity of manner a tacit denial that the thoughts of one intelligent being could possibly be shocking to another upon this the doctor was very insistent conduct he held could never be sufficiently discreet thought could never be sufficiently free as a citizen one had to treat a law or an institution as a thing as rigidly right as a natural law that the social wellbeing demands but as a scientific man in ones stated thoughts and in public discussion the case was altogether different there was no offence in any possible hypothesis or in the contemplation of any possibility just as when one played a game one was bound to play in unquestioning obedience to the laws and spirit of the game but if one was not playing that game then there was no reason why one should not contemplate the completest reversal of all its methods and the alteration and abandonment of every rule correctness of conduct the doctor held was an imperative concomitant of all really free thinking revolutionary speculation is one of those things that must be divorced absolutely from revolutionary conduct it was to the neglect of these obvious principles as the doctor considered them that the general muddle in contemporary marital affairs was very largely due we left divorcelaw revision to exposed adulterers and marriage reform to hot adolescents and craving spinsters driven by the furies within them to assertions that established nothing and to practical demonstrations that only left everybody thoroughly uncomfortable far better to leave all these matters to calm patient men in easy chairs weighing typical cases impartially ready to condone indisposed to envy  in return for which restraint on the part of the eager and adventurous the calm patient man was prepared in his thoughts to fly high and go far without giving any guarantee of course that he might not ultimately return to the comfortable point of inaction from which he started  in sir richmond dr martineau found the most interesting and encouraging confirmation of the fundamental idea of the psychology of a new age the immediate need of new criteria of conduct altogether here was a man whose life was evidently ruled by standards that were at once very high and very generous he was overworking himself to the pitch of extreme distress and apparently he was doing this for ends that were essentially unselfish manifestly there were many things that an ordinary industrial or political magnate would do that sir richmond would not dream of doing and a number of things that such a man would not feel called upon to do that he would regard as imperative duties and mixed up with so much fine intention and fine conduct was this disreputable streak of intrigue and this extraordinary claim that such misconduct was necessary to continued vigour of action  to energy of thought it is not necessary said dr martineau and considered for a time yetcertainlyi am not a man of action i admit it i make few decisions  the chapters of the psychology of a new age dealing with women were still undrafted but they had already greatly exercised the doctors mind he found now that the case of sir richmond had stirred his imagination he sat with his hands apposed his head on one side and an expression of great intellectual contentment on his face while these emancipated ideas gave a sort of gala performance in his mind  the good doctor did not dislike women he had always guarded himself very carefully against misogyny but he was very strongly disposed to regard them as much less necessary in the existing scheme of things than was generally assumed women he conceded had laid the foundations of social life through their contrivances and sacrifices and patience the fierce and lonely patriarchal familyherd of a male and his women and off spring had grown into the clan and tribe the woven tissue of related families that constitute the human comity had been woven by the subtle persistent protection of sons and daughters by their mothers against the intolerant jealous possessive old man but that was a thing of the remote past little was left of those ancient struggles now but a few infantile dreams and nightmares the greater human community human society was made for good and being made it had taken over the ancient tasks of the woman one by one until now in its modern forms it cherished more sedulously than she did it educated it housed and comforted it clothed and served and nursed leaving the wife privileged honoured protected for the sake of tasks she no longer did and of a burthen she no longer bore progress has trivialized women said the doctor and made a note of the word for later consideration  and woman has trivialized civilization the doctor tried  she has retained her effect of being central she still makes the social atmosphere she raises mens instinctive hopes of help and direction except the doctor stipulated for a few highly developed modern types most men found the sense of achieving her a necessary condition for sustained exertion and there is no direction in her any more  she spends said the doctor she just spends she spends excitingly and competitively for her own pride and glory she drives all the energy of men over the weirs of gain  what are we to do with the creature whispered the doctor  apart from the procreative necessity was woman an unavoidable evil the doctors untrammelled thoughts began to climb high spin nose dive and loop the loop nowadays we took a proper care of the young we had no need for high birth rates quite a small proportion of women with a gift in that direction could supply all the offspring that the world wanted given the power of determining sex that science was slowly winning today and why should we have so many women about a drastic elimination of the creatures would be quite practicable a fantastic world to a vulgar imagination no doubt but to a calmly reasonable mind by no means fantastic but this was where the case of sir richmond became so interesting was it really true that the companionship of women was necessary to these energetic creative types was it the fact that the drive of life towards action as distinguished from contemplation arose out of sex and needed to be refreshed by the reiteration of that motive it was a plausible proposition it marched with all the doctors ideas of natural selection and of the conditions of a survival that have made us what we are it was in tune with the freudian analyses  sex not only a renewal of life in the species noted the doctors silver pencil sex may be also a renewal of energy in the individual  after some musing he crossed out sex and wrote above it sexual love  that is practically what he claims dr martineau said in which case we want the completest revision of all our standards of sexual obligation we want a new system of restrictions and imperatives altogether  it was a fixed idea of the doctors that women were quite incapable of producing ideas in the same way that men do but he believed that with suitable encouragement they could be induced to respond quite generously to such ideas suppose therefore we really educated the imaginations of women suppose we turned their indubitable capacity for service towards social and political creativeness not in order to make them the rivals of men in these fields but their moral and actual helpers a man of this sort wants a mistressmother said the doctor he wants a sort of woman who cares more for him and his work and honour than she does for child or home or clothes or personal pride  but are there such women can there be such a woman  his work needs to be very fine to deserve her help but admitting its fineness  the alternative seems to be to teach the sexes to get along without each other  a neutralized world a separated world how we should jostle in the streets but the early christians have tried it already the thing is impossible  very well then we have to make women more responsible again in a new capacity we have to educate them far more seriously as sources of energyas guardians and helpers of men and we have to suppress them far more rigorously as tempters and dissipaters instead of mothering babies they have to mother the race  a vision of women made responsible floated before his eyes  is that man working better since you got hold of him if not why not  or againjane smith was charged with neglecting her lover to the common danger the inspector said the man was in a pitiful state morally quite uncombed and infested with vulgar showy ideas  the doctor laughed telescoped his pencil and stood up  section 7  it became evident after dinner that sir richmond also had been thinking over the afternoons conversation  he and dr martineau sat in widearmed cane chairs on the lawn with a wickerwork table bearing coffee cups and little glasses between them a few other diners chatted and whispered about similar tables but not too close to our talkers to disturb them the dining room behind them had cleared its tables and depressed its illumination the moon in its first quarter hung above the sunset sank after twilight shone brighter and brighter among the western trees and presently had gone leaving the sky to an increasing multitude of stars the maidenhead river wearing its dusky blue draperies and its jewels of light had recovered all the magic sir richmond had stripped from it in the afternoon the grave arches of the bridge made complete circles by the reflexion of the water sustained as if by some unifying and justifying reason the erratic flat flashes and streaks and glares of traffic that fretted to and fro overhead a voice sang intermittently and a banjo tinkled but remotely enough to be indistinct and agreeable  after all sir richmond began abruptly the search for some sort of sexual modus vivendi is only a means to an end one does not want to live for sex but only through sex the main thing in my life has always been my work this afternoon under the maidenhead influence i talked too much of sex i babbled of things one doesnt usually  it was very illuminating said the doctor  no doubt but a temporary phase it is the defective bearing talks just nowi happen to be irritated  the darkness concealed a faint smile on the doctors face  the work is the thing said sir richmond so long as one can keep ones grip on it  what said the doctor after a pause leaning back and sending wreaths of smoke up towards the stardusted zenith what is your idea of your work i mean how do you see it in relation to yourselfand things generally  put in the most general terms  put in the most general terms  i wonder if i can put it in general terms for you at all it is hard to put something one is always thinking about in general terms or to think of it as a whole now fuel  i suppose it was my fathers business interests that pushed me towards specialization in fuel he wanted me to have a thoroughly scientific training in days when a scientific training was less easy to get for a boy than it is today and much more inspiring when you got it my mind was framed so to speak in geology and astronomical physics i grew up to think on that scale just as a man who has been trained in history and law grows to think on the scale of the roman empire i dont know what your pocket map of the universe is the map i mean by which you judge all sorts of other general ideas to me this planet is a little ball of oxides and nickel steel life a sort of tarnish on its surface and we the minutest particles in that tarnish who can nevertheless in some unaccountable way take in the idea of this universe as one whole who begin to dream of taking control of it  that is not a bad statement of the scientific point of view i suppose i have much the same general idea of the world on rather more psychological lines  we think i suppose said sir richmond of life as something that is only just beginning to be aware of what it isand what it might be  exactly said the doctor good  he went on eagerly that is precisely how i see it you and i are just particles in the tarnish as you call it who are becoming dimly awake to what we are to what we have in common only a very few of us have got as far even as this these others here for example  he indicated the rest of maidenhead by a movement  desire mutual flattery egotistical dreams greedy solicitudes fill them up they havent begun to get out of themselves  we i suppose have doubted sir richmond  we have  the doctor had no doubt he lay back in his chair with his hands behind his head and his smoke ascending vertically to heaven with the greatest contentment he began quoting himself this getting out of ones individualitythis conscious getting out of ones individualityis one of the most important and interesting aspects of the psychology of the new age that is now dawning as compared with any previous age unconsciously of course every true artist every philosopher every scientific investigator so far as his art or thought went has always got out of himselfhas forgotten his personal interests and become man thinking for the whole race and intimations of the same thing have been at the heart of most religions but now people are beginning to get this detachment without any distinctively religious feeling or any distinctive aesthetic or intellectual impulse as if it were a plain matter of fact plain matter of fact that we are only incidentally ourselves that really each one of us is also the whole species is really indeed all life  a part of it  an integral partas sight is part of a man with no absolute separation from all the restno more than a separation of the imagination the whole so far as his distinctive quality goes i do not know how this takes shape in your mind sir richmond but to me this idea of actually being life itself upon the world a special phase of it dependent upon and connected with all other phases and of being one of a small but growing number of people who apprehend that and want to live in the spirit of that is quite central it is my fundamental idea wethis small but growing minorityconstitute that part of life which knows and wills and tries to rule its destiny this new realization the new psychology arising out of it is a fact of supreme importance in the history of life it is like the appearance of selfconsciousness in some creature that has not hitherto had selfconsciousness and so far as we are concerned we are the true kingship of the world necessarily we who know are the true kingi wonder how this appeals to you it is stuff i have thought out very slowly and carefully and written and approved it is the very core of my life and yet when one comes to say these things to someone else face to face it is much more difficult to say than to write  sir richmond noted how the doctors chair creaked as he rolled to and fro with the uneasiness of these intimate utterances  i agree said sir richmond presently one does think in this fashion something in this fashion what one calls ones work does belong to something much bigger than ourselves  something much bigger he expanded  which something we become the doctor urged in so far as our work takes hold of us  sir richmond made no answer to this for a little while of course we trail a certain egotism into our work he said  could we do otherwise but it has ceased to be purely egotism it is no longer i am i but i am part one wants to be an honourable part  you think of man upon his planet the doctor pursued i think of life rather as a mind that tries itself over in millions and millions of trials but it works out to the same thing  i think in terms of fuel said sir richmond  he was still debating the doctors generalization i suppose it would be true to say that i think of myself as mankind on his planet with very considerable possibilities and with only a limited amount of fuel at his disposal to achieve them yes i agree that i think in that way i have not thought much before of the way in which i think about thingsbut i agree that it is in that way whatever enterprises mankind attempts are limited by the sum total of that store of fuel upon the planet that is very much in my mind besides that he has nothing but his annual allowance of energy from the sun  i thought that presently we were to get unlimited energy from atoms said the doctor  i dont believe in that as a thing immediately practicable no doubt getting a supply of energy from atoms is a theoretical possibility just as flying was in the time of daedalus probably there were actual attempts at some sort of glider in ancient crete but before we get to the actual utilization of atomic energy there will be ten thousand difficult corners to turn we may have to wait three or four thousand years for it we cannot count on it we havent it in hand there may be some impasse all we have surely is coal and oilthere is no surplus of wood nowonly an annual growth and waterpower is income also doled out day by day we cannot anticipate it coal and oil are our only capital they are all we have for great important efforts they are a gift to mankind to use to some supreme end or to waste in trivialities coal is the key to metallurgy and oil to transit when they are done we shall either have built up such a fabric of apparatus knowledge and social organization that we shall be able to manage without themor we shall have travelled a long way down the slopes of waste towards extinction today in getting in distribution in use we waste enormouslyas we sit here all the world is wasting fuel fantastically  just as mentallyeducationally we waste the doctor interjected  and my job is to stop what i can of that waste to do what i can to organize first of all sane fuel getting and then sane fuel using and that second proposition carries us far into the whole use we are making of life  first things first said sir richmond if we set about getting fuel sanely if we do it as the deliberate cooperative act of the whole species then it follows that we shall look very closely into the use that is being made of it when all the fuel getting is brought into one view as a common interest then it follows that all the fuel burning will be brought into one view at present we are getting fuel in a kind of scramble with no general aim we waste and lose almost as much as we get and of what we get the waste is idiotic  i wont trouble you said sir richmond with any long discourse on the ways of getting fuel in this country but land as you know is owned in patches and stretches that were determined in the first place chiefly by agricultural necessities when it was divided up among its present owners nobody was thinking about the minerals beneath but the lawyers settled long ago that the landowner owned his land right down to the centre of the earth so we have the superficial landlord as coal owner trying to work his coal according to the superficial divisions quite irrespective of the lie of the coal underneath each man goes for the coal under his own land in his own fashion you get three shafts where one would suffice and none of them in the best possible place you get the coal coming out of this point when it would be far more convenient to bring it out at thatmiles away you get boundary walls of coal between the estates abandoned left in the ground for ever and each coal owner sells his coal in his own pettifogging manner but you know of these things you know too how we trail the coal all over the country spoiling it as we trail it until at last we get it into the silly coal scuttles beside the silly wasteful airpoisoning fogcreating fireplace  and this stuff said sir richmond bringing his hand down so smartly on the table that the startled coffee cups cried out upon the tray was given to men to give them power over metals to get knowledge with to get more power with  the oil story i suppose is as bad  the oil story is worse  there is a sort of cant said sir richmond in a fierce parenthesis that the supplies of oil are inexhaustiblethat you can muddle about with oil anyhow optimism of knaves and imbeciles they dont want to be pulled up by any sane considerations  for some moments he kept silenceas if in unspeakable commination  here i am with some clearness of visionmy only gift not very clever with a natural bad temper and a strong sexual bias doing what i can to get a broader handling of the fuel questionas a common interest for all mankind and i find myself up against a lot of men subtle men sharp men obstinate men prejudiced men able to get round me able to get over me able to blockade me clever menyes and all of them ultimately damnedoh utterly damnedfools coal owners who think only of themselves solicitors who think backwards politicians who think like a game of catscradle not a gleam of generosity not a gleam  what particularly are you working for asked the doctor  i want to get the whole business of the worlds fuel discussed and reported upon as one affair so that some day it may be handled as one affair in the general interest  the world did you say you meant the empire  no the world it is all one system now you cant work it in bits i want to call in foreign representatives from the beginning  advisoryconsultative  no with powers these things interlock now internationally both through labour and finance the sooner we scrap this nonsense about an autonomous british empire complete in itself contra mundum the better for us a world control is fifty years overdue hence these disorders  stillits rather a difficult proposition as things are  oh lord dont i know its difficult cried sir richmond in the tone of one who swears dont i know that perhaps its impossible but its the only way to do it therefore i say lets try to get it done and everybody says difficult difficult and nobody lifts a finger to try and the only real difficulty is that everybody for one reason or another says that its difficult its against human nature granted every decent thing is its socialism who cares along this line of comprehensive scientific control the world has to go or it will retrogress it will muddle and rot  i agree said dr martineau  so i want a report to admit that distinctly i want it to go further than that i want to get the beginnings the germ of a world administration i want to set up a permanent world commission of scientific men and economistswith powers just as considerable powers as i can give themtheyll be feeble powers at the bestbut still some sort of say in the whole fuel supply of the world a saythat may grow at last to a control a right to collect reports and receive accounts for example to begin with and then the right to make recommendations you see no the international part is not the most difficult part of it but my beastly owners and their beastly lawyers wont relinquish a scrap of what they call their freedom of action and my labour men because im a fairly big coal owner myself sit and watch and suspect me too stupid to grasp what i am driving at and too incompetent to get out a scheme of their own they want a world control on scientific lines even less than the owners they try to think that fuel production can carry an unlimited wages bill and the owners try to think that it can pay unlimited profits and when i say this business is something more than a scramble for profits and wages its a service and a common interest they stare at me sir richmond was at a loss for an image like a committee in a thieves kitchen when someone has casually mentioned the law  but will you ever get your permanent commission  it can be done if i can stick it out  but with the whole committee against you  the curious thing is that the whole committee isnt against me every individual is  sir richmond found it difficult to express the psychology of my committee ought to interest you it is probably a fair sample of the way all sorts of things are going nowadays its curious there is not a man on that committee who is quite comfortable within himself about the particular individual end he is there to serve its there i get them they pursue their own ends bitterly and obstinately i admit but they are bitter and obstinate because they pursue them against an internal oppositionwhich is on my side they are terrified to think if once they stopped fighting me how far they might not have to go with me  a suppressed world conscience in fact this marches very closely with my own ideas  a world conscience world conscience i dont know but i do know that there is this drive in nearly every member of the committee some drive anyhow towards the decent thing it is the same drive that drives me but i am the most driven it has turned me round it hasnt turned them i go east and they go west and they dont want to be turned round tremendously they dont  creative undertow said dr martineau making notes as it were an increasing force in modern life in the psychology of a new age strengthened by educationit may play a directive part  they fight every little point but you see because of this creative undertowif you like to call it thatwe do get along i am leader or whipperin it is hard to say which of a bolting flocki believe they will report for a permanent world commission i believe i have got them up to that but they will want to make it a bureau of this league of nations and i have the profoundest distrust of this league of nations it may turn out to be a sort of sidetracking arrangement for all sorts of important world issues and they will find they have to report for some sort of control but there again they will shy they will report for it and then they will do their utmost to whittle it down again they will refuse it the most reasonable powers they will alter the composition of the committee so as to make it innocuous  how  get rid of the independent scientific men load it up so far as britain is concerned with muck of the colonial politician type and tame labour representatives balance with shady new adventurer millionaires get in still shadier stuff from abroad let these gentry appoint their own tame experts after their own heartsexperts who will make merely advisory reports which will not be published  they want in fact to keep the old system going under the cloak of your committee reduced to a cloak and nothing more  that is what it amounts to they want to have the air of doing rightindeed they do want to have the feel of doing rightand still leave things just exactly what they were before and as i suffer under the misfortune of seeing the thing rather more clearly i have to shepherd the conscience of the whole committee but there is a conscience there if i can hold out myself i can hold the committee  he turned appealingly to the doctor why should i have to be the conscience of that damned committee why should i do this exhausting inhuman job in their hearts these others know only they wont know why should it fall on me  you have to go through with it said dr martineau  i have to go through with it but its a hell of utterly inglorious squabbling they bait me they have been fighting the same fight within themselves that they fight with me they know exactly where i am that i too am doing my job against internal friction the one thing before all others that they want to do is to bring me down off my moral high horse and i loathe the high horse i am in a position of special moral superiority to men who are on the whole as good men as i am or better that shows all the time you see the sort of man i am ive a broad streak of personal vanity i fag easily im shorttempered ive other things as you perceive when i fag i become obtuse i repeat and bore i get viciously illtempered i suffer from an intolerable sense of ill usage then that ass wagstaffe who ought to be working with me steadily sees his chance to be pleasantly witty he gets a laugh round the table at my expense young dent the more intelligent of the labour men reads me a lecture in committee manners old cassidy sees his opening and jabs some ridiculous petty accusation at me and gets me spluttering selfdefence like a fool all my stock goes down and as my stock goes down the chances of a good report dwindle young dent grieves to see me injuring my own case too damned a fool to see what will happen to the report you see if only they can convince themselves i am just a prig and an egotist and an impractical bore they escape from a great deal more than my poor propositions they escape from the doubt in themselves by dismissing me they dismiss their own consciences and then they can scamper off and be sensible little piggywigs and not bother any more about what is to happen to mankind in the long run do you begin to realize the sort of fight upside down in a dustbin that that committee is for me  you have to go through with it dr martineau repeated  i have if i can but i warn you i have been near breaking point and if i tumble off the high horse if i cant keep going regularly there to ride the moral high horse that committee will slump into utter scoundrelism it will turn out a long inconsistent botched unreadable report that will back up all sorts of humbugging bargains and sham settlements it will contain some halfbaked scheme to pacify the miners at the expense of the general welfare it wont even succeed in doing that but in the general confusion old cassidy will get away with a series of hauls that may run into millions which will last his timedamn him and that is where we are oh i know i know i must do this job i dont need any telling that my life will be nothing and mean nothing unless i bring this thing through  but the thanklessness of playing this lone hand  the doctor watched his friends resentful black silhouette against the lights on the steely river and said nothing for awhile  why did i ever undertake to play it sir richmond appealed why has it been put upon me seeing what a poor thing i am why am i not a poor thing altogether  section 8  i think i understand that loneliness of yours said the doctor after an interval  i am intolerable to myself  and i think it explains why it is that you turn to women as you do you want help you want reassurance and you feel they can give it  i wonder if it has been quite like that sir richmond reflected  by an effort dr martineau refrained from mentioning the mother complex you want help and reassurance as a child does he said women and women alone seem capable of giving that of telling you that you are surely right that notwithstanding your blunders you are right that even when you are wrong it doesnt so much matter you are still in spirit right they can show their belief in you as no man can with all their being they can do that  yes i suppose they could  they can you have said already that women are necessary to make things real for you  not my work said sir richmond i admit that it might be like that but it isnt like that it has not worked out like that the two drives go on side by side in me they have no logical connexion all i can say is that for me with my bifid temperament one makes a rest from the other and is so far refreshment and a renewal of energy but i do not find women coming into my work in any effectual way  the doctor reflected further i suppose he began and stopped short  he heard sir richmond move in his chair creaking an interrogation  you have never said the doctor turned to the idea of god  sir richmond grunted and made no other answer for the better part of a minute  as dr martineau waited for his companion to speak a falling star streaked the deep blue above them  i cant believe in a god said sir richmond  something after the fashion of a god said the doctor insidiously  no said sir richmond nothing that reassures  but this loneliness this craving for companionship  we have all been through that said sir richmond we have all in our time lain very still in the darkness with our souls crying out for the fellowship of god demanding some sign some personal response the faintest feeling of assurance would have satisfied us  and there has never been a response  have you ever had a response  once i seemed to have a feeling of exaltation and security  well  perhaps i only persuaded myself that i had i had been reading william james on religious experiences and i was thinking very much of conversion i tried to experience conversion  yes  it faded  it always fades said sir richmond with anger in his voice i wonder how many people there are nowadays who have passed through this last experience of ineffectual invocation this appeal to the fading shadow of a vanished god in the night in utter loneliness answer me speak to me does he answer in the silence you hear the little blood vessels whisper in your ears you see a faint glow of colour on the darkness  dr martineau sat without a word  i can believe that over all things righteousness rules i can believe that but righteousness is not friendliness nor mercy nor comfort nor any such dear and intimate things this cuddling up to righteousness it is a dream a delusion and a phase ive tried all that long ago ive given it up long ago ive grown out of it men doafter forty our souls were made in the squattingplace of the submen of ancient times they are made out of primitive needs and they die before our bodies as those needs are satisfied only young people have souls complete the need for a personal god feared but reassuring is a youths need i no longer fear the old man nor want to propitiate the old man nor believe he matters any more im a bit of an old man myself i discover yes but the other thing still remains  the great mother of the gods said dr martineaustill clinging to his theories  the need of the woman said sir richmond i want mating because it is my nature to mate i want fellowship because i am a social animal and i want it from another social animal not from any godany inconceivable god who fades and disappears no  perhaps that other need will fade presently i do not know perhaps it lasts as long as life does how can i tell  he was silent for a little while then his voice sounded in the night as if he spoke to himself but as for the god of all things consoling and helping imagine it that up therehaving fellowship with me i would as soon think of cooling my throat with the milky way or shaking hands with those stars     chapter the fifth  in the land of the forgotten peoples   section 1  a gust of confidence on the part of a person naturally or habitually reserved will often be followed by a phase of recoil at breakfast next morning their overnight talk seemed to both sir richmond and dr martineau like something each had dreamt about the other a quite impossible excess of intimacy they discussed the weather which seemed to be settling down to the utmost serenity of which the english spring is capable they talked of sir richmonds coming car and of the possible routes before them sir richmond produced the michelin maps which he had taken out of the pockets of the little charmeuse the bath road lay before them he explained reading newbury hungerford marlborough silbury hill which overhangs avebury both travellers discovered a common excitement at the mention of avebury and silbury hill both took an intelligent interest in archaeology both had been greatly stimulated by the recent work of elliot smith and rivers upon what was then known as the heliolithic culture it had revived their interest in avebury and stonehenge the doctor moreover had been reading hippisley coxs green roads of england  neither gentleman had ever seen avebury but dr martineau had once visited stonehenge  avebury is much the oldest said the doctor they must have made silbury hill long before 2000 bc it may be five thousand years old or even more it is the most important historical relic in the british isles and the most neglected  they exchanged archaeological facts the secret places of the heart rested until the afternoon  then sir richmond saw fit to amplify his confessions in one particular  section 2  the doctor and his patient had discovered a need for exercise as the morning advanced they had walked by the road to marlow and had lunched at a riverside inn returning after a restful hour in an arbour on the lawn of this place to tea at maidenhead it was as they returned that sir richmond took up the thread of their overnight conversation again  in the night he said i was thinking over the account i tried to give you of my motives a lot of it was terribly out of drawing  facts asked the doctor  no the facts were all right it was the atmosphere the proportions i dont know if i gave you the effect of something don juanesque  vulgar poem said the doctor remarkably i discounted that  vulgar  intolerable byron in sexual psychology is like a stink in a kitchen  sir richmond perceived he had struck upon the sort of thing that used to be called a pet aversion  i dont want you to think that i run about after women in an habitual and systematic manner or that i deliberately hunt them in the interests of my work and energy your questions had set me theorizing about myself and i did my best to improvise a scheme of motives yesterday it was i perceive a jerrybuilt scheme run up at short notice my nocturnal reflections convinced me of that i put reason into things that are essentially instinctive the truth is that the wanderings of desire have no single drive all sorts of motives come in high and low down to sheer vulgar imitativeness and competitiveness what was true in it all was this that a man with any imagination in a fatigue phase falls naturally into these complications because they are more attractive to his type and far easier and more refreshing to the mind at the outset than anything else and they do work a sort of recovery in him they send him back to his work refreshedso far that is as his work is concerned  at the outset they are easier said the doctor  sir richmond laughed when one is fagged it is only the outset counts the more tired one is the more readily one moves along the line of least resistance  that is one footnote to what i said so far as the motive of my work goes i think we got something like the spirit of it what i said about that was near the truth of things  but there is another set of motives altogether sir richmond went on with an air of having cleared the ground for his real business that i didnt go into at all yesterday  he considered it arises out of these other affairs before you realize it your affections are involved i am a man much swayed by my affections  mr martineau glanced at him there was a note of genuine selfreproach in sir richmonds voice  i get fond of people it is quite irrational but i get fond of them which is quite a different thing from the admiration and excitement of falling in love almost the opposite thing they cry or they come some mental or physical cropper and hurt themselves or they do something distressingly little and human and suddenly i find theyve got me im distressed im filled with something between pity and an impulse of responsibility i become tender towards them i am impelled to take care of them i want to ease them off to reassure them to make them stop hurting at any cost i dont see why it should be the weak and sickly and seamy side of people that grips me most but it is i dont know why it should be their failures that gives them power over me but it is i told you of this girl this mistress of mine who is ill just now shes got me in that way shes got me tremendously  you did not speak of her yesterday with any morbid excess of pity the doctor was constrained to remark  i abused her very probably i forget exactly what i said  the doctor offered no assistance  but the reason why i abuse her is perfectly plain i abuse her because she distresses me by her misfortunes and instead of my getting anything out of her i go out to her but i do go out to her all this time at the back of my mind i am worrying about her she has that gift of making one feel for her i am feeling that damned carbuncle almost as if it had been my affair instead of hers  that carbuncle has made me suffer frightfully why should i it isnt mine  he regarded the doctor earnestly the doctor controlled a strong desire to laugh  i suppose the young lady he began  oh she puts in suffering all right ive no doubt about that  i suppose sir richmond went on now that i have told you so much of this affair i may as well tell you all it is a sort of comedy a painful comedy of irrelevant affections  the doctor was prepared to be a good listener facts he would always listen to it was only when people told him their theories that he would interrupt with his exactly  this young woman is a person of considerable genius i dont know if you have seen in the illustrated papers a peculiar sort of humorous illustrations usually with a considerable amount of bite in them over the name of martin leeds  extremely amusing stuff  it is that martin leeds i met her at the beginning of her career she talks almost as well as she draws she amused me immensely im not the sort of man who waylays and besieges women and girls im not the pursuing type but i perceived that in some odd way i attracted her and i was neither wise enough nor generous enough not to let the thing develop  hm said dr martineau  id never had to do with an intellectually brilliant woman before i see now that the more imaginative force a woman has the more likely she is to get into a state of extreme selfabandonment with any male thing upon which her imagination begins to crystallize before i came along shed mixed chiefly with a lot of young artists and students all doing nothing at all except talk about the things they were going to do i suppose i profited by the contrast being older and with my hands full of affairs perhaps something had happened that had made her recoil towards my sort of thing i dont know but she just let herself go at me  and you  let myself go too id never met anything like her before it was her wit took me it didnt occur to me that she wasnt my contemporary and as able as i was as able to take care of herself all sorts of considerations that i should have shown to a sillier woman i never dreamt of showing to her i had never met anyone so mentally brilliant before or so helpless and headlong and so here we are on each others hands  but the child  it happened to us for four years now things have just happened to us all the time i have been overworking first at explosives and now at this fuel business she too is full of her work  nothing stops that though everything seems to interfere with it and in a distraught preoccupied way we are abominably fond of each other fond is the word but we are both too busy to look after either ourselves or each other  she is much more incapable than i am said sir richmond as if he delivered a weighed and very important judgment  you see very much of each other  she has a flat in chelsea and a little cottage in south cornwall and we sometimes snatch a few days together away somewhere in surrey or up the thames or at such a place as southend where one is lost in a crowd of inconspicuous people then things go wellthey usually go well at the startwe are glorious companions she is happy she is creative she will light up a new place with flashes of humour with a keenness of appreciation  but things do not always go well  things said sir richmond with the deliberation of a man who measures his words are apt to go wrong at the flat there is constant trouble with the servants they bully her a woman is more entangled with servants than a man women in that position seem to resent the work and freedom of other women her servants wont leave her in peace as they would leave a man they make trouble for her and when we have had a few days anywhere away even if nothing in particular has gone wrong  sir richmond stopped short  when they go wrong it is generally her fault the doctor sounded  almost always  but if they dont said the psychiatrist  it is difficult to describe the essential incompatibility of the whole thing comes out  the doctor maintained his expression of intelligent interest  she wants to go on with her work she is able to work anywhere all she wants is just cardboard and ink my mind on the other hand turns back to the fuel commission  then any little thing makes trouble  any little thing makes trouble and we always drift round to the same discussion whether we ought really to go on together  it is you begin that  yes i start that you see she is perfectly contented when i am about she is as fond of me as i am of her  fonder perhaps  i dont know but she isadhesive emotionally adhesive all she wants to do is just to settle down when i am there and go on with her work but then you see there is my work  exactly after all it seems to me that your great trouble is not in yourselves but in social institutions which havent yet fitted themselves to people like you two it is the sense of uncertainty makes her as you say adhesive nervously so if we were indeed living in a new age instead of the moral ruins of a shattered one  we cant alter the age we live in said sir richmond a little testily  no exactly but we can realize in any particular situation that it is not the individuals to blame but the misfit of ideas and forms and prejudices  no said sir richmond obstinately rejecting this pacifying suggestion she could adapt herself if she cared enough  but how  she will not take the slightest trouble to adjust herself to the peculiarities of our position she could be cleverer other women are cleverer any other woman almost would be cleverer than she is  but if she was cleverer she wouldnt be the genius she is she would just be any other woman  perhaps she would said sir richmond darkly and desperately perhaps she would perhaps it would be better if she was  dr martineau raised his eyebrows in a furtive aside  but here you see that it is that in my case the fundamental incompatibility between ones affections and ones wider conception of duty and work comes in we cannot change social institutions in a year or a lifetime we can never change them to suit an individual case that would be like suspending the laws of gravitation in order to move a piano as things are martin is no good to me no help to me she is a rival to my duty she feels that she is hostile to my duty a definite antagonism has developed she feels and treats fueland everything to do with fuel as a bore it is an attack we quarrel on that it isnt as though i found it so easy to stick to my work that i could disregard her hostility and i cant bear to part from her i threaten it distress her excessively and then i am overcome by sympathy for her and i go back to her in the ordinary course of things i should be with her now  if it were not for the carbuncle  if it were not for the carbuncle she does not care for me to see her disfigured she does not understand sir richmond was at a loss for a phrasethat it is not her good looks  she wont let you go to her  it amounts to that and soon there will be all the trouble about educating the girl whatever happens she must have as good a chance asanyone  ah that is worrying you too  frightfully at times if it were a boy it would be easier it needs constant tact and dexterity to fix things up neither of us have any it needs attention  sir richmond mused darkly  dr martineau thought aloud an incompetent delightful person with martin leedss sense of humour and her powers of expression she must be attractive to many people she could probably do without you if once you parted  sir richmond turned on him eagerly  you think i ought to part from her on her account  on her account it might pain her but once the thing was done  i want to part i believe i ought to part  well  but then my affection comes in  that extraordinarytenderness of yours  im afraid  of what  anyone might get hold of herif i let her down she hasnt a tithe of the ordinary coolheaded calculation of an average woman ive a duty to her genius ive got to take care of her  to which the doctor made no reply  nevertheless the idea of parting has been very much in my mind lately  letting her go free  you can put it in that way if you like  it might not be a fatal operation for either of you  and yet there are moods when parting is an intolerable idea when one is invaded by a flood of affection and old habits of association  dr martineau thought was that the right wordaffection perhaps it was  they had come out on the towing path close by the lock and they found themselves threading their way through a little crowd of boating people and lookerson for a time their conversation was broken sir richmond resumed it  but this is where we cease to be man on his planet and all the rest of it this is where the idea of a definite task fanatically followed to the exclusion of all minor considerations breaks down when the work is good when we are sure we are all right then we may carry off things with a high hand but the work isnt always good we arent always sure we blunder we make a muddle we are fatigued then the sacrificed affections come in as accusers then it is that we want to be reassured  and then it is that miss martin leeds  doesnt sir richmond snapped  came a long pause  and yetit is extraordinarily difficult to think of parting from martin  section 3  in the evening after dinner dr martineau sought rather unsuccessfully to go on with the analysis of sir richmond  but sir richmond was evidently a creature of moods either he regretted the extent of his confidences or the slight irrational irritation that he felt at waiting for his car affected his attitude towards his companion or dr martineaus tentatives were illchosen at any rate he would not rise to any conversational bait that the doctor could devise the doctor found this the more regrettable because it seemed to him that there was much to be worked upon in this martin leeds affair he was inclined to think that she and sir richmond were unduly obsessed by the idea that they had to stick together because of the child because of the look of the thing and so forth and that really each might be struggling against a very strong impulse indeed to break off the affair it seemed evident to the doctor that they jarred upon and annoyed each other extremely on the whole separating people appealed to a doctors mind more strongly than bringing them together accordingly he framed his enquiries so as to make the revelation of a latent antipathy as easy as possible  he made several not very welldevised beginnings at the fifth sir richmond was suddenly conclusive its no use he said i cant fiddle about any more with my motives today  an awkward silence followed on reflection sir richmond seemed to realize that this sentence needed some apology i admit he said that this expedition has already been a wonderfully good thing for me these confessions have made me look into all sorts of thingssquarely butim not used to talking about myself or even thinking directly about myself what i say i afterwards find disconcerting to recall i want to alter it i can feel myself wallowing into a mess of modifications and qualifications  yes but  i want a rest anyhow  there was nothing for dr martineau to say to that  the two gentlemen smoked for some time in a slightly uncomfortable silence dr martineau cleared his throat twice and lit a second cigar they then agreed to admire the bridge and think well of maidenhead sir richmond communicated hopeful news about his car which was to arrive the next morning before tenhed just ring the fellow up presently to make sureand dr martineau retired early and went rather thoughtfully to bed the spate of sir richmonds confidences it was evident was over  section 4  sir richmonds car arrived long before ten brought down by a young man in a state of scared alacritysir richmond had done some vigorous telephoning before turning inthe charmeuse set off in a repaired and chastened condition to town and after a leisurely breakfast our two investigators into the springs of human conduct were able to resume their westward journey they ran through scattered twyford with its pleasant looking inns and through the commonplace urbanities of reading by newbury and hungerfords pretty bridge and up long wooded slopes to savernake forest where they found the road heavy and dusty still in its wartime state and so down a steep hill to the wide market street which is marlborough they lunched in marlborough and went on in the afternoon to silbury hill that british pyramid the largest artificial mound in europe they left the car by the roadside and clambered to the top and were very learned and inconclusive about the exact purpose of this vast heap of chalk and earth this heap that men had made before the temples at karnak were built or babylon had a name  then they returned to the car and ran round by a winding road into the wonder of avebury they found a clean little inn there kept by pleasant people and they garaged the car in the cowshed and took two rooms for the night that they might the better get the atmosphere of the ancient place wonderful indeed it is a vast circumvallation that was already two thousand years old before the dawn of british history a great wall of earth with its ditch most strangely on its inner and not on its outer side and within this enclosure gigantic survivors of the great circles of unhewn stone that even as late as tudor days were almost complete a whole village a church a pretty manor house have been built for the most part out of the ancient megaliths the great wall is sufficient to embrace them all with their gardens and paddocks four crossroads meet at the village centre there are drawings of avebury before these things arose there when it was a lonely wonder on the plain but for the most part the destruction was already done before the mayflower sailed to the southward stands the cone of silbury hill its shadow creeps up and down the intervening meadows as the seasons change around this lonely place rise the downs now bare sheep pastures in broad undulations with a wartlike barrow here and there and from it radiate creeping up to gain and hold the crests of the hills the abandoned trackways of that forgotten world these trackways these green roads of england these roads already disused when the romans made their highway past silbury hill to bath can still be traced for scores of miles through the land running to salisbury and the english channel eastward to the crossing at the straits and westward to wales to ferries over the severn and southwestward into devon and cornwall  the doctor and sir richmond walked round the walls surveyed the shadow cast by silbury upon the river flats strolled up the down to the northward to get a general view of the village had tea and smoked round the walls again in the warm april sunset the matter of their conversation remained prehistoric both were inclined to find fault with the archaeological work that had been done on the place clumsy treasure hunting sir richmond said they bore into silbury hill and expect to find a mummified chief or something sensational of that sort and they dont and they report nothing they havent sifted finely enough they havent thought subtly enough these walls of earth ought to tell what these people ate what clothes they wore what woods they used was this a sheep land then as it is now or a cattle land were these hills covered by forests i dont know these archaeologists dont know or if they do they havent told me which is just as bad i dont believe they know  what trade came here along these tracks so far as i know they had no beasts of burthen but suppose one day someone were to find a potsherd here from early knossos or a fragment of glass from pepis egypt  the place had stirred up his imagination he wrestled with his ignorance as if he thought that by talking he might presently worry out some picture of this forgotten world without metals without beasts of burthen without letters without any sculpture that has left a trace and yet with a sense of astronomical fact clear enough to raise the great gnomon of silbury and with a social system complex enough to give the large and orderly community to which the size of avebury witnesses and the traffic to which the green roads testify  the doctor had not realized before the boldness and liveliness of his companions mind sir richmond insisted that the climate must have been moister and milder in those days he covered all the downlands with woods as savernake was still covered beneath the trees he restored a thicker richer soil these people must have done an enormous lot with wood this use of stones here was a freak it was the very strangeness of stones here that had made them into sacred things one thought too much of the stones of the stone age who would carve these lumps of quartzite when one could carve good oak or beecha most carvable wood especially when ones sharpest chisel was a flint its wood we ought to look for said sir richmond wood and fibre he declared that these people had their tools of wood their homes of wood their gods and perhaps their records of wood a peat bog here even a few feet of clay might have pickled some precious memoranda no such luck now in glastonbury marshes one found the life of the early iron agehalf way to our own timesquite beautifully pickled  though they wrestled mightily with the problem neither sir richmond nor the doctor could throw a gleam of light upon the riddle why the ditch was inside and not outside the great wall  and what was our mind like in those days said sir richmond that i suppose is what interests you a vivid childish mind i guess with not a suspicion as yet that it was man ruling his planet or anything of that sort  the doctor pursed his lips none he delivered judicially if one were able to recall ones childhoodat the age of about twelve or thirteenwhen the artistic impulse so often goes into abeyance and one begins to think in a troubled monstrous way about god and hell one might get something like the mind of this place  thirteen you put them at that already these people you think were religious  intensely in that personal way that gives death a nightmare terror and as for the fading of the artistic impulse theyve left not a trace of the paintings and drawings and scratchings of the old stone people who came before them  adults with the minds of thirteenyearold children thirteenyearold children with the strength of adultsand no one to slap them or tell them not to after all they probably only thought of death now and then and they never thought of fuel they supposed there was no end to that so they used up their woods and kept goats to nibble and kill the new undergrowth did these people have goats  i dont know said the doctor so little is known  very like children they must have been the same unending days they must have thought that the world went on for everjust as they knew itlike my damned committee does with their fuel wasting away and the climate changing imperceptibly century by century kings and important men followed one another here for centuries and centuries they had lost their past and had no idea of any future  they had forgotten how they came into the land when i was a child i believed that my fathers garden had been there for ever  this is very like trying to remember some game one played when one was a child it is like coming on something that one built up with bricks and stones in some forgotten part of the garden  the life we lived here said the doctor has left its traces in traditions in mental predispositions in still unanalyzed fundamental ideas  archaeology is very like remembering said sir richmond presently we shall remember a lot more about all this we shall remember what it was like to live in this place and the long journey hither age by age out of the south we shall remember the sacrifices we made and the crazy reasons why we made them we sowed our corn in blood here we had strange fancies about the stars those we brought with us out of the south where the stars are brighter and what like were those wooden gods of ours i dont remember but i could easily persuade myself that i had been here before  they stood on the crest of the ancient wall and the setting sun cast long shadows of them athwart a field of springing wheat  perhaps we shall come here again the doctor carried on sir richmonds fancy after another four thousand years or so with different names and fuller minds and then i suppose that this ditch wont be the riddle it is now  life didnt seem so complicated then sir richmond mused our muddles were unconscious we drifted from mood to mood and forgot there was more sunshine then more laughter perhaps and blacker despair despair like the despair of children that can weep itself to sleep its over was it battle and massacre that ended that long afternoon here or did the woods catch fire some exceptionally dry summer leaving black hills and famine or did strange men bring a sicknessmeasles perhaps or the black death or was it cattle pest or did we just waste our woods and dwindle away before the new peoples that came into the land across the southern sea i cant remember  sir richmond turned about i would like to dig up the bottom of this ditch here foot by footand dry the stuff and sift itvery carefully then i might begin to remember things  section 5  in the evening after a pleasant supper they took a turn about the walls with the moon sinking over beyond silbury and then went in and sat by lamplight before a brightly fussy wood fire and smoked there were long intervals of friendly silence  i dont in the least want to go on talking about myself said sir richmond abruptly  let it rest then said the doctor generously  today among these ancient memories has taken me out of myself wonderfully i cant tell you how good avebury has been for me this afternoon half my consciousness has seemed to be a tattooed creature wearing a knife of stone  the healing touch of history  and for the first time my damned committee has mattered scarcely a rap  sir richmond stretched himself in his chair and blinked cheerfully at his cigar smoke  nevertheless he said this confessional business of yours has been an excellent exercise it has enabled me to get outside myself to look at myself as a case now i can even see myself as a remote case that i neednt bother about further so far as that goes i think we have done all that there is to be done  i shouldnt say thatquiteyet said the doctor  i dont think im a subject for real psychoanalysis at all im not an overlaid sort of person when i spread myself out there is not much indication of a suppressed wish or of anything masked or buried of that sort what you get is a quite open and recognized discord of two sets of motives  the doctor considered yes i think that is true your libido is i should say exceptionally free generally you are doing what you want to dooverdoing in fact what you want to do and getting simply tired  which is the theory i started with i am a case of fatigue under irritating circumstances with very little mental complication or concealment  yes said the doctor i agree you are not a case for psychoanalysis strictly speaking at all you are in open conflict with yourself upon moral and social issues practically open your problems are problems of conscious conduct  as i said  of what renunciations you have consciously to make  sir richmond did not answer that  this pilgrimage of ours he said presently has made for magnanimity this day particularly has been a good day when we stood on this old wall here in the sunset i seemed to be standing outside myself in an immense still sphere of past and future i stood with my feet upon the stone age and saw myself four thousand years away and all my distresses as very little incidents in that perspective away there in london the case is altogether different after three hours or so of the committee one concentrates into one little inflamed moment of personality there is no past any longer there is no future there is only the rankling dispute for all those three hours perhaps i have been thinking of just what i had to say just how i had to say it just how i looked while i said it just how much i was making myself understood how i might be misunderstood how i might be misrepresented challenged denied one draws in more and more as one is used up at last one is reduced to a little raw bleeding desperately fighting pinpoint of self one goes back to ones home unable to recover fighting it over again all night sometimes i get up and walk about the room and curse martineau how is one to get the avebury frame of mind to westminster  when westminster is as dead as avebury said the doctor unhelpfully he added after some seconds milton knew of these troubles not without dust and heat he wrotea great phrase  but the dust chokes me said sir richmond  he took up a copy of the green roads of england that lay beside him on the table but he did not open it he held it in his hand and said the thing he had had in mind to say all that evening i do not think that i shall stir up my motives any more for a time better to go on into the west country cooling my poor old brain in these wide shadows of the past  i can prescribe nothing better said dr martineau incidentally we may be able to throw a little more light on one or two of your minor entanglements  i dont want to think of them said sir richmond let me get right away from everything until my skin has grown again     chapter the sixth  the encounter at stonehenge  section 1  next day in the early afternoon after a farewell walk over the downs round avebury they went by way of devizes and netheravon and amesbury to stonehenge  dr martineau had seen this ancient monument before but now with avebury fresh in his mind he found it a poorer thing than he had remembered it to be sir richmond was frankly disappointed after the real greatness and mystery of the older place it seemed a poor little heap of stones it did not even dominate the landscape it was some way from the crest of the swelling down on which it stood and it was further dwarfed by the colossal airship hangars and clustering offices of the air station that the great war had called into existence upon the slopes to the southwest it looks sir richmond said as though some old giantess had left a discarded set of teeth on the hillside far more impressive than stonehenge itself were the barrows that capped the neighbouring crests  the sacred stones were fenced about and our visitors had to pay for admission at a little kiosk by the gate at the side of the road stood a travelstained middleclass automobile with a miscellany of dusty luggage rugs and luncheon things thereina family automobile with father no doubt at the wheel sir richmond left his own trim coupe at its tail  they were impeded at the entrance by a difference of opinion between the keeper of the turnstile and a small but resolute boy of perhaps five or six who proposed to leave the enclosure the custodian thought that it would be better if his nurse or his mother came out with him  she keeps on looking at it said the small boy it isunt anything i want to go and clean the car  you wont see stonehenge every day young man said the custodian a little piqued  its only an old beach said the small boy with extreme conviction its rocks like the seaside and there isunt no sea  the man at the turnstile mutely consulted the doctor  i dont see that he can get into any harm here the doctor advised and the small boy was released from archaeology  he strolled to the family automobile produced an entoutcas pockethandkerchief and set himself to polish the lamps with great assiduity the two gentlemen lingered at the turnstile for a moment or so to watch his proceedings modern child said sir richmond old stones are just old stones to him but motor cars are gods  you can hardly expect him to understandat his age said the custodian jealous for the honor of stonehenge  reminds me of martins little girl said sir richmond as he and dr martineau went on towards the circle when she encountered her first dragonfly she was greatly delighted oh dee lill aeplane she said  as they approached the grey old stones they became aware of a certain agitation among them a voice an authoritative bass voice was audible crying anthony a nurse appeared remotely going in the direction of the aeroplane sheds and her cry of master anthony came faintly on the breeze an extremely pretty young woman of five or six and twenty became visible standing on one of the great prostrate stones in the centre of the place she was a blackhaired sunburnt individual and she stood with her arms akimbo quite frankly amused at the disappearance of master anthony and offering no sort of help for his recovery on the greensward before her stood the paterfamilias of the family automobile and he was making a trumpet with his hands in order to repeat the name of anthony with greater effect a short lady in grey emerged from among the encircling megaliths and one or two other feminine personalities produced effects of movement rather than of individuality as they flitted among the stones well said the lady in grey with that rising intonation of humorous conclusion which is so distinctively american those druids have got him  hes hiding said the automobilist in a voice that promised chastisement to a hidden hearer thats what he is doing he ought not to play tricks like this a great boy who is almost six  if you are looking for a small resolute boy of six said sir richmond addressing himself to the lady on the rock rather than to the angry parent below hes perfectly safe and happy the druids havent got him indeed theyve failed altogether to get him stonehenge he says is no good so hes gone back to clean the lamps of your car  aaoo so thats it said papa winnie go and tell price hes gone back to the car they oughtnt to have let him out of the enclosure  the excitement about master anthony collapsed the rest of the people in the circles crystallized out into the central space as two apparent sisters and an apparent aunt and the nurse who was packed off at once to supervise the lamp cleaning the head of the family found some difficulty it would seem in readjusting his mind to the comparative innocence of anthony and sir richmond and the young lady on the rock sought as if by common impulse to establish a general conversation there were faint traces of excitement in her manner as though there had been some controversial passage between herself and the family gentleman  we were discussing the age of this old place she said smiling in the frankest and friendliest way how old do you think it is  the father of anthony intervened also with a shadow of controversy in his manner i was explaining to the young lady that it dates from the early bronze age before chronology existed but she insists on dates  nothing of bronze has ever been found here said sir richmond  well when was this early bronze age anyhow said the young lady  sir richmond sought a recognizable datum bronze got to britain somewhere between the times of moses and solomon  ah said the young lady as who should say this man at least talks sense  but these stones are all shaped said the father of the family it is difficult to see how that could have been done without something harder than stone  i dont see the place said the young lady on the stone i cant imagine how they did it upnot one bit  did it up exclaimed the father of the family in the tone of one accustomed to find a gentle sport in the intellectual frailties of his womenkind  its just the bones of a place they hung things round it they draped it  but what things asked sir richmond  oh they had things all right skins perhaps mats of rushes bast cloth fibre of all sorts wadded stuff  stonehenge draped its really a delightful idea said the father of the family enjoying it  its quite a possible one said sir richmond  or they may have used wicker the young lady went on undismayed she seemed to concede a point wicker is likelier  but surely said the father of the family with the expostulatory voice and gesture of one who would recall erring wits to sanity it is far more impressive standing out bare and noble as it does in lonely splendour  but all this country may have been wooded then said sir richmond in which case it wouldnt have stood out it doesnt stand out so very much even now  you came to it through a grove said the young lady eagerly picking up the idea  probably beech said sir richmond  which may have pointed to the midsummer sunrise said dr martineau unheeded  these are novel ideas said the father of the family in the reproving tone of one who never allows a novel idea inside his doors if he can prevent it  well said the young lady i guess there was some sort of show here anyhow and no human being ever had a show yet without trying to shut people out of it in order to make them come in i guess this was covered in all right a dark hunched old place in a wood beech stems smooth like pillars and they came to it at night in procession beating drums and scared half out of their wits they came in there and went round the inner circle with their torches and so they were shown the torches were put out and the priests did their mysteries until dawn broke that is how they worked it  but even you cant tell what the show was vv said the lady in grey who was standing now at dr martineaus elbow  something horrid said anthonys younger sister to her elder in a stage whisper  bluggy agreed anthonys elder sister to the younger in a noiseless voice that certainly did not reach father squeals  this young lady who was addressed as vv was perhaps one or two and twenty dr martineau thoughthe was not very good at feminine ages she had a clear sunbrowned complexion with dark hair and smiling lips her features were finely modelled with just that added touch of breadth in the brow and softness in the cheek bones that faint flavour of the amerindian one sees at times in american women her voice was a very soft and pleasing voice and she spoke persuasively and not assertively as so many american women do her determination to make the dry bones of stonehenge live shamed the doctors disappointment with the place and when she had spoken dr martineau noted that she looked at sir richmond as if she expected him at least to confirm her vision sir richmond was evidently prepared to confirm it  with a queer little twinge of infringed proprietorship the doctor saw sir richmond step up on the prostrate megalith and stand beside her the better to appreciate her point of view he smiled down at her now why do you think they came in there he asked  the young lady was not very clear about her directions she did not know of the roadway running to the avon river nor of the alleged race course to the north nor had she ever heard that the stones were supposed to be of two different periods and that some of them might possibly have been brought from a very great distance  section 2  neither dr martineau nor the father of the family found the imaginative reconstruction of the stonehenge rituals quite so exciting as the two principals the father of the family endured some further particulars with manifest impatience no longer able now that sir richmond was encouraging the girl to keep her in check with the slightly derisive smile proper to her sex then he proclaimed in a fine loud tenor all this is very imaginative im afraid and to his family time we were pressing on turps we must goo come phoebe  as he led his little flock towards the exit his voice came floating back talking wanton nonsense any professional archaeologist would laugh simply laugh  he passed out of the world  with a faint intimation of dismay dr martineau realized that the two talkative ladies were not to be removed in the family automobile with the rest of the party sir richmond and the younger lady went on very cheerfully to the population agriculture housing and general scenery of the surrounding downland during the later stone age the shorter less attractive lady whose accent was distinctly american came now and stood at the doctors elbow she seemed moved to play the part of chorus to the two upon the stone  when vv gets going she remarked she makes things come alive  dr martineau hated to be addressed suddenly by strange ladies he started and his face assumed the distressed politeness of the moon at its full your friend he said interested in archaeology  interested said the stouter lady why shes a fiend at it ever since we came on carnac  youve visited carnac  thats where the bug bit her said the stout lady with a note of querulous humour directly vv set eyes on carnac she just turned against all her upbringing why wasnt i told of this before she said whats notre dame to this this is where we came from this is the real starting point of the mayflower belinda she said weve got to see all we can of this sort of thing before we go back to america theyve been keeping this from us and thats why were here right now instead of being shopping in paris or london like decent american women  the younger lady looked down on her companion with something of the calm expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving and like a plumber refrained from precipitate action she stood with the backs of her hands resting on her hips  well she said slowly giving most of the remark to sir richmond and the rest to the doctor it is nearer the beginnings of things than london or paris  and nearer to us said sir richmond  i call that justparadoxical said the shorter lady who appeared to be called belinda  not paradoxical dr martineau contradicted gently life is always beginning again and this is a time of fresh beginnings  now thats after vvs own heart cried the stout lady in grey shell agree to all that shes been saying it right across europe rome paris london theyre simply just done they dont signify any more theyve got to be cleared away  you let me tell my own opinions belinda said the young lady who was called vv i said that if people went on building with fluted pillars and corinthian capitals for two thousand years it was time they were cleared up and taken away  corinthian capitals sir richmond considered it and laughed cheerfully i suppose europe does rather overdo that sort of thing  the way she went on about the victor emmanuele monument said the lady who answered to the name of belinda it gave me cold shivers to think that those italian officers might understand english  the lady who was called vv smiled as if she smiled at herself and explained herself to sir richmond when one is travelling about one gets to think of history and politics in terms of architecture i do anyhow and those columns with corinthian capitals have got to be a sort of symbol for me for everything in europe that i dont want and have no sort of use for it isnt a bad sort of capital in its way florid and pretty but not a patch on the doricand that a whole continent should come up to it and stick at it and never get past it  its the classical tradition  it puzzles me  its the roman empire that corinthian column is a weed spread by the romans all over western europe  and it smothers the history of europe you cant see europe because of it europe is obsessed by rome everywhere marble arches and arcs de triomphe you never get away from it it is like some old gentleman who has lost his way in a speech and keeps on repeating the same thing and cant sit down the empire gentlementhe empire empire rome itself is perfectly frightful it stares at you with its great round stupid arches as though it couldnt imagine that you could possibly want anything else for ever saint peters and that frightful monument are just the same stuff as the baths of caracalla and the palaces of the caesars just the same they will make just the same sort of ruins it goes on and goes on  ave roma immortalis said dr martineau  this roman empire seems to be europes first and last idea a fixed idea and such a poor idea america never came out of that its no goodtelling me that it did it escaped from it so i said to belinda here lets burrow if we can under all this marble and find out what sort of people we were before this roman empire and its acanthus weeds got hold of us  i seem to remember at washington something faintly corinthian something called the capitol sir richmond reflected and other buildings a treasury  that is different said the young lady so conclusively that it seemed to leave nothing more to be said on that score  a last twinge of europeanism she vouchsafed we were young in those days  you are well beneath the marble here  she assented cheerfully  a thousand years before it  happy place happy people  but even this place isnt the beginning of things here carnac was older than this and older still is avebury have you heard in america of avebury it may have predated this place they think by another thousand years  avebury said the lady who was called belinda  but what is this avebury asked vv ive never heard of the place  i thought it was a lord said belinda  sir richmond with occasional appeals to dr martineau embarked upon an account of the glory and wonder of avebury possibly he exaggerated avebury  it was dr martineau who presently brought this disquisition upon avebury to a stop by a very remarkable gesture he looked at his watch he drew it out ostentatiously a thick respectable gold watch for the doctor was not the sort of man to wear his watch upon his wrist he clicked it open and looked at it thereby he would have proclaimed his belief this encounter was an entirely unnecessary interruption of his healing duologue with sir richmond which must now be resumed  but this action had scarcely the effect he had intended it to have it set the young lady who was called belinda asking about ways and means of getting to salisbury it brought to light the distressing fact that vv had the beginnings of a chafed heel once he had set things going they moved much too quickly for the doctor to deflect their course he found himself called upon to make personal sacrifices to facilitate the painless transport of the two ladies to salisbury where their luggage awaited them at the old george hotel in some way too elusive to trace it became evident that he and sir richmond were to stay at this same old george hotel the luggage was to be shifted to the top of the coupe the young lady called vv was to share the interior of the car with sir richmond while the lady named belinda for whom dr martineau was already developing a very strong dislike was to be thrust into an extreme proximity with him and the balance of the luggage in the dicky seat behind  sir richmond had never met with a young woman with a genuine historical imagination before and he was evidently very greatly excited and resolved to get the utmost that there was to be got out of this encounter  section 3  sir richmond displayed a complete disregard of the sufferings of dr martineau shamefully compressed behind him of these he was to hear later he ran his overcrowded little car overcrowded so far as the dicky went over the crest of the down and down into amesbury and on to salisbury stopping to alight and stretch the legs of the party when they came in sight of old sarum  certainly they can do with a little stretching said dr martineau grimly  this charming young woman had seized upon the imagination of sir richmond to the temporary exclusion of all other considerations the long downland gradients quivering very slightly with the vibration of the road came swiftly and easily to meet and pass the throbbing little car as he sat beside her and talked to her he fell into that expository manner which comes so easily to the native entertaining the visitor from abroad  in england it seems to me there are four main phases of history four avebury which i would love to take you to see tomorrow stonehenge old sarum which we shall see in a moment as a great grassy mound on our right as we come over one of these crests each of them represents about a thousand years old sarum was keltic it saw the romans and the saxons through and for a time it was a norman city now it is pasture for sheep latest as yet is salisburyenglish real english it may last a few centuries still it is little more than seven hundred years old but when i think of those great hangars back there by stonehenge i feel that the next phase is already beginning of a world one will fly to the ends of in a week or so our world still our people your people and mine who are going to take wing so soon now were made in all these places we are visiting the old homes i am glad i came back to it just when you were doing the same thing  im lucky to have found a sympathetic fellow traveller she said with a car  youre the first american ive ever met whose interest in history didnt seem he sought for an inoffensive word  silly oh i admit it its true of a lot of us most of us we come over to europe as if it hadnt anything to do with us except to supply us with old pictures and curios generally we come sightseeing its romantic its picturesque we stare at the nativeslike visitors at a zoo we dont realize that we belong i know our style but we arent all like that some of us are learning a bit better than that we have one or two teachers over there to lighten our darkness theres professor breasted for instance he comes sometimes to my fathers house and theres james harvey robinson and professor hutton webster theyve been trying to restore our memory  ive never heard of any of them said sir richmond  you hear so little of america over here its quite a large country and all sorts of interesting things happen there nowadays and we are waking up to history quite fast we shant always be the most ignorant people in the world we are beginning to realize that quite a lot of things happened between adam and the mayflower that we ought to be told about i allow its a recent revival the united states has been like one of those men you read about in the papers who go away from home and turn up in some distant place with their memories gone theyve forgotten what their names were or where they lived or what they did for a living theyve forgotten everything that matters often they have to begin again and settle down for a long time before their memories come back thats how it has been with us our memory is just coming back to us  and what do you find you are  europeans who came away from kings and churchesand corinthian capitals  you feel all this country belongs to you  as much as it does to you sir richmond smiled radiantly at her but if i say that america belongs to me as much as it does to you  we are one people she said  we  europe these parts of europe anyhow and ourselves  you are the most civilized person ive met for weeks and weeks  well you are the first civilized person ive met in europe for a long time if i understand you  there are multitudes of reasonable civilized people in europe  ive heard or seen very little of them  theyre scattered i admit  and hard to find  so ours is a lucky meeting ive wanted a serious talk to an american for some time i want to know very badly what you think you are up to with the worldour world  im equally anxious to know what england thinks she is doing her ways recently have been a little difficult to understand on any hypothesisthat is honourable to her  hm said sir richmond  i assure you we dont like it this irish business we feel a sort of ownership in england its like finding your dearest aunt torturing the cat  we must talk of that said sir richmond  i wish you would  it is a cat and a dogand they have been very naughty animals and poor aunt britannia almost deliberately lost her temper but i admit she hits about in a very nasty fashion  and favours the dog  she does  i want to know all you admit  you shall and incidentally my friend and i may have the pleasure of showing you salisbury and avebury if you are free  were travelling together just we two we are wandering about the south of england on our way to falmouth where i join a father in a few days time and i go on with him to paris and if you and your friend are coming to the old george  we are said sir richmond  i see no great scandal in talking right on to bedtime and seeing avebury tomorrow why not perhaps if we did as the germans do and gave our names now it might mitigate something of the extreme informality of our behaviour  my name is hardy ive been a munition manufacturer i was slightly wounded by a stray shell near arras while i was inspecting some plant i had set up and also i was hit by a stray knighthood so my name is now sir richmond hardy my friend is a very distinguished harley street physician chiefly nervous and mental cases his name is dr martineau he is quite as civilized as i am he is also a philosophical writer he is really a very wise and learned man indeed he is full of ideas hes stimulated me tremendously you must talk to him  sir richmond glanced over his shoulder at the subject of these commendations through the oval window glared an expression of malignity that made no impression whatever on his preoccupied mind  my name said the young lady is grammont the war whirled me over to europe on red cross work and since the peace ive been settling up things and travelling about europe my father is rather a big business man in new york  the oil grammont  he is rather deep in oil i believe he is coming over to europe because he does not like the way your people are behaving in mesopotamia he is on his way to paris now paris it seems is where everything is to be settled against you belinda is a sort of companion i have acquired for the purposes of independent travel she was red cross too i must have somebody and i cannot bear a maid her name is belinda seyffert from philadelphia originally you have that seyffert grammont  and hardy  sir richmond and dr martineau  andahthat great green bank there just coming into sight must be old sarum the little ancient city that faded away when salisbury lifted its spire into the world we will stop here for a little while  then it was that dr martineau was grim about the stretching of his legs  section 4  the sudden prospect which now opened out before sir richmond of talking about history and suchlike topics with a charming companion for perhaps two whole days instead of going on with this tiresome shamefaced egotistical business of selfexamination was so attractive to him that it took immediate possession of his mind to the entire exclusion and disregard of dr martineaus possible objections to any such modification of their original programme when they arrived in salisbury the doctor did make some slight effort to suggest a different hotel from that in which the two ladies had engaged their rooms but on the spur of the moment and in their presence he could produce no sufficient reason for refusing the accommodation the old george had ready for him he was reduced to a vague we dont want to inflict ourselves he could not get sir richmond aside for any adequate expression of his feelings about miss seyffert before the four of them were seated together at tea amidst the mediaeval modernity of the old george smokingroom and only then did he begin to realize the depth and extent of the engagements to which sir richmond had committed himself  i was suggesting that we run back to avebury tomorrow said sir richmond these ladies were nearly missing it  the thing took the doctors breath away for the moment he could say nothing he stared over his teacup dourfaced an objection formulated itself very slowly but that dicky he whispered  his whisper went unnoted sir richmond was talking of the completeness of salisbury from the very beginning it had been a cathedral city it was essentially and purely that the church at its best in the full tide of its mediaeval ascendancy had called it into being he was making some extremely loose and inaccurate generalizations about the buildings and ruins each age had left for posterity and miss grammont was countering with equally unsatisfactory qualifications our age will leave the ruins of hotels said sir richmond railway arches and hotels  baths and aqueducts miss grammont compared rome of the empire comes nearest to it  as soon as tea was over dr martineau realized they meant to walk round and about salisbury he foresaw that walk with the utmost clearness in front and keeping just a little beyond the range of his intervention sir richmond would go with miss grammont he himself and miss seyffert would bring up the rear if i do he muttered ill be damned an unusually strong expression for him  you said asked miss seyffert  that i have some writing to dobefore the post goes said the doctor brightly  oh come and see the cathedral cried sir richmond with illconcealed dismay he was if one may put it in such a fashion not looking at miss seyffert in the directest fashion when he said this  im afraid said the doctor mulishly impossible  with the unspoken addition of you try her for a bit  miss grammont stood up everybody stood up we can go first to look for shops she said theres those things you want to buy belinda a fountain pen and the little books we can all go together as far as that and while you are shopping if you wouldnt mind getting one or two things for me  it became clear to dr martineau that sir richmond was to be let off belinda it seemed abominably unjust and it was also clear to him that he must keep closely to his own room or he might find miss seyffert drifting back alone to the hotel and eager to resume with him  well a quiet time in his room would not be disagreeable he could think over his notes  but in reality he thought over nothing but the little speeches he would presently make to sir richmond about the unwarrantable the absolutely unwarrantable alterations that were being made without his consent in their common programme  for a long time sir richmond had met no one so interesting and amusing as this frankminded young woman from america young woman was how he thought of her she didnt correspond to anything so prim and restrained and extensively reserved and withheld as a young lady  and though he judged her no older than five and twenty the word girl with its associations of virginal ignorances invisible purdah and trite ideas newly discovered seemed even less appropriate for her than the word boy she had an air of having in some obscure way graduated in life as if so far she had lived each several year of her existence in a distinctive and conclusive manner with the utmost mental profit and no particular tarnish or injury he could talk with her as if he talked with a man like himselfbut with a zest no man could give him  it was evident that the good things she had said at first came as the natural expression of a broad stream of alert thought they were no mere display specimens from one of those jackdaw collections of bright things so many clever women waste their wits in accumulating she was not talking for effect at all she was talking because she was tremendously interested in her discovery of the spectacle of history and delighted to find another person as possessed as she was  belinda having been conducted to her shops the two made their way through the bright evening sunlight to the compact gracefulness of the cathedral a glimpse through a wroughtiron gate of a delightful garden of spring flowers alyssum aubrietia snowuponthemountains daffodils narcissus and the like held them for a time and then they came out upon the level grassy space surrounded by little ripe old houses on which the cathedral stands they stood for some moments surveying it  its a perfect little lady of a cathedral said sir richmond but why i wonder did we build it  your memory ought to be better than mine she said with her halfclosed eyes blinking up at the sunlit spire sharp against the blue ive been away for so longover therethat i forget altogether why did we build it  she had fallen in quite early with this freak of speaking and thinking as if he and she were all mankind it was as if her mind had been prepared for it by her own eager exploration in europe my friend the philosopher he had said will not have it that we are really the individuals we think we are you must talk to himhe is a very curious and subtle thinker we are just thoughts in the mind of the race he says passing thoughts we arewhat does he call itman on his planet taking control of life  man and woman she had amended  but just as man on his planet taking control of life had failed altogether to remember why the ditch at avebury was on the inside instead of the outside of the vallum so now miss grammont and sir richmond found very great difficulty in recalling why they had built salisbury cathedral  we built temples by habit and tradition said sir richmond but the impulse was losing its force  she looked up at the spire and then at him with a faintly quizzical expression  but he had his reply ready  we were beginning to feel our power over matter we were already very clever engineers what interested us here wasnt the old religion any more we wanted to exercise and display our power over stone we made it into reeds and branches we squirted it up in all these spires and pinnacles the priest and his altar were just an excuse do you think people have ever feared and worshipped in thisthis artists larkas they did in stonehenge  i certainly do not remember that i ever worshipped here she said  sir richmond was in love with his idea the spirit of the gothic cathedrals he said is the spirit of the skyscrapers it is architecture in a mood of flaming ambition the freemasons on the building could hardly refrain from jeering at the little priest they had left down below there performing antiquated puerile mysteries at his altar he was just their excuse for doing it all  skyscrapers she conceded an early display of the skyscraper spirit you are doing your best to make me feel thoroughly at home  you are more at home here still than in that new country of ours over the atlantic but it seems to me now that i do begin to remember building this cathedral and all the other cathedrals we built in europe it was the fun of building made us do it  hm she said and my skyscrapers  still the fun of building that is the thing i envy most about america its still large enough mentally and materially to build all sorts of things over here the sites are frightfully crowded  and what do you think we are building now and what do you think you are building over here  what are we building now i believe we have almost grown up i believe it is time we began to build in earnest for good  but are we building anything at all  a new world  show it me she said  were still only at the foundations said sir richmond nothing shows as yet  i wish i could believe they were foundations  but can you doubt we are scrapping the old  it was too late in the afternoon to go into the cathedral so they strolled to and fro round and about the west end and along the path under the trees towards the river exchanging their ideas very frankly and freely about the things that had recently happened to the world and what they thought they ought to be doing in it  section 5  after dinner our four tourists sat late and talked in a corner of the smokingroom the two ladies had vanished hastily at the first dinner gong and reappeared at the second mysteriously and pleasantly changed from tweedy pedestrians to indoor company they were quietly but definitely dressed pretty alterations had happened to their coiffure a silver band and deep red stones lit the dusk of miss grammonts hair and a necklace of the same colourings kept the peace between her jolly sunburnt cheek and her soft untanned neck it was evident her recent uniform had included a collar of great severity miss seyffert had revealed a plump forearm and proclaimed it with a clash of bangles dr martineau thought her evening throat much too confidential  the conversation drifted from topic to topic it had none of the steady continuity of sir richmonds duologue with miss grammont miss seyfferts methods were too discursive and exclamatory she broke every thread that appeared the old george at salisbury is really old it shows it and miss seyffert laced the entire evening with her recognition of the fact just look at that old beam she would cry suddenly to think it was exactly where it is before there was a cabot in america  miss grammont let her companion pull the talk about as she chose after the animation of the afternoon a sort of lazy contentment had taken possession of the younger lady she sat deep in a basket chair and spoke now and then miss seyffert gave her impressions of france and italy she talked of the cabmen of naples and the beggars of amalfi  apropos of beggars miss grammont from the depths of her chair threw out the statement that italy was frightfully overpopulated in some parts of italy it is like mites on a cheese nobody seems to be living everyone is too busy keeping alive  poor old women carrying loads big enough for mules said miss seyffert  little children working like slaves said miss grammont  and everybody begging even the people at work by the roadside who ought to be getting wagessufficient  beggingfrom foreignersis just a sport in italy said sir richmond it doesnt imply want but i agree that a large part of italy is frightfully overpopulated the whole world is dont you think so martineau  wellyesfor its present social organization  for any social organization said sir richmond  ive no doubt of it said miss seyffert and added amazingly im out for birth control all the time  a brief but active pause ensued dr martineau in a state of sudden distress attempted to drink out of a cold and empty coffee cup  the world swarms with cramped and undeveloped lives said sir richmond which amount to nothing which do not even represent happiness and which help to use up the resources the fuel and surplus energy of the world  i suppose they have a sort of liking for their lives miss grammont reflected  does that matter they do nothing to carry life on they are just vain repetitionsimperfect dreary blurred repetitions of one common life all that they feel has been felt all that they do has been done better before because they are crowded and hurried and underfed and undereducated and as for liking their lives they need never have had the chance  how many people are there in the world she asked abruptly  i dont know twelve hundred fifteen hundred millions perhaps  and in your world  id have two hundred and fifty millions let us say at most it would be quite enough for this little planet for a time at any rate dont you think so doctor  i dont know said dr martineau oddly enough i have never thought about that question before at least not from this angle  but could you pick out two hundred and fifty million aristocrats began miss grammont my native instinctive democracy  need not be outraged said sir richmond any two hundred and fifty million would do theyd be able to develop fully all of them as things are only a minority can do that the rest never get a chance  thats what i always say said miss seyffert  a new age said dr martineau a new world we may be coming to such a stage when population as much as fuel will be under a world control if one thing why not the other i admit that the movement of thought is away from haphazard towards control  im for control all the time miss seyffert injected following up her previous success  i admit the doctor began his broken sentence again with marked patience that the movement of thought is away from haphazard towards controlin things generally but is the movement of events  the eternal problem of man said sir richmond can our wills prevail  there came a little pause  miss grammont smiled an enquiry at miss seyffert if you are said belinda  i wish i could imagine your world said miss grammont rising of two hundred and fifty millions of fully developed human beings with room to live and breathe in and no need for wars will they live in palaces will they all be healthy machines will wait on them no i cant imagine it perhaps i shall dream of it my dreaming self may be cleverer  she held out her hand to sir richmond just for a moment they stood hand in hand appreciatively  well said dr martineau as the door closed behind the two americans this is a curious encounter  that young woman has brains said sir richmond standing before the fireplace there was no doubt whatever which young woman he meant but dr martineau grunted  i dont like the american type the doctor pronounced judicially  i do sir richmond countered  the doctor thought for a moment or so you are committed to the project of visiting avebury he said  they ought to see avebury said sir richmond  hm said the doctor ostentatiously amused by his thoughts and staring at the fire birth control i never did  sir richmond smiled down on the top of the doctors head and said nothing  i think said the doctor and paused i shall leave this avebury expedition to you  we can be back in the early afternoon said sir richmond to give them a chance of seeing the cathedral the chapter house here is not one to miss  and then i suppose we shall go on  as you please said sir richmond insincerely  i must confess that four people make the car at any rate seem tremendously overpopulated and to tell the truth i do not find this encounter so amusing as you seem to do i shall not be sorry when we have waved goodbye to those young ladies and resume our interrupted conversation  sir richmond considered something mulish in the doctors averted face  i find miss grammont an extremely interestingand stimulating human being  evidently  the doctor sighed stood up and found himself delivering one of the sentences he had engendered during his solitary meditations in his room before dinner he surprised himself by the plainness of his speech let me be frank he said regarding sir richmond squarely considering the general situation of things and your position i do not care very greatly for the part of an accessory to what may easily develop as you know very well into a very serious flirtation an absurd mischievous irrelevant flirtation you may not like the word you may pretend it is a conversation an ordinary intellectual conversation that is not the word simply that is not the word you people eye one another flirtation i give the affair its proper name that is all merely that when i thinkbut we will not discuss it now good night forgive me if i put before you rather bluntly my particular point of view  sir richmond found himself alone with his eyebrows raised  section 6  after twentyfour eventful hours our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smokingroom they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension  if you find the accommodation of the car insufficient said sir richmond in a tone of extreme reasonableness and i admit it is we can easily hire a larger car in a place like this  i would not care if you hired an omnibus said dr martineau i am not coming on if these young women are  but if you consider it scandalousand really martineau really as one man to another it does seem to me to be a bit pernickety of you a broad and original thinker as you are  thought is one matter rash inconsiderate action quite another and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of miss belinda seyffert i shalli shall be extremely rude to her  but said sir richmond and bit his lower lip and considered  we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite she couldfor examplebe left behind with the luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammont  there was no immediate reply for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctors silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum  i object to miss grammont and that side of the thing more than i do to miss seyffert  sir richmond said nothing  it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seyffert has asked me if you were a married man  and of course you told her i was  on the second occasion  sir richmond smiled again  frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling  dont you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too muchwhat shall i sayromanticflirtatiousmeaning to this affair i dont mind that after my rather lavish confessions you should consider me a rather oversexed person but isnt your attitude rather unfairunjust indeed and almost insulting to this miss grammont after all shes a young lady of very good social position indeed she doesnt strike youdoes sheas an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable selfcontrol and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe asa maiden aunt say im twice her age we are a party of four there are conventions there are considerations arent you really my dear martineau overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests  am i said dr martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmonds face  i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted  then i shall prefer to leave your party  there were some moments of silence  i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice  it is not a dilemma said dr martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kenelm latter at bournemouth nothing simpler than to go to him now  i shall be sorry all the same  i could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened a little later  the matter was settled nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said but neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision  when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to thethe inconveniences your present code would set about it they would travel about together as they chose  the fundamental principle of the new age said the doctor will be honi soit qui mal y pense in these matters with perhaps fay ce que vouldras as its next injunction so long as other lives are not affected in matters of personal behaviour the world will probably be much more free and individuals much more open in their conscience and honour than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patchedup ruins of a very old one and youif you will forgive meare living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves as if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more may involve very serious consequences indeed with which i for one do not wish to be involved  sir richmond upon the hearthrug had a curious feeling that he was back in the head masters study at caxton  dr martineau went on with a lucidity that sir richmond found rather trying to give his impression of miss grammont and her position in life  she is he said manifestly a very expensively educated girl and in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favoured with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile miss seyffert is a fairly crude mixture of frankness insincerity and selfexplanatory egotism and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little  your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond  you know that  she has told me as much  hm wellshe impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions that is how i inferred that there was no mother i dont think there has been any stepmother either friendly or hostile there hasnt been i thought not she has had various governesses and companions ladies of birth and education engaged to look after her and she has done exactly what she liked with them her manner with miss seyffert an excellent manner for miss seyffert by the bye isnt the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day or for one person only she is a very sure and commanding young woman  sir richmond nodded  i suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butchered the thing has been done these business americans i am told neglect their womenkind give them money and power let them loose on the world it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honoured amused talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time  i think this must be near the truth of her biography said sir richmond  i suppose she has lovers  you dont mean  no i dont though that is a matter that ought to have no special interest for you i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss grammont is not silly and all this homage and facile approval probably bored her more than she realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewellery pet animals and books bound in a special sort of leather the prospect of being a rich mans only daughter until such time as it becomes advisable to change into a rich mans wealthy wife is probably not nearly so amusing as envious people might suppose i take it miss grammont had got all she could out of that sort of thing some time before the war and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was twenty i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presents those who seek find  what do you think she found  what would a rich girl find out there in america i dont know i havent the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction artists and writers even men of science menthere are still such menactive in the creative work of the empire  in america i suppose there is at least an equal variety made up of rather different types she would find that life was worth while to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her sex she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worth while for him i am inclined to think there was someone in her case who did seem to promise a sort of life that was worth while and that somehow the war came to alter the look of that promise  how  i dont know perhaps i am only romancing but for this young woman i am convinced this expedition to europe has meant experience harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance there have been love experiences experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there and something more than that what it is i dont know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didnt expect it she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth she has ceased to take the world for granted it hasnt broken her but it has matured her that i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you in her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on she sees history as you see it and i see it she is a very grownup young woman  its just that said sir richmond its just that if you see as much in miss grammont as all that why dont you want to come on with us you see the interest of her  i see a lot more than that you dont know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligiblenegligible that is the exact wordto them you cant look at a woman for five minutes without losing sight of her in a mist of imaginative excitement because she looks back at you i have the privilege of the negligiblewhich is a cool head miss grammont has a startled and matured mind an original mind yes and there is something more to be said her intelligence is better than her character  i dont quite see what you are driving at  the intelligence of all intelligent women is better than their characters goodness in a woman as we understand it seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity miss grammont has an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoilt child with no discipline you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends youon account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leeds arent you rather abusing the secrets of the confessional  this is the confessional it closes tomorrow morning but it is the confessional still look at the thing frankly you i say are also at loose ends can you deny it my dear sir dont we both know that ever since we left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three haporth of kindness a lost dog looking for a master youre a stray man looking for a mistress miss grammont being a woman is a little more selective than that but if shes at a loose end as i suppose she isnt protected by the sense of having made her selection and she has no preconceptions of what she wants you are a very interesting man in many ways you carry marriage and entanglements lightly with an air of being neither married nor entangled she is quite prepared to fall in love with you  but you dont really think that said sir richmond with an illconcealed eagerness  dr martineau rolled his face towards sir richmond these miraclesgrotesquelyhappen he said she knows nothing of martin leeds you must remember that  and then he added if she and you fall in love as the phrase goes what is to follow  there was a pause  sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offence  really he said this is preposterous you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf in our agesin our quality from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing are men and women to go on for everseparated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion  you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you two anyhow and at present the world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the core of this situation  a pause fell between the two gentlemen they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said  well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martineau that we have to part like this     chapter the seventh  companionship  section 1  well said dr martineau extending his hand to sir richmond on the salisbury station platform i leave you to it  his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation  ought you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond  i shall be interested to learn what happens  but if you wont stay to see  now sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and dr martineau got in  sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit  what else could i do he asked aloud to nobody in particular  for a little while he thought confusedly of the collapse of his expedition into the secret places of his own heart with dr martineau and then his prepossession with miss grammont resumed possession of his mind dr martineau was forgotten  section 2  for the better part of forty hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence or sleeping and dreaming dreams in which she never failed to play a part even if at times it was an altogether amazing and incongruous part and as they were both very frank and expressive people they already knew a very great deal about each other  for an american miss grammont was by no means autobiographical she gave no sketches of her idiosyncrasies and she repeated no remembered comments and prophets of her contemporaries about herself she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences and her liking for sir richmond was pleasingly manifest she liked his turn of thought she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favoured visitor  their ways of thought harmonized they talked at first chiefly about the history of the world and the extraordinary situation of aimlessness in a phase of ruin to which the great war had brought all europe if not all mankind the world excited them both in the same way as a crisis in which they were called upon to do somethingthey did not yet clearly know what into this topic they peered as into some deep pool side by side and in it they saw each other reflected  the visit to avebury had been a great success it had been a perfect springtime day and the little inn had been delighted at the reappearance of sir richmonds car so soon after its departure its delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch both miss grammont and miss seyffert displayed an intelligent interest in their food after lunch they had all gone out to the stones and the wall half a dozen sunburnt children were putting one of the partially overturned megaliths to a happy use by clambering to the top of it and sliding on their little behinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing  sir richmond and miss grammont had walked round the old circumvallation together but belinda seyffert had strayed away from them professing an interest in flowers it was not so much that she felt they had to be left together that made her do this as her own consciousness of being possessed by a devil who interrupted conversations  when miss grammont was keenly interested in a conversation then belinda had learnt from experience that it was wiser to go off with her devil out of the range of any temptation to interrupt  you really think said miss grammont that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards that new world of yoursof two hundred and fifty million fully developed beautiful and happy people  why not nobody is doing anything with the world except muddle about why not give it a direction  youd take it in your hands like clay  obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its own  her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice i believe what you say is possible if people dare  i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them i am tired of seeing all the world doing the same i am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great disasters here is something mankind can attempt that we can attempt  and will  i believe that as mankind grows up this is the business man has to settle down to and will settle down to  she considered that  ive been getting to believe something like this but it frightens me i suppose most of us have this same sort of dread of taking too much upon ourselves  so we just live like pigs sensible little piggywiggys ive got a committee full of that sort of thing we live like little modest pigs and let the world go hang and pride ourselves upon our freedom from the sin of presumption  not quite that  well how do you put it  we are afraid she said its too vast we want bright little lives of our own  exactlysensible little piggywiggys  we have a right to lifeand happiness  first said sir richmond as much right as a pig has to food but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings who have imaginations want something more nowadays of course we want bright lives of course we want happiness just as we want food just as we want sleep but when we have eaten when we have slept when we have jolly things about usit is nothing we have been made an exception ofand got our rations the big thing confronts us still it is vast i agree but vast as it is it is the thing we have to think about i do not know why it should be so but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind i want it as my culminating want i want a world in order a disciplined mankind going on to greater things dont you  now you tell me of it she said with a smile i do  but before  no youve made it clear it wasnt clear before  ive been talking of this sort of thing with my friend dr martineau and ive been thinking as well as talking that perhaps is why im so clear and positive  i dont complain that you are clear and positive ive been coming along the same way its refreshing to meet you  i found it refreshing to meet martineau a twinge of conscience about dr martineau turned sir richmond into a new channel hes a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects devoted to his work and hes writing a book which has saturated him in these ideas only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it the psychology of a new age the world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its history the adolescence so to speak of mankind it is an idea that seizes the imagination there is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities we are sharing the adolescence of our race it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us it is bringing us into directer relation with public affairsmaking them matter as formerly they didnt seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board  i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before  the private life she said has a way of coming aboard again  her reflections travelled fast and broke out now far ahead of him  you have some sort of work cut out for you she said abruptly  yes yes i have  i havent she said  so that i go about she added like someone who is looking for something id like to know if its not jabbing too searching a question at youwhat you have found  sir richmond considered incidentally he smiled i want to get a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbaric person your father i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world control of fuel production and distribution we have a fuel commission in london with rather wide powers of enquiry into the whole world problem of fuel we shall come out to washington presently with proposals  miss grammont surveyed the landscape i suppose she said poor father is rather like an unbroken mule in business affairs so many of our big business men in america are hell lash out at you  i dont mind if only he lashes out openly in the sight of all men  she considered and turned on sir richmond gravely  tell me what you want to do to him you find out so many things for me that i seem to have been thinking about in a sort of almost invisible halfconscious way ive been suspecting for a long time that civilization wasnt much good unless it got people like my father under some sort of control but controlling fatheras distinguished from managing him she reviewed some private and amusing memories he is a most intractable man  section 3  they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives hurting and disordering hundreds of thousands of people they dont seem to know what they are doing they have no plans in particular and you are getting something going that will be a plan and a direction and a conscience and a control for them you will find my father extremely difficult but some of our younger men would love it  and she went on there are american women whod love it too were petted were kept out of things we arent placed we dont get enough to do were spenders and wastersnot always from choice while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker with all the empty unspeakable solemnity of the male and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings  that cant go on she said  her eyes went back to the long low undulating skyline of the downs she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life that isnt going on she said with an effect of conclusive decision  sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martineau he recalled too the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments he smiled at the idea of any facile passion in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality martineau was very fineminded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter but passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest then it wasnt so necessary it might happen but it wasnt so necessary if it did it would be a secondary thing to companionship thats what she wasa companion  but a very lovely and wonderful companion the companion one would not relinquish until the very last moment one could keep with her  her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond  i realize ive got to be a responsible american citizen she had said that didnt mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well she had no illusions about the power of the former class it didnt exist they were steered to their decisions by people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates the owners of america the real responsible citizens or they fell a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries but anyhow they were steered she herself it was clear was bound to become a very responsible citizen indeed she would some day she laughed be swimming in oil and such like property her interest in sir richmonds schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was therefore she realized a very direct one but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that  father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mr grammonts sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost then he gave his intelligence chiefly to schemes for tying her up against the machinations of adventurers by means of trustees partners lawyers advisers agreements and suchlike complications or for acquiring a workable son by marriage to this last idea it would seem the importance in her life of the rather heavily named gunter lake was to be ascribed but another mood of the old mans was distrust of anything that could not be spoken of as his own flesh and blood and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicability of his lifes ideal there was hetty green  this latter idea had reft her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe and thrust her for the mornings and a moiety of the afternoons of the better part of a year after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and an office down town she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mr grammont because he feared his own people wouldnt train her hard she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two menservants and a trustworthy secretary used to pick her out from the torrent of undistinguished workers that poured out of the synoptical building this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into mexico there apparently she had really done responsible work  but upon the question of labour mr grammont was fierce even for an american business man and one night at a dinner party he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas this had produced a violent revulsion towards the purdah system and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasnt half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way mr lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment there was some story however connected with her war services in europe upon which miss grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell about that story sir richmond was left at the end of his avebury day and after his last talk with dr martineau still quite vaguely guessing  so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmonds mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as allusions or by way of illustration the sustaining topic was this new age sir richmond fore shadowed this world under scientific control the utopia of fully developed people fully developing the resources of the earth for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to dr martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that dr martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmonds mind before his talks with dr martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise tomorrow the new age will be here no doubt but today it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings  so that it was natural for miss grammont and sir richmond to ask what are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically ordered an immense organization of mature commonsense healthy and secure gathering knowledge and power for creative adventures as yet beyond dreaming they were prepared to think of the makers of the avebury dyke as their yesterday selves of the stone age savages as a phase in their late childhood and of this great world order sir richmond foresaw as a day where dawn was already at hand and in such long perspectives the states governments and institutions of today became very temporarylooking and replaceable structures indeed both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before sir richmond was still turning over in his mind the happy mutual release of the imagination this chance companionship had brought about when he found himself back again at the threshold of the old george  section 4  sir richmond hardy was not the only man who was thinking intently about miss grammont at that particular moment two gentlemen were coming towards her across the atlantic whose minds it chanced were very busily occupied by her affairs one of these was her father who was lying in his brass bed in his commodious cabin on the hollandia regretting his diminishing ability to sleep in the early morning now even when he was in the strong and soothing air of midatlantic and thinking of vv because she had a way of coming into his mind when it was undefended and the other was mr gunter lake on the megantic one day out from sandy hook who found himself equally sleepless and preoccupied and although mr lake was a man of vast activities and complicated engagements he was coming now to europe for the express purpose of seeing vv and having things out with her fully and completely because in spite of all that had happened she made such an endless series of delays in coming to america  old grammont as he appeared upon the pillow of his bed by the light of a roseshaded bedside lamp was a smallheaded greyhaired gentleman with a wrinkled face and sunken brown eyes years of business experience mitigated only by such exercise as the game of poker affords had intensified an instinctive inexpressiveness under the most solitary circumstances old grammont was still inexpressive and the face that stared at the ceiling of his cabin and the problem of his daughter might have been the face of a pickled head in a museum for any indication it betrayed of the flow of thought within he lay on his back and his bent knees lifted the bedclothes into a sharp mountain he was not even trying to sleep  why he meditated had vv stayed on in europe so much longer than she need have done and why had gunter lake suddenly got into a state of mind about her why didnt the girl confide in her father at least about these things what was afoot she had thrown over lake once and it seemed she was going to turn him down again well if she was an ordinary female person that was a silly sort of thing to do with her fortune and hisyou could buy the world but suppose she was not all ordinary female person her mother hadnt been ordinary anyhow whatever else you called her and no one could call grammont blood all ordinary fluid  old grammont had never had any delusions about lake if lakes father hadnt been a big man lake would never have counted for anything at all suppose she did turn him down in itself that wasnt a thing to break her fathers heart  what did matter was not whether she threw lake over but what she threw him over for if it was because he wasnt man enough well and good but if it was for some other lover some goodlooking worthless impostor some european title or suchlike folly  at the thought of a lover for vv a sudden flood of anger poured across the old mans mind behind the still mask of his face it infuriated him even to think of vv his little vv his own girl entertaining a lover being possiblymost shameful thoughtin love like some ordinary silly female sinking to kisses to the deeds one could buy and pay for his vv the idea infuriated and disgusted him he fought against it as a possibility once some woman in new york had ventured to hint something to him of some fellow some affair with an artist caston she had linked this caston with vvs red cross nursing in europe old grammont had made that woman sorry she spoke afterwards he had caused enquiries to be made about this caston careful enquiries it seems that he and vv had known each other there had been something but nothing that vv need be ashamed of when old grammonts enquiry man had come back with his report old grammont had been very particular about that at first the fellow had not been very clear rather muddled indeed as to how things wereno doubt he had wanted to make out there was something just to seem to earn his money old grammont had struck the table sharply and the eyes that looked out of his mask had blazed what have you found out against her he had asked in a low even voice absolutely nothing sir said the agent suddenly white to the lips  old grammont stared at his memory of that moment for a while that affair was all right quite all right of course it was all right and also happily caston was among the dead but it was well her broken engagement with lake had been resumed as though it had never been broken off if there had been any talk that fact answered it and now that lake had served his purpose old grammont did not care in the least if he was shelved vv could stand alone  old grammont had got a phrase in his mind that looked like dominating the situation he dreamt of saying to vv vv im going to make a man of youif youre man enough that was a large proposition it impliedoh it implied all sorts of things it meant that she would care as little for philandering as an able young business man perhaps some day a long time ahead she might marry there wasnt much reason for it but it might be she would not wish to be called a spinster take a husband thought old grammont when i am gone as one takes a butler to make the household complete in previous meditations on his daughters outlook old grammont had found much that was very suggestive in the precedent of queen victoria she had had no husband of the lord and master type so to speak but only a prince consort well in hand why shouldnt the grammont heiress dominate her male belonging if it came to that in the same fashion why shouldnt one tie her up and tie the whole thing up so far as any male belonging was concerned leaving vv in all other respects free how could one do it  the speculative calm of the sunken brown eyes deepened  his thoughts went back to the white face of the private enquiry agent absolutely nothing sir what had the fellow thought of hinting nothing of that kind in vvs composition never fear yet it was a curious anomaly that while one had a thousand ways of defending ones daughter and ones property against that daughters husband there was no power on earth by which a father could stretch his dead hand between that daughter and the undue influence of a lover unless you tied her up for good and all lover or none  one was left at the mercy of vvs character  i ought to see more of her he thought she gets away from me just as her mother did a man need not suspect his womenkind but he should know what they are doing it is duty his protective duty to them these companions these seyffert women and so forth were all very well in their way there wasnt much they kept from you if you got them cornered and asked them intently but a fathers eye is better he must go about with the girl for a time watch her with other men give her chances to talk business with him and see if she took them vv im going to make a man of you the phrase ran through his brain the deep instinctive jealousy of the primordial father was still strong in old grammonts blood it would be pleasant to go about with her on his right hand in paris his girl straight and lovely desirable and unapproachableabove that sort of nonsense above all other masculine subjugation  vv im going to make a man of you  his mind grew calmer whatever she wanted in paris should be hers hed just let her rip theyd be like sweethearts together he and his girl  old grammont dozed off into dreamland  section 5  the imaginations of mr gunter lake two days behind mr grammont upon the atlantic were of a gentler more romantic character in them vv was no longer a daughter in the fierce focus of a fathers jealousy but the goddess enshrined in a good mans heart indeed the figure that the limelight of the reverie fell upon was not vv at all but mr gunter lake himself in his favourite role of the perfect lover  an interminable speech unfolded itself i ask for nothing in return ive never worried you about that caston business and i never will married to me you shall be as free as if you were unmarried dont i know my dear girl that you dont love me yet let that be as you wish i want nothing you are not willing to give me nothing at all all i ask is the privilege of making life happyand it shall be happyfor you all i ask all i ask protect guard cherish  for to mr gunter lake it seemed there could be no lovelier thing in life than a wife in name only slowly warmed into a glow of passion by the steadfast devotion and the strength and wisdom of a mate at first despised until at last a day would come  my darling mr gunter lake whispered to the darkness my little guurl it has been worth the waiting  section 6  miss grammont met sir richmond in the bureau of the old george with a telegram in her hand my father reported his latitude and longitude by wireless last night the london people think he will be off falmouth in four days time he wants me to join his liner there and go on to cherbourg and paris hes arranged that he is the sort of man who can arrange things like that therell be someone at falmouth to look after us and put us aboard the liner i must wire them where i can pick up a telegram tomorrow  wells in somerset said sir richmond  his plans were already quite clear he explained that he wanted her first to see shaftesbury a little old wessex town that was three or four hundred years older than salisbury perched on a hill a saxon town where alfred had gathered his forces against the danes and where canute who had ruled over all scandinavia and iceland and greenland and had come near ruling a patch of america had died it was a little sleepy place now looking out dreamily over beautiful views they would lunch in shaftesbury and walk round it then they would go in the afternoon through the pleasant west country where the celts had prevailed against the old folk of the stonehenge temple and the romans against the celts and the saxons against the romanized britons and the danes against the saxons a warscarred landscape abounding in dykes and entrenchments and castles sunken now into the deepest peace to glastonbury to see what there was to see of a marsh village the celts had made for themselves three or four hundred years before the romans came and at glastonbury also there were the ruins of a great benedictine church and abbey that had once rivalled salisbury thence they would go on to wells to see yet another great cathedral and to dine and sleep glastonbury abbey and wells cathedral brought the story of europe right up to reformation times  that will be a good day for us said sir richmond it will be like turning over the pages of the history of our family to and fro there will be nothing nearly so old as avebury in it but there will be something from almost every chapter that comes after stonehenge rome will be poorly represented but that may come the day after at bath and the next day too i want to show you something of our old river severn we will come right up to the present if we go through bristol there we shall have a whiff of america our new find from which the tobacco comes and we shall be reminded of how we set sail thitherwas it yesterday or the day before you will understand at bristol how it is that the energy has gone out of this dreaming landto africa and america and the whole wide world it was the good men of bristol by the bye with their trade from africa to america who gave you your colour problem bristol we may go through tomorrow and gloucester mother of i dont know how many american gloucesters bath well get in somehow and then as an angloamerican showman i shall be tempted to run you northward a little way past tewkesbury just to go into a church here and there and show you monuments bearing little shields with the stars and stripes upon them a few stars and a few stripes the washington family monuments  it was not only from england that america came said miss grammont  but england takes an american memory back most easily and most fullyto avebury and the baltic northmen past the emperors and the corinthian columns that smothered latin europe for you and me anyhow this is our past this was our childhood and this is our land he interrupted laughing as she was about to reply well anyhow he said it is a beautiful day and a pretty country before us with the ripest history in every grain of its soil so well send a wire to your london people and tell them to send their instructions to wells  ill tell belinda she said to be quick with her packing  section 7  as miss grammont and sir richmond hardy fulfilled the details of his excellent programme and revised their impressions of the past and their ideas about the future in the springtime sunlight of wiltshire and somerset with miss seyffert acting the part of an almost ostentatiously discreet chorus it was inevitable that their conversation should become by imperceptible gradations more personal and intimate they kept up the pose which was supposed to represent dr martineaus philosophy of being man and woman on their planet considering its future but insensibly they developed the idiosyncrasies of their position they might profess to be man and woman in the most general terms but the facts that she was the daughter not of everyman but old grammont and that sir richmond was the angry leader of a minority upon the fuel commission became more and more important what shall we do with this planet of ours gave way by the easiest transitions to what are you and i doing and what have we got to do how do you feel about it all what do you desire and what do you dare  it was natural that sir richmond should talk of his fuel commission to a young woman whose interests in fuel were even greater than his own he found that she was very much better read than he was in the recent literature of socialism and that she had what he considered to be a most unfeminine grasp of economic ideas he thought her attitude towards socialism a very sane one because it was also his own so far as socialism involved the idea of a scientific control of natural resources as a common property administered in the common interest she and he were very greatly attracted by it but so far as it served as a form of expression for the merely insubordinate discontent of the many with the few under any conditions so long as it was a formula for class jealousy and warfare they were both repelled by it if she had had any illusions about the working class possessing as a class any profounder political wisdom or more generous public impulses than any other class those illusions had long since departed people were much the same she thought in every class there was no stratification of either rightness or righteousness  he found he could talk to her of his work and aims upon the fuel commission and of the conflict and failure of motives he found in himself as freely as he had done to dr martineau and with a surer confidence of understanding perhaps his talks with the doctor had got his ideas into order and made them more readily expressible than they would have been otherwise he argued against the belief that any class could be good as a class or bad as a class and he instanced the conflict of motives he found in all the members of his committee and most so in himself he repeated the persuasion he had already confessed to dr martineau that there was not a single member of the fuel commission but had a considerable drive towards doing the right thing about fuel and not one who had a singleminded unencumbered drive towards the right thing that said sir richmond is what makes life so interesting and in spite of a thousand tragic disappointments so hopeful every man is a bad man every man is a feeble man and every man is a good man my motives come and go yours do the same we vary in response to the circumstances about us given a proper atmosphere most men will be publicspirited rightliving generous given perplexities and darkness most of us can be cowardly and vile people say you cannot change human nature and perhaps that is true but you can change its responses endlessly the other day i was in bohemia discussing silesian coal with benes and i went to see the festival of the bohemian sokols opposite to where i sat far away across the arena was a great bank of men of the sokol organizations an unbroken brown mass wrapped in their brown uniform cloaks suddenly the sun came out and at a word the whole body flung back their cloaks showed their garibaldi shirts and became one solid blaze of red it was an amazing transformation until one understood what had happened yet nothing material had changed but the sunshine and given a change in laws and prevailing ideas and the very same people who are greedy traders grasping owners and revolting workers today will all throw their cloaks aside and you will find them working together cheerfully even generously for a common end they arent traders and owners and workers and so forth by any inner necessity those are just the ugly parts they play in the present drama which is nearly at the end of its run  thats a hopeful view said miss grammont i dont see the flaw in itif there is a flaw  there isnt one said sir richmond it is my chief discovery about life i began with the question of fuel and the energy it affords mankind and i have found that my generalization applies to all human affairs human beings are fools weaklings cowards passionate idiotsi grant you that is the brown cloak side of them so to speak but they are not such fools and so forth that they cant do pretty well materially if once we hammer out a sane collective method of getting and using fuel which people generally will understandin the place of our present methods of snatch and wrangle of that i am absolutely convinced some work some help some willingness you can get out of everybody thats the red and the same principle applies to most labour and property problems to health to education to population social relationships and war and peace we havent got the right system we have inefficient halfbaked systems or no system at all and a wild confusion and war of ideas in all these respects but there is a right system possible none the less let us only hammer our way through to the sane and reasonable organization in this and that and the other human affairs and once we have got it we shall have got it for good we may not live to see even the beginnings of success but the spirit of order the spirit that has already produced organized science if only there are a few faithful persistent people to stick to the job will in the long run certainly save mankind and make human life clean and splendid happy work in a clear mind if i could live to see it  and as for usin our time  measured by the end we serve we dont matter you know we dont matter  we have to find our fun in the building and in our confidence that we do really build  so long as our confidence lasts there is no great hardship said sir richmond  so long as our confidence lasts she repeated after him  ah cried sir richmond there it is so long as our confidence lasts so long as one keeps ones mind steady that is what i came away with dr martineau to discuss i went to him for advice i havent known him for more than a month its amusing to find myself preaching forth to you it was just faith i had lost suddenly i had lost my power of work my confidence in the rightness of what i was doing evaporated my will failed me i dont know if you will understand what that means it wasnt that my reason didnt assure me just as certainly as ever that what i was trying to do was the right thing to try to do but somehow that seemed a cold and personally unimportant proposition the life had gone out of it  he paused as if arrested by a momentary doubt  i dont know why i tell you these things he said  you tell them me she said  its a little like a patient in a hydropath retailing his ailments  no no go on  i began to think now that what took the go out of me as my work went on was the lack of any real fellowship in what i was doing it was the pressure of the opposition in the committee day afterday it was being up against men who didnt reason against me but who just showed by everything they did that the things i wanted to achieve didnt matter to them one rap it was going back to a home lunching in clubs reading papers going about a world in which all the organization all the possibility of the organization i dream of is tacitly denied i dont know if it seems an extraordinary confession of weakness to you but that steady refusal of the majority of my committee to come into cooperation with me has beaten meor at any rate has come very near to beating me most of them you know are such able men you can feel their knowledge and commonsense they and everybody about me seemed busy and intent upon more immediate things that seemed more real to them than this remote theoretical priggish end i have set for myself  he paused  go on said miss grammont i think i understand this  and yet i know i am right  i know you are right im certain go on  if one of those ten thousand members of the sokol society had thrown back his brown cloak and shown red when all the others still kept them selves cloakedif he was a normal sensitive manhe might have felt something of a fool he might have felt premature and presumptuous red he was and the others he knew were red also but why show it that is the peculiar distress of people like ourselves who have some sense of history and some sense of a larger life within us than our merely personal life we dont want to go on with the old story merely we want to live somehow in that larger life and to live for its greater ends and lose something unbearable of ourselves and in wanting to do that we are only wanting to do what nearly everybody perhaps is ripe to do and will presently want to do when the new age martineau talks about begins to come it may come very quicklyas the red came at prague but for the present everyone hesitates about throwing back the cloak  until the cloak becomes unbearable she said repeating his word  i came upon this holiday in the queerest state i thought i was ill i thought i was overworked but the real trouble was a loneliness that robbed me of all driving force nobody seemed thinking and feeling with me i have never realized until now what a gregarious beast man is it needed only a day or so with martineau in the atmosphere of ideas and beliefs like my own to begin my restoration now as i talk to youthat is why i have clutched at your company because here you are coming from thousands of miles away and you talk my ideas you fall into my ways of thought as though we had gone to the same school  perhaps we have gone to the same school she said  you mean  disappointment disillusionment having to find something better in life than the first things it promised us  but you disappointed i thought that in america people might be educating already on different lines  even in america miss grammont said crops only grow on the ploughed land  section 8  glastonbury in the afternoon was wonderful they talked of avalon and of that vanished legendary world of king arthur and his knights and in the early evening they came to wells and a pleasant inn with a quaint little garden before its front door that gave directly upon the cathedral the three tourists devoted a golden half hour before dinner to the sculptures on the western face the great screen of wrought stone rose up warmly grey and clear and distinct against a clear blue sky in which the moon hung round and already bright that western facade with its hundreds of little figures tells the whole story of god and man from adam to the last judgment as the mediaeval mind conceived it it is an even fuller exposition than the carved bible history that goes round the chapter house at salisbury it presented the universe said sir richmond as a complete crystal globe it explained everything in life in a simple and natural manner hope heaven devil and despair generations had lived and died mentally within that crystal globe convinced that it was all and complete  and now said miss grammont we are in limitless space and time the crystal globe is broken  and said belinda amazinglyfor she had been silent for some time the goldfish are on the floor vv free to flop about are they any happier  it was one of those sudden rhetorical triumphs that are best left alone i trow not said belinda giving the last touch to it  after dinner sir richmond and miss grammont walked round the cathedral and along by the moat of the bishops palace and miss seyffert stayed in the hotel to send off postcards to her friends a duty she had neglected for some days the evening was warm and still and the moon was approaching its full and very bright insensibly the soft afterglow passed into moonlight  at first the two companions talked very little sir richmond was well content with this tacit friendliness and miss grammont was preoccupied because she was very strongly moved to tell him things about herself that hitherto she had told to no one it was not merely that she wanted to tell him these things but also that for reasons she did not put as yet very clearly to herself she thought they were things he ought to know she talked of herself at first in general terms life comes on anyone with a rush childhood seems lasting for ever and then suddenly one tears into life she said it was even more so for women than it was for men you are shown life a crowded vast spectacle full of what seems to be intensely interesting activities and endless delightful and frightful and tragic possibilities and you have hardly had time to look at it before you are called upon to make decisions and there is something in your blood that urges you to decisive acts your mind your reason resists give me time it says they clamour at you with treats crowds shows theatres all sorts of things lovers buzz at you each trying to fix you part of his life when you are trying to get clear to live a little of your own her father had had one merit at any rate he had been jealous of her lovers and very ready to interfere  i wanted a lover to love she said every girl of course wants that i wanted to be tremendously excited and at the same time i dreaded the enormous interference  i wasnt temperamentally a cold girl men interested and excited me but there were a lot of men about and they clashed with each other perhaps way down in some out of the way place i should have fallen in love quite easily with the one man who came along but no man fixed his image after a year or so i think i began to lose the power which is natural to a young girl of falling very easily into love i became critical of the youths and men who were attracted to me and i became analytical about myself  i suppose it is because you and i are going to part so soon that i can speak so freely to you but there are things about myself that i have never had out even with myself i can talk to myself in you  she paused baffled i know exactly said sir richmond  in my composition i perceive there have always been two ruling strains i was a spoilt child at home a rather reserved girl at school keen on my dignity i liked respect i didnt give myself away i suppose one would call that personal pride anyhow it was that streak made me value the position of being a rich married woman in new york that was why i became engaged to lake he seemed to be as good a man as there was about he said he adored me and wanted me to crown his life he wasnt illlooking or illmannered the second main streak in my nature wouldnt however fit in with that  she stopped short  the second streak said sir richmond  ohlove of beauty love of romance i want to give things their proper names i dont want to pretend to you it was more or less than that it wasimaginative sensuousness why should i pretend it wasnt in me i believe that streak is in all women  i believe so too in all properly constituted women  i tried to devote that streak to lake she said i did my best for him but lake was much too much of a gentleman or an idealist about women or what you will to know his business as a lover and that side of me fell in love the rest of me protesting with a man named caston it was a notorious affair everybody in new york couples my name with caston except when my father is about his jealousy has blasted an area of silencein that matterall round him he will not know of that story and they dare not tell him i should pity anyone who tried to tell it him  what sort of man was this caston  miss grammont seemed to consider she did not look at sir richmond she kept her profile to him  he was she said deliberately a very rotten sort of man  she spoke like one resolved to be exact and judicial i believe i always knew he wasnt right but he was very handsome and ten years younger than lake and nobody else seemed to be all right so i swallowed that he was an artist a painter perhaps you know his work sir richmond shook his head he could make american business men look like characters out of the three musketeers they said and he was beginning to be popular he made love to me in exactly the way lake didnt if i shut my eyes to one or two things it was delightful i liked it but my father would have stood a painter as my husband almost as cheerfully as he would a man of colour i made a fool of myself as people say about caston wellwhen the war came he talked in a way that irritated me he talked like an east side annunzio about art and war it made me furious to know it was all talk and that he didnt mean business i made him go  she paused for a moment he hated to go  then i relented or i missed him and i wanted to be made love to or i really wanted to go on my own account i forget i forget my motives altogether now that early war time was a queer time for everyone a kind of wildness got into the blood i threw over lake all the time things had been going on in new york i had still been engaged to lake i went to france i did good work i did do good work and also things were possible that would have seemed fantastic in america you know something of the wartime atmosphere there was death everywhere and people snatched at gratifications caston made tomorrow we die his text we contrived three days in paris togethernot very cleverly all sorts of people know about it we went very far  she stopped short well said sir richmond  he did die  another long pause they told me caston had been killed but someone hintedor i guessedthat there was more in it than an ordinary casualty  nobody i think realizes that i know this is the first time i have ever confessed that i do know he wasshot he was shot for cowardice  that might happen to any man said sir richmond presently no man is a hero all round the twentyfour hours perhaps he was caught by circumstances unprepared he may have been taken by surprise  it was the most calculated coldblooded cowardice imaginable he let three other men go on and get killed   no it is no good your inventing excuses for a man you know nothing about it was vile contemptible cowardice and meanness it fitted in with a score of ugly little things i remembered it explained them all i know the evidence and the judgment against him were strictly just and true because they were exactly in character and that you see was my man that was the lover i had chosen that was the man to whom i had given myself with both hands  her soft unhurrying voice halted for a time and then resumed in the same even tones of careful statement i wasnt disgusted not even with myself about him i was chiefly sorry intensely sorry because i had made him come out of a life that suited and protected him to the war about myself i was stunned and perplexed i had the clearest realization that what you and i have been calling the bright little personal life had broken off short and was spoilt and over and done with i felt as though it was my body they had shot and there i was with fifty years of life left in me and nothing particular to do with them  that was just the prelude to life said sir richmond  it didnt seem so at the time i felt i had to got hold of something or go to pieces i couldnt turn to religion i had no religion and duty what is duty i set myself to that i had a kind of revelation one night either i find out what all this world is about i said or i perish i have lost myself and i must forget myself by getting hold of something bigger than myself and becoming that thats why i have been making a sort of historical pilgrimage thats my story sir richmond thats my education somehow though your troubles are different it seems to me that my little muddle makes me understand how it is with you what youve got this idea of a scientific ordering of the world is what i in my younger less experienced way have been feeling my way towards i want to join on i want to got hold of this idea of a great fuel control in the world and of a still greater economic and educational control of which it is a part i want to make that idea a part of myself rather i want to make myself a part of it when you talk of it i believe in it altogether  and i believe in it when i talk of it to you  section 9  sir richmond was stirred very deeply by miss grammonts confidences his dispute with dr martineau was present in his mind so that he did not want to make love to her but he was extremely anxious to express his vivid sense of the value of her friendship and while he hesitated over this difficult and unfamiliar task she began to talk again of herself and in such a way as to give a new turn to sir richmonds thoughts  perhaps i ought to tell you a little more about myself she said now that i have told you so much i did a thing that still puzzles me i was filled with a sense of hopeless disaster in france and i suppose i had some sort of desperate idea of saving something out of the situation i renewed my correspondence with gunter lake he made the suggestion i knew he would make and i renewed our engagement  to go back to wealth and dignity in new york  yes  but you dont love him  thats always been plain to me but what i didnt realize until i had given my promise over again was that i dislike him acutely  you hadnt realized that before  i hadnt thought about him sufficiently but now i had to think about him a lot the other affair had given me an idea perhaps of what it means to be married to a man and here i am drifting back to him the horrible thing about him is the steady enveloping way in which he has always come at me without fellowship without any community of ideas ready to make the most extraordinary bargains so long as he can in any way fix me and get me what does it mean what is there behind those watching soliciting eyes of his i dont in the least love him and this desire and service and all the rest of it he offers meits not love its not even such love as caston gave me its a game he plays with his imagination  she had released a flood of new ideas in sir richmonds mind this is illuminating he said you dislike lake acutely you always have disliked him  i suppose i have but its only now i admit it to myself  yes and you might for example have married him in new york before the war  it came very near to that  and then probably you wouldnt have discovered you disliked him you wouldnt have admitted it to yourself  i suppose i shouldnt i suppose i should have tried to believe i loved him  women do this sort of thing odd i never realized it before and there are endless wives suppressing an acute dislike my wife does i see now quite clearly that she detests me reasonably enough from her angle im entirely detestable but she wont admit it wont know of it she never will to the end of my life always she will keep that detestation unconfessed she puts a face on the matter we both do and this affair of yours have you thought how unjust it is to lake  not nearly so much as i might have done  it is unfair to him atrociously unfair hes not my sort of man perhaps but it will hurt him cruelly according to the peculiar laws of his being he seems to me a crawling sort of lover with an immense selfconceit at the back of his crawlingness  he has she endorsed  he backs himself to crawluntil he crawls triumphantly right over you i dont like to think of the dream he has i take it he will lose is it fair to go into this game with him  in the interests of lake she said smiling softly at sir richmond in the moonlight but you are perfectly right  and suppose he doesnt lose  sir richmond found himself uttering sentiments  there is only one decent way in which a civilized man and a civilized woman may approach one another passionate desire is not enough what is called love is not enough pledges rational considerations all these things are worthless all these things are compatible with hate the primary essential is friendship clear understanding absolute confidence then within that condition in that elect relationship love is permissible mating marriage or no marriage as you willall things are permissible  came a long pause between them  dear old cathedral said miss grammont a little irrelevantly she had an air of having concluded something that to sir richmond seemed scarcely to have begun she stood looking at the great dark facade edged with moonlight for some moments and then turned towards the hotel which showed a pinklit window  i wonder she said if belinda is still up and what she will think when i tell her of the final extinction of mr lake i think she rather looked forward to being the intimate friend secrets and everything of mrs gunter lake  section 10  sir richmond woke up at dawn and he woke out of an extraordinary dream he was saying to miss grammont there is no other marriage than the marriage of true minds there is no other marriage than the marriage of true minds he saw her as he had seen her the evening before light and cool coming towards him in the moonlight from the hotel but also in the inconsistent way of dreams he was very close to her kind faintly smiling face and his eyes were wet with tears and he was kissing her hand my dear wife and mate he was saying and suddenly he was kissing her cool lips  he woke up and stared at his dream which faded out only very slowly before the fresh sun rise upon the red tiles and tree boughs outside the open window and before the first stir and clamour of the birds  he felt like a court in which some overwhelmingly revolutionary piece of evidence had been tendered all the elaborate defence had broken down at one blow he sat up on the edge of his bed facing the new fact  this is monstrous and ridiculous he said and martineau judged me exactly i am in love with her i am head over heels in love with her i have never been so much in love or so truly in love with anyone before  section 11  that was the dawn of a long day of tension for sir richmond and miss grammont because each was now vividly aware of being in love with the other and so neither was able to see how things were with the other they were afraid of each other a restraint had come upon them both a restraint that was greatly enhanced by their sense of belinda acutely observant ostentatiously tactful and selfeffacing and prepared at the slightest encouragement to be overwhelmingly romantic and sympathetic their talk waned and was revived to an artificial activity and waned again the historical interest had evaporated from the west of england and left only an urgent and embarrassing present  but the loveliness of the weather did not fail and the whole day was set in severn landscapes they first saw the great river like a sea with the welsh mountains hanging in the sky behind as they came over the mendip crest above shipham they saw it again as they crossed the hill before clifton bridge and so they continued climbing to hill crests for views at alveston and near dursley and so to gloucester and the lowest bridge and thence back down stream again through fat meadow lands at first and much appleblossom and then over gentle hills through wide pale nownham and lidney and alvington and woolaston to old chepstow and its brown castle always with the widening estuary to the left of them and its foaming shoals and shining sand banks from chepstow they turned back north along the steep wye gorge to tintern and there at the snug little beaufort arms with its prim lawn and flower garden they ended the days journey  tintern abbey they thought a poor graceless mass of ruin down beside the river and it was fenced about jealously and locked up from their invasion after dinner sir richmond and miss grammont went for a walk in the mingled twilight and moonlight up the hill towards chepstow both of them were absurdly and nervously pressing to belinda to come with them but she was far too wise to take this sudden desire for her company seriously her dinner shoes she said were too thin perhaps she would change and come out a little later yes come later said miss grammont and led the way to the door  they passed through the garden i think we go up the hill  said sir richmond  yes she agreed up the hill  followed a silence  sir richmond made an effort but after some artificial and disconnected talk about tintern abbey concerning which she had no history ready and then still lamer about whether monmouthshire is in england or wales silence fell again the silence lengthened assumed a significance a dignity that no common words might break  then sir richmond spoke i love you he said with all my heart  her soft voice came back after a stillness i love you she said with all myself  i had long ceased to hope said sir richmond that i should ever find a friend a lover perfect companionship  they went on walking side by side without touching each other or turning to each other  all the things i wanted to think i believe have come alive in me she said  cool and sweet said sir richmond such happiness as i could not have imagined  the light of a silent bicycle appeared above them up the hill and swept down upon them lit their two still faces brightly and passed  my dear she whispered in the darkness between the high hedges  they stopped short and stood quite still trembling he saw her face dim and tender looking up to his  then he took her in his arms and kissed her lips as he had desired in his dream  when they returned to the inn belinda seyffert offered flat explanations of why she had not followed them and enlarged upon the moonlight effect of the abbey ruins from the inn lawn but the scared congratulations in her eyes betrayed her recognition that momentous things had happened between the two     chapter the eighth  full moon  section 1  sir richmond had talked in the moonlight and shadows of having found such happiness as he could not have imagined but when he awoke in the night that happiness had evaporated he awoke suddenly out of this love dream that had lasted now for nearly four days and he awoke in a mood of astonishment and dismay  he had thought that when he parted from dr martineau he had parted also from that process of selfexploration that they had started together but now he awakened to find it established and in full activity in his mind something or someone a sort of etherealized martineauhardy an abstracted intellectual conscience was demanding what he thought he was doing with miss grammont and whither he thought he was taking her how he proposed to reconcile the close relationship with her that he was now embarked upon with in the first place his work upon and engagements with the fuel commission and in the second place martin leeds curiously enough lady hardy didnt come into the case at all he had done his utmost to keep martin leeds out of his head throughout the development of this affair now in an unruly and determined way that was extremely characteristic of her she seemed resolute to break in  she appeared as an advocate without affection for her client but without any hostility of the claims of miss grammont to be let alone the elaborate pretence that sir richmond had maintained to himself that he had not made love to miss grammont that their mutual attraction had been irresistible and had achieved its end in spite of their resolute and complete detachment collapsed and vanished from his mind he admitted to himself that driven by a kind of instinctive necessity he had led their conversation step by step to a realization and declaration of love and that it did not exonerate him in the least that miss grammont had been quite ready and willing to help him and meet him half way she wanted love as a woman does more than a man does and he had steadily presented himself as a man free to love able to love and loving  she wanted a man to love she wanted perfected fellowship and you have made her that tremendous promise that was implicit in your embrace and how can you keep that promise  it was as if martin spoke it was her voice it was the very quality of her thought  you belong to this work of yours which must needs be interrupted or abandoned if you take her whatever is not mortgaged to your work is mortgaged to me for the strange thing in all this is that you and i love one anotherand have no power to do otherwise in spite of all this  you have nothing to give her but stolen goods said the shadow of martin you have nothing to give anyone personally any more  think of the love that she desires and think of this love that you can give  is there any new thing in you that you can give her that you havent given me you and i know each other very well perhaps i know you too well havent you loved me as much as you can love anyone think of all that there has been between us that you are ready now eager now to set aside and forget as though it had never been for four days you have kept me out of your mind in order to worship her yet you have known i was therefor all you would not know no one else will ever be so intimate with you as i am we have quarrelled together wept together jested happily and jested bitterly you have spared me not at all pitiless and cruel you have been to me you have reckoned up all my faults against me as though they were sins you have treated me at times unlovinglynever was lover treated so unlovingly as you have sometimes treated me and yet i have your loveas no other woman can ever have it even now when you are wildly in love with this girls freshness and boldness and cleverness i come into your mind by right and necessity  she is different argued sir richmond  but you are the same said the shadow of martin with martins unsparing return your love has never been a steadfast thing it comes and goes like the wind you are an extravagantly imperfect lover but i have learnt to accept you as people accept the english weather never in all your life have you loved wholly fully steadfastlyas people deserve to be lovednot your mother nor your father not your wife nor your children nor me nor our child nor any living thing pleasant to all of us at timesat times bitterly disappointing you do not even love this work of yours steadfastly this work to which you sacrifice us all in turn you do not love enough that is why you have these moods and changes that is why you have these lassitudes so it is you are made  and that is why you must not take this brave young life so much simpler and braver than your own and exalt itas you can doand then fail it as you will do  sir richmonds mind and body lay very still for a time  should i fail her  for a time martin leeds passed from the foreground of his mind  he was astonished to think how planless instinctive and unforeseeing his treatment of miss grammont had been it had been just a blind drive to get hold of her and possess her  suddenly his passion for her became active in its defence again  but is there such a thing as a perfect love is yours a perfect love my dear martin with its insatiable jealousy its ruthless criticism has the world ever seen a perfect lover yet isnt it our imperfection that brings us together in a common need is miss grammont after all likely to get a more perfect love in all her life than this poor love of mine and isnt it good for her that she should love  perfect love cherishes perfect love foregoes  sir richmond found his mind wandering far away from the immediate question perfect love the phrase was his point of departure was it true that he could not love passionately and completely was that fundamentally what was the matter with him was that perhaps what was the matter with the whole world of mankind it had not yet come to that power of loving which makes action full and simple and direct and unhesitating man upon his planet has not grown up to love is still an eager egotistical and fluctuating adolescent he lacks the courage to love and the wisdom to love love is here but it comes and goes it is mixed with greeds and jealousies and cowardice and cowardly reservations one hears it only in snatches and single notes it is like something tuning up before the music begins the metaphor altogether ran away with sir richmonds half dreaming mind some day perhaps all life would go to music  love was music and power if he had loved enough he need never have drifted away from his wife love would have created love would have tolerated and taught and inspired where there is perfect love there is neither greed nor impatience he would have done his work calmly he would have won his way with his committee instead of fighting and quarrelling with it perpetually  flimsy creatures he whispered uncertain health uncertain strength a will that comes and goes moods of baseness moods of utter beastliness love like april sunshine april  he dozed and dreamt for a time of spring passing into a high summer sunshine into a continuing music of love he thought of a world like some great playhouse in which players and orchestra and audience all cooperate in a noble production without dissent or conflict he thought he was the savage of thirty thousand years ago dreaming of the great world that is still perhaps thirty thousand years ahead his effort to see more of that coming world than indistinct and cloudy pinnacles and to hear more than a vague music dissolved his dream and left him awake again and wrestling with the problem of miss grammont  section 2  the shadow of martin stood over him inexorable he had to release miss grammont from the adventure into which he had drawn her this decision stood out sternand inevitable in his mind with no conceivable alternative  as he looked at the task before him he began to realize its difficulty he was profoundly in love with her he was still only learning how deeply and she was not going to play a merely passive part in this affair she was perhaps as deeply in love with him  he could not bring himself to the idea of confessions and disavowals he could not bear to think of her disillusionment he felt that he owed it to her not to disillusion her to spoil things for her in that fashion to turn into something mean and ugly after she has believed in me it would be like playing a practical joke upon her it would be like taking her into my arms and suddenly making a grimace at her it would scar her with a second humiliation  should he take her on to bath or exeter tomorrow and contrive by some sudden arrival of telegrams that he had to go from her suddenly but a mere sudden parting would not end things between them now unless he went off abruptly without explanations or any arrangements for further communications at the outset of this escapade there had been a tacit but evident assumption that it was to end when she joined her father at falmouth it was with an effect of discovery that sir richmond realized that now it could not end in that fashion that with the whisper of love and the touching of lips something had been started that would go on that would develop to break off now and go away without a word would leave a raw and torn end would leave her perplexed and perhaps even more humiliated with an aching mystery to distress her why did he go was it something i saidsomething he found out or imagined  parting had disappeared as a possible solution of this problem she and he had got into each others lives to stay the real problem was the terms upon which they were to stay in each others lives close association had brought them to the point of being in the completest sense lovers that could not be and the real problem was the transmutation of their relationship to some form compatible with his honour and her happiness a word an idea from some recent reading floated into sir richmonds head sublimate he whispered we have to sublimate this affair we have to put this relationship upon a higher plane  his mind stopped short at that  presently his voice sounded out of the depths of his heart god how i loathe the higher plane  god has put me into this higher plane business like some poor little kid who has to wear irons on its legs  i want her do you hear martin i want her  as if by a lightning flash he saw his car with himself and miss grammontmiss seyffert had probably fallen outtraversing europe and asia in headlong flight to a sunlit beach in the south seas  his thoughts presently resumed as though these unmannerly and fantastic interruptions had not occurred  we have to carry the whole affair on to a higher planeand keep it there we two love one anotherthat has to be admitted now i ought never to have touched her i ought never to have thought of touching her but we two are too high our aims and work and obligations are too high for any ordinary love making that sort of thing would embarrass us would spoil everything  spoil everything he repeated rather like a small boy who learns an unpalatable lesson  for a time sir richmond exhausted by moral effort lay staring at the darkness  it has to be done i believe i can carry her through with it if i can carry myself shes a finer thing than i am on the whole i am glad its only one more day belinda will be about afterwards we can write to each other if we can get over the next day it will be all right then we can write about fuel and politicsand there wont be her voice and her presence we shall really sublimate first class ideasublimate and i will go back to dear old martin whos all alone there and miserable ill be kind to her and play my part and tell her her carbuncle scar rather becomes her and in a little while i shall be altogether in love with her again  queer what a brute ive always been to martin  queer that martin can come in a dream to me and take the upper hand with me  queer that nowi love martin  he thought still more profoundly by the time the committee meets again i shall have been tremendously refreshed  he repeatedput things on the higher plane and keep them there then go back to martin and so to the work thats it  nothing so pacifies the mind as a clearcut purpose sir richmond fell asleep during the fourth recapitulation of this programme  section 3  when miss grammont appeared at breakfast sir richmond saw at once that she too had had a restless night when she came into the little long breakfast room of the inn with its brown screens and its neat white tables it seemed to him that the miss grammont of his nocturnal speculations the beautiful young lady who had to be protected and managed and loved unselfishly vanished like some exorcised intruder instead was this real dear young woman who had been completely forgotten during the reign of her simulacrum and who now returned completely remembered familiar friendly intimate she touched his hand for a moment she met his eyes with the shadow of a smile in her own  oranges said belinda from the table by the window beautiful oranges  she had been preparing them poor transatlantic exile after the fashion in which grape fruits are prepared upon liners and in the civilized world of the west hes getting us tea spoons said belinda as they sat down  this is realler england than ever she said ive been up an hour i found a little path down to the river bank its the greenest morning world and full of wild flowers look at these  thats ladys smock said sir richmond its not really a flower its a quotation from shakespeare  and there are cowslips  cuckoo buds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight all the english flowers come out of shakespeare i dont know what we did before his time  the waiter arrived with the tea spoons for the oranges  belinda having distributed these resumed her discourse of enthusiasm for england she asked a score of questions about gloucester and chepstow the severn and the romans and the welsh and did not wait for the answers she did not want answers she talked to keep things going her talk masked a certain constraint that came upon her companions after the first mornings greetings were over  sir richmond as he had planned upstairs produced two michelin maps today he said we will run back to bathfrom which it will be easy for you to train to falmouth we will go by monmouth and then turn back through the forest of dean where you will get glimpses of primitive coal mines still worked by two men and a boy with a windlass and a pail perhaps we will go through cirencester i dont know perhaps it is better to go straight to bath in the very heart of bath you will find yourselves in just the same world you visited at pompeii bath is pompeii overlaid by jane austens england  he paused for a moment we can wire to your agents from here before we start and we can pick up their reply at gloucester or nailsworth or even bath itself so that if your father is nearer than we supposebut i think tomorrow afternoon will be soon enough for falmouth anyhow  he stopped interrogatively  miss grammonts face was white that will do very well she said  section 4  they started but presently they came to high banks that showed such masses of bluebells ragged robin great stitchwort and the like that belinda was not to be restrained she clamoured to stop the car and go up the bank and pick her hands full and so they drew up by the roadside and sir richmond and miss grammont sat down near the car while belinda carried her enthusiastic onslaught on the flowers up the steep bank and presently out of earshot  the two lovers said unheeded things about the flowers to each other and then fell silent then miss grammont turned her head and seemed deliberately to measure her companions distance evidently she judged her out of earshot  well said miss grammont in her soft even voice we love one another is that so still  i could not love you more  it wasnt a dream  no  and tomorrow we part  he looked her in the eyes i have been thinking of that all night he said at last  i too  and you think  that we must part just as we arranged it when was it three days or three ages ago there is nothing else in the world to do except for us to go our ways i love you that means for a womanit means that i want to be with you but that is impossible dont doubt whether i love you because i sayimpossible  sir richmond faced with his own nocturnal decision was now moved to oppose it flatly nothing that one can do is impossible  she glanced again at belinda and bent down towards him suppose she said you got back into that car with me suppose that instead of going on as we have planned you took me away how much of us would go  you would go said sir richmond and my heart  and this work of yours and your honour for the honour of a man in this new age of yours will be first of all in the work he does for the world and you will leave your work to be just a lover and the work that i might do because of my fathers wealth all that would vanish too we should leave all of that all of our usefulness all that much of ourselves but what has made me love you just your breadth of vision just the sense that you mattered what has made you love me just that i have understood the dream of your work all that we should have to leave behind we should specialize in our own scandal we should run away just for one thing to think by sharing the oldest simplest dearest indulgences in the world that we had got each other when really we had lost each other lost all that mattered  her face was flushed with the earnestness of her conviction her eyes were bright with tears dont think i dont love you its so hard to say all this somehow it seems like going back on somethingsomething supreme our instincts have got us dont think id hold myself from you dear id give myself to you with both hands i love youwhen a woman lovesi at any rateshe loves altogether but this thingi am convincedcannot be i must go my own way the way i have to go my father is the man obstinate more than half a savage for mei know ithe has the jealousy of ten husbands if you take meif our secret becomes manifestif you are to take me and keep me then his life and your life will become wholly this feud nothing but this feud you have to fight him anyhowthat is why i of all people must keep out of the quarrel for him it would be an immense excitement full of the possibility of fierce satisfactions for you whether you won me or lost me it would be utter waste and ruin  she paused and then went onand for me too waste and ruin i shall be a woman fought over i shall be fought over as dogs fight over a bone i shall sink back to the level of helen of troy i shall cease to be a free citizen a responsible free person whether you win me or lose me it will be waste and ruin for us both your fuel commission will go to pieces all the wide enduring work you have set me dreaming about will go the same way we shall just be another romantic story no  sir richmond sat still a little like a sullen child she thought i hate all this he said slowly i didnt think of your father before and now i think of him it sets me bristling for a fight it makes all this harder to give up and yet do you know in the night i was thinking i was coming to conclusions very like yours for quite other reasons i thought we ought not towe have to keep friends anyhow and hear of each other  that goes without saying  i thought we ought not to go on to be lovers in any way that would affect you touch you too closely i was sorryi had kissed you  not i no dont be sorry for that i am glad we have fallen in love more glad than i have been of anything else in my life and glad we have spoken plainly though we have to part and  her whisper came close to him for a whole day yet all round the clock twice you and i have one another  miss seyffert began speaking as soon as she was well within earshot  i dont know the name of a single one of these flowers she cried except the bluebells look at this great handful ive gotten springtime in italy doesnt compare with it not for a moment  section 5  because belinda seyffert was in the dicky behind them with her alert interest in their emotions all too thinly and obviously veiled it seemed more convenient to sir richmond and miss grammont to talk not of themselves but of man and woman and of that new age according to the prophet martineau which sir richmond had partly described and mainly invented and ascribed to his departed friend they talked anthropologically philosophically speculatively with an absurd pretence of detachment they sat side by side in the little car scarcely glancing at one another but side by side and touching each other and all the while they were filled with tenderness and love and hunger for one another  in the course of a day or so they had touched on nearly every phase in the growth of man and woman from that remote and brutish past which has left its traces in human bones mingled with the bones of hyaenas and cave bears beneath the stalagmites of wookey hole near wells in those nearly forgotten days the mind of man and woman had been no more than an evanescent succession of monstrous and infantile imaginations that brief journey in the west country had lit up phase after phase in the long teaching and discipline of man as he had developed depth of memory and fixity of purpose out of these raw beginnings through the dreaming childhood of avebury and stonehenge and the crude boyhood of ancient wars and massacres sir richmond recalled those phases now and how as they had followed one another mans idea of woman and womans idea of man had changed with them until nowadays in the minds of civilized men brute desire and possession and a limitless jealousy had become almost completely overlaid by the desire for fellowship and a free mutual loyalty overlaid he said the older passions are still there like the fires in an engine he invented a saying for dr martineau that the man in us today was still the old man of palaeolithic times with his will his wrath against the universe increased rather than diminished if today he ceases to crack his brothers bones and rape and bully his womenkind it is because he has grown up to a greater game and means to crack this world and feed upon its marrow and wrench their secrets from the stars  and furthermore it would seem that the prophet martineau had declared that in this new age that was presently to dawn for mankind jealousy was to be disciplined even as we had disciplined lust and anger instead of ruling our law it was to be ruled by law and custom no longer were the jealousy of strange peoples the jealousy of ownership and the jealousy of sex to determine the framework of human life there was to be one peace and law throughout the world one economic scheme and a universal freedom for men and women to possess and give themselves  and how many generations yet must there be before we reach that utopia miss grammont asked  i wouldnt put it at a very great distance  but think of all the confusions of the world  confusions merely the world is just a muddle of states and religions and theories and stupidities there are great lumps of disorderly strength in it but as a whole it is a weak world it goes on by habit theres no great idea in possession and the only possible great idea is this one the new age may be nearer than we dare to suppose  if i could believe that  there are many more people think as we do than you suppose are you and i such very strange and wonderful and exceptional people  no i dont think so  and yet the new world is already completely established in our hearts what has been done in our minds can be done in most minds in a little while the muddled angry mind of man upon his planet will grow clear and it will be this idea that will have made it clear and then life will be very different for everyone that tyranny of disorder which oppresses every life on earth now will be lifted there will be less and less insecurity less and less irrational injustice it will be a better instructed and a better behaved world we shall live at our ease not perpetually anxious not resentful and angry and that will alter all the rules of love then we shall think more of the loveliness of other people because it will no longer be necessary to think so much of the dangers and weaknesses and pitifulliesses of other people we shall not have to think of those who depend upon us for happiness and selfrespect we shall not have to choose between a wasteful fight for a personal end or the surrender of our hearts desire  hearts desire she whispered am i indeed your hearts desire  sir richmond sank his head and voice in response  you are the best of all things and i have to let you go  sir richmond suddenly remembered miss seyffert and half turned his face towards her her forehead was just visible over the hood of the open coupe she appeared to be intelligently intent upon the scenery then he broke out suddenly into a tirade against the world but i am bored by this jostling unreasonable world at the bottom of my heart i am bitterly resentful today this is a world of fools and brutes in which we live a world of idiotic traditions imbecile limitations cowardice habit greed and mean cruelty it is a slum of a world a congested district an insanitary jumble of souls and bodies every good thing every sweet desire is thwartedevery one i have to lead the life of a slum missionary a sanitary inspector an underpaid teacher i am bored oh god how i am bored i am bored by our laws and customs i am bored by our rotten empire and its empty monarchy i am bored by its parades and its flags and its sham enthusiasms i am bored by london and its life by its smart life and by its servile life alike i am bored by theatres and by books and by every sort of thing that people call pleasure i am bored by the brag of people and the claims of people and the feelings of people damn people i am bored by profiteers and by the snatching they call business enterprise damn every business man i am bored by politics and the universal mismanagement of everything i am bored by france by anglosaxondom by german selfpity by bolshevik fanaticism i am bored by these fools squabbles that devastate the world i am bored by ireland orange and green curse the irishnorth and south together lord how i hate the irish from carson to the last sinn feiner and i am bored by india and by egypt i am bored by poland and by islam i am bored by anyone who professes to have rights damn their rights curse their rights i am bored to death by this year and by last year and by the prospect of next year i am boredi am horribly boredby my work i am bored by every sort of renunciation i want to live with the woman i love and i want to work within the limits of my capacity curse all hullo damn his eyessteady ah the spark good no skid  he had come round a corner at five and twenty miles an hour and had stopped his spark and pulled up neatly within a yard of the forewheel of a waggon that was turning in the road so as to block the way completely  that almost had me  and now you feel better said miss grammont  ever so much said sir richmond and chuckled  the waggoner cleared the road and the car started up again  for a minute or so neither spoke  you ought to be smacked hard for that outbreakmy dear said miss grammont  i oughtmy dear i have no right to be illtempered we two are among the supremely fortunate ones of our time we have no excuse for misbehaviour got nothing to grumble at always i am lucky thatwith the waggonwas a very near thing god spoils us  we two he went on after a pause are among the most fortunate people alive we are both rich and easily rich that gives us freedoms few people have we have a vision of the whole world in which we live its in a messbut that is by the way the mass of mankind never gets enough education to have even a glimpse of the world as a whole they never get a chance to get the hang of it it is really possible for us to do things that will matter in the world all our time is our own all our abilities we are free to use most people most intelligent and educated people are caught in cages of pecuniary necessity they are tied to tasks they cant leave they are driven and compelled and limited by circumstances they can never master but we if we have tasks have tasks of our own choosing we may not like the world but anyhow we are free to do our best to alter it if i were a clerk in hoxton and you were a city typist then we might swear  it was you who swore smiled miss grammont  its the thought of that clerk in hoxton and that city typist who really keep me at my work any smacking ought to come from them i couldnt do less than i do in the face of their helplessness nevertheless a day will comethrough what we do and what we refrain from doing when there will be no bound and limited clerks in hoxton and no captive typists in the city and nobody at all to consider  according to the prophet martineau said miss grammont  and then you and i must contrive to be born again  heighho cried miss grammont a thousand years ahead when fathers are civilized when all these phanton people who intervene on your sideno i dont want to know anything about them but i know of them by instinctwhen they also dont matter  then you and i can have things out with each otherthoroughly said sir richmond with a surprising ferocity in his voice charging the little hill before him as though he charged at time  section 6  they had to wait at nailsworth for a telegram from mr grammonts agents they lunched there and drove on to bath in the afternoon they came into the town through unattractive and unworthy outskirts and only realized the charm of the place after they had garaged their car at the pulteney hotel and walked back over the pulteney bridge to see the avon with the pump room and the roman baths the pulteney they found hung with pictures and adorned with sculpture to an astonishing extent some former proprietor must have had a mania for replicas and the place is eventful with white marble fauns and sylphs and lions and caesars and queen victorias and packed like an exhibition with memories of rome florence milan paris the national gallery and the royal academy amidst which splendours a competent staff administers modern comforts with an oldfashioned civility but round and about the pulteney one has still the scenery of georgian england the white faintly classical terraces and houses of the days of fielding smollett fanny burney and jane austen the graceful bridge with the bright little shops full of presents from bath the pump room with its water drinkers and a fine array of the original bath chairs  down below the pump room our travellers explored the memories of the days when the world was latin from york to the tigris and the corinthian capital flourished like a weed from bath to baalbek and they considered a little doubtfully the seventeenth century statue of bladud who is said to have been healed by the bath waters and to have founded the city in the days when stonehenge still flourished eight hundred years before the romans came  in the afternoon miss seyffert came with sir richmond and miss grammont and was very enthusiastic about everything but in the evening after dinner it was clear that her role was to remain in the hotel sir richmond and miss grammont went out into the moonlit gloaming they crossed the bridge again and followed the road beside the river towards the old abbey church that lantern of the west away in some sunken gardens ahead of them a band was playing and a cluster of little lights about the bandstand showed a crowd of people down below dancing on the grass these little lights these bobbing black heads and the lilting music this little inflamed centre of throbbing sounds and ruddy illumination made the dome of the moonlit world about it seem very vast and cool and silent our visitors began to realize that bath could be very beautiful they went to the parapet above the river and stood there leaning over it elbow to elbow and smoking cigarettes miss grammont was moved to declare the pulteney bridge with its noble arch its effect of height over the swirling river and the cluster of houses above more beautiful than the ponte vecchio at florence down below was a man in waders with a fishingrod going to and fro along the foaming weir and a couple of boys paddled a boat against the rush of the water lower down the stream  dear england said miss grammont surveying this gracious spectacle how full it is of homely and lovely and kindly things  it is the home we come from  you belong to it still  no more than you do i belong to a big overworking modern place called london which stretches its tentacles all over the world i am as much a homecoming tourist as you are most of this western country i am seeing for the first time  she said nothing for a space ive not a word to say tonight she said im just full of a sort of animal satisfaction in being close to you and in being with you among lovely things somewherebefore we part tonight  yes he said to her pause and his face came very near to hers  i want you to kiss me  yes he said awkwardly glancing over his shoulder acutely aware of the promenaders passing close to them  its a promise  yes  very timidly and guiltily his hand sought hers beside it and gripped it and pressed it my dear he whispered tritest and most unavoidable of expressions it was not very like man and woman loving upon their planet it was much more like the shy endearments of the shop boys and work girls who made the darkling populous about them with their silent interchanges  there are a thousand things i want to talk about to you she said after we have parted tomorrow i shall begin to think of them but nowevery rational thing seems dissolved in this moonlight  presently she made an effort to restore the intellectual dignity of their relationship  i suppose i ought to be more concerned tonight about the work i have to do in the world and anxious for you to tell me this and that but indeed i am not concerned at all about it i seem to have it in outline all perfectly clear i mean to play a mans part in the world just as my father wants me to do i mean to win his confidence and work with himlike a partner then some day i shall be a power in the world of fuel and at the same time i must watch and read and think and learn how to be the servant of the world we two have to live like trusted servants who have been made guardians of a helpless minor we have to put things in order and keep them in order against the time when manman whom we call in america the common mancan take hold of his world  and release his servants said sir richmond  all that is perfectly clear in my mind that is what i am going to live for that is what i have to do  she stopped abruptly all that is about as interesting tonightin comparison with the touch of your dear fingersas next months railway timetable  but later she found a topic that could hold their attention for a time  we have never said a word about religion she said  sir richmond paused for a moment i am a godless man he said the stars and space and time overwhelm my imagination i cannot imagine anything above or beyond them  she thought that over but there are divine things she said  you are divine im not talking lovers nonsense he hastened to add i mean that there is something about human beingsnot just the everyday stuff of them but something that appears intermittentlyas though a light shone through something translucent if i believe in any divinity at all it is a divinity revealed to me by other peopleand even by myself in my own heart  im never surprised at the badness of human beings said sir richmond seeing how they have come about and what they are but i have been surprised time after time by fine things often in people i disliked or thought little of i can understand that i find you full of divine quality because i am in love with you and all alive to you necessarily i keep on discovering loveliness in you but i have seen divine things in dear old martineau for example a vain man fussy timidand yet filled with a passion for truth ready to make great sacrifices and to toil tremendously for that and in those men i am always cursing my committee it is astonishing at times to discover what streaks of goodness even the really bad men can show but one cant make use of just anyones divinity i can see the divinity in martineau but it leaves me cold he tired me and bored me but i live on you its only through love that the god can reach over from one human being to another all real love is a divine thing a reassurance a release of courage it is wonderful enough that we should take food and drink and turn them into imagination invention and creative energy it is still more wonderful that we should take an animal urging and turn it into a light to discover beauty and an impulse towards the utmost achievements of which we are capable all love is a sacrament and all lovers are priests to each other you and i  sir richmond broke off abruptly i spent three days trying to tell this to dr martineau but he wasnt the priest i had to confess to and the words wouldnt come i can confess it to you readily enough  i cannot tell said miss grammont whether this is the last wisdom in life or moonshine i cannot tell whether i am thinking or feeling but the noise of the water going over the weir below is like the stir in my heart and i am swimming in love and happiness am i awake or am i dreaming you and are we dreaming one another hold my handhold it hard and tight im trembling with love for you and all the world if i say more i shall be weeping  for a long time they stood side by side saying not a word to one another  presently the band down below and the dancing ceased and the little lights were extinguished the silent moon seemed to grow brighter and larger and the whisper of the waters louder a crowd of young people flowed out of the gardens and passed by on their way home sir richmond and miss grammont strolled through the dispersing crowd and over the toll bridge and went exploring down a little staircase that went down from the end of the bridge to the dark river and then came back to their old position at the parapet looking upon the weir and the pulteney bridge the gardens that had been so gay were already dark and silent as they returned and the streets echoed emptily to the few people who were still abroad  its the most beautiful bridge in the world said miss grammont and gave him her hand again  some deeptoned clock close by proclaimed the hour eleven  the silence healed again  well said sir richmond  well said miss grammont smiling very faintly  i suppose we must go out of all this beauty now back to the lights of the hotel and the watchful eyes of your dragon  she has not been a very exacting dragon so far has she  she is a miracle of tact  she does not really watch but she is curiousand very sympathetic  she is wonderful  that man is still fishing said miss grammont  for a time she peered down at the dark figure wading in the foam below as though it was the only thing of interest in the world then she turned to sir richmond  i would trust belinda with my life she said and anyhownowwe need not worry about belinda  section 7  at the breakfast table it was belinda who was the most nervous of the three the most moved the most disposed to throw a sacramental air over their last meal together her companions had passed beyond the idea of separation it was as if they now cherished a secret satisfaction at the high dignity of their parting belinda in some way perceived they had become different they were no longer tremulous lovers they seemed sure of one another and with a new pride in their bearing it would have pleased belinda better seeing how soon they were to be torn apart if they had not made quite such excellent breakfasts she even suspected them of having slept well yet yesterday they had been deeply stirred they had stayed out late last night so late that she had not heard them come in perhaps then they had passed the climax of their emotions sir richmond she learnt was to take the party to exeter where there would be a train for falmouth a little after two if they started from bath about nine that would give them an ample margin of time in which to deal with a puncture or any such misadventure  they crested the mendips above shepton mallet ran through tilchester and ilminster into the lovely hill country about upottery and so to honiton and the broad level road to exeter sir richmond and miss grammont were in a state of happy gravity they sat contentedly side by side talking very little they had already made their arrangements for writing to one another there was to be no stream of loveletters or protestations that might prove a mutual torment their love was to be implicit they were to write at intervals about political matters and their common interests and to keep each other informed of their movements about the world  we shall be working together she said speaking suddenly out of a train of thought she had been following we shall be closer together than many a couple who have never spent a day apart for twenty years  then presently she said in the new age all lovers will have to be accustomed to meeting and parting we women will not be tied very much by domestic needs unless we see fit to have children we shall be going about our business like men we shall have worldwide businessesmany of usjust as men will  it will be a world full of lovers meetings  some daysomewherewe two will certainly meet again  even you have to force circumstances a little said sir richmond  we shall meet she said without doing that  but where he asked unanswered  meetings and partings she said women will be used to seeing their lovers go away even to seeing them go away to other women who have borne them children and who have a closer claim on them  no one began sir richmond startled  but i dont mind very much its how things are if i were a perfectly civilized woman i shouldnt mind at all if men and women are not to be tied to each other there must needs be such things as this  but you said sir richmond i at any rate am not like that i cannot bear the thought that you  you need not bear it my dear i was just trying to imagine this world that is to be women i think are different from men in their jealousy men are jealous of the other man women are jealous for their manand careless about the other woman what i love in you i am sure about my mind was empty when it came to you and now it is full to overflowing i shall feel you moving about in the same world with me im not likely to think of anyone else for a very long time later on who knows i may marry i make no vows but i think until i know certainly that you do not want me any more it will be impossible for me to marry or to have a lover i dont know but that is how i believe it will be with me and my mind feels beautifully clear now and settled ive got your idea and made it my own your idea that we matter scarcely at all but that the work we do matters supremely ill find my rope and tug it never fear half way round the world perhaps some day you will feel me tugging  i shall feel youre there he said whether you tug or not  three miles left to exeter he reported presently  she glanced back at belinda  it is good that we have loved my dear she whispered say it is good  the best thing in all my life he said and lowered his head and voice to say my dearest dear  hearts desirestill  hearts delight priestess of life divinity  she smiled and nodded and suddenly belinda up above their lowered heads accidentally and irrelevantly no doubt coughed  at exeter station there was not very much time to spare after all hardly had sir richmond secured a luncheon basket for the two travellers before the train came into the station he parted from miss grammont with a hand clasp belinda was flushed and distressed at the last but her friend was quiet and still au revoir said belinda without conviction when sir richmond shook her hand  section 8  sir richmond stood quite still on the platform as the train ran out of the station he did not move until it had disappeared round the bend then he turned lost in a brown study and walked very slowly towards the station exit  the most wonderful thing in my life he thought and alreadyit is unreal  she will go on to her father whom she knows ten thousand times more thoroughly than she knows me she will go on to paris she will pick up all the threads of her old story be reminded of endless things in her life but never except in the most casual way of these days they will be cut off from everything else that will serve to keep them real and as for methis connects with nothing else in my life at all it is as disconnected as a dream already it is hardly more substantial than a dream  we shall write letters do letters breathe faster or slower as you read them  we may meet  where are we likely to meet again i never realized before how improbable it is that we shall meet again and if we meet  never in all our lives shall we be really together again its overwith a completeness  like death  he came opposite the bookstalls and stopped short and stared with unseeing eyes at the display of popular literature he was wondering now whether after all he ought to have let her go he experienced something of the blank amazement of a child who has burst its toy balloon his golden globe of satisfaction in an instant had gone an irrational sense of loss was flooding every other feeling about vv if she had loved him truly and altogether could she have left him like this neither of them surely had intended so complete a separation he wanted to go back and recall that train  a few seconds more he realized and he would give way to anger whatever happened that must not happen he pulled himself together what was it he had to do now he had not to be angry he had not even to be sorry they had done the right thing outside the station his car was waiting  he went outside the station and stared at his car he had to go somewhere of course down into cornwall to martins cottage he had to go down to her and be kind and comforting about that carbuncle to be kind if this thwarted feeling broke out into anger he might be tempted to take it out of martin that at any rate he must not do he had always for some inexplicable cause treated martin badly nagged her and blamed her and threatened her that must stop now no shadow of this affair must lie on martin and martin must never have a suspicion of any of this  the image of martin became very vivid in his mind he thought of her as he had seen her many times with the tears close fighting with her back to the wall with all her wit and vigour gone because she loved him more steadfastly than he did her whatever happened he must not take it out of martin it was astonishing how real she had become nowas vv became a dream yes martin was astonishingly real and if only he could go now and talk to martinand face all the facts of life with her even as he had done with that phantom martin in his dream  but things were not like that  he looked to see if his car was short of water or petrol both needed replenishing and so he would have to go up the hill into exeter town again he got into his car and sat with his fingers on the electric starter  martin old friend eight days were still left before the committee met again eight days for golden kindness he would distress martin by no clumsy confession he would just make her happy as she loved to be made happy nevertheless nevertheless  was it martin who failed him or he who failed martin  incessant and insoluble dispute well the thing now was to go to martin and then the work  he laughed suddenly  ill take it out of the damned commission ill make old rumford brown sit up  he was astonished to find himself thinking of the affairs of the commission with a lively interest and no trace of fatigue he had had his change he had taken his rest he was equal to his task again already he started his engine and steered his way past a van and a waiting cab  fuel he said     chapter the ninth  the last days of sir richmond hardy  section 1  the majority and minority reports of the fuel commission were received on their first publication with much heat and disputation but there is already a fairly general agreement that they are great and significant documents broadly conceived and historically important they do lift the questions of fuel supply and distribution high above the level of parochial jealousies and above the petty and destructive profiteering of private owners and traders to a view of a general human welfare they form an important link in a series of private and public documents that are slowly opening out a prospect of new economic methods methods conceived in the generous spirit of scientific work that may yet arrest the drift of our western civilization towards financial and commercial squalor and the social collapse that must ensue inevitably on that in view of the composition of the committee the majority report is in itself an amazing triumph of sir richmonds views it is astonishing that he was able to drive his opponents so far and then leave them there securely advanced while he carried on the adherents he had altogether won including of course the labour representatives to the further altitudes of the minority report  after the summer recess the majority report was discussed and adopted sir richmond had shown signs of flagging energy in june but he had come back in september in a state of exceptional vigour for a time he completely dominated the committee by the passionate force of his convictions and the illuminating scorn he brought to bear on the various subterfuges and weakening amendments by which the meaner interests sought to save themselves in whole or in part from the common duty of sacrifice but toward the end he fell ill he had worked to the pitch of exhaustion he neglected a cold that settled on his chest he began to cough persistently and betray an increasingly irritable temper in the last fights in the committee his face was bright with fever and he spoke in a voiceless whisper often a vast angry whisper his place at table was marked with scattered lozenges and scraps of paper torn to the minutest shreds such good manners as had hitherto mitigated his behaviour on the committee departed from him he carried his last points gesticulating and coughing and wheezing rather than speaking but he had so hammered his ideas into the committee that they took the effect of what he was trying to say  he died of pneumonia at his own house three days after the passing of the majority report the minority report his own especial creation he never signed it was completed by wast and carmichael  after their parting at salisbury station dr martineau heard very little of sir richmond for a time except through the newspapers which contained frequent allusions to the committee someone told him that sir richmond had been staying at ruan in cornwall where martin leeds had a cottage and someone else had met him at bath on his way he said in his car from cornwall to a conference with sir peter davies in glamorganshire  but in the interim dr martineau had the pleasure of meeting lady hardy at a luncheon party he was seated next to her and he found her a very pleasing and sympathetic person indeed she talked to him freely and simply of her husband and of the journey the two men had taken together either she knew nothing of the circumstances of their parting or if she did she did not betray her knowledge that holiday did him a world of good she said he came back to his work like a giant i feel very grateful to you  dr martineau said it was a pleasure to have helped sir richmonds work in any way he believed in him thoroughly sir richmond was inspired by great modern creative ideas  forgive me if i keep you talking about him said lady hardy i wish i could feel as sure that i had been of use to him  dr martineau insisted i know very well that you are  i do what i can to help him carry his enormous burthen of toil she said i try to smooth his path but he is a strange silent creature at times  her eyes scrutinized the doctors face  it was not the doctors business to supplement sir richmonds silences yet he wished to meet the requirements of this lady if he could he is one of those men he said who are driven by forces they do not fully understand a man of genius  yes she said in an undertone of intimacy genius a great irresponsible genius difficult to help i wish i could do more for him  a very sweet and charming lady it was with great regret that the doctor found the time had come to turn to his lefthand neighbour  section 2  it was with some surprise that dr martineau received a fresh appeal for aid from sir richmond it was late in october and sir richmond was already seriously ill but he was still going about his business as though he was perfectly well he had not mistaken his man dr martineau received him as though there had never been a shadow of offence between them  he came straight to the point martineau he said i must have those drugs i asked you for when first i came to you now i must be bolstered up i cant last out unless i am im at the end of my energy i come to you because you will understand the commission cant go on now for more than another three weeks whatever happens afterwards i must keep going until then  the doctor did understand he made no vain objections he did what he could to patch up his friend for his last struggles with the opposition in the committee pro forma he said stethoscope in hand i must order you to bed you wont go but i order you you must know that what you are doing is risking your life your lungs are congested the bronchial tubes already that may spread at any time if this open weather lasts you may go about and still pull through but at any time this may pass into pneumonia and theres not much in you just now to stand up against pneumonia  ill take all reasonable care  is your wife at home  she is in wales with her people but the household is well trained i can manage  go in a closed car from door to door wrap up like a mummy i wish the committee room wasnt down those abominable house of commons corridors  they parted with an affectionate handshake  section 3  death approved of sir richmonds determination to see the committee through our universal creditor gave this particular debtor grace to the very last meeting then he brushed a gust of chilly rain across the face of sir richmond as he stood waiting for his car outside the strangers entrance to the house for a couple of days sir richmond felt almost intolerably tired but scarcely noted the changed timbre of the wheezy notes in his throat he rose later each day and with ebbing vigour jotted down notes and corrections upon the proofs of the minority report he found it increasingly difficult to make decisions he would correct and alter back and then repeat the correction perhaps half a dozen times on the evening of the second day his lungs became painful and his breathing difficult his head ached and a sense of some great impending evil came upon him his skin was suddenly a detestable garment to wear he took his temperature with a little clinical thermometer he kept by him and found it was a hundred and one he telephoned hastily for dr martineau and without waiting for his arrival took a hot bath and got into bed he was already thoroughly ill when the doctor arrived  forgive my sending for you he said not your line i know my wifes gpan exasperating sort of ass cant stand him no one else  he was lying on a narrow little bed with a hard pillow that the doctor replaced by one from lady hardys room he had twisted the bedclothes into a hopeless muddle the sheet was on the floor  sir richmonds bedroom was a large apartment in which sleep seemed to have been an admitted necessity rather than a principal purpose on one hand it opened into a businesslike dressing and bath room on the other into the day study it bore witness to the nocturnal habits of a man who had long lived a life of irregular impulses to activity and dislocated hours and habits there was a desk and reading lamp for night work near the fireplace an electric kettle for making tea at night a silver biscuit tin all the apparatus for the lonely intent industry of the small hours there was a bookcase of bluebooks books of reference and suchlike material and some files over the mantelpiece was an enlarged photograph of lady hardy and a plain office calendar the desk was littered with the galley proofs of the minority report upon which sir richmond had been working up to the moment of his hasty retreat to bed and lying among the proofs as though it had been taken out and looked at quite recently was the photograph of a girl for a moment dr martineaus mind hung in doubt and then he knew it for the young american of stonehenge how that affair had ended he did not know and now it was not his business to know  these various observations printed themselves on dr martineaus mind after his first cursory examination of his patient and while he cast about for anything that would give this large industrious apartment a little more of the restfulness and comfort of a sick room i must get in a night nurse at once he said we must find a small table somewhere to put near the bed  i am afraid you are very ill he said returning to the bedside this is not as you say my sort of work will you let me call in another man a man we can trust thoroughly to consult  im in your hands said sir richmond i want to pull through  he will know better where to get the right sort of nurse for the caseand everything  the second doctor presently came with the right sort of nurse hard on his heels sir richmond submitted almost silently to his expert handling and was sounded and looked to and listened at  hm said the second doctor and then encouragingly to sir richmond weve got to take care of you  theres a lot about this i dont like said the second doctor and drew dr martineau by the arm towards the study for a moment or so sir richmond listened to the low murmur of their voices but he did not feel very deeply interested in what they were saying he began to think what a decent chap dr martineau was how helpful and fine and forgiving his professional training had made him how completely he had ignored the smothered incivilities of their parting at salisbury all men ought to have some such training not a bad idea to put every boy and girl through a year or so of hospital service sir richmond must have dozed for his next perception was of dr martineau standing over him and saying i am afraid my dear hardy that you are very ill indeed much more so than i thought you were at first  sir richmonds raised eyebrows conveyed that he accepted this fact  i think lady hardy ought to be sent for  sir richmond shook his head with unexpected vigour  dont want her about he said and after a pause dont want anybody about  but if anything happens  send then  an expression of obstinate calm overspread sir richmonds face he seemed to regard the matter as settled he closed his eyes  for a time dr martineau desisted he went to the window and turned to look again at the impassive figure on the bed did sir richmond fully understand he made a step towards his patient and hesitated then he brought a chair and sat down at the bedside  sir richmond opened his eyes and regarded him with a slight frown  a case of pneumonia said the doctor after great exertion and fatigue may take very rapid and unexpected turns  sir richmond cheek on pillow seemed to assent  i think if you want to be sure that lady hardy sees you again if you dont want to take risks about that one never knows in these cases probably there is a night train  sir richmond manifested no surprise at the warning but he stuck to his point his voice was faint but firm couldnt make up anything to say to her anything shed like  dr martineau rested on that for a little while then he said if there is anyone else  not possible said sir richmond with his eyes on the ceiling  but to see  sir richmond turned his head to dr martineau his face puckered like a peevish childs theyd want things said to themthings to rememberi cant im tired out  dont trouble whispered dr martineau suddenly remorseful  but sir richmond was also remorseful give them my love he said best loveold martin love  dr martineau was turning away when sir richmond spoke again in a whisper best lovepoor at the best he dozed for a time then he made a great effort i cant see them martineau until ive something to say its like that perhaps i shall think of some kind things to sayafter a sleep but if they came nowid say something wrong be cross perhaps hurt someone ive hurt so many people exaggeratepeople exaggerateimportance these occasions  yes yes whispered dr martineau i quite understand  section 4  for a time sir richmond dozed then he stirred and muttered second rate poor at the best love work all  it had been splendid work said dr martineau and was not sure that sir richmond heard  those last few days lost my grip always lose my damned grip  ragged them put their backs upsilly  never never done anythingwell  its done done well or ill  done  his voice sank to the faintest whisper done for ever and ever and ever and ever  again he seemed to doze  dr martineau stood up softly something beyond reason told him that this was certainly a dying man he was reluctant to go and he had an absurd desire that someone someone for whom sir richmond cared should come and say goodbye to him and for sir richmond to say goodbye to someone he hated this lonely launching from the shores of life of one who had sought intimacy so persistently and vainly it was extraordinaryhe saw it now for the first timehe loved this man if it had been in his power he would at that moment have anointed him with kindness  the doctor found himself standing in front of the untidy writing desk littered like a recent battlefield the photograph of the american girl drew his eyes what had happened was there not perhaps some word for her he turned about as if to enquire of the dying man and found sir richmonds eyes open and regarding him in them he saw an expression he had seen there once or twice before a faint but excessively irritating gleam of amusement  ohwell said dr martineau and turned away he went to the window and stared out as his habit was  sir richmond continued to smile dimly at the doctors back until his eyes closed again  it was their last exchange sir richmond died that night in the small hours so quietly that for some time the night nurse did not observe what had happened she was indeed roused to that realization by the ringing of the telephone bell in the adjacent study  section 5  for a long time that night dr martineau had lain awake unable to sleep he was haunted by the figure of sir richmond lying on his uncomfortable little bed in his big bedroom and by the curious effect of loneliness produced by the nocturnal desk and by the evident dread felt by sir richmond of any deathbed partings he realized how much this man who had once sought so feverishly for intimacies had shrunken back upon himself how solitary his motives had become how rarely he had taken counsel with anyone in his later years his mind now dwelt apart even if people came about him he would still be facing death alone  and so it seemed he meant to slip out of life as a man might slip out of a crowded assembly unobserved even now he might be going the doctor recalled how he and sir richmond had talked of the rage of life in a young baby how we drove into life in a sort of fury how that rage impelled us to do this and that how we fought and struggled until the rage spent itself and was gone that eddy of rage that was sir richmond was now perhaps very near its end presently it would fade and cease and the stream that had made it and borne it would know it no more  dr martineaus thoughts relaxed and passed into the picture land of dreams he saw the figure of sir richmond going as it were away from him along a narrow path a path that followed the crest of a ridge between great darknesses enormous cloudy darknesses above him and below he was going along this path without looking back without a thought for those he left behind without a single word to cheer him on his way walking as dr martineau had sometimes watched him walking without haste or avidity walking as a man might along some great picture gallery with which he was perhaps even over familiar his hands would be in his pockets his indifferent eyes upon the clouds about him and as he strolled along that path the darkness closed in upon him his figure became dim and dimmer  whither did that figure go did that enveloping darkness hide the beginnings of some strange long journey or would it just dissolve that figure into itself  was that indeed the end  dr martineau was one of that large class of people who can neither imagine nor disbelieve in immortality dimmer and dimmer grew the figure but still it remained visible as one can continue to see a star at dawn until one turns away or one blinks or nods and it is gone  vanished now are the beliefs that held our race for countless generations where now was that path of the dead mapped so clearly faced with such certainty in which the heliolithic peoples believed from avebury to polynesia not always have we had to go alone and unprepared into uncharted darknesses for a time the dream artist used a palette of the doctors vague memories of things egyptian he painted a new roll of the book of the dead at a copy of which the doctor had been looking a day or so before sir richmond became a brown naked figure crossing a bridge of danger passing between terrific monsters ferrying a dark and dreadful stream he came to the scales of judgment before the very throne of osiris and stood waiting while dogheaded anubis weighed his conscience and that evil monster the devourer of the dead crouched ready if the judgment went against him the doctors attention concentrated upon the scales a memory of swedengorgs heaven and hell mingled with the egyptian fantasy now at last it was possible to know something real about this mans soul now at last one could look into the secret places of his heart anubis and thoth the god with the ibis head were reading the heart as if it were a book reading aloud from it to the supreme judge  suddenly the doctor found himself in his own dreams his anxiety to plead for his friend had brought him in he too had become a little painted figure and he was bearing a book in his hand he wanted to show that the laws of the new world could not be the same as those of the old and the book he was bringing as evidence was his own psychology of a new age  the clear thought of that book broke up his dream by releasing a train of waking troubles you have been six months on chapter ten will it ever be ready for osiris will it ever be ready for print  dream and waking thoughts were mingled like sky and cloud upon a windy day in april suddenly he saw again that lonely figure on the narrow way with darknesses above and darknesses below and darknesses on every hand but this time it was not sir richmond who was it surely it was everyman everyman had to travel at last along that selfsame road leaving love leaving every task and every desire but was it everyman a great fear and horror came upon the doctor that little figure was himself and the book which was his particular task in life was still undone he himself stood in his turn upon that lonely path with the engulfing darknesses about him  he seemed to wrench himself awake  he lay very still for some moments and then he sat up in bed an overwhelming conviction had arisenin his mind that sir richmond was dead he felt he must know for certain he switched on his electric light mutely interrogated his round face reflected in the looking glass got out of bed shuffled on his slippers and went along the passage to the telephone he hesitated for some seconds and then lifted the receiver it was his call which aroused the nurse to the fact of sir richmonds death  section 6  lady hardy arrived home in response to dr martineaus telegram late on the following evening he was with her next morning comforting and sympathetic her big blue eyes bright with tears met his very wistfully her little body seemed very small and pathetic in its simple black dress and yet there was a sort of bravery about her when he came into the drawingroom she was in one of the window recesses talking to a seriouslooking woman of the dressmaker type she left her business at once to come to him why did i not know in time she cried  no one dear lady had any idea until late last night he said taking both her hands in his for a long friendly sympathetic pressure  i might have known that if it had been possible you would have told me she said  you know she added i dont believe it yet i dont realize it i go about these formalities  i think i can understand that  he was always you know not quite here it is as if he were a little more not quite here i cant believe it is over  she asked a number of questions and took the doctors advice upon various details of the arrangements my daughter helen comes home tomorrow afternoon she explained she is in paris but our son is far far away in the punjab i have sent him a telegram it is so kind of you to come in to me  dr martineau went more than half way to meet lady hardys disposition to treat him as a friend of the family he had conceived a curious half maternal affection for sir richmond that had survived even the trying incident of the salisbury parting and revived very rapidly during the last few weeks this affection extended itself now to lady hardy hers was a type that had always appealed to him he could understand so well the perplexed loyalty with which she was now setting herself to gather together some preservative and reassuring evidences of this man who had always been as she put it never quite here it was as if she felt that now it was at last possible to make a definite reality of him he could be fixed and as he was fixed he would stay never more would he be able to come in and with an almost expressionless glance wither the interpretation she had imposed upon him she was finding much comfort in this task of reconstruction she had gathered together in the drawingroom every presentable portrait she had been able to find of him he had never she said sat to a painter but there was an early pencil sketch done within a couple of years of their marriage there was a number of photographs several of whichshe wanted the doctors advice upon this pointshe thought might be enlarged there was a statuette done by some woman artist who had once beguiled him into a sitting there was also a painting she had had worked up from a photograph and some notes she flitted among these memorials going from one to the other undecided which to make the standard portrait that painting i think is most like she said as he was before the war but the war and the commission changed himworried him and aged him i grudged him to that commission he let it worry him frightfully  it meant very much to him said dr martineau  it meant too much to him but of course his ideas were splendid you know it is one of my hopes to get some sort of book done explaining his ideas he would never write he despised itunreasonably a real thing done he said was better than a thousand books nobody read books he said but women parsons and idle people but there must be books and i want one something a little more real than the ordinary official biography i have thought of young leighton the secretary of the commission he seems thoroughly intelligent and sympathetic and really anxious to reconcile richmonds views with those of the big business men on the committee he might do or perhaps i might be able to persuade two or three people to write down their impressions of him a sort of memorial volume but he was shy of friends there was no man he talked to very intimately about his ideas unless it was to you i wish i had the writers gift doctor  section 7  it was on the second afternoon that lady hardy summoned dr martineau by telephone something rather disagreeable she said if you could spare the time if you could come round  it is frightfully distressing she said when he got round to her and for a time she could tell him nothing more she was having tea and she gave him some she fussed about with cream and cakes and biscuits he noted a crumpled letter thrust under the edge of the silver tray  he talked i know very intimately with you she said coming to it at last he probably went into things with you that he never talked about with anyone else usually he was very reserved even with me there were things about which he said nothing  we did said dr martineau with discretion deal a little with his private life  there was someone  dr martineau nodded and then not to be too portentous took and bit a biscuit  did he by any chance ever mention someone called martin leeds  dr martineau seemed to reflect then realizing that this was a mistake he said he told me the essential facts  the poor lady breathed a sigh of relief im glad she said simply she repeated yes im glad it makes things easier now  dr martineau looked his enquiry  she wants to come and see him  here  here and helen here and the servants noticing everything ive never met her never set eyes on her for all i know she may want to make a scene there was infinite dismay in her voice  dr martineau was grave you would rather not receive her  i dont want to refuse her i dont want even to seem heartless i understand of course she has a sort of claim she sobbed her reluctant admission i know it i know there was much between them  dr martineau pressed the limp hand upon the little tea table i understand dear lady he said i understand now  suppose i were to write to her and arrangei do not see that you need be put to the pain of meeting her suppose i were to meet her here myself  if you could  the doctor was quite prepared to save the lady any further distresses no matter at what trouble to himself you are so good to me she said letting the tears have their way with her  i am silly to cry she said dabbing her eyes  we will get it over tomorrow he reassured her you need not think of it again  he took over martins brief note to lady hardy and set to work by telegram to arrange for her visit she was in london at her chelsea flat and easily accessible she was to come to the house at midday on the morrow and to ask not for lady hardy but for him he would stay by her while she was in the house and it would be quite easy for lady hardy to keep herself and her daughter out of the way they could for example go out quietly to the dressmakers in the closed car for many little things about the mourning still remained to be seen to  section 8  miss martin leeds arrived punctually but the doctor was well ahead of his time and ready to receive her she was ushered into the drawing room where he awaited her as she came forward the doctor first perceived that she had a very sad and handsome face the face of a sensitive youth rather than the face of a woman she had fine grey eyes under very fine brows they were eyes that at other times might have laughed very agreeably but which were now full of an unrestrained sadness her brown hair was very untidy and parted at the side like a mans then he noted that she seemed to be very untidily dressed as if she was that rare and to him very offensive thing a woman careless of her beauty she was short in proportion to her broad figure and her broad forehead  you are dr martineau she said he talked of you as she spoke her glance went from him to the pictures that stood about the room she walked up to the painting and stood in front of it with her distressed gaze wandering about her horrible she said absolutely horrible did she do this  her question disconcerted the doctor very much you mean lady hardy he asked she doesnt paint  no no i mean did she get all these things together  naturally said dr martineau  none of them are a bit like him they are like blows aimed at his memory not one has his life in it how could she do it look at that idiot statuette he was extraordinarily difficult to get i have burnt every photograph i had of him for fear that this would happen that he would go stiff and formaljust as you have got him here i have been trying to sketch him almost all the time since he died but i cant get him back hes gone  she turned to the doctor again she spoke to him not as if she expected him to understand her but because she had to say these things which burthened her mind to someone i have done hundreds of sketches my room is littered with them when you turn them over he seems to be lurking among them but not one of them is like him  she was trying to express something beyond her power it is as if someone had suddenly turned out the light  she followed the doctor upstairs this was his study the doctor explained  i know it i came here once she said  they entered the big bedroom in which the coffined body lay dr martineau struck by a sudden memory glanced nervously at the desk but someone had made it quite tidy and the portrait of aliss grammont had disappeared miss leeds walked straight across to the coffin and stood looking down on the waxen inexpressive dignity of the dead sir richmonds brows and nose had become sharper and more clearcut than they had ever been in life and his lips had set into a faint inane smile she stood quite still for a long time at length she sighed deeply  she spoke a little as though she thought aloud a little as though she talked at that silent presence in the coffin i think he loved she said sometimes i think he loved me but it is hard to tell he was kind he could be intensely kind and yet he didnt seem to care for you he could be intensely selfish and yet he certainly did not care for himself anyhow i loved him there is nothing left in me now to love anyone elsefor ever  she put her hands behind her back and looked at the dead man with her head a little on one side too kind she said very softly  there was a sort of dishonesty in his kindness he would not let you have the bitter truth he would not say he did not love you  he was too kind to life ever to call it the foolish thing it is he took it seriously because it takes itself seriously he worked for it and killed himself with work for it  she turned to dr martineau and her face was streaming with tears and life you know isnt to be taken seriously it is a jokea bad jokemade by some cruel little god who has caught a neglected planet like torturing a stray cat but he took it seriously and he gave up his life for it  there was much happiness he might have had he was very capable of happiness but he never seemed happy this work of his came before it he overworked and fretted our happiness away he sacrificed his happiness and mine  she held out her hands towards the doctor what am i to do now with the rest of my life who is there to laugh with me now and jest  i dont complain of him i dont blame him he did his bestto be kind  but all my days now i shall mourn for him and long for him  she turned back to the coffin suddenly she lost every vestige of selfcontrol she sank down on her knees beside the trestle why have you left me she cried  oh speak to me my darling speak to me i tell you speak to me  it was a storm of passion monstrously childish and dreadful she beat her hands upon the coffin she wept loudly and fiercely as a child does  dr martineau drifted feebly to the window  he wished he had locked the door the servants might hear and wonder what it was all about always he had feared love for the cruel thing it was but now it seemed to him for the first time that he realized its monstrous cruelty  the end
