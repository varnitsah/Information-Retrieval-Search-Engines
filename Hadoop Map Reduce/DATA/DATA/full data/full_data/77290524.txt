you—you had better let me take care of that      i hope they won’t meet ’er pore thing he ses      mrs ward and her daughter flung themselves hastily      i got out at last by playing a game on her     back to back     mrs scutts concealed behind the curtain gazed at the cab in uneasy amazement the cabman clambered down from the box and opening the door stood by with his hands extended ready for any help that might be needed a stranger was the first to alight and with his back towards mrs scutts seemed to be struggling with something in the cab he placed a dangling hand about his neck and staggering under the weight reeled backwards supporting mr scutts whose other arm was round the neck of a third man in a flash mrs scutts was at the door  mr scutts raised his head sharply and his lips parted then his head sank again and he became a dead weight in the grasp of his assistants  he’s all right said one of them turning to mrs scutts  a deep groan from mr scutts confirmed the statement  what is it inquired his wife anxiously  just a little bit of a railway accident said one of the strangers train ran into some empty trucks nobody hurt—seriously he added in response to a terrible and annoyed groan from mr scutts  with his feet dragging helplessly mr scutts was conveyed over his own doorstep and placed on the sofa  all the others went off home on their own legs said one of the strangers reproachfully he said he couldn’t walk and he wouldn’t go to a hospital  wanted to die at home declared the sufferer i ain’t going to be cut about at no ’ospitals  the two strangers stood by watching him then they looked at each other  i don’t want—no—’ospitals gasped mr scutts i’m going to have my own doctor  of course the company will pay the doctor’s bill said one of the strangers to mrs scutts or they’ll send their own doctor i expect he’ll be all right tomorrow  i ’ope so said mr scutts but i don’t think it thank you for bringing of me ’ome  he closed his eyes languidly and kept them closed until the men had departed  can’t you walk bill inquired the tearful mrs scutts  her husband shook his head you go and fetch the doctor he said slowly that new one round the corner  he looks such a boy objected mrs scutts  you go and fetch ’im said mr scutts raising his voice d’ye hear  but— began his wife  if i get up to you my gal said the forgetful mr scutts you’ll know it  why i thought— said his wife in surprise  mr scutts raised himself on the sofa and shook his fist at her then as a tribute to appearances he sank back and groaned again mrs scutts looking somewhat relieved took her bonnet from a nail and departed  the examination was long and tedious but mr scutts beyond remarking that he felt chilly made no complaint he endeavoured but in vain to perform the tests suggested and even did his best to stand supported by his medical attendant selfpreservation is the law of nature and when mr scutts’s legs and back gave way he saw to it that the doctor was underneath  we’ll have to get you up to bed said the latter rising slowly and dusting himself  mr scutts who was lying full length on the floor acquiesced and sent his wife for some neighbours one of them was a professional furnitureremover and halfway up the narrow stairs the unfortunate had to remind him that he was dealing with a british working man and not a piano four pairs of hands deposited mr scutts with mathematical precision in the centre of the bed and then proceeded to tuck him in while mrs scutts drew the sheet in a straight line under his chin  don’t look much the matter with ’im said one of the assistants  you can’t tell with a face like that said the furnitureremover it’s wot you might call a ’appy face why he was ’arf smiling as we carried ’im up the stairs  you’re a liar said mr scutts opening his eyes  all right mate said the furnitureremover all right there’s no call to get annoyed about it good old english pluck i call it where d’you feel the pain  all over said mr scutts briefly  his neighbours regarded him with sympathetic eyes and then led by the furnitureremover filed out of the room on tiptoe the doctor with a few parting instructions also took his departure  if you’re not better by the morning he said pausing at the door you must send for your club doctor  mr scutts in a feeble voice thanked him and lay with a twisted smile on his face listening to his wife’s vivid narrative to the little crowd which had collected at the front door she came back followed by the nextdoor neighbour mr james flynn whose offers of assistance ranged from carrying mr scutts out pickaback when he wanted to take the air to filling his pipe for him and fetching his beer  but i dare say you’ll be up and about in a couple o’ days he concluded you wouldn’t look so well if you’d got anything serious the matter rosy fat cheeks and——  that’ll do said the indignant invalid it’s my back that’s hurt not my face  i know said mr flynn nodding sagely but if it was hurt bad your face would be as white as that sheetwhiter  the doctor said as he was to be kep’ quiet remarked mrs scutts sharply  righto said mr flynn tata old pal keep your pecker up and if you want your back rubbed with turps or anything of that sort just knock on the wall  he went before mr scutts could think of a reply suitable for an invalid and at the same time bristling with virility a sinful and foolish desire to leap out of bed and help mr flynn downstairs made him more rubicund than ever  he sent for the club doctor next morning and pending his arrival partook of a basin of arrowroot and drank a little beeftea a bottle of castoroil and an empty pillbox on the table by the bedside added a little local colour to the scene  any pain inquired the doctor after an examination in which bony and very cold fingers had played a prominent part  not much pain said mr scutts don’t seem to have no strength in my back  ah said the doctor  i tried to get up this morning to go to my work said mr scutts but i can’t stand couldn’t get out of bed  fearfully upset he was pore dear testified mrs scutts he can’t bear losing a day i s’pose—i s’pose the railway company will ’ave to do something if it’s serious won’t they sir  nothing to do with me said the doctor i’ll put him on the club for a few days i expect he will be all right soon he’s got a healthy colour—a very healthy colour  mr scutts waited until he had left the house and then made a few remarks on the colour question that for impurity of english and strength of diction have probably never been surpassed  a second visitor that day came after dinner—a tall man in a frockcoat bearing in his hand a silk hat which after a careful survey of the room he hung on a knob of the bedpost  mr scutts he inquired bowing  that’s me said mr scutts in a feeble voice  i’ve called from the railway company said the stranger we have seen now all those who left their names and addresses on monday afternoon and i am glad to say that nobody was really hurt nobody  mr scutts in a faint voice said he was glad to hear it  been a wonder if they had said the other cheerfully why even the paint wasn’t knocked off the engine the most serious damage appears to be two tophats crushed and an umbrella broken  he leaned over the bedrail and laughed joyously mr scutts through halfclosed eyes gazed at him in silent reproach  i don’t say that one or two people didn’t receive a little bit of a shock to their nerves said the visitor thoughtfully one lady even stayed in bed next day however i made it all right with them the company is very generous and although of course there is no legal obligation they made several of them a present of a few pounds so that they could go away for a little change or anything of that sort to quiet their nerves  mr scutts who had been listening with closed eyes opened them languidly and said oh  i gave one gentleman twenty pounds said the visitor jingling some coins in his trouserpocket i never saw a man so pleased and grateful in my life when he signed the receipt for it—i always get them to sign a receipt so that the company can see that i haven’t kept the money for myself—he nearly wept with joy  i should think he would said mr scutts slowly—if he wasn’t hurt  you’re the last on my list said the other hastily he produced a slip of paper from his pocketbook and placed it on the small table with a fountain pen then with a smile that was both tender and playful he plunged his hand in his pocket and poured a stream of gold on the table  what do you say to thirty pounds he said in a hushed voice thirty golden goblins  what for inquired mr scutts with a notable lack of interest  for—well to go away for a day or two said the visitor i find you in bed it may be a cold or a bilious attack or perhaps you had a little upset of the nerves when the trains kissed each other  i’m in bed—because—i can’t walkor stand said mr scutts speaking very distinctly i’m on my club and if as ’ow i get well in a day or two there’s no reason why the company should give me any money i’m pore but i’m honest  take my advice as a friend said the other take the money while you can get it  he nodded significantly at mr scutts and closed one eye mr scutts closed both of his  i ’ad my back hurt in the collision he said after a long pause i ’ad to be helped ’ome so far it seems to get worse but i ’ope for the best  dear me said the visitor how sad i suppose it has been coming on for a long time most of these back cases do at least all the doctors say so  it was done in the collision said mr scutts mildly but firmly i was as right as rain before then  the visitor shook his head and smiled ah you would have great difficulty in proving that he said softly in fact speaking as man to man i don’t mind telling you it would be impossible i’m afraid i’m exceeding my duty but as you’re the last on my list suppose—suppose we say forty pounds forty a small fortune  he added some more gold to the pile on the table and gently tapped mr scutts’s arm with the end of the pen  good afternoon said the invalid  the visitor justly concerned at his lack of intelligence took a seat on the edge of the bed and spoke to him as a friend and a brother but in vain mr scutts reminded him at last that it was medicinetime after which pain and weakness permitting he was going to try to get a little sleep  forty pounds he said to his wife after the official had departed why didn’t ’e offer me a bag o’ sweets  it’s a lot o’ money said mrs scutts wistfully  so’s a thousand said her husband i ain’t going to ’ave my back broke for nothing i can tell you now you keep that mouth o’ yours shut and if i get it you shall ’ave a new pair o’ boots  a thousand exclaimed the startled mrs scutts have you took leave of your senses or what  i read a case in the paper where a man got it said mr scutts he ’ad his back ’urt too pore chap how would you like to lay on your back all your life for a thousand pounds  will you ’ave to lay abed all your life inquired his wife staring  wait till i get the money said mr scutts then i might be able to tell you better  he gazed wistfully at the window it was late october but the sun shone and the air was clear the sound of traffic and cheerful voices ascended from the little street to mr scutts it all seemed to be a part of a distant past  if that chap comes round tomorrow and offers me five hundred he said slowly i don’t know as i won’t take it i’m sick of this mouldy bed  he waited expectantly next day but nothing happened and after a week of bed he began to realize that the job might be a long one the monotony to a man of his active habits became almost intolerable and the narrated adventures of mr james flynn his only caller filled him with an uncontrollable longing to be up and doing  the fine weather went and mr scutts in his tumbled bed lay watching the rain beating softly on the windowpanes then one morning he awoke to the darkness of a london fog  it gets worse and worse said mrs scutts as she returned home in the afternoon with a relish for his tea can’t see your ’and before your face  mr scutts looked thoughtful he ate his tea in silence and after he had finished lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking  penny for your thoughts said his wife  i’m going out said mr scutts in a voice that defied opposition i’m going to ’ave a walk and when i’m far enough away i’m going to ’ave one or two drinks i believe this fog is sent apurpose to save my life  mrs scutts remonstrated but in vain and at halfpast six the invalid with his cap over his eyes and a large scarf tied round the lower part of his face listened for a moment at his front door and then disappeared in the fog  left to herself mrs scutts returned to the bedroom and poking the tiny fire into a blaze sat and pondered over the willfulness of men  she was awakened from a doze by a knocking at the streetdoor it was just eight o’clock and inwardly congratulating her husband on his return to common sense and home she went down and opened it two tall men in silk hats entered the room  mrs scutts said one of them  mrs scutts in a dazed fashion nodded  we have come to see your husband said the intruder i am a doctor  the panicstricken mrs scutts tried in vain to think  hehe’s asleep she said at last  doesn’t matter said the doctor  not a bit said his companion  you—you can’t see him protested mrs scutts he ain’t to be seen  he’d be sorry to miss me said the doctor eyeing her keenly as she stood on guard by the inner door i suppose he’s at home  of course said mrs scutts stammering and flushing why the pore man can’t stir from his bed  well i’ll just peep in at the door then said the doctor i won’t wake him you can’t object to that if you do—  mrs scutts’s head began to swim i’ll go up and see whether he’s awake she said  she closed the door on them and stood with her hand to her throat thinking then instead of going upstairs she passed into the yard and stepping over the fence opened mr flynn’s back door  halloa said that gentleman who was standing in the scullery removing mud from his boots what’s up  in a frenzied gabble mrs scutts told him you must be ’im she said clutching him by the coat and dragging him towards the door they’ve never seen ’im and they won’t know the difference  but— exclaimed the astonished james  quick she said sharply go into the back room and undress then nip into his room and get into bed and mind be fast asleep all the time  still holding the bewildered mr flynn by the coat she led him into the house and waved him upstairs and stood below listening until a slight creaking of the bed announced that he had obeyed orders then she entered the parlour  he’s fast asleep she said softly and mind i won’t ’ave him disturbed it’s the first real sleep he’s ’ad for nearly a week if you promise not to wake ’im you may just have a peep  we won’t disturb him said the doctor and followed by his companion noiselessly ascended the stairs and peeped into the room mr flynn was fast asleep and not a muscle moved as the two men approached the bed on tiptoe and stood looking at him the doctor turned after a minute and led the way out of the room  we’ll call again he said softly  yes sir said mrs scutts when  the doctor and his companion exchanged glances i’m very busy just at present he said slowly we’ll look in some time and take our chance of catching him awake  mrs scutts bowed them out and in some perplexity returned to mr flynn i don’t like the look of ’em she said shaking her head you’d better stay in bed till bill comes ’ome in case they come back  righto said the obliging mr flynn just step in and tell my landlady i’m ’aving a chat with bill  he lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking until a knock at the front door at halfpast eleven sent him off to sleep again mrs scutts who was sitting downstairs opened it and admitted her husband  all serene he inquired what are you looking like that for what’s up  he sat quivering with alarm and rage as she told him and then mounting the stairs with a heavy tread stood gazing in helpless fury at the slumbering form of mr james flynn  get out o’ my bed he said at last in a choking voice  what bill said mr flynn opening his eyes  get out o’ my bed repeated the other you’ve made a nice mess of it between you it’s a fine thing if a man can’t go out for ’arf a pint without coming home and finding all the riffraff of the neighbourhood in ’is bed  ’ow’s the pore back bill inquired mr flynn with tenderness  mr scutts gurgled at him outside he said as soon as he could get his breath  bill said the voice of mrs scutts outside the door  halloa growled her husband  he mustn’t go said mrs scutts those gentlemen are coming again and they think he is you  what roared the infuriated mr scutts  don’t you see it’s me what’s got the pore back now bill said mr flynn you can’t pass yourself off as me bill you ain’t goodlooking enough  mr scutts past speech raised his clenched fists to the ceiling  he’ll ’ave to stay in your bed continued the voice of mrs scutts he’s got a good ’art and i know he’ll do it won’t you jim  mr flynn pondered tell my landlady in the morning that i’ve took your back room he said what a fortunit thing it is i’m out o’ work what are you walking up and down like that for bill back coming on agin  then o’ course pursued the voice of mrs scutts in meditative accents there’s the club doctor and the other gentleman that knows bill they might come at any moment there’s got to be two bills in bed so that if one party comes one bill can nip into the back room and if the other bill—party i mean—comes the other bill—you know what i mean  mr scutts swore himself faint  that’s ’ow it is mate said mr flynn it’s no good standing there saying your little piece of poetry to yourself take off your clo’es and get to bed like a little man now now naughty naughty  p’r’aps i oughtn’t to ’ave let ’em up bill said his wife but i was afraid they’d smell a rat if i didn’t besides i was took by surprise  you get off to bed said mr scutts get off to bed while you’re safe  and get a good night’s rest added the thoughtful mr flynn if bill’s back is took bad in the night i’ll look after it  mr scutts turned a threatening face on him for two pins— he began  for two pins i’ll go back ’ome and stay there said mr flynn  he put one muscular leg out of bed and then at the earnest request of mr scutts put it back again in a few simple manly words the latter apologized by putting all the blame on mrs scutts and removing his clothes got into bed  wrapped in bedclothes they passed the following day listening for knocks at the door and playing cards by evening both men were weary and mr scutts made a few pointed remarks concerning dodging doctors and deceitful visitors to which mr flynn listened in silent approval  they mightn’t come for a week he said dismally it’s all right for you but where do i come in halves  mr scutts had a rush of blood to the head  you leave it to me mate he said controlling himself by an effort if i get ten quid say you shall have ’arf  and suppose you get more demanded the other  we’ll see said mr scutts vaguely  mr flynn returned to the charge next day but got no satisfaction mr scutts preferred to talk instead of the free board and lodging his friend was getting on the subject of such pay for such work he was almost eloquent  i’ll bide my time said mr flynn darkly treat me fair and i’ll treat you fair  his imprisonment came to an end on the fourth day there was a knock at the door and the sound of men’s voices followed by the hurried appearance of mrs scutts  it’s jim’s lot she said in a hurried whisper i’ve just come up to get the room ready  mr scutts took his friend by the hand and after warmly urging him not to forget the expert instructions he had received concerning his back slipped into the back room and a prey to forebodings awaited the result  well he looks better said the doctor regarding mr flynn  much better said his companion  mrs scutts shook her head his pore back don’t seem no better sir she said in a low voice can’t you do something for it  let me have a look at it said the doctor undo your shirt  mr flynn with slow fingers fumbled with the button at his neck and looked hard at mrs scutts  she can’t bear to see me suffer he said in a feeble voice as she left the room  he bore the examination with the fortitude of an early christian martyr in response to inquiries he said he felt as though the mainspring of his back had gone  how long since you walked inquired the doctor  not since the accident said mr flynn firmly  try now said the doctor  mr flynn smiled at him reproachfully  you can’t walk because you think you can’t said the doctor that is all you’ll have to be encouraged the same way that a child is i should like to cure you and i think i can  he took a small canvas bag from the other man and opened it forty pounds he said would you like to count it  mr flynn’s eyes shone  it is all yours said the doctor if you can walk across the room and take it from that gentleman’s hand  honour bright asked mr flynn in tremulous tones as the other man held up the bag and gave him an encouraging smile  honour bright said the doctor  with a spring that nearly broke the bed mr flynn quitted it and snatched the bag and at the same moment mrs scutts impelled by a maddened arm burst into the room  your back she moaned it’ll kill you get back to bed  i’m cured lovey said mr flynn simply  his back is as strong as ever said the doctor giving it a thump  mr flynn who had taken his clothes from a chair and was hastily dressing himself assented  but if you’ll wait ’arf a tick i’ll walk as far as the corner with you he said quickly i’d like to make sure it’s all right  he paused at the foot of the stairs and glancing up at the palid and murderous face of mr scutts which protruded from the back bedroom smiled at him rapturously then with a lordly air he tossed him five pieces of gold     keeping watch     human natur’ said the nightwatchman gazing fixedly at a pretty girl in a passing waterman’s skiff human natur’  he sighed and striking a match applied it to his pipe and sat smoking thoughtfully  the young fellow is pretending that his arm is at the back of her by accident he continued and she’s pretending not to know that it’s there when he’s allowed to put it round ’er waist whenever he wishes he won’t want to do it she’s artful enough to know that and that’s why they are all so standoffish until the thing is settled she’ll move forward ’arf an inch presently and ’arf a minute arterwards she’ll lean back agin without thinking she’s a nicelooking gal and what she can see in a tailor’s dummy like that i can’t think  he leaned back on his box and folding his arms emitted a cloud of smoke  human natur’s a funny thing i’ve seen a lot of it in my time and if i was to ’ave my life all over agin i expect i should be just as silly as them two in the skiff i’ve known the time when i would spend money as free over a gal as i would over myself i on’y wish i’d got all the money now that i’ve spent on peppermint lozenges  that gal in the boat reminds me o’ one i used to know a few years ago just the same innercent baby look—a look as if butter wouldn’t melt in ’er mouth—and a artful disposition that made me sorry for ’er sects  she used to come up to this wharf once a week in a schooner called the belle her father cap’n butt was a widowman and ’e used to bring her with ’im partly for company and partly because ’e could keep ’is eye on her nasty eye it was too when he ’appened to be out o’ temper  i’d often took a bit o’ notice o’ the gal just giving ’er a kind smile now and then as she sat on deck and sometimes—when ’er father wasn’t looking—she’d smile back once when ’e was down below she laughed right out she was afraid of ’im and by and by i noticed that she daren’t even get off the ship and walk up and down the wharf without asking ’im when she went out ’e was with ’er and from one or two nasty little snacks i ’appened to overhear when the skipper thought i was too far away i began to see that something was up  it all came out one evening and it only came out because the skipper wanted my help i was standing leaning on my broom to get my breath back arter a bit o’ sweeping when he came up to me and i knew at once by the nice way ’e spoke that he wanted me to do something for ’im  ’come and ’ave a pint bill’ he ses  i put my broom agin the wall and we walked round to the bull’s head like a couple o’ brothers we ’ad two pints apiece and then he put his ’and on my shoulder and talked as man to man  ’i’m in a little bit o’ difficulty about that gal o’ mine’ he ses passing me his baccybox ’six months ago she dropped a letter out of ’er pocket and i’m blest if it wasn’t from a young man a young man’  ’you surprise me’ i ses meaning to be sarcastic  ’i surprised her’ he ses looking very fierce ’i went to ’er box and i found a pile of ’ema pile of ’emtied up with a piece o’ pink ribbon and a photygraph of my lord and of all the narrerchested weakeyed slackbaked spindlylegged sons of a gun you ever saw in your life he is the worst if i on’y get my ’ands on him i’ll choke ’im with his own feet’  he washed ’is mouth out with a drop o’ beer and stood scowling at the floor  ’arter i’ve choked ’im i’ll twist his neck’ he ses ’if he ’ad on’y put his address on ’is letters i’d go round and do it now and my daughter my only daughter won’t tell me where he lives’  ’she ought to know better’ i ses  he took hold o’ my ’and and shook it ’you’ve got more sense than one ’ud think to look at you bill’ he ses not thinking wot he was saying ’you see wot a mess i’m in’  ’yes’ i ses  ’i’m a nurse that’s wot i am’ he ses very savage ’just a nursemaid i can’t move ’and or foot without that gal ’ow’d you like it yourself bill’  ’it must be very orkard for you’ i ses ’very orkard indeed’  ’orkard’ he ses ’it’s no name for it bill i might as well be a sundayschool teacher and ha’ done with it i never ’ad such a dull time in all my life never and the worst of it is it’s spiling my temper and all because o’ that narrereyed redchested—you know wot i mean’  he took another mouthful o’ beer and then he took ’old of my arm ’bill’ he ses very earnest ’i want you to do me a favour’  ’go ahead’ i ses  ’i’ve got to meet a pal at charing cross at ha’past seven’ he ses ’and we’re going to make a night of it i’ve left winnie in charge o’ the cook and i’ve told ’im plain that if she ain’t there when i come back i’ll skin ’im alive now i want you to watch ’er too keep the gate locked and don’t let anybody in you don’t know especially that monkeyfaced imitation of a man here ’e is that’s his likeness’  he pulled a photygraph out of ’is coatpocket and ’anded it to me  ’that’s ’im’ he ses ’fancy a gal getting loveletters from a thing like that and she was on’y twenty last birthday keep your eye on ’er bill and don’t let ’er out of your sight you’re worth two o’ the cook’  he finished ’is beer and cuddling my arm stepped back to the wharf miss butt was sitting on the cabin skylight reading a book and old joe the cook was standing near ’er pretending to swab the decks with a mop  ’i’ve got to go out for a little while—on business’ ses the skipper ’i don’t s’pose i shall be long and while i’m away bill and the cook will look arter you’  miss butt wrinkled up ’er shoulders  ’the gate’ll be locked and you’re not to leave the wharf d’ye ’ear’  the gal wriggled ’er shoulders agin and went on reading but she gave the cook a look out of ’er innercent baby eyes that nearly made ’im drop the mop  ’them’s my orders’ ses the skipper swelling his chest and looking round ’to everybody you know wot’ll ’appen to you joe if things ain’t right when i come back come along bill and lock the gate arter me an’ mind for your own sake don’t let anything ’appen to that gal while i’m away’  ’wot time’ll you be back’ i ses as ’e stepped through the wicket  ’not afore twelve and p’r’aps a good bit later’ he ses smiling all over with ’appiness ’but young slabchest don’t know i’m out and winnie thinks i’m just going out for ’arf an hour so it’ll be all right so long’  i watched ’im up the road and i must say i began to wish i ’adn’t taken the job on arter all i ’ad on’y had two pints and a bit o’ flattery and i knew wot ’ud ’appen if anything went wrong built like a bull he was and fond o’ using his strength i locked the wicket careful and putting the key in my pocket began to walk up and down the wharf  for about ten minutes the gal went on reading and didn’t look up once then as i passed she gave me a nice smile and shook ’er little fist at the cook wot ’ad got ’is back towards ’er i smiled back o’ course and by and by she put her book down and climbed on to the side o’ the ship and held out her ’and for me to ’elp her ashore  ’i’m so tired of the ship’ she ses in a soft voice ’it’s like a prison don’t you get tired of the wharf’  ’sometimes’ i ses ’but it’s my dooty’  ’yes’ she ses ’yes of course but you’re a big strong man and you can put up with things better’  she gave a little sigh and we walked up and down for a time without saying anything  ’and it’s all father’s foolishness’ she ses at last ’that’s wot makes it so tiresome i can’t help a pack of silly young men writing to me can i’  ’no i s’pose not’ i ses  ’thank you’ she ses putting ’er little ’and on my arm ’i knew that you were sensible i’ve often watched you when i’ve been sitting alone on the schooner longing for somebody to speak to and i’m a good judge of character i can read you like a book’  she turned and looked up at me beautiful blue eyes she’d got with long curling lashes and teeth like pearls  ’father is so silly’ she ses shaking her ’ead and looking down ’and it’s so unreasonable because as a matter of fact i don’t like young men oh i beg your pardon i didn’t mean that i didn’t mean to be rude’  ’rude’ i ses staring at her  ’of course it was a rude thing for me to say’ she ses smiling ’because you are still a young man yourself’  i shook my ’ead ’youngish’ i ses  ’young’ she ses stamping ’er little foot  she gave me another look and this time ’er blue eyes seemed large and solemn she walked along like one in a dream and twice she tripped over the planks and would ’ave fallen if i hadn’t caught ’er round the waist  ’thank you’ she ses ’i’m very clumsy how strong your arm is’  we walked up and down agin and every time we went near the edge of the jetty she ’eld on to my arm for fear of stumbling agin and there was that silly cook standing about on the schooner on tiptoe and twisting his silly old neck till i wonder it didn’t twist off  ’wot a beautiful evening it is’ she ses at last in a low voice ’i ’ope father isn’t coming back early do you know wot time he is coming home’  ’about twelve’ i ses ’but don’t tell ’im i told you so’  ’o’ course not’ she ses squeezing my arm ’poor father i hope he is enjoying himself as much as i am’  we walked down to the jetty agin arter that and sat side by side looking acrost the river and she began to talk about life and wot a strange thing it was and ’ow the river would go on flowing down to the sea thousands and thousands o’ years arter we was both dead and forgotten if it hadn’t ha’ been for her little ’ead leaning agin my shoulder i should have ’ad the creeps  ’let’s go down into the cabin’ she ses at last with a little shiver ’it makes me melancholy sitting here and thinking of the mighthavebeens’  i got up first and ’elped her up and arter both staring hard at the cook wot didn’t seem to know ’is place we went down into the cabin it was a comfortable little place and arter she ’ad poured me out a glass of ’er father’s whisky and filled my pipe for me i wouldn’t ha’ changed places with a king even when the pipe wouldn’t draw i didn’t mind  ’may i write a letter’ she ses at last  ’sartainly’ i ses  she got out her pen and ink and paper and wrote ’i sha’n’t be long’ she ses looking up and nibbling ’er pen ’it’s a letter to my dressmaker she promised my dress by six o’clock this afternoon and i am just writing to tell her that if i don’t have it by ten in the morning she can keep it’  ’quite right’ i ses ’it’s the on’y way to get things done’  ’it’s my way’ she ses sticking the letter in an envelope and licking it down ’nice name isn’t it’  she passed it over to me and i read the name and address ’miss minnie miller 17 john street mile end road’  ’that’ll wake her up’ she ses smiling ’will you ask joe to take it for me’  ’he—he’s on guard’ i ses smiling back at ’er and shaking my ’ead  ’i know’ she ses in a low voice ’but i don’t want any guard—only you i don’t like guards that peep down skylights’  i looked up just in time to see joe’s ’ead disappear then i nipped up and arter i ’ad told ’im part of wot i thought about ’im i gave ’im the letter and told ’im to sheer off  ’the skipper told me to stay ’ere’ he ses looking obstinate  ’you do as you’re told’ i ses ’i’m in charge and i take full responsibility i shall lock the gate arter you wot are you worrying about’  ’and here’s a shilling joe for a bus fare’ ses the gal smiling ’you can keep the change’  joe took off ’is cap and scratched ’is silly bald ’ead  ’come on’ i ses ’it’s a letter to a dressmaker a letter that must go tonight’  ’else it’s no use’ ses the gal ’you don’t know ’ow important it is’  ’all right’ ses joe ’’ave it your own way so long as you don’t tell the skipper i don’t mind if anything ’appens you’ll catch it too bill’  he climbed ashore and i follered ’im to the gate and unlocked it he was screwing up ’is eye ready for a wink but i give ’im such a look that he thought better of it and arter rubbing his eye with ’is finger as though he ’ad got a bit o’ dust in it he went off  i locked the gate and went back to the cabin and for some time we sat talking about fathers and the foolish ideas they got into their ’eads and things o’ that sort so far as i remember i ’ad two more goes o’ whisky and one o’ the skipper’s cigars and i was just thinking wot a beautiful thing it was to be alive and ’ealthy and in good spirits talking to a nice gal that understood wot you said a’most afore you said it when i ’eard three blows on a whistle  ’wot’s that’ i ses starting up ’police whistle’  ’i don’t think so’ ses miss butt putting her ’and on my shoulder ’sit down and stay where you are i don’t want you to get hurt if it is let somebody i don’t like go’  i sat down agin and listened but there was no more whistling  ’boy in the street i expect’ ses the gal going into the stateroom ’oh i’ve got something to show you wait a minute’  i ’eard her moving about and then she comes back into the cabin  ’i can’t find the key of my box’ she ses ’and it’s in there i wonder whether you’ve got a key that would open it it’s a padlock’  i put my ’and in my pocket and pulled out my keys ’shall i come and try’ i ses  ’no thank you’ she ses taking the keys ’this looks about the size what key is it’  ’it’s the key of the gate’ i ses ’but i don’t suppose it’ll fit’  she went back into the stateroom agin and i ’eard her fumbling at a lock then she came back into the cabin breathing rather hard and stood thinking  ’i’ve just remembered’ she ses pinching her chin ’yes’  she stepped to the door and went up the companionladder and the next moment i ’eard a sliding noise and a key turn in a lock i jumped to the foot of the ladder and ’ardly able to believe my senses saw that the hatch was closed when i found that it was locked too you might ha’ knocked me down with a feather  i went down to the cabin agin and standing on the locker pushed the skylight up with my ’ead and tried to lookout i couldn’t see the gate but i ’eard voices and footsteps and a little while arterwards i see that gal coming along the wharf arm in arm with the young man she ’ad told me she didn’t like and dancing for joy they climbed on to the schooner and then they both stooped down with their hands on their knees and looked at me  ’wot is it’ ses the young man grinning  ’it’s a watchman’ ses the gal ’it’s here to take charge of the wharf you know and see that nobody comes on’  ’we ought to ha’ brought some buns for it’ ses the young man ’look at it opening its mouth’  they both laughed fit to kill themselves but i didn’t move a muscle  ’you open the companion’ i ses ’or it’ll be the worse for you d’ye hear open it’  ’oh alfred’ ses the gal ’he’s losing ’is temper wotever shall we do’  ’i don’t want no more nonsense’ i ses trying to fix ’er with my eye ’if you don’t let me out it’ll be the worse for you’  ’don’t you talk to my young lady like that’ ses the young man  ’your young lady’ i ses ’h’mm you should ha’ seen ’er ’arf an hour ago’  the gal looked at me steady for a moment  ’he put ’is nasty fat arm round my waist alfred’ she ses  ’wot’ ses the young man squeaking ’wot’  he snatched up the mop wot that nasty untidy cook ’ad left leaning agin the side and afore i ’ad any idea of wot ’e was up to he shoved the beastly thing straight in my face  ’next time’ he ses ’i’ll tear you limb from limb’  i couldn’t speak for a time and when i could ’e stopped me with the mop agin it was like a chained lion being tormented by a monkey i stepped down on to the cabin floor and then i told ’em both wot i thought of ’em  ’come along alfred’ ses the gal ’else the cook’ll be back before we start’  ’he’s all right’ ses the young man ’minnie’s looking arter him when i left he’d got ’arf a bottle of whisky in front of ’im’  ’still we may as well go’ ses miss butt ’it seems a shame to keep the cab waiting’  ’all right’ he ses ’i just want to give this old chump one more lick with the mop and then we’ll go’  he peeped down the skylight and waited but i kept quite quiet with my back towards ’im  ’come along’ ses miss butt  ’i’m coming’ he ses ’hi you down there when the cap’n comes back tell ’im that i’m taking miss butt to an aunt o’ mine in the country and tell’im that in a week or two he’ll ’ave the largest and nicest piece of weddingcake he ’as ever ’ad in his life so long’  ’goodbye watchman’ ses the gal  they moved off without another word—from them i mean i heard the wicket slam and then i ’eard a cab drive off over the stones i couldn’t believe it at first i couldn’t believe a gal with such beautiful blue eyes could be so hard’earted and for a long time i stood listening and hoping to ’ear the cab come back then i stepped up to the companion and tried to shift it with my shoulders  i went back to the cabin at last and arter lighting the lamp i ’ad another sup o’ the skipper’s whisky to clear my ’ead and sat down to try and think wot tale i was to tell ’im i sat for pretty near three hours without thinking of one and then i ’eard the crew come on to the wharf  they was a bit startled when they saw my ’ead at the skylight and then they all started at the same time asking me wot i was doing i told ’em to let me out fust and then i’d tell ’em and one of ’em ’ad just stepped round to the companion when the skipper come on to the wharf and stepped aboard he stooped down and peeped at me through the skylight as though he couldn’t believe ’is eyesight and then arter sending the hands for’ard and telling ’em to stay there wotever ’appened he unlocked the companion and came down     the understudy     dogs on board ship is a nuisance said the nightwatchman gazing fiercely at the vociferous mongrel that had chased him from the deck of the henry william the skipper asks me to keep an eye on the ship and then leaves a thing like that down in the cabin  he leaned against a pile of empty casks to recover his breath shook his fist at the dog and said slowly—  some people can’t make too much of ’em they talk about a dog’s honest eyes and his faithful ’art i ’ad a dog once and i never saw his eyes look so honest as they did one day when ’e was sitting on a pound o’ beefsteak we was ’unting high and low for  i’ve known dogs to cause a lot of trouble in my time a man as used to live in my street told me he ’ad been in jail three times because dogs follered him ’ome and wouldn’t go away when he told ’em to he said that some men would ha’ kicked ’em out into the street but he thought their little lives was far too valuable to risk in that way  some people used to wink when ’e talked like that but i didn’t i remembered a dog that took a fancy to old sam small and ginger dick and peter russet once in just the same way  it was one night in a little public’ouse down commercial road way they ’ad on’y been ashore a week and ’aving been turned out of a music’all the night afore because a man ginger dick had punched in the jaw wouldn’t behave ’imself they said they’d spend the rest o’ their money on beer instead there was just the three of ’em sitting by themselves in a cosy little bar when the door was pushed open and a big black dog came in  he came straight up to sam and licked his ’and sam was eating a arrowroot biscuit with a bit o’ cheese on it at the time he wasn’t wot you’d call a partickler sort o’ man but seeing as ’ow the dog was so careless that ’e licked the biscuit a’most as much as he did his ’and he gave it to ’im the dog took it in one gulp and then he jumped up on sam’s lap and wagged his tail in ’is face for joy and thankfulness  he’s took a fancy to you sam ses ginger  sam pushed the dog off on to the floor and wiped his face  he’s a good dog by the look of ’im ses peter russet who was country bred  he bought a sausageroll and him and the dog ate it between ’em then ginger dick bought one and gave it to ’im and by the time it was finished the dog didn’t seem to know which one of ’em he loved the most  wonder who he belongs to ses ginger is there any name on the collar peter  peter shook his ’ead it’s a good collar though he ses i wonder whether he’s been and lost ’imself  old sam wot was always on the lookout for money put his beer down and wiped ’is mouth there might be a reward out for ’im he ses i think i’ll take care of ’im for a day or two in case  we’ll all take care of ’im ses ginger and if there’s a reward we’ll go shares mind that  i found ’im ses sam very disagreeable he came up to me as if he’d known me all ’is life  no ses ginger don’t you flatter yourself he came up to you because he didn’t know you sam  if he ’ad he’d ha’ bit your ’and ses peter russet  instead o’ washing it ses ginger  go on ses sam ’olding his breath with passion go on  peter opened ’is mouth but just then another man came into the bar and arter ordering ’is drink turned round and patted the dog’s ’ead  that’s a good dog ’ow old is he he ses to ginger  two years last april ses ginger without moving a eyelid  fifth of april ses old sam very quick and fierce  at two o’clock in the morning ses peter  the man took up ’is beer and looked at ’em then ’e took a drink and looked at ’em again arter which he ’ad another look at the dog  i could see ’e was very valuable he ses i see that the moment i set eyes on ’im mind you don’t get ’im stole  he finished up ’is beer and went out and he ’ad ’ardly gone afore ginger took a piece o’ thick string out of ’is pocket and fastened it to the dog’s collar  make yourself at ’ome ginger ses sam very nasty  i’m going to ses ginger that chap knows something about dogs and if we can’t get a reward for ’im p’r’aps we can sell ’im  they ’ad another arfpint each and then ginger taking ’old of the string they went out into the street  nine o’clock ses peter it’s no good going ’ome yet ginger  we can ’ave a glass or two on the way ses ginger but i sha’n’t feel comfortable in my mind till we’ve got the dog safe ’ome p’r’aps the people wot ’ave lost it are looking for it now  they ’ad another drink farther on and a man in the bar took such a fancy to the dog that ’e offered ginger five shillings for it and drinks round  that shows ’ow valuable it is ses peter russet when they got outside hold that string tight ginger wot’s the matter  he won’t come ses ginger tugging at the string come on old chap good dog come on  he stood there pulling at the dog wot was sitting down and being dragged along on its stummick he didn’t know its name but ’e called it a few things that seemed to ease ’is mind and then he ’anded over the string to sam wot ’ad been asking for it and told ’im to see wot he could do  we shall ’ave a crowd round us in a minute ses peter mind you don’t bust a bloodvessel sam  and be locked up for stealing it p’r’aps ses ginger better let it go sam  wot arter refusing five bob for it ses sam talk sense ginger and give it a shove be’ind  ginger gave it a shove but it was no good there was three or four people coming along the road and sam made up ’is mind in an instant and ’eld up his ’and to a cab that was passing  it took the three of ’em to get the dog into the cab and as soon as it was in the cabman told ’em to take it out agin they argufied with ’im till their tongues ached and at last arter paying ’im four shillings and sixpence afore they started he climbed up on the box and drove off  the door was open when they got to their lodgings but they ’ad to be careful because o’ the landlady it took the three of ’em to pull and push that dog upstairs and ginger took a dislike to dogs that ’e never really got over they got ’im in the bedroom at last and arter they ’ad given ’im a drink o’ water out o’ the washhand basin ginger and peter started to find fault with sam small  i know wot i’m about ses sam but o’ course if you don’t want your share say so wot  talk sense ses ginger we paid our share o’ the cab didn’t we and more fools us  there won’t be no share ses peter russet but if there is we’re going to’ave it  they undressed themselves and got into bed and ginger ’adn’t been in his five minutes afore the dog started to get in with ’im when ginger pushed ’im off ’e seemed to think he was having a game with ’im and arter pretending to bite ’im in play he took the end of the counterpane in ’is mouth and tried to drag it off  why don’t you get to sleep ginger ses sam who was just dropping off ’ave a game with ’im in the morning  ginger gave the dog a punch in the chest and arter saying a few o’ the things he’d like to do to sam small he cuddled down in ’is bed and they all went off to sleep all but the dog that is he seemed uneasy in ’is mind and if ’e woke ’em up once by standing on his ’indlegs and putting his forepaws on their chest to see if they was still alive he did arfadozen times  he dropped off to sleep at last scratching ’imself but about three o’clock in the morning ginger woke up with a ’orrible start and sat up in bed shivering sam and peter woke up too and raising themselves in bed looked at the dog wot was sitting on its tail with its ’ead back moaning fit to break its ’art  wot’s the matter ses old sam in a shaky voice stop it stop it d’ye hear  p’r’aps it’s dying ses ginger as the dog let off a ’owl like a steamer coming up the river stop it you brute  he’ll wake the ’ouse up in a minute ses peter take ’im downstairs and kick ’im into the street sam  take ’im yourself ses sam hsh somebody’s coming upstairs poor old doggie come along then come along  the dog left off his ’owling and went over and licked ’im just as the landlady and one or two more came to the door and called out to know wot they meant by it  it’s all right missis ses sam it’s on’y pore ginger you keep quiet he ses in a whisper turning to ginger  wot’s he making that row about ses the landlady he made my blood run cold  he’s got a touch o’ toothache ses sam never mind ginger ’e ses in a hurry as the dog let off another ’owl try and bear it  he’s a coward that’s wot ’e is ses the landlady very fierce why a child o’ five wouldn’t make such a fuss  sounds more like a dog than a ’uman being ses another voice you come outside ginger and i’ll give you something to cry for  they waited a minute or two and then everything being quiet they went back to bed while old sam talked to ginger about wot ’e called ’is presence o’ mind and ginger talked to ’im about wot he’d do to ’im if ’e wasn’t a fat old man with one foot in the grave  they was all in a better temper when they woke up in the morning and while sam was washing they talked about wot they was to do with the dog  we can’t lead ’im about all day ses ginger and if we let ’im off the string he’ll go off ’ome  he don’t know where his ’ome is ses sam very severe but he might run away and then the pore thing might be starved or else illtreated i ’ave ’eard o’ boys tying tin cans to their tails  i’ve done it myself ses ginger nodding consequently it’s our dooty to look arter ’im ses sam  i’ll go down to the front door ses peter and when i whistle bring him down  ginger stuck his ’ead out o’ the window and by and by when peter whistled him and sam took the dog downstairs and out into the street  so far so good ses sam now wot about brekfuss  they ’ad their brekfuss in their usual coffeeshop and the dog took bits from all of them unfortunately ’e wasn’t used to haddick bones and arter two of the customers ’ad gorn out and two more ’ad complained to the landlord they ’ad to leave their brekfusses and take ’im outside for a breath o’ fresh air  now wot are we going to do ses ginger i’m beginning to be sick of the sight of ’im ’ave we got to lead ’im about all day on a bit o’ string  let’s take ’im round the corner and lose ’im ses peter russet  you give me ’old o’ that string ses sam if you don’t want shares that’s all right if i’m going to look arter ’im i’ll ’ave it all  that made ginger and peter look at each other direckly sam began to talk about money they began to think they might be losing something  and wot about ’aving ’im in our bedroom and keeping us awake all night ses peter  and putting it on to me with the toothache ses ginger no you can look arter ’im sam while me and peter goes off and enjoys ourselves and if you get anything we go shares mind  all right ses sam turning away with the dog  and suppose sam gets a reward or sells it and then tells us that it ran away and ’e lost it ses peter  o’ course i never thought o’ that ses ginger you’ve got your ’ead on straight peter  i see ’im smile that’s why ses peter russet  you’re a liar ses sam  we’ll stick together ses ginger leastways one of us’ll keep with you sam  they settled it that way at last and while ginger went for a walk down round about where they ’ad found the dog sam small and peter waited for him in a little public’ouse down limehouse way their idea was that there would be bills up and when ginger came back and said there wasn’t they ’ad a lot to say about people wot wasn’t fit to ’ave dogs because they didn’t love ’em  they ’ad a miserable day when the dog got sick o’ sitting in a pub ’e made such a noise they ’ad to take ’im out and when ’e got tired o’ walking about he sat down on the pavement and they ’ad to drag ’im along to the nearest pub agin at five o’clock in the arternoon ginger dick was talking about twopenn’orth o’ ratpoison  wot are we to do with ’im till twelve o’clock tonight ses peter  and s’pose we can’t smuggle ’im into the ’ouse agin ses ginger or suppose he makes that noise agin in the night  they ’ad a pint each to ’elp them to think wot was to be done and arter a lot o’ talking and quarrelling they did wot a lot of other people ’ave done when they got into trouble they came to me  i ’ad on’y been on dooty about arf an hour when the three of ’em turned up at the wharf with the dog and arter saying ’ow well i looked and that i seemed to get younger every time they saw me they asked me to take charge of the dog for ’em  it’ll be company for you ses old sam it must be very lonely ’ere of a night i’ve often thought of it  and of a daytime you could take it ’ome and tie it up in your backyard ses ginger  i wouldn’t ’ave anything to do with it at fust but at last i gave way they offered me fourpence a day for its keep and as i didn’t want to run any risk i made ’em give me a couple o’ bob to go on with  they went off as though they’d left a load o’ care be’ind ’em and arter tying the dog up to a crane i went on with my work they ’adn’t told me wot the game was but from one or two things they’d let drop i’d got a pretty good idea  the dog ’owled a bit at fust but he quieted down arter a bit he was a nicelooking animal but one dog is much the same as another to me and if i ’ad one ten years i don’t suppose i could pick it out from two or three others  i took it off ’ome with me when i left at six o’clock next morning and tied it up in my yard my missis ’ad words about it o’ course—that’s wot people get married for—but when she found it woke me up three times she quieted down and said wot a nice coat it ’ad got  the three of ’em came round next evening to see it and they was so afraid of its being lost that when they stood me a pint at the bull’s head we ’ad to take it with us ginger was going to buy a sausageroll for it but arter sam ’ad pointed out that they was paying me fourpence a day for its keep he didn’t and sam ’ad the cheek to tell me that it liked a nice bit o’ fried steak as well as anything  a lot o’ people admired that dog i remember on the fourth night i think it was the barge dauntless came alongside and arter she was made fast the skipper came ashore and took a little notice of it  where did you get ’im he ses  i told ’im ’ow it was and he stood there for some time patting the dog on the ’ead and whistling under ’is breath  it’s much the same size as my dog he ses that’s a black retriever too  i ses oh  i’m afraid i shall ’ave to get rid of it he ses it’s on the barge now my missis won’t ’ave it in the ’ouse any more cos it bit the baby and o’ course it was no good p’inting out to ’er that it was its first bite even the law allows one bite but it’s no good talking about the law to wimmen  except when it’s on their side i ses  he patted the dog’s ’ead agin and whistled and a big black dog came up out of the cabin and sprang ashore it went up and put its nose to sam’s dog and they both growled like thunderstorms  might be brothers ses the skipper on’y your dog’s got a better ’eead and a better coat it’s a good dog  they’re all alike to me i ses i couldn’t tell ’em apart not if you paid me  the skipper stood there a moment and then he ses i wish you’d let me see ’ow my dog looks in your dog’s collar he ses  whaffor i ses  on’y fancy he ses oh bill  yes i ses  it ain’t christmas he ses taking my arm and walking up and down a bit but it will be soon and then i mightn’t see you you’ve done me one or two good turns and i should like to make you a christmasbox of three ’arfdollars  i let ’im give ’em to me and then just to please ’im i let ’im try the collar on ’is dog while i swept up a bit  it looked beautiful on ’im he ses when i’d finished but i’ve put it back agin come on bruno goodnight bill  he got ’is dog on the barge agin arter a bit o’ trouble and arter making sure ’that my dog ’ad got its own collar on i went on with my work  the dog didn’t seem to be quite ’imself next day and he was so fierce in the yard that my missis was afraid to go near ’im i was going to ask the skipper about it as ’e seemed to know more about dogs than i did but when i got to the wharf the barge had sailed  it was just getting dark when there came a ring at the gatebell and afore i could answer it arfadozen more as fast as the bell could go and when i opened the wicket sam small and ginger and peter russet all tried to get in at once  where’s the dog ses sam  tied up i ses wot’s the matter ’ave you all gorn mad  they didn’t answer me they ran on to the jetty and afore i could turn round a’most they ’ad got the dog loose and was dragging it towards me smiling all over their faces  reward ses ginger as i caught ’old of ’im by the coat five pounds —landlord of a pub—at bow—come on sam  why don’t you keep your mouth shut ginger ses sam  five pounds i ses five pounds hurrah  wot are you hurraying about ses sam very short  why i ses i s’pose——here arf a moment  can’t stop ses sam going arter the others  i watched ’em up the road and then i locked the gate and walked up and down the wharf thinking wot a funny thing money is and ’ow it alters people’s natures and arter all i thought that three arfdollars earned honest was better than a reward for hiding another man’s dog  i finished tidying up and at nine o’clock i went into the office for a quiet smoke i couldn’t ’elp wondering ’ow them three ’ad got on and just as i was thinking about it there came the worst ringing at the gatebell i ’ave ever ’eard in my life and the noise of heavy boots kicking the gate it was so violent i ’ardly liked to go at fust thinking it might be bad news but i opened it at last and in bust sam small with ginger and peter  for five minutes they all talked at once with their nasty fists ’eld under my nose i couldn’t make lead or tail of it at fust and then i found as ’ow they ’ad got the dog back with them and that the landlord ’ad said ’e wasn’t the one  but ’e said as he thought the collar was his ses sam ’ow do you account for that  p’r’aps he made a mistake i ses or p’r’aps he thought you’d turn the dog adrift and he’d get it back for nothing you know wot landlords are try ’im agin  you take ’im back tomorrow night i ses it’s a nice walk to bow and then come back and beg my pardon i want to ’ave a word with this policeman here goodnight     the weaker vessel     mr gribble sat in his small front parlour in a state of angry amazement it was halfpast six and there was no mrs gribble worse still there was no tea it was a state of things that had only happened once before that was three weeks after marriage and on that occasion mr gribble had put his foot down with a bang that had echoed down the corridors of thirty years  the fire in the little kitchen was out and the untidy remains of mrs gribble’s midday meal still disgraced the table more and more dazed the indignant husband could only come to the conclusion that she had gone out and been run over other things might possibly account for her behaviour that was the only one that would excuse it  his meditations were interrupted by the sound of a key in the front door and a second later a small anxious figure entered the room and leaning against the table strove to get its breath the process was not helped by the alarming distension of mr gribble’s figure  i—i got home—quick as i could—henry said mrs gribble panting  where is my tea demanded her husband what do you mean by it the fire’s out and the kitchen is just as you left it  i—i’ve been to a lawyer’s henry said mrs gribble and i had to wait  lawyer’s repeated her husband  i got a letter this afternoon telling me to call poor uncle george that went to america is gone  that is no excuse for neglecting me said mr gribble of course people die when they are old is that the one that got on and made money  his wife apparently struggling to repress a little excitement nodded he—he’s left me two hundred pounds a year for life henry she said dabbing at her pale blue eyes with a handkerchief they’re going to pay it monthly sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a month that’s how he left it  two hund— began mr gribble forgetting himself two hun——go and get my tea if you think you’re going to give yourself airs because your uncle’s left you money you won’t do it in my house  he took a chair by the window and while his wife busied herself in the kitchen sat gazing in blank delight at the little street two hundred a year it was all he could do to resume his wonted expression as his wife reentered the room and began to lay the table his manner however when she let a cup and saucer slip from her trembling fingers to smash on the floor left nothing to be desired  it’s nice to have money come to us in our old age said mrs gribble timidly as they sat at tea it takes a load off my mind  old age said her husband disagreeably what d’ye mean by old age i’m fiftytwo and feel as young as ever i did  you look as young as ever you did said the docile mrs gribble i can’t see no change in you at least not to speak of  not so much talk said her husband when i want your opinion of my looks i’ll ask you for it when do you start getting this money  tuesday week first of may replied his wife the lawyers are going to send it by registered letter  mr gribble grunted  i shall be sorry to leave the house for some things said his wife looking round we’ve been here a good many years now henry  leave the house repeated mr gribble putting down his teacup and staring at her  leave the house what are you talking about  but we can’t stay here henry faltered mrs gribble not with all that money they are building some beautiful houses in charlton grove now—bathroom tiled hearths and beautiful stained glass in the front door and all for twentyeight pounds a year  wonderful said the other with a mocking glint in his eye  and iron palings to the front garden painted chocolatecolour picked out with blue continued his wife eyeing him wistfully  mr gribble struck the table a blow with his fist this house is good enough for me he roared and what’s good enough for me is good enough for you you want to waste money on show that’s what you want stained glass and bowwindows you want a bowwindow to loll about in do you shouldn’t wonder if you don’t want a servantgal to do the work  mrs gribble flushed guiltily and caught her breath  we’re going to live as we’ve always lived pursued mr gribble money ain’t going to spoil me i ain’t going to put on no side just because i’ve come in for a little bit if you had your way we should end up in the workhouse  he filled his pipe and smoked thoughtfully while mrs gribble cleared away the teathings and washed up pictures good to look upon formed in the smokepictures of a hale hearty man walking along the primrose path arminarm with two hundred a year of the mahogany and plush of the saloon bar at the grafton arms of sunday jaunts and the oval on summer afternoons  he ate his breakfast slowly on the first of the month and the meal finished took a seat in the window with his pipe and waited for the postman mrs gribble’s timid reminders concerning the flight of time and consequent fines for lateness at work fell on deaf ears he jumped up suddenly and met the postman at the door  has it come inquired mrs gribble extending her hand  by way of reply her husband tore open the envelope and handing her the covering letter counted the notes and coin and placed them slowly in his pockets then as mrs gribble looked at him he looked at the clock and snatching up his hat set off down the road  he was late home that evening and his manner forbade conversation mrs gribble with the bereaved air of one who has sustained an irremediable loss sighed fitfully and once applied her handkerchief to her eyes  that’s no good said her husband at last that won’t bring him back  bring who back inquired mrs gribble in genuine surprise  why your uncle george said mr gribble that’s what you’re turning on the watercart for ain’t it  i wasn’t thinking of him said mrs gribble trying to speak bravely i was thinking of——  well you ought to be interrupted her husband he wasn’t my uncle poor chap but i’ve been thinking of him off and on all day that bloaterpaste you are eating now came from his kindness i brought it home as a treat  i was thinking of my clothes said mrs gribble clenching her hands together under the table when i found i had come in for that money the first thing i thought was that i should be able to have a decent dress my old ones are quite worn out and as for my hat and jacket—  go on said her husband fiercely go on that’s just what i said trust you with money and we should be poorer than ever  i’m ashamed to be seen out said mrs gribble  a woman’s place is the home said mr gribble and so long as i’m satisfied with your appearance nobody else matters so long as i am pleased that’s everything what do you want to go dressing yourself up for nothing looks worse than an overdressed woman  what are we going to do with all that money then inquired mrs gribble in trembling tones  that’ll do said mr gribble decidedly that’ll do one o’ these days you’ll go too far you start throwing that money in my teeth and see what happens i’ve done my best for you all these years and there’s no reason to suppose i sha’n’t go on doing so what did you say what  mrs gribble turned to him a face rendered ghastly by terror i—i said—it was my money she stammered  mr gribble rose and stood for a full minute regarding her then kicking a chair out of his way he took his hat from its peg in the passage and with a bang of the streetdoor that sent a current of fresh sweet air circulating through the house strode off to the grafton arms  it was past eleven when he returned but even the spectacle of his wife laboriously darning her old dress failed to reduce his goodhumour in the slightest degree in a frivolous mood he even took a feather from the dismembered hat on the table and stuck it in his hair he took the stump of a strong cigar from his lips and exhaling a final cloud of smoke tossed it into the fireplace  uncle george dead he said at last shaking his head hadn’t pleasure acquaintance but good man good man  he shook his head again and gazed mistily at his wife  he was a teetotaller she remarked casually  he was teetoiler repeated mr gribble regarding her equably good man uncle george deadteetoller  mrs gribble gathered up her work and began to put it away  bedtime said mr gribble and led the way upstairs singing  his goodhumour had evaporated by the morning and having made a light breakfast of five cups of tea he went off with lagging steps to work it was a beautiful spring morning and the idea of a man with two hundred a year and a headache going off to a warehouse instead of a day’s outing seemed to border upon the absurd what use was money without freedom his toil was sweetened that day by the knowledge that he could drop it any time he liked and walk out a free man into the sunlight  by the end of a week his mind was made up each day that passed made his hurried uprising and scrambled breakfast more and more irksome and on monday morning with hands in trouserpockets and legs stretched out he leaned back in his chair and received his wife’s alarming intimations as to the flight of time with a superior and sphinxlike smile  it’s too fine to go to work today he said lazily come to that any day is too fine to waste at work  mrs gribble sat gasping at him  so on saturday i gave ’em a week’s notice continued her husband and after potts and co had listened while i told ’em what i thought of ’em they said they’d do without the week’s notice  you’ve never given up your job said mrs gribble  i spoke to old potts as one gentleman of independent means to another said mr gribble smiling thirtyfive bob a week after twenty years’ service and he had the cheek to tell me i wasn’t worth that when i told him what he was worth he talked about sending for the police what are you looking like that for i’ve worked hard for you for thirty years and i’ve had enough of it now it’s your turn  you’d find it hard to get another place at your age said his wife especially if they wouldn’t give you a good character  place said the other staring place i tell you i’ve done with work for a man o’ my means to go on working for thirtyfive bob a week is ridiculous  but suppose anything happened to me said his wife in a troubled voice  that’s not very likely said mr gribble  you’re tough enough and if it did your money would come to me  mrs gribble shook her head  what roared her husband jumping up  i’ve only got it for life henry as i told you said mrs gribble in alarm i thought you knew it would stop when i died  and what’s to become of me if anything happens to you then demanded the dismayed mr gribble what am i to do  mrs gribble put her handkerchief to her eyes  and don’t start weakening your constitution by crying shouted the incensed husband  what are you mumbling  i sa—sa—said let’s hope—you’ll go first sobbed his wife then it will be all right  mr gribble opened his mouth and then realizing the inadequacy of the english language for moments of stress closed it again he broke his silence at last in favour of uncle george  mind you he said concluding a peroration which his wife listened to with her fingers in her ears—mind you i reckon i’ve been absolutely done by you and your precious uncle george i’ve given up a good situation and now any time you fancy to go off the hooks i’m to be turned into the street  i’ll try and live for your sake henry said his wife  think of my worry every time you are ill pursued the indignant mr gribble  mrs gribble sighed and her husband after a few further remarks concerning uncle george his past and his future announced his intention of going to the lawyers and seeing whether anything could be done he came back in a state of voiceless gloom and spent the rest of a beautiful day indoors smoking a pipe which had lost much of its flavour and regarding with a critical and anxious eye the small weedy figure of his wife as she went about her work  the second month’s payment went into his pocket as a matter of course but on this occasion mrs gribble made no requests for new clothes or change of residence a little nervous cough was her sole comment  got a cold inquired her husband starting  i don’t think so replied his wife and surprised and touched at this unusual display of interest coughed again  is it your throat or your chest he inquired gruffly  mrs gribble coughed again to see after five coughs she said she thought it was her chest  you’d better not go out o’ doors today then said mr gribble don’t stand about in draughts and i’ll fetch you in a bottle of cough mixture when i go out what about a laydown on the sofa  his wife thanked him and reaching the sofa watched with halfclosed eyes as he cleared the breakfasttable it was the first time he had done such a thing in his life and a little honest pride in the possession of such a cough would not be denied dim possibilities of its vast usefulness suddenly occurred to her  she took the cough mixture for a week by which time other symptoms extremely disquieting to an easeloving man had manifested themselves going upstairs deprived her of breath carrying a loaded teatray produced a long and alarming stitch in the side the last time she ever filled the coalscuttle she was discovered sitting beside it on the floor in a state of collapse  you’d better go and see the doctor said mr gribble  mrs gribble went years before the doctor had told her that she ought to take life easier and she was now able to tell him she was prepared to take his advice  and you see i must take care of myself now for the sake of my husband she said after she had explained matters  i understand said the doctor  if anything happened to me— began the patient  nothing shall happen said the other stay in bed tomorrow morning and i’ll come round and overhaul you  mrs gribble hesitated you might examine me and think i was all right she objected and at the same time you wouldn’t know how i feel  i know just how you feel was the reply goodbye  he came round the following morning and following the dejected mr gribble upstairs made a long and thorough investigation of his patient  say ’ninetynine’ he said adjusting his stethoscope  mrs gribble ticked off ninetynines until her husband’s ears ached with them the doctor finished at last and fastening his bag stood with his beard in his hand pondering he looked from the little whitefaced woman on the bed to the bulky figure of mr gribble  you had better lie up for a week he said decidedly the rest will do you good  nothing serious i s’pose said mr gribble as he led the way downstairs to the small parlour  she ought to be all right with care was the reply  care repeated the other distastefully what’s the matter with her  she’s not very strong said the doctor and hearts don’t improve with age you know under favourable conditions she’s good for some years yet the great thing is never to thwart her let her have her own way in everything  own way in everything repeated the dumbfounded mr gribble  the doctor nodded never let her worry about anything he continued and above all never find fault with her  not said mr gribble thickly—not even for her own good  unless you want to run the risk of losing her  mr gribble shivered  let her have an easy time said the doctor taking up his hat pamper her a bit if you like it won’t hurt her above all don’t let that heart of hers get excited  he shook hands with the petrified mr gribble and went off grinning wickedly he had few favourites and mr gribble was not one of them  for two days the devoted husband did the housework and waited on the invalid then he wearied and at his wife’s suggestion a small girl was engaged as servant she did most of the nursing as well and having a great love for the sensational took a grave view of her mistress’s condition  it was a relief to mr gribble when his wife came downstairs again and he was cheered to see that she looked much better his satisfaction was so marked that it brought on her cough again  it’s this house i think she said with a resigned smile it never did agree with me  well you’ve lived in it a good many years said her husband controlling himself with difficulty  it’s rather dark and small said mrs gribble not but what it is good enough for me and i dare say it will last my time  nonsense said her husband gruffly you want to get out a bit more you’ve got nothing to do now we are wasting all this money on a servant why don’t you go out for little walks  mrs gribble went after several promptings and the fruit of one of them was handed by the postman to mr gribble a few days afterwards halfchoking with wrath and astonishment he stood over his trembling wife with the first draper’s bill he had ever received  one pound two shillings and threepence threefarthings he recited it must be a mistake it must be for somebody else  mrs gribble with her hand to her heart tottered to the sofa and lay there with her eyes closed  i had to get some dress material she said in a quavering voice you want me to go out and i’m so shabby i’m ashamed to be seen  mr gribble made muffled noises in his throat then afraid to trust himself he went into the backyard and taking a seat on an upturned bucket sat with his head in his hands peering into the future  the dressmaker’s bill and a bill for a new hat came after the next monthly payment and a bill for shoes came a week later hoping much from the wellknown curative effects of fine feathers he managed to treat the affair with dignified silence the only time he allowed full play to his feelings mrs gribble took to her bed for two days and the doctor had a hearttoheart talk with him on the doorstep  it was a matter of great annoyance to him that his wife still continued to attribute her illhealth to the smallness and darkness of the house and the fact that there were only two of the houses in charlton grove left caused a marked depression of spirits it was clear that she was fretting the small servant went further and said that she was fading away  they moved at the september quarter and a slight but temporary improvement in mrs gribble’s health took place her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkled over new curtains and new linoleum the tiled hearths and stained glass in the front door filled her with a deep and solemn thankfulness the only thing that disturbed her was the fact that mr gribble to avoid wasting money over necessaries contrived to spend an unduly large portion on personal luxuries  we ought to have some new things for the kitchen she said one day  no money said mr gribble laconically  and a mat for the bathroom  mr gribble got up and went out  she had to go to him for everything two hundred a year and not a penny she could call her own she consulted her heart and that faithful organ responded with a bound that set her nerves quivering if she could only screw her courage to the stickingpoint the question would be settled for once and all  white and trembling she sat at breakfast on the first of november waiting for the postman while the unconscious mr gribble went on with his meal the doubleknocks down the road came nearer and nearer and mr gribble wiping his mouth sat upright with an air of alert and pleased interest rapid steps came to the front door and a double bang followed  always punctual said mr gribble goodhumouredly  his wife made no reply but taking a bluecrossed envelope from the maid in her shaking fingers looked round for a knife her gaze encountered mr gribble’s outstretched hand  after you he said sharply  mrs gribble found the knife and hacking tremulously at the envelope peeped inside it and with her gaze fastened on the window fumbled for her pocket she was so pale and shook so much that the words died away on her husband’s lips  it is—all right gasped his wife  she put her hand to her throat and hardly able to believe in her victory sat struggling for breath before her grim and upright her husband sat a figure of helpless smouldering wrath  you might lose it he said at last i sha’n’t lose it said his wife  to avoid further argument she arose and went slowly upstairs through the doorway mr gribble saw her helping herself up by the banisters her left hand still at her throat then he heard her moving slowly about in the bedroom overhead  he took out his pipe and filled it mechanically and was just holding a match to the tobacco when he paused and gazed with a puzzled air at the ceiling blamed if it don’t sound like somebody dancing he growled     stepping backwards     wonderful improvement said mr jack mills show ’em to me again  mr simpson took his pipe from his mouth and parting his lips revealed his new teeth  and you talk better said mr mills taking his glass from the counter and emptying it you ain’t got that silly lisp you used to have what does your missis think of ’em  she hasn’t seen ’em yet said the other i had ’em put in at dinnertime i ate my dinner with ’em  mr mills expressed his admiration if it wasn’t for your white hair and whiskers you’d look thirty again he said slowly how old are you  fiftythree said his friend if it wasn’t for being laughed at i’ve often thought of having my whiskers shaved off and my hair dyed black people think i’m sixty  or seventy continued mr mills what does it matter people laughing you’ve got a splendid head of ’air and it would dye beautiful  mr simpson shook his head and ordering a couple of glasses of bitter attacked his in silence  it might be done gradual he said after a long interval it don’t do anybody good at the warehouse to look old  make a clean job of it counselled mr mills who was very fond of a little cheap excitement get it over and done with you’ve got good features and you’d look splendid cleanshaved mr simpson smiled faintly only on wednesday the barmaid here was asking after you pursued mr mills mr simpson smiled again she says to me ’where’s gran’pa’ she says and when i says haughty like ’who do you mean’ she says ’father christmas’ if you was to tell her that you are only fiftythree she’d laugh in your face  let her laugh said the other sourly  come out and get it off said mr mills earnestly there’s a barber’s in bird street you could go in the little back room where he charges a penny more and get it done without anybody being a bit the wiser  he put his hand on mr simpson’s shoulder and that gentleman with a glare in the direction of the fair but unconscious offender rose in a hypnotized fashion and followed him out twice on the way to bird street mr simpson paused and said he had altered his mind and twice did the propulsion of mr mills’s right hand and his flattering argument make him alter it again  it was a matter of relief to mr simpson that the barber took his instructions without any show of surprise it appeared indeed that an elderly man of seventyeight had enlisted his services for a similar purpose not two months before and had got married six weeks afterwards age of the bride given as twentyfour but said to have looked older  a snip of the scissors and six inches of white beard fell to the floor for the first time in thirty years mr simpson felt a razor on his face then his hair was cut and shampooed and an hour later he sat gazing at a darkhaired cleanshaven man in the glass who gazed back at him with wondering eyes—a leanjawed goodlooking man who in a favourable light might pass for forty he turned and met the admiring eyes of mr mills  what did i tell you inquired the latter you look young enough to be your own son  or grandson said the barber with professional pride  mr simpson got up slowly from the chair and accompanied by the admiring mr mills passed out into the street the evening was young and at his friend’s suggestion they returned to the plume of feathers  you give the order said mr mills and see whether she recognizes you  mr simpson obeyed  don’t you know him inquired mr mills as the barmaid turned away  i don’t think i have that pleasure said the girl simpering  gran’pa’s eldest boy said mr mills  oh said the girl well i hope he’s a better man than his father then  what do you mean by that demanded mr simpson painfully conscious of his friend’s regards  nothing said the girl nothing only we can all be better can’t we he’s a nice old gentleman so simple  don’t know you from adam said mr mills as she turned away now if you ask me i don’t believe as your own missis will recognize you  rubbish said mr simpson my wife would know me anywhere we’ve been married over thirty years thirty years of sunshine and shadow together you’re a single man and don’t understand these things  p’r’aps you’re right said his friend but it’ll be a bit of a shock to her anyway what do you say to me stepping round and breaking the news to her it’s a bit sudden you know she’s expecting a whitehaired old gentleman not a blackhaired boy  mr simpson looked a bit uneasy p’r’aps i ought to have told her first he murmured craning his neck to look in the glass at the back of the bar  i’ll go and put it right for you said his friend you stay here and smoke your pipe  he stepped out briskly but his pace slackened as he drew near the house  i—i—came—to see you about your husband he faltered as mrs simpson opened the door and stood regarding him  what’s the matter she exclaimed with a faint cry what’s happened to him  nothing said mr mills hastily nothing serious that is i just came round to warn you so that you will be able to know it’s him  mrs simpson let off a shriek that set his ears tingling then steadying herself by the wall she tottered into the front room followed by the discomfited mr mills and sank into a chair  he’s dead she sobbed he’s dead  he is not said mr mills  is he much hurt is he dying gasped mrs simpson  only his hair said mr mills clutching at the opening he is not hurt at all  mrs simpson dabbed at her eyesand sat regarding him in bewilderment her twin chins were still quivering with emotion but her eyes were beginning to harden what are you talking about she inquired in a raspy voice  he’s been to a hairdresser’s said mr mills he’s ’ad all his white whiskers cut off and his hair cut short and dyed black and what with that and his new teeth i thought—he thought—p’r’aps you mightn’t know him when he came home  dyed cried mrs simpson starting to her feet  mr mills nodded he looks twenty years younger he said with a smile he’d pass for his own son anywhere  mrs simpson’s eyes snapped perhaps he’d pass for my son she remarked  yes easy said the tactful mr mills you can’t think what a difference it’s made to him that’s why i came to see you—so you shouldn’t be startled  thank you said mrs simpson i’m much obliged but you might have spared yourself the trouble i should know my husband anywhere  ah that’s what you think retorted mr mills with a smile but the barmaid at the plume didn’t that’s what made me come to you  mrs simpson gazed at him  i says to myself continued mr mills ’if she don’t know him i’m certain his missis won’t and i’d better——’  you’d better go interrupted his hostess  mr mills started and then with much dignity stalked after her to the door  as to your story i don’t believe a word of it said mrs simpson whatever else my husband is he isn’t a fool and he’d no more think of cutting off his whiskers and dyeing his hair than you would of telling the truth  seeing is believing said the offended mr mills darkly  i’ll wait till i do see and then i sha’n’t believe was the reply it is a putup job between you and some other precious idiot i expect but you can’t deceive me if your blackhaired friend comes here he’ll get it i can tell you  she slammed the door on his protests and returning to the parlour gazed fiercely into the glass on the mantelpiece it reflected sixteen stone of honest english womanhood a thin wisp of yellowishgrey hair and a pair of faded eyes peering through clumsy spectacles  son indeed she said her lips quivering you wait till you come home my lord  mr simpson with some forebodings returned home an hour later to a man who loved peace and quietness the report of the indignant mr mills was not of a reassuring nature he hesitated on the doorstep for a few seconds while he fumbled for his key and then humming unconcernedly hung his hat in the passage and walked into the parlour  the astonished scream of his wife warned him that mr mills had by no means exaggerated she rose from her seat and crouching by the fireplace regarded him with a mixture of anger and dismay  it—it’s all right milly said mr simpson with a smile that revealed a dazzling set of teeth  who are you demanded mrs simpson how dare you call me by my christian name it’s a good job for you my husband is not here  he wouldn’t hurt me said mr simpson with an attempt at facetiousness he’s the best friend i ever had why we slept in the same cradle  i don’t want any of your nonsense said mrs simpson you get out of my house before i send for the police how dare you come into a respectable woman’s house in this fashion be off with you  now look here milly—— began mr simpson  his wife drew herself up to her full height of four feet eleven  i’ve had a haircut and a shave pursued her husband also i’ve had my hair restored to its natural colour but i’m the same man and you know it  i know nothing of the kind said his wife doggedly i don’t know you from adam i’ve never seen you before and i don’t want to see you again you go away  i’m your husband and my place is at home replied mr simpson a man can have a shave if he likes can’t he where’s my supper  go on said his wife keep it up but be careful my husband don’t come in and catch you that’s all  mr simpson gazed at her fixedly and then with an impatient exclamation walked into the small kitchen and began to set the supper a joint of cold beef a jar of pickles bread butter and cheese made an appetizing display then he took a jug from the dresser and descended to the cellar  a musical trickling fell on the ear of mrs simpson as she stood at the parlour door and drew her stealthily to the cellar the key was in the lock and with a sudden movement she closed the door and locked it a sharp cry from mr simpson testified to his discomfiture  now i’m off for the police cried his wife  don’t be a fool shouted mr simpson tugging wildly at the doorhandle open the door  mrs simpson remained silent and her husband resumed his efforts until the doorknob unused to such treatment came off in his hand a sudden scrambling noise on the cellar stairs satisfied the listener that he had not pulled it off intentionally  she stood for a few moments considering it was a stout door and opened inwards she took her bonnet from its nail in the kitchen and walking softly to the streetdoor set off to lay the case before a brother who lived a few doors away  poor old bill said mr cooper when she had finished still it might be worse he’s got the barrel o’ beer with him  it’s not bill said mrs simpson  mr cooper scratched his whiskers and looked at his wife  she ought to know said the latter we’ll come and have a look at him said mr cooper  mrs simpson pondered and eyed him dubiously  come in and have a bit of supper she said at last there’s a nice piece of beef and pickles  and bill—i mean the stranger—sitting on the beerbarrel said mr cooper gloomily  you can bring your beer with you said his sister sharply come along  mr cooper grinned and placing a couple of bottles in his coat pockets followed the two ladies to the house seated at the kitchen table he grinned again as a persistent drumming took place on the cellar door his wife smiled and a faint sour attempt in the same direction appeared on the face of mrs simpson  open the door bellowed an indignant voice open the door  mrs simpson commanding silence with an uplifted finger proceeded to carve the beef a rattle of knives and forks succeeded  openthedoor said the voice again  not so much noise commanded mr cooper i can’t hear myself eat  bob said the voice in relieved accents bob come and let me out  mr cooper putting a huge hand over his mouth struggled nobly with his feelings  who are you calling ’bob’ he demanded in an unsteady voice you keep yourself to yourself i’ve heard all about you you’ve got to stay there till my brotherinlaw comes home  it’s me bob said mr simpson—bill  yes i dare say said mr cooper but if you’re bill why haven’t you got bill’s voice  let me out and look at me said mr simpson  there was a faint scream from both ladies followed by protests  don’t be alarmed said mr cooper reassuringly i wasn’t born yesterday i don’t want to get a crack over the head  it’s all a mistake bob said the prisoner appealingly i just had a shave and a haircut and—and a little hairdye if you open the door you’ll know me at once  how would it be said mr cooper turning to his sister and speaking with unusual distinctness—how would it be if you opened the door and just as he put his head out i hit it a crack with the poker  you try it on said the voice behind the door hotly you know who i am well enough bob cooper i don’t want any more of your nonsense milly has put you up to this  if your wife don’t know you how do you think i can said mr cooper now look here you keep quiet till my brotherinlaw comes home if he don’t come home perhaps we shall be more likely to think you’re him if he’s not home by tomorrow morning we—hsh hsh don’t you know there’s ladies present  that settles it said mrs cooper speaking for the first time my brotherinlaw would never talk like that  i should never forgive him if he did said her husband piously  he poured himself out another glass of beer and resumed his supper with relish conversation turned on the weather and from that to the price of potatoes frantic efforts on the part of the prisoner to join in the conversation and give it a more personal turn were disregarded finally he began to kick with monotonous persistency on the door  stop it shouted mr cooper  i won’t said mr simpson  the noise became unendurable mr cooper who had just lit his pipe laid it on the table and looked round at his companions  he’ll have the door down soon he said rising halloa there  halloa said the other  you say you’re bill simpson said mr cooper holding up a forefinger at mrs simpson who was about to interrupt if you are tell us something you know that only you could know something we know so as to identify you things about your past  a strange noise sounded behind the door  sounds as though he is smacking his lips said mrs cooper to her sisterinlaw who was eyeing mr cooper restlessly  very good said mr simpson i agree who is there  me and my wife and mrs simpson said mr cooper  he is smacking his lips whispered mrs cooper having a go at the beer perhaps  let’s go back fifteen years said mr simpson in meditative tones do you remember that girl with coppercoloured hair that used to live in john street  no said mr cooper loudly and suddenly  do you remember coming to me one day—two days after valentine day it was—white as chalk and shaking like a leaf and—  no roared mr cooper  very well i must try something else then said mr simpson philosophically carry your mind back ten years bob cooper—  look here said mr cooper turning round with a ghastly smile we’d better get off home mary i don’t like interfering in other people’s concerns never did  you stay where you are said his wife  ten years repeated the voice behind the door there was a new barmaid at the crown and one night you——  if i listen to any more of this nonsense i shall burst remarked mr cooper plaintively  go on prompted mrs cooper grimly one night——  never mind said mr simpson it doesn’t matter but does he identify me because if not i’ve got a lot more things i can try  the harassed mr cooper looked around appealingly  how do you expect me to recognize you— he began and stopped suddenly  go back to your courting days then said mr simpson when mrs cooper wasn’t mrs cooper but only wanted to be  mrs cooper shivered so did mr cooper  and you came round to me for advice pursued mr simpson in reminiscent accents because there was another girl you wasn’t sure of and you didn’t want to lose them both do you remember sitting with the two photographs—one on each knee—and trying to make up your mind  wonderful imagination said mr cooper smiling in a ghastly fashion at his wife hark at him  i am harking said mrs cooper  am i bill simpson or am i not demanded mr simpson  bill was always fond of his joke said mr cooper with a glance at the company that would have moved an oyster he was always fond of making up things you’re like him in that what do you think milly  it’s not my husband said mrs simpson  tell us something about her said mr cooper hastily  i daren’t said mr simpson doesn’t that prove i’m her husband but i’ll tell you things about your wife if you like  you dare said mrs cooper turning crimson as she realized what confidences might have passed between husband and wife if you say a word of your lies about me i don’t know what i won’t do to you  very well i must go on about bob then—till he recognizes me said mr simpson patiently carry your mind—  open the door and let him out shouted mr cooper turning to his sister how can i recognize a man through a deal door  mrs simpson after a little hesitation handed him the key and the next moment her husband stepped out and stood blinking in the gaslight  do you recognize me he asked turning to mr cooper  i do said that gentleman with a ferocious growl  i’d know you anywhere said mrs cooper with emphasis  and you said mr simpson turning to his wife  you’re not my husband she said obstinately  are you sure inquired mr cooper  certain  very good then said her brother if he’s not your husband i’m going to knock his head off for telling them lies about me  he sprang forward and catching mr simpson by the collar shook him violently until his head banged against the dresser the next moment the hands of mrs simpson were in the hair of mr cooper  how dare you knock my husband about she screamed as mr cooper let go and caught her fingers you’ve hurt him  concussion i think said mr simpson with great presence of mind  his wife helped him to a chair and wetting her handkerchief at the tap tenderly bathed the dyed head mr cooper breathing hard stood by watching until his wife touched him on the arm  you come off home she said in a hard voice you ain’t wanted are you going to stay here all night  i should like to said mr cooper wistfully     the three sisters     thirty years ago on a wet autumn evening the household of mallett’s lodge was gathered round the deathbed of ursula mallow the eldest of the three sisters who inhabited it the dingy motheaten curtains of the old wooden bedstead were drawn apart the light of a smoking oillamp falling upon the hopeless countenance of the dying woman as she turned her dull eyes upon her sisters the room was in silence except for an occasional sob from the youngest sister eunice outside the rain fell steadily over the steaming marshes  nothing is to be changed tabitha gasped ursula to the other sister who bore a striking likeness to her although her expression was harder and colder this room is to be locked up and never opened  very well said tabitha brusquely though i don’t see how it can matter to you then  it does matter said her sister with startling energy how do you know how do i know that i may not sometimes visit it i have lived in this house so long i am certain that i shall see it again i will come back come back to watch over you both and see that no harm befalls you  you are talking wildly said tabitha by no means moved at her sister’s solicitude for her welfare your mind is wandering you know that i have no faith in such things  ursula sighed and beckoning to eunice who was weeping silently at the bedside placed her feeble arms around her neck and kissed her  do not weep dear she said feebly perhaps it is best so a lonely woman’s life is scarce worth living we have no hopes no aspirations other women have had happy husbands and children but we in this forgotten place have grown old together i go first but you must soon follow  tabitha comfortably conscious of only forty years and an iron frame shrugged her shoulders and smiled grimly  i go first repeated ursula in a new and strange voice as her heavy eyes slowly closed but i will come for each of you in turn when your lease of life runs out at that moment i will be with you to lead your steps whither i now go  as she spoke the flickering lamp went out suddenly as though extinguished by a rapid hand and the room was left in utter darkness a strange suffocating noise issued from the bed and when the trembling women had relighted the lamp all that was left of ursula mallow was ready for the grave  that night the survivors passed together the dead woman had been a firm believer in the existence of that shadowy borderland which is said to form an unhallowed link between the living and the dead and even the stolid tabitha slightly unnerved by the events of the night was not free from certain apprehensions that she might have been right  with the bright morning their fears disappeared the sun stole in at the window and seeing the poor earthworn face on the pillow so touched it and glorified it that only its goodness and weakness were seen and the beholders came to wonder how they could ever have felt any dread of aught so calm and peaceful a day or two passed and the body was transferred to a massive coffin long regarded as the finest piece of work of its kind ever turned out of the village carpenter’s workshop then a slow and melancholy cortege headed by four bearers wound its solemn way across the marshes to the family vault in the grey old church and all that was left of ursula was placed by the father and mother who had taken that selfsame journey some thirty years before  to eunice as they toiled slowly home the day seemed strange and sabbathlike the flat prospect of marsh wilder and more forlorn than usual the roar of the sea more depressing tabitha had no such fancies the bulk of the dead woman’s property had been left to eunice and her avaricious soul was sorely troubled and her proper sisterly feelings of regret for the deceased sadly interfered with in consequence  what are you going to do with all that money eunice she asked as they sat at their quiet tea  i shall leave it as it stands said eunice slowly we have both got sufficient to live upon and i shall devote the income from it to supporting some beds in a children’s hospital  if ursula had wished it to go to a hospital said tabitha in her deep tones she would have left the money to it herself i wonder you do not respect her wishes more  what else can i do with it then inquired eunice  save it said the other with gleaming eyes save it  eunice shook her head  no said she it shall go to the sick children but the principal i will not touch and if i die before you it shall become yours and you can do what you like with it  very well said tabitha smothering her anger by a strong effort i don’t believe that was what ursula meant you to do with it and i don’t believe she will rest quietly in the grave while you squander the money she stored so carefully  what do you mean asked eunice with pale lips you are trying to frighten me i thought that you did not believe in such things  tabitha made no answer and to avoid the anxious inquiring gaze of her sister drew her chair to the fire and folding her gaunt arms composed herself for a nap  for some time life went on quietly in the old house the room of the dead woman in accordance with her last desire was kept firmly locked its dirty windows forming a strange contrast to the prim cleanliness of the others tabitha never very talkative became more taciturn than ever and stalked about the house and the neglected garden like an unquiet spirit her brow roughened into the deep wrinkles suggestive of much thought as the winter came on bringing with it the long dark evenings the old house became more lonely than ever and an air of mystery and dread seemed to hang over it and brood in its empty rooms and dark corridors the deep silence of night was broken by strange noises for which neither the wind nor the rats could be held accountable old martha seated in her distant kitchen heard strange sounds upon the stairs and once upon hurrying to them fancied that she saw a dark figure squatting upon the landing though a subsequent search with candle and spectacles failed to discover anything eunice was disturbed by several vague incidents and as she suffered from a complaint of the heart rendered very ill by them even tabitha admitted a strangeness about the house but confident in her piety and virtue took no heed of it her mind being fully employed in another direction  since the death of her sister all restraint upon her was removed and she yielded herself up entirely to the stern and hard rules enforced by avarice upon its devotees her housekeeping expenses were kept rigidly separate from those of eunice and her food limited to the coarsest dishes while in the matter of clothes the old servant was by far the better dressed seated alone in her bedroom this uncouth hardfeatured creature revelled in her possessions grudging even the expense of the candleend which enabled her to behold them so completely did this passion change her that both eunice and martha became afraid of her and lay awake in their beds night after night trembling at the chinking of the coins at her unholy vigils  one day eunice ventured to remonstrate why don’t you bank your money tabitha she said it is surely not safe to keep such large sums in such a lonely house  large sums repeated the exasperated tabitha large sums what nonsense is this you know well that i have barely sufficient to keep me  it’s a great temptation to housebreakers said her sister not pressing the point i made sure last night that i heard somebody in the house  did you said tabitha grasping her arm a horrible look on her face so did i i thought they went to ursula’s room and i got out of bed and went on the stairs to listen  well said eunice faintly fascinated by the look on her sister’s face  there was something there said tabitha slowly i’ll swear it for i stood on the landing by her door and listened something scuffling on the floor round and round the room at first i thought it was the cat but when i went up there this morning the door was still locked and the cat was in the kitchen  oh let us leave this dreadful house moaned eunice  what said her sister grimly afraid of poor ursula why should you be your own sister who nursed you when you were a babe and who perhaps even now comes and watches over your slumbers  oh said eunice pressing her hand to her side if i saw her i should die i should think that she had come for me as she said she would o god have mercy on me i am dying  she reeled as she spoke and before tabitha could save her sank senseless to the floor  get some water cried tabitha as old martha came hurrying up the stairs eunice has fainted  the old woman with a timid glance at her retired reappearing shortly afterwards with the water with which she proceeded to restore her muchloved mistress to her senses tabitha as soon as this was accomplished stalked off to her room leaving her sister and martha sitting drearily enough in the small parlour watching the fire and conversing in whispers  it was clear to the old servant that this state of things could not last much longer and she repeatedly urged her mistress to leave a house so lonely and so mysterious to her great delight eunice at length consented despite the fierce opposition of her sister and at the mere idea of leaving gained greatly in health and spirits a small but comfortable house was hired in morville and arrangements made for a speedy change  it was the last night in the old house and all the wild spirits of the marshes the wind and the sea seemed to have joined forces for one supreme effort when the wind dropped as it did at brief intervals the sea was heard moaning on the distant beach strangely mingled with the desolate warning of the bellbuoy as it rocked to the waves then the wind rose again and the noise of the sea was lost in the fierce gusts which finding no obstacle on the open marshes swept with their full fury upon the house by the creek the strange voices of the air shrieked in its chimneys windows rattled doors slammed and even the very curtains seemed to live and move  eunice was in bed awake a small nightlight in a saucer of oil shed a sickly glare upon the wormeaten old furniture distorting the most innocent articles into ghastly shapes a wilder gust than usual almost deprived her of the protection afforded by that poor light and she lay listening fearfully to the creakings and other noises on the stairs bitterly regretting that she had not asked martha to sleep with her but it was not too late even now she slipped hastily to the floor crossed to the huge wardrobe and was in the very act of taking her dressinggown from its peg when an unmistakable footfall was heard on the stairs the robe dropped from her shaking fingers and with a quickly beating heart she regained her bed  the sounds ceased and a deep silence followed which she herself was unable to break although she strove hard to do so a wild gust of wind shook the windows and nearly extinguished the light and when its flame had regained its accustomed steadiness she saw that the door was slowly opening while the huge shadow of a hand blotted the papered wall still her tongue refused its office the door flew open with a crash a cloaked figure entered and throwing aside its coverings she saw with a horror past all expression the napkinbound face of the dead ursula smiling terribly at her in her last extremity she raised her faded eyes above for succour and then as the figure noiselessly advanced and laid its cold hand upon her brow the soul of eunice mallow left its body with a wild shriek and made its way to the eternal  martha roused by the cry and shivering with dread rushed to the door and gazed in terror at the figure which stood leaning over the bedside as she watched it slowly removed the cowl and the napkin and exposed the fell face of tabitha so strangely contorted between fear and triumph that she hardly recognized it  who’s there cried tabitha in a terrible voice as she saw the old woman’s shadow on the wall  i thought i heard a cry said martha entering did anybody call  yes eunice said the other regarding her closely i too heard the cry and hurried to her what makes her so strange is she in a trance  ay said the old woman falling on her knees by the bed and sobbing bitterly the trance of death ah my dear my poor lonely girl that this should be the end of it she has died of fright said the old woman pointing to the eyes which even yet retained their horror she has seen something devilish  tabitha’s gaze fell she has always suffered with her heart she muttered the night has frightened her it frightened me  she stood upright by the foot of the bed as martha drew the sheet over the face of the dead woman  first ursula then eunice said tabitha drawing a deep breath i can’t stay here i’ll dress and wait for the morning  she left the room as she spoke and with bent head proceeded to her own martha remained by the bedside and gently closing the staring eyes fell on her knees and prayed long and earnestly for the departed soul overcome with grief and fear she remained with bowed head until a sudden sharp cry from tabitha brought her to her feet  well said the old woman going to the door  where are you cried tabitha somewhat reassured by her voice  in miss eunice’s bedroom do you want anything  come down at once quick i am unwell  her voice rose suddenly to a scream quick for god’s sake quick or i shall go mad there is some strange woman in the house  the old woman stumbled hastily down the dark stairs what is the matter she cried entering the room who is it what do you mean  i saw it said tabitha grasping her convulsively by the shoulder i was coming to you when i saw the figure of a woman in front of me going up the stairs is it—can it be ursula come for the soul of eunice as she said she would  or for yours said martha the words coming from her in some odd fashion despite herself  tabitha with a ghastly look fell cowering by her side clutching tremulously at her clothes light the lamps she cried hysterically light a fire make a noise oh this dreadful darkness will it never be day  soon soon said martha overcoming her repugnance and trying to pacify her when the day comes you will laugh at these fears  i murdered her screamed the miserable woman i killed her with fright why did she not give me the money ’twas no use to her ah look there  martha with a horrible fear followed her glance to the door but saw nothing  it’s ursula said tabitha from between her teeth keep her off keep her off  the old woman who by some unknown sense seemed to feel the presence of a third person in the room moved a step forward and stood before her as she did so tabitha waved her arms as though to free herself from the touch of a detaining hand half rose to her feet and without a word fell dead before her  at this the old woman’s courage forsook her and with a great cry she rushed from the room eager to escape from this house of death and mystery the bolts of the great door were stiff with age and strange voices seemed to ring in her ears as she strove wildly to unfasten them her brain whirled she thought that the dead in their distant rooms called to her and that a devil stood on the step outside laughing and holding the door against her then with a supreme effort she flung it open and heedless of her nightclothes passed into the bitter night the path across the marshes was lost in the darkness but she found it the planks over the ditches slippery and narrow but she crossed them in safety until at last her feet bleeding and her breath coming in great gasps she entered the village and sank down more dead than alive on a cottage doorstep     the unknown     handsome is as ’andsome does  said the nightwatchman it’s an old saying but it’s true give a chap good looks and it’s precious little else that is given to ’im he’s lucky when ’is good looks ’ave gorn—or partly gorn—to get a berth as nightwatchman or some other hard and badpaid job  one drawback to a goodlooking man is that he generally marries young not because ’e wants to but because somebody else wants ’im to and that ain’t the worst of it the handsomest chap i ever knew married five times and got seven years for it it wasn’t his fault pore chap he simply couldn’t say no  one o’ the bestlooking men i ever knew was cap’n bill smithers wot used to come up here once a week with a schooner called the wild rose funny thing about ’im was he didn’t seem to know about ’is good looks and he was one o’ the quietest bestbehaved men that ever came up the london river considering that he was mistook for me more than once it was just as well  he didn’t marry until ’e was close on forty and then ’e made the mistake of marrying a widderwoman she was like all the rest of ’em—only worse afore she was married butter wouldn’t melt in ’er mouth but as soon as she ’ad got her lines safe she began to make up for it  for the fust month or two ’e didn’t mind it ’e rather liked being fussed arter but when he found that he couldn’t go out for arf an hour without having ’er with ’im he began to get tired of it her idea was that ’e was too handsome to be trusted out alone and every trip he made ’e had to write up in a book day by day wot ’e did with himself even then she wasn’t satisfied and arter saying that a wife’s place was by the side of ’er husband she took to sailing with ’im every v’y’ge  wot he could ha’ seen in ’er i don’t know i asked ’im one evening—in a roundabout way—and he answered in such a long roundabout way that i didn’t know wot to make of it till i see that she was standing just behind me listening arter that i heard ’er asking questions about me but i didn’t ’ave to listen i could hear ’er twenty yards away and singing to myself at the same time  arter that she treated me as if i was the dirt beneath ’er feet she never spoke to me but used to speak against me to other people she was always talking to them about the sleepingsickness and things o’ that kind she said nightwatchmen always made ’er think of it somehow but she didn’t know why and she couldn’t tell you if you was to ask her the only thing i was thankful for was that i wasn’t ’er husband she stuck to ’im like his shadow and i began to think at last it was a pity she ’adn’t got some thing to be jealous about and something to occupy her mind with instead o’ me  she ought to ’ave a lesson i ses to the skipper one evening are you going to be follered about like this all your life if she was made to see the foolishness of ’er ways she might get sick of it  my idea was to send her on a wildgoose chase and while the wild rose was away i thought it out i wrote a loveletter to the skipper signed with the name of dorothy and asked ’im to meet me at cleopatra’s needle on the embankment at eight o’clock on wednesday i told ’im to look out for a tall girl mrs smithers was as short as they make ’em with mischievous brown eyes in a blue ’at with red roses on it  i read it over careful and arter marking it private twice in front and once on the back i stuck it down so that it could be blown open a’most and waited for the schooner to come back then i gave a vanboy twopence to ’and it to mrs smithers wot was sitting on the deck alone and tell ’er it was a letter for captain smithers  i was busy with a barge wot happened to be handy at the time but i ’eard her say that she would take it and give it to ’im when i peeped round she ’ad got the letter open and was leaning over the side to wind’ard trying to get ’er breath every now and then she’d give another look at the letter and open ’er mouth and gasp but by and by she got calmer and arter putting it back in the envelope she gave it a lick as though she was going to bite it and stuck it down agin then she went off the wharf and i’m blest if five minutes arterwards a young fellow didn’t come down to the ship with the same letter and ask for the skipper  who gave it you ses the skipper as soon as ’e could speak  a lady ses the young fellow  the skipper waved ’im away and then ’e walked up and down the deck like a man in a dream  bad news i ses looking up and catching ’is eye  no he ses no only a note about a couple o’ casks o’ soda  he stuffed the letter in ’is pocket and sat on the side smoking till his wife came back in five minutes’ time smiling all over with good temper  it’s a nice evening she ses and i think i’ll just run over to dalston and see my cousin joe  the skipper got up like a lamb and said he’d go and clean ’imself  you needn’t come if you feel tired she ses smiling at ’im  the skipper could ’ardly believe his ears  i do feel tired he ses i’ve had a heavy day and i feel more like bed than anything else  you turn in then she ses i’ll be all right by myself  she went down and tidied herself up—not that it made much difference to ’er—and arter patting him on the arm and giving me a stare that would ha’ made most men blink she took herself off  i was pretty busy that evening wot with shifting lighters from under the jetty and sweeping up it was pretty near ha’past seven afore i ’ad a minute i could call my own i put down the broom at last and was just thinking of stepping round to the bull’s head for a ’arfpint when i see cap’n smithers come off the ship on to the wharf and walk to the gate  i thought you was going to turn in i ses  i did think of it he ses then i thought p’r’aps i’d better stroll as far as broad street and meet my wife  it was all i could do to keep a straight face i’d a pretty good idea where she ’ad gorn and it wasn’t dalston  come in and ’ave ’arf a pint fust i ses  no i shall be late he ses hurrying off  i went in and ’ad a glass by myself and stood there so long thinking of mrs smithers walking up and down by cleopatra’s needle that at last the landlord fust asked me wot i was laughing at and then offered to make me laugh the other side of my face and then he wonders why people go to the albion  i locked the gate rather earlier than usual that night sometimes if i’m up that end i leave it a bit late but i didn’t want mrs smithers to come along and nip in without me seeing her face  it was ten o’clock afore i heard the bell go and when i opened the wicket and looked out i was surprised to see that she ’ad got the skipper with ’er and of all the miserablelooking objects i ever saw in my life he was the worst she ’ad him tight by the arm and there was a look on ’er face that a’most scared me  did you go all the way to dalston for her i ses to ’im  mrs smithers made a gasping sort o’ noise but the skipper didn’t answer a word  she shoved him in in front of ’er and stood ever ’im while he climbed aboard when he held out ’is hand to help ’er she struck it away  i didn’t get word with ’im till five o’clock next morning when he came up on deck with his ’air all rough and ’is eyes red for want of sleep  haven’t ’ad a wink all night he ses stepping on to the wharf  i gave a little cough didn’t she ’ave a pleasant time at dalston i ses  he walked a little further off from the ship she didn’t go there he ses in a whisper  you’ve got something on your mind i ses wot is it  he wouldn’t tell me at fust but at last he told me all about the letter from dorothy and ’is wife reading it unbeknown to ’im and going to meet ’er  it was an awful meeting he ses awful  i couldn’t think wot to make of it was the gal there then i ses staring at ’im  no ses the skipper but i was  you i ses starting back you wot for i’m surprised at you i wouldn’t ha’ believed it of you  i felt a bit curious he ses with a silly sort o’ smile but wot i can’t understand is why the gal didn’t turn up  i’m ashamed of you bill i ses very severe  p’r’aps she did he ses ’arf to ’imself and then saw my missis standing there waiting p’r’aps that was it  or p’r’aps it was somebody ’aving a game with you i ses  you’re getting old bill he ses very short you don’t understand it’s some pore gal that’s took a fancy to me and it’s my dooty to meet ’er and tell her ’ow things are  he walked off with his ’ead in the air and if ’e took that letter out once and looked at it he did five times  chuck it away i ses going up to him  certainly not he ses folding it up careful and stowing it away in ’is breastpocket she’s took a fancy to me and it’s my dooty——  you said that afore i ses  he stared at me nasty for a moment and then ’e ses you ain’t seen any young lady hanging about ’ere i suppose bill a tall young lady with a blue hat trimmed with red roses  i shook my ’ead  if you should see ’er he ses  i’ll tell your missis i ses it ’ud be much easier for her to do her dooty properly than it would you she’d enjoy doing it too  he went off agin then and i thought he ’ad done with me but he ’adn’t he spoke to me that evening as if i was the greatest friend he ’ad in the world i ’ad two ’arfpints with ’im at the albion—with his missis walking up and down outside—and arter the second ’arfpint he said he wanted to meet dorothy and tell ’er that ’e was married and that he ’oped she would meet some good man that was worthy of ’er  i had a week’s peace while the ship was away but she was hardly made fast afore i ’ad it all over agin and agin  are you sure there’s been no more letters he ses  sartain i ses  that’s right he ses that’s right and you ’aven’t seen her walking up and down  no i ses  ’ave you been on the lookout he ses i don’t suppose a nice gal like that would come and shove her ’ead in at the gate did you look up and down the road  yes i ses i’ve fair made my eyes ache watching for her  i can’t understand it he ses it’s a mystery to me unless p’r’aps she’s been taken ill she must ’ave seen me here in the fust place and she managed to get hold of my name mark my words i shall ’ear from her agin  ’ow do you know i ses  i feel it ’ere he ses very solemn laying his ’and on his chest  i didn’t know wot to do wot with ’is foolishness and his missis’s temper i see i ’ad made a mess of it he told me she had ’ardly spoke a word to ’im for two days and when i said—being a married man myself— that it might ha’ been worse ’e said i didn’t know wot i was talking about  i did a bit o’ thinking arter he ’ad gorn aboard agin i dursn’t tell ’im that i ’ad wrote the letter but i thought if he ’ad one or two more he’d see that some one was ’aving a game with ’im and that it might do ’im good besides which it was a little amusement for me  arter everybody was in their beds asleep i sat on a clerk’s stool in the office and wrote ’im another letter from dorothy i called ’im dear bill and i said ’ow sorry i was that i ’adn’t had even a sight of ’im lately having been laid up with a sprained ankle and ’ad only just got about agin i asked ’im to meet me at cleopatra’s needle at eight o’clock and said that i should wear the blue ’at with red roses  it was a very good letter but i can see now that i done wrong in writing it i was going to post it to ’im but as i couldn’t find an envelope without the name of the blessed wharf on it i put it in my pocket till i got ’ome  i got ’ome at about a quarter to seven and slept like a child till pretty near four then i went downstairs to ’ave my dinner  the moment i opened the door i see there was something wrong three times my missis licked ’er lips afore she could speak her face ’ad gone a dirty white colour and she was leaning forward with her ’ands on her ’ips trembling all over with temper  is my dinner ready i ses easylike ’cos i’m ready for it  i—i wonder i don’t tear you limb from limb she ses catching her breath  wot’s the matter i ses  and then boil you she ses between her teeth you in one pot and your precious dorothy in another  if anybody ’ad offered me five pounds to speak then i couldn’t ha’ done it i see wot i’d done in a flash and i couldn’t say a word but i kept my presence o’ mind and as she came round one side o’ the table i went round the other  wot ’ave you got to say for yourself she ses with a scream  nothing i ses at last it’s all a mistake  mistake she ses yes you made a mistake leaving it in your pocket that’s all the mistake you’ve made that’s wot you do is it when you’re supposed to be at the wharf go about with a blue ’at with red roses in it at your time o’ life and a wife at ’ome working herself to death to make both ends meet and keep you respectable  it’s all a mistake i ses the letter wasn’t for me  oh no o’ course not she ses that’s why you’d got it in your pocket i suppose and i suppose you’ll say your name ain’t bill next  don’t say things you’ll be sorry for i ses  i’ll take care o’ that she ses i might be sorry for not saying some things but i don’t think i shall  i don’t think she was i don’t think she forgot anything and she raked up things that i ’ad contradicted years ago and wot i thought was all forgot and every now and then when she stopped for breath she’d try and get round to the same side of the table i was  she follered me to the street door when i went and called things up the road arter me i ’ad a snack at a coffeeshop for my dinner but i ’adn’t got much appetite for it i was too full of trouble and finding fault with myself and i went off to my work with a ’art as heavy as lead  i suppose i ’adn’t been on the wharf ten minutes afore cap’n smithers came sidling up to me but i got my spoke in fust  look ’ere i ses if you’re going to talk about that forward hussy wot’s been writing to you i ain’t i’m sick and tired of ’er  forward hussy he ses forward hussy and afore i could drop my broom he gave me a punch in the jaw that pretty near broke it say another word against her he ses and i’ll knock your ugly ’ead off how dare you insult a lady  i thought i should ’ave gone crazy at fust but i went off into the office without a word some men would ha’ knocked ’im down for it but i made allowances for ’is state o’ mind and i stayed inside until i see ’im get aboard agin  he was sitting on deck when i went out and his missis too but neither of ’em spoke a word i picked up my broom and went on sweeping when suddenly i ’eard a voice at the gate i thought i knew and in came my wife  ho she ses calling out ain’t you gone to meet that gal at cleopatra’s needle yet you ain’t going to keep ’er waiting are you  h’sh i ses  h’sh yourself she ses shouting i’ve done nothing to be ashamed of i don’t go to meet other people’s husbands in a blue ’at with red roses i don’t write ’em loveletters and say ’h’sh’ to my wife when she ventures to make a remark about it i may work myself to skin and bone for a man wot’s old enough to know better but i’m not going to be trod on dorothy indeed i’ll dorothy ’er if i get the chance  mrs smithers wot ’ad been listening with all her ears jumped up and so did the skipper and mrs smithers came to the side in two steps  did you say ’dorothy’ ma’am she ses to my missis  i did ses my wife she’s been writing to my husband  it must be the same one ses mrs smithers she’s been writing to mine too  the two of ’em stood there looking at each other for a minute and then my wife holding the letter between ’er finger and thumb as if it was pison passed it to mrs smithers  it’s the same ses mrs smithers was the envelope marked ’private’  i didn’t see no envelope ses my missis this is all i found  mrs smithers stepped on to the wharf and taking ’old of my missis by the arm led her away whispering at the same moment the skipper walked across the deck and whispered to me  wot d’ye mean by it he ses wot d’ye mean by ’aving letters from dorothy and not telling me about it  i can’t help ’aving letters any more than you can i ses now p’r’aps you’ll understand wot i meant by calling ’er a forward hussy  fancy ’er writing to you he ses wrinkling ’is forehead pph she must be crazy  p’r’aps it ain’t a gal at all i ses my belief is somebody is ’aving a game with us  don’t be a fool he ses i’d like to see the party as would make a fool of me like that just see ’im and get my ’ands on him he wouldn’t want to play any more games  it was no good talking to ’im he was ’arf crazy with temper if i’d said the letter was meant for ’im he’d ’ave asked me wot i meant by opening it and getting ’im into more trouble with ’is missis instead of giving it to ’im on the quiet i just stood and suffered in silence and thought wot a lot of ’arm eddication did for people  i want some money ses my missis coming back at last with mrs smithers  that was the way she always talked when she’d got me in ’er power she took twoandtenpence—all i’d got—and then she ordered me to go and get a cab  me and this lady are going to meet her she ses sniffing at me  and tell her wot we think of ’er ses mrs smithers sniffing too  and wot we’ll do to ’er ses my missis  i left ’em standing side by side looking at the skipper as if ’e was a waxworks while i went to find a cab when i came back they was in the same persition and ’e was smoking with ’is eyes shut  they went off side by side in the cab both of ’em sitting boltupright and only turning their ’eads at the last moment to give us looks we didn’t want  i don’t wish her no ’arm ses the skipper arter thinking for a long time was that the fust letter you ’ad from ’er bill  fust and last i ses grinding my teeth  i’ve been married longer than wot you have i ses and i tell you one thing it won’t make no difference to us whether they do or they don’t i ses  and it didn’t     the vigil     im the happiest man in the world said mr farrer in accents of dreamy tenderness  miss ward sighed wait till father comes in she said  mr farrer peered through the plants which formed a welcome screen to the window and listened with some uneasiness he was waiting for the firm springy step that should herald the approach of exsergeantmajor ward a squeeze of miss ward’s hand renewed his courage  perhaps i had better light the lamp said the girl after a long pause i wonder where mother’s got to  she’s on my side at any rate said mr farrer  poor mother said the girl she daren’t call her soul her own i expect she’s sitting in her bedroom with the door shut she hates unpleasantness and there’s sure to be some  so do i said the young man with a slight shiver but why should there be any he doesn’t want you to keep single all your life does he  he’d like me to marry a soldier said miss ward he says that the young men of the present day are too soft the only thing he thinks about is courage and strength  she rose and placing the lamp on the table removed the chimney and then sought round the room for the matches mr farrer who had two boxes in his pocket helped her  they found a box at last on the mantelpiece and mr farrer steadied her by placing one arm round her waist while she lit the lamp a sudden exclamation from outside reminded them that the blind was not yet drawn and they sprang apart in dismay as a grizzled and upright old warrior burst into the room and confronted them  pull that blind down he roared not you he continued as mr farrer hastened to help what do you mean by touching my blind what do you mean by embracing my daughter eh why don’t you answer  we—we are going to be married said mr farrer trying to speak boldly  the sergeantmajor drew himself up and the young man gazed in dismay at a chest which seemed as though it would never cease expanding  married exclaimed the sergeantmajor with a grim laugh married to a little tame bunnyrabbit not if i know it where’s your mother he demanded turning to the girl  upstairs was the reply  her father raised his voice and a nervous reply came from above a minute later mrs ward pale of cheek entered the room  here’s fine goingson said the sergeant major sharply i go for a little walk and when i come back this—this infernal cockroach has got its arm round my daughter’s waist why don’t you look after her do you know anything about it  his wife shook her head  five feet four and about thirty round the chest and wants to marry my daughter said the sergeantmajor with a sneer eh what’s that what did you say what  i said that’s a pretty good size for a cockroach murmured mr farrer defiantly besides size isn’t everything if it was you’d be a general instead of only a sergeantmajor  you get out of my house said the other as soon as he could get his breath go on sharp with it  i’m going said the mortified mr farrer i’m sorry if i was rude i came on purpose to see you tonight bertha—miss ward i mean—told me your ideas but i couldn’t believe her i said you’d got more common sense than to object to a man just because he wasn’t a soldier  i want a man for a soninlaw said the other i don’t say he’s got to be a soldier  just so said mr farrer you’re a man ain’t you well i’ll do anything that you’ll do  pph said the sergeantmajor i’ve done my little lot i’ve been in action four times and wounded in three places that’s my tally  the colonel said once that my husband doesn’t know what fear is said mrs ward timidly he’s afraid of nothing  except ghosts remarked her daughter softly  hold your tongue miss said her father twisting his moustache no sensible man is afraid of what doesn’t exist  a lot of people believe they do though said mr farrer breaking in i heard the other night that old smith’s ghost has been seen again swinging from the apple tree three people have seen it  rubbish said the sergeantmajor  maybe said the young man but i’ll bet you mr ward for all your courage that you won’t go up there alone at twelve o’clock one night to see  i thought i ordered you out of my house just now said the sergeantmajor glaring at him  going into action said mr farrer pausing at the door is one thing —you have to obey orders and you can’t help yourself but going to a lonely cottage two miles off to see the ghost of a man that hanged himself is another  do you mean to say i’m afraid blustered the other  mr farrer shook his head i don’t say anything he remarked but even a cockroach does a bit of thinking sometimes  perhaps you’d like to go said the sergeantmajor  i don’t mind said the young man and perhaps you’ll think a little better of me mr ward if i do what you’re afraid to do—  mrs ward and her daughter flung themselves hastily between the sergeantmajor and his intended sacrifice mr farrer pale but determined stood his ground  i’ll dare you to go up and spend a night there alone he said  i’ll dare you said the incensed warrior weakly  all right i’ll spend wednesday night there said mr farrer and i’ll come round on thursday and let you know how i got on  i dare say said the other but i don’t want you here and what’s more i won’t have you you can go to smith’s cottage on wednesday at twelve o’clock if you like and i’ll go up any time between twelve and three and make sure you’re there d’ye understand i’ll show you whether i’m afraid or not  there’s no reason for you to be afraid said mr farrer i shall be there to protect you that’s very different to being there alone as i shall be but of course you can go up the next night by yourself and wait for me if you like if you like to prove your courage i mean  when i want to be ordered about said the sergeantmajor in a magnificent voice i’ll let you know now go before i do anything i might be sorry for afterwards  he stood at the door erect as a ramrod and watched the young man up the road his conversation at the suppertable that night related almost entirely to puppydogs and the best way of training them  he kept a close eye upon his daughter for the next day or two but human nature has its limits he tried to sleep one afternoon in his easychair with one eye open but the exquisite silence maintained by miss ward was too much for it a hum of perfect content arose from the feature below and five minutes later miss ward was speeding in search of mr farrer  i had to come ted she said breathlessly because tomorrow’s wednesday i’ve got something to tell you but i don’t know whether i ought to  tell me and let me decide said mr farrer tenderly  i—i’m so afraid you might be frightened said the girl i won’t tell you but i’ll give you a hint if you see anything awful don’t be frightened  mr farrer stroked her hand the only thing i’m afraid of is your father he said softly  oh said the girl clasping her hands together you have guessed it  guessed it said mr farrer  miss ward nodded i happened to pass his door this morning she said in a low voice it was open a little way and he was standing up and measuring one of mother’s nightgowns against his chest i couldn’t think what he was doing it for at first  mr farrer whistled and his face hardened  that’s not fair play he said at last all right i’ll be ready for him  he doesn’t like to be put in the wrong said miss ward he wants to prove that you haven’t got any courage he’d be disappointed if he found you had  all right said mr farrer again you’re an angel for coming to tell me  father would call me something else i expect said miss ward with a smile goodbye i want to get back before he wakes up  she was back in her chair listening to her father’s slumbers half an hour before he awoke  i’m making up for tomorrow night he said opening his eyes suddenly  his daughter nodded  shows strength of will continued the sergeantmajor amiably wellington could go to sleep at any time by just willing it i’m the same way i can go to sleep at five minutes’ notice  it’s a very useful gift said miss ward piously very  mr ward had two naps the next day he awoke from the second at twelvethirty am and in a somewhat disagreeable frame of mind rose and stretched himself the house was very still he took a small brownpaper parcel from behind the sofa and extinguishing the lamp put on his cap and opened the front door  if the house was quiet the little street seemed dead he closed the door softly and stepped into the darkness in terms which would have been understood by our army in flanders he execrated the forefathers the name and the upbringing of mr edward farrer  not a soul in the streets not a light in a window he left the little town behind passed the last isolated house on the road and walked into the greater blackness of a road between tall hedges he had put on canvas shoes with rubber soles for the better surprise of mr farrer and his own progress seemed to partake of a ghostly nature every ghost story he had ever heard or read crowded into his memory for the first time in his experience even the idea of the company of mr farrer seemed better than no company at all  the night was so dark that he nearly missed the turning that led to the cottage for the first few yards he had almost to feel his way then with a greater yearning than ever for the society of mr farrer he straightened his back and marched swiftly and noiselessly towards the cottage  it was a small tumbledown place set well back in an overgrown garden the sergeantmajor came to a halt just before reaching the gate and hidden by the hedge unfastened his parcel and shook out his wife’s best nightgown  he got it over his head with some difficulty and with his arms in the sleeves tried in vain to get his big hands through the small lacetrimmed wristbands despite his utmost efforts he could only get two or three fingers through and after a vain search for his cap which had fallen off in the struggle he made his way to the gate and stood there waiting it was at this moment that the thought occurred to him that mr farrer might have failed to keep the appointment  his knees trembled slightly and he listened anxiously for any sound from the house he rattled the gate and standing with white arms outstretched waited nothing happened he shook it again and then pulling himself together opened it and slipped into the garden as he did so a large bough which lay in the centre of the footpath thoughtfully drew on one side to let him pass  mr ward stopped suddenly and with his gaze fixed on the bough watched it glide over the grass until it was swallowed up in the darkness his own ideas of frightening mr farrer were forgotten and in a dry choking voice he called loudly upon the name of that gentleman  he called two or three times with no response and then in a state of panic backed slowly towards the gate with his eyes fixed on the house a loud crash sounded from somewhere inside the door was flung violently open and a gruesome figure in white hopped out and squatted on the step  it was evident to sergeantmajor ward that mr farrer was not there and that no useful purpose could be served by remaining it was clear that the young man’s courage had failed him and with grey head erect elbows working like the sails of a windmill and the ends of the nightgown streaming behind him the sergeantmajor bent his steps towards home  he dropped into a walk after a time and looked carefully over his shoulder so far as he could see he was alone but the silence and loneliness were oppressive he looked again and without stopping to inquire whether his eyes had deceived him broke into a run again alternately walking and running he got back to the town and walked swiftly along the streets to his house policeconstable burgess who was approaching from the other direction reached it at almost the same moment and turning on his lantern stood gaping with astonishment anything wrong he demanded  wrong panted the sergeantmajor trying to put a little surprise and dignity into his voice no  i thought it was a lady walking in her sleep at first said the constable a tall lady  the sergeantmajor suddenly became conscious of the nightgown i’ve been—for a little walk he said still breathing hard i felt a bit chilly—so i—put this on  suits you too said the constable stiffly but you army men always was a bit dressy now if i put that on i should look ridikerlous  the door opened before mr ward could reply and revealed in the light of a bedroom candle the astonished countenances of his wife and daughter  george exclaimed mrs ward  father said miss ward  the sergeantmajor tottered in and gaining the front room flung himself into his armchair a stiff glass of whisky and water handed him by his daughter was swallowed at a gulp  did you go inquired mrs ward clasping her hands  the sergeantmajor fully conscious of the suspicions aroused by his disordered appearance rallied his faculties not likely he said with a short laugh after i got outside i knew it was no good going there to look for that young snippet he’d no more think of going there than he would of flying i walked a little way down the road—for exercise—and then strolled back  but—my nightgown said the wondering mrs ward  put it on to frighten the constable said her husband  he stood up and allowed her to help him pull it off his face was flushed and his hair tousled but the bright fierceness of his eye was unquenched in submissive silence she followed him to bed  he was up late next morning and made but a poor breakfast his afterdinner nap was disturbed and tea was over before he had regained his wonted calm an hour later the arrival of a dignified and reproachful mr farrer set him blazing again  i have come to see you about last night said mr farrer before the other could speak a joke’s a joke but when you said you would come i naturally expected you would keep your word  keep my word repeated the sergeantmajor almost choking with wrath  i stayed there in that lonely cottage from twelve to three as per agreement waiting for you said mr farrer  you were not there shouted the sergeantmajor  how do you know inquired the other  the sergeantmajor looked round helplessly at his wife and daughter  prove it said mr farrer pushing his advantage you questioned my courage and i stayed there three hours where were you  you were not there said the sergeantmajor i know you can’t bluff me you were afraid  i was there and i’ll swear it said mr farrer still there’s no harm done i’ll go there again tonight and i’ll dare you to come for me  dare said the sergeantmajor choking dare  dare repeated the other and if you don’t come this time i’ll spread it all over marcham tomorrow night you can go there and wait for me if you see what i saw—  oh ted said miss ward with a shiver saw said the sergeantmajor starting nothing harmful said mr farrer calmly  as a matter of fact it was very interesting  what was demanded the sergeantmajor  it sounds rather silly as a matter of fact said mr farrer slowly still i did see a broken bough moving about the garden  mr ward regarded him openmouthed  anything else he inquired in a husky voice  a figure in white said mr farrer with long waving arms hopping about like a frog i don’t suppose you believe me but if you come tonight perhaps you’ll see it yourself it’s very interesting  wer—weren’t you frightened inquired the staring mrs ward  mr farrer shook his head it would take more than that to frighten me he said simply i should be ashamed of myself to be afraid of a poor thing like that it couldn’t do me any harm  did you see its face inquired mrs ward nervously  mr farrer shook his head  what sort of a body had it got said her daughter  so far as i could see very good said mr farrer very good figure —not tall but well made  an incredible suspicion that had been forming in the sergeantmajor’s mind began to take shape did you see anything else he asked sharply  one more said mr farrer regarding him pleasantly one i call the running ghost  run— began the sergeantmajor and stopped suddenly  it came in at the front gate pursued mr farrer a tall wellknit figure of martial bearing—much about your height mr ward—with a beautiful filmy white robe down to its knees—  he broke off in mild surprise and stood gazing at miss ward who with her handkerchief to her mouth was rocking helplessly in her chair  knees he repeated quietly it came slowly down the path and half way to the house it stopped and in a frightened sort of voice called out my name i was surprised naturally but before i could get to it—to reassure it—  that’ll do said the sergeantmajor rising hastily and drawing himself up to his full height  you asked me said mr farrer in an aggrieved voice  i know i did said the sergeantmajor breathing heavily i know i did but if i sit here listening to any more of your lies i shall be ill the best thing you can do is to take that giggling girl out and give her a breath of fresh air i have done with her     easy money     a lad of about twenty stepped ashore from the schooner jane and joining a girl who had been avoiding for some ten minutes the ardent gaze of the nightwatchman set off arminarm the watchman rolled his eyes and shook his head slowly  nearly all his money on ’is back he said and what little bit ’e’s got over he’ll spend on ’er and three months arter they’re married he’ll wonder wot ’e ever saw in her if a man marries he wishes he ’adn’t and if he doesn’t marry he wishes he ’ad that’s life  looking at them two young fools reminds me of a nevy of sam small’s a man i think i’ve spoke to you of afore as a rule sam didn’t talk much about ’is relations but there was a sister of ’is in the country wot ’e was rather fond of because ’e ’adn’t seen ’er for twenty years she ’ad got a boy wot ’ad just got a job in london and when ’e wrote and told ’er he was keeping company with the handsomest and loveliest and best ’arted gal in the whole wide world she wrote to sam about it and asked ’im to give ’is nevy some good advice  sam ’ad just got back from china and was living with peter russet and ginger dick as usual and arter reading the letter about seven times and asking ginger how ’e spelt minx ’e read the letter out loud to them and asked ’em what they thought about it  ginger shook his ’ead and arter thinking a bit peter shook his too  she’s caught ’im rather young ses ginger  they get it bad at that age too ses peter when i was twenty there was a gal as i was fond of and a regiment couldn’t ha’ parted us  wot did part you then ses sam  another gal ses peter a gal i took a fancy to that’s wot did it  i was nearly married when i was twenty ses ginger with a faraway look in his eyes she was the most beautiful gal i ever saw in my life she ’ad one ’undred pounds a year of ’er own and she couldn’t bear me out of her sight if a thump acrost the chest would do that cough of yours any good sam—  don’t take no notice of ’im ginger ses peter why didn’t you marry ’er  ’cos i was afraid she might think i was arter ’er money ses ginger getting a little bit closer to sam  peter ’ad another turn then and him and ginger kept on talking about gals whose ’arts they ’ad broke till sam didn’t know what to do with ’imself  i’ll just step round and see my nevy while you and peter are amusing each other he ses at last i’ll ask ’im to come round tomorrow and then you can give ’im good advice  the nevy came round next evening bright cheerful young chap ’e was and he agreed with everything they said when peter said as ’ow all gals was deceivers he said he’d known it for years but they was born that way and couldn’t ’elp it and when ginger said that no man ought to marry afore he was fifty he corrected ’im and made it fiftyfive  i’m glad to ’ear you talk like that ses ginger  so am i ses peter  he’s got his ’ead screwed on right ses sam wot thought his sister ’ad made a mistake  i’m surprised when i look round at the wimmen men ’ave married ses the nevy wot they could ’ave seen in them i can’t think me and my young lady often laugh about it  your wot ses sam pretending to be very surprised  my young lady ses the nevy  sam gives a cough i didn’t know you’d got a young lady he ses  well i ’ave ses his nevy and we’re going to be married at christmas  but—but you ain’t fiftyfive ses ginger  i’m twentyone ses the nevy but my case is different there isn’t another young lady like mine in the world she’s different to all the others and it ain’t likely i’m going to let ’er be snapped up by somebody else fiftyfive why ’ow i’m to wait till christmas i don’t know she’s the prettiest and handsomest gal in the world and she’s the cleverest one i ever met you ought to hear ’er laugh like music it is you’d never forget it  twentyone is young ses ginger shaking his ’ead ’ave you known ’er long  three months ses the nevy she lives in the same street as i do ’ow it is she ain’t been snapped up before i can’t think but she told me that she didn’t care for men till she saw me  they all say that ses ginger  if i’ve ’ad it said to me once i’ve ’ad it said twenty times ses peter nodding  they do it to flatter ses old sam looking as if ’e knew all about it you wait till you are my age joe then you’ll know why i should ha’ been married dozens o’ times if i ’adn’t been careful  p’r’aps it was a bit on both sides ses joe looking at ’is uncle p’r’aps they was careful too if you only saw my young lady you wouldn’t talk like that she’s got the truthfullest eyes in the world large grey eyes like a child’s leastways sometimes they are grey and sometimes they are blue it seems to depend on the light somehow i ’ave seen them when they was a brownbrownishgold and she smiles with ’er eyes  hasn’t she got a mouth ses ginger wot was getting a bit tired of it  you’ve been crossed in love ses the nevy staring at ’im that’s wot’s the matter with you and looking at you i don’t wonder at it  ginger ’arf got up but sam gave him a look and ’e sat down agin and then they all sat quiet while the nevy went on telling them about ’is gal  i should like to see ’er ses his uncle at last  call round for me at seven tomorrow night ses the young ’un and i’ll introduce you  we might look in on our way ses sam arter ginger and peter ’ad both made eyes at ’im we’re going out to spend the evening  the more the merrier ses his nevy well so long i expect she’s waiting for me  he got up and said goodbye and arter he ’ad gorn sam and the other two shook their leads together and said what a pity it was to be twentyone ginger said it made ’im sad to think of it and peter said ’ow any gal could look at a man under thirty ’e couldn’t think  they all went round to the nevy’s the next evening they was a little bit early owing to ginger’s watch ’aving been set right by guesswork and they ’ad to sit in a row on the nevy’s bed waiting while ’e cleaned ’imself and changed his clothes although it was only wednesday ’e changed his collar and he was so long making up ’is mind about his necktie that ’is uncle tried to make it up for him by the time he ’ad finished sam said it made ’im think it was sunday  miss gill was at ’ome when they got there and all three of ’em was very much surprised that such a goodlooking gal should take up with sam’s nevy ginger nearly said so but peter gave ’im a dig in the back just in time and ’e called him something under ’is breath instead  why shouldn’t we all make an evening of it ses ginger arter they ’ad been talking for about ten minutes and the nevy ’ad looked at the clock three or four times  because two’s company ses mrs gill why you was young yourself once can’t you remember  he’s young now mother ses the gal giving ginger a nice smile  i tell you wot we might do ses mrs gill putting ’er finger to her forehead and considering you and joe go out and ’ave your evening and me and these gentlemen’ll go off together somewhere i shall enjoy an outing i ain’t ’ad one for a long time  ginger said it would be very nice if she thought it wouldn’t make ’er too tired and afore sam or peter could think of anything to say she was upstairs putting ’er bonnet on they thought o’ plenty to say while they was sitting alone with ginger waiting for ’er  my idea was for the gal and your nevy to come too ses pore ginger then i thought we might lose ’im and i would ’ave a little chat with the gal and show ’er ’ow foolish she was  well you’ve done it now ses sam spoilt our evening  p’r’aps good will come out of it ses ginger if the old lady takes a fancy to us we shall be able to come agin and then to please you sam i’ll have a go to cut your nevy out  sam stared at ’im and peter stared too and then they looked at each other and began to laugh till ginger forgot where ’e was and offered to put sam through the winder they was still quarrelling under their breath and saying wot they’d like to do to each other when mrs gill came downstairs dressed up to the nines she was and they walked down the street with a feeling that everybody was looking at em  one thing that ’elped to spoil the evening was that mrs gill wouldn’t go into public’ouses but to make up for it she went into sweetstuff shops three times and ’ad ices while they stood and watched ’er and wondered ’ow she could do it and arter that she stopped at a place poplar way where there was a few swings and roundabouts and things she was as skittish as a schoolgal and arter taking pore sam on the roundabout till ’e didn’t know whether he was on his ’eels or his ’ead she got ’im into a boatswing and swung ’im till he felt like a boy on ’is fust v’y’ge arter that she took ’im to the rifle gallery and afore he had ’ad three shots the man took the gun away from ’im and threatened to send for the police  it was an expensive evening for all of them but as ginger said when they got ’ome they ’ad broken the ice and he bet peter russet ’arf a dollar that afore two days ’ad passed he’d take the nevy’s gal for a walk he stepped round by ’imself the next arternoon and made ’imself agreeable to mrs gill and the day arter they was both so nice and kind that ’e plucked up ’is courage and offered to take miss gill to the zoo  she said no at fust of course but arter ginger ’ad pointed out that joe was at work all day and couldn’t take ’er ’imself and that ’e was joe’s uncle’s best pal she began to think better of it  why not ses her mother joe wouldn’t mind he wouldn’t be so silly as to be jealous o’ mr ginger dick  of course not ses the gal there’s nothing to be jealous of  she let ’er mother and ginger persuade ’er arter a time and then she went upstairs to clean herself and put on a little silver brooch that ginger said he ’ad picked up coming along  she took about threequarters of an hour to get ready but when she came down ginger felt that it was quite worth it he couldn’t take ’is eyes off ’er as the saying goes and ’e sat by ’er side on the top of the omnibus like a man in a dream  this is better than being at sea he ses at last  don’t you like the sea ses the gal i should like to go to sea myself  i shouldn’t mind the sea if you was there ses ginger  miss gill turned her ’ead away you mustn’t talk to me like that she ses in a soft voice still—  still wot ses ginger arter waiting a long time  i mean if i did go to sea it would be nice to have a friend on board she ses i suppose you ain’t afraid of storms are you  i like ’em ses ginger  you look as if you would ses the gal giving ’im a little look under ’er eyelashes it must be nice to be a man and be brave i wish i was a man  i don’t ses ginger  why not ses the gal turning her ’ead away agin  ginger didn’t answer he gave ’er elbow a little squeeze instead she took it away at once and ginger was just wishing he ’adn’t been so foolish when it came back agin and they sat for a long time without speaking a word  the sea is all right for some things ses ginger at last but suppose a man married  the gal shook her ’ead it would be hard on ’is wife she ses with another little look at ’im but—but——  ginger pinched ’er elbow agin  but p’r’aps he could get a job ashore she ses and then he could take his wife out for a busride every day  they ’ad to change buses arter a time and they got on a wrong bus and went miles out o’ their way but neither of ’em seemed to mind ginger said he was thinking of something else and the gal said she was too they got to the zoological gardens at last and ginger said he ’ad never enjoyed himself so much when the lions roared she squeezed his arm and when they ’ad an elephant ride she was holding on to ’im with both ’ands  i am enjoying myself she ses as ginger ’elped her down and said whoa to the elephant i know it’s wicked but i can’t ’elp it and wot’s more i’m afraid i don’t want to ’elp it  she let ginger take ’er arm when she nearly tripped up over a peppermint ball some kid ’ad dropped and arter a little persuasion she ’ad a bottle of lemonade and six bathbuns at a refreshment stall for dinner  she was as nice as she could be to him but by the time they started for ’ome she ’ad turned so quiet that ginger began to think ’e must ’ave offended ’er in some way  are you tired he ses  no ses the gal shaking her ’ead i’ve enjoyed myself very much  i thought you seemed a bit tired ses ginger arter waiting a long time  i’m not tired ses the gal giving ’im a sad sort o’ little smile but i’m a little bit worried that’s all  worried ses ginger very tender wot’s worrying you  oh i can’t tell you ses miss gill it doesn’t matter i’ll try and cheer up wot a lovely day it is isn’t it i shall remember it all my life  wot is it worrying you ses ginger in a determined voice can’t you tell me  no ses the gal shaking her ’ead i can’t tell you because you might want to ’elp me and i couldn’t allow that  why shouldn’t i ’elp you ses ginger it’s wot we was put ’ere for to ’elp one another  i couldn’t tell you ses the gal just dabbing at’er eyes—with a lace pocket’ankercher about one and a ’arf times the size of ’er nose  not if i ask you to ses ginger  miss gill shook ’er ’ead and then she tried her ’ardest to turn the conversation she talked about the weather and the monkey’ouse and a gal in ’er street whose ’air changed from red to black in a single night but it was all no good ginger wouldn’t be put off and at last she ses—  well she ses if you must know i’m in a difficulty i ’ave got to get three pounds and where to get it i don’t know any more than the man in the moon now let’s talk about something else  do you owe it ses ginger  i can’t tell you any more ses miss gill and i wouldn’t ’ave told you that only you asked me and somehow i feel as though i ’ave to tell you things when you want me to  three pounds ain’t much ses pore ginger wot ’ad just been paid off arter a long v’y’ge i can let you ’ave it and welcome  miss gill started away from ’im as though she ’ad been stung and it took ’im all his time to talk ’er round agin when he ’ad she begged ’is pardon and said he was the most generous man she ’ad ever met but it couldn’t be  i don’t know when i could pay it back she ses but i thank you all the same for offering it  pay it back when you like ses ginger and if you never pay it back it don’t matter  he offered ’er the money four or five times but she wouldn’t take it but at last just as they got near her ’ouse he forced it in her ’and and put his own ’ands in his pockets when she tried to make ’im take it back  you are good to me she ses arter they ’ad gone inside and ’er mother ’ad gone upstairs arter giving ginger a bottle o’ beer to amuse ’imself with i shall never forget you never  i ’ope not ses ginger starting are you coming out agin tomorrow  i’m afraid i can’t ses miss gill shaking her ’ead and looking sorrowful  not with me ses ginger sitting down beside her on the sofa and putting ’is arm so that she could lean against it if she wanted to  i don’t think i can ses the gal leaning back very gentle  think agin ses ginger squeezing ’er waist a little  miss gill shook her ’ead and then turned and looked at ’im her face was so close to his that thinking that she ’ad put it there apurpose he kissed it and the next moment ’e got a clout that made his ’ead ring  ’ow dare you she ses jumping up with a scream ’ow dare you ’ow dare——  wot’s the matter ses her mother coming downstairs like a runaway barrel of treacle  he—he’s insulted me ses miss gill taking out her little ’ankercher and sobbing he—kkissed me  wot ses mrs gill well i’d never ’ave believed it never why ’e ought to be taken up wot d’ye mean by it she ses turning on pore ginger  ginger tried to explain but it was all no good and two minutes arterwards ’e was walking back to ’is lodgings like a dog with its tail between its legs his ’ead was going round and round with astonishment and ’e was in such a temper that ’e barged into a man twice as big as himself and then offered to knock his ’ead off when ’e objected and when sam and peter asked him ’ow he ’ad got on he was in such a state of mind it was all ’e could do to answer ’em  and i’ll trouble you for my ’arf dollar peter he ses i’ve been out with ’er all day and i’ve won my bet  peter paid it over like a lamb and then ’e sat thinking ’ard for a bit  are you going out with ’er agin tomorrow ginger he ses arter a time  i don’t know ses ginger carelesslike i ain’t made up my mind yet  peter looked at ’im and then ’e looked at sam and winked let me ’ave a try he ses i’ll bet you another ’arf dollar that i take ’er out p’r’aps i shall come ’ome in a better temper than wot you ’ave  old sam said it wasn’t right to play with a gal’s ’art in that way but arter a lot o’ talking and telling sam to shut up ginger took the bet he was quite certain in his own mind that miss gill would slam the door in peter’s face and arter he ’ad started off next morning ginger and sam waited in to ’ave the pleasure of laughing in ’is face  they got tired of waiting at last and went out to enjoy themselves and breathe the fresh air in a pub down poplar way they got back at seven o’clock and ten minutes arterwards peter came in and sat down on his bed and began to smoke without a word  had a good time ses ginger  rippin’ ses peter holding ’is pipe tight between ’is teeth you owe me ’arf a dollar ginger  where’d you go ses ginger passing it over  crystal pallis ses peter  are you going to take ’er out tomorrow ses sam  i don’t think so ses peter taking ’is pipe out of ’is mouth and yawning she’s rather too young for me i like talking to gals wot’s a bit older i won’t stand in ginger’s way  i found ’er a bit young too ses ginger p’r’aps we’d better let sam’s nevy ’ave ’er arter all it’s a bit rough on ’im when you come to think of it  you’re quite right ses peter jumping up it’s sam’s business and why we should go out of our way and inconvenience ourselves to do ’im a good turn i don’t know  it’s sam all over ses ginger he’s always been like that and the more you try to oblige ’im the more you may  they went on abusing sam till he got sick and tired of it and arter telling ’em wot he thought of ’em he slammed the door and went out and spent the evening by ’imself he would ’ardly speak to them next day but arter tea he brightened up a bit and they went off together as if nothing ’ad happened and the fust thing they saw as they turned out of their street was sam’s nevy coming along smiling till it made their faces ache to look at him  i was just coming to see you he ses  we’re just off on business ses ginger  i wasn’t going to stop ses the nevy my young lady just told me to step along and show uncle wot she has bought me a silver watch and chain and a gold ring look at it  he held his ’and under ginger’s nose and ginger stood there looking at it and opening and shutting ’is mouth like a dying fish then he took peter by the arm and led’im away while the nevy was opening ’is new watch and showing sam the works  ’ow much did she get out of you peter ses ginger looking at ’im very hard i don’t want any lies  three quid ses peter staring at ’im  same ’ere ses ginger grinding his teeth did she give you a smack on the side of your face  wot—are—you—talking about ginger ses peter  did she smack your face too ses ginger  yes ses peter     his other self     they’re as like as two peas him and ’is brother said the nightwatchman gazing blandly at the indignant face of the lighterman on the barge below and the on’y way i know this one is sam is because bill don’t use bad langwidge twins they are but the likeness is only outside bill’s ’art is as white as snow  he cut off a plug of tobacco and placing it in his cheek waited expectantly  white as snow he repeated  that’s me said the lighterman as he pushed his unwieldy craft from the jetty i’ll tell sam your opinion of ’im so long  the watchman went a shade redder than usual that’s twins all over he said sourly always deceiving people it’s bill arter all and instead of hurting ’is feelings i’ve just been flattering of ’im up  it ain’t the fust time i’ve ’ad trouble over a likeness i’ve been a twin myself in a manner o’ speaking it didn’t last long but it lasted long enough for me to always be sorry for twins and to make a lot of allowance for them it must be very ’ard to have another man going about with your face on ’is shoulders and getting it into trouble  it was a year or two ago now i was sitting one evening at the gate smoking a pipe and looking at a newspaper i ’ad found in the office when i see a gentleman coming along from the swingbridge welldressed cleanshaved chap ’e was smoking a cigarette he was walking slow and looking about ’im casuallike until his eyes fell on me when he gave a perfect jump of surprise and arter looking at me very ’ard walked on a little way and then turned back he did it twice and i was just going to say something to ’im something that i ’ad been getting ready for ’im when he spoke to me  good evening he ses  good evening i ses folding the paper over and looking at ’im rather severe  i hope you’ll excuse me staring he ses very perlite but i’ve never seen such a face and figger as yours in all my life—never  ah you ought to ha’ seen me a few years ago i ses i’m like everybody else—i’m getting on  rubbish he ses you couldn’t be better if you tried it’s marvellous wonderful it’s the very thing i’ve been looking for why if you’d been made to order you couldn’t ha’ been better  i thought at fust he was by way of trying to get a drink out o’ me—i’ve been played that game afore—but instead o’ that he asked me whether i’d do ’im the pleasure of ’aving one with ’im  we went over to the albion and i believe i could have ’ad it in a pail if i’d on’y liked to say the word and all the time i was drinking he was looking me up and down till i didn’t know where to look as the saying is  i came down ’ere to look for somebody like you he ses but i never dreamt i should have such luck as this i’m an actor and i’ve got to play the part of a sailor and i’ve been worried some time ’ow to make up for the part d’ye understand  no i ses looking at ’im  i want to look the real thing he ses speaking low so the landlord shouldn’t hear i want to make myself the living image of you if that don’t fetch ’em i’ll give up the stage and grow cabbages  make yourself like me i ses why you’re no more like me than i’m like a seasick monkey  not so much he ses that’s where the art comes in  he stood me another drink and then taking my arm in a cuddling sort o’ way and calling me dear boy ’e led me back to the wharf and explained he said ’e would come round next evening with wot ’e called his makeup box and paint ’is face and make ’imself up till people wouldn’t know one from the other  and wot about your figger i ses looking at ’im  a cushion he ses winking or maybe a couple and what about clothes you’ll ’ave to sell me those you’ve got on hat and all and boots  i put a price on ’em that i thought would ’ave finished ’im then and there but it didn’t and at last arter paying me so many more compliments that they began to get into my ’ead he fixed up a meeting for the next night and went off  and mind he ses coming back not a word to a living soul  he went off agin and arter going to the bull’s head and ’aving a pint to clear my ’ead i went and sat down in the office and thought it over it seemed all right to me as far as i could see but p’r’aps the pint didn’t clear my ’ead enough—p’r’aps i ought to ’ave ’ad two pints  i lay awake best part of next day thinking it over and when i got up i ’ad made up my mind i put my clothes in a sack and then i put on some others as much like ’em as possible on’y p’r’aps a bit older in case the missis should get asking questions and then i sat wondering ’ow to get out with the sack without ’er noticing it she’s got a very inquiring mind and i wasn’t going to tell her any lies about it besides which i couldn’t think of one  i got out at last by playing a game on her i pertended to drop ’arf a dollar in the washus and while she was busy on ’er hands and knees i went off as comfortable as you please  i got into the office with it all right and just as it was getting dark a cab drove up to the wharf and the actorchap jumped out with a big leather bag i took ’im into the private office and ’e was so ready with ’is money for the clothes that i offered to throw the sack in  he changed into my clothes fust of all and then asking me to sit down in front of ’im he took a lookingglass and a box out of ’is bag and began to alter ’is face wot with sticks of coloured paint and false eyebrows and a beard stuck on with gum and trimmed with a pair o’ scissors it was more like a conjuring trick than anything else then ’e took a wig out of ’is bag and pressed it on his ’ead put on the cap put some black stuff on ’is teeth and there he was we both looked into the glass together while ’e gave the finishing touches and then he clapped me on the back and said i was the handsomest sailorman in england  i shall have to make up a bit ’eavier when i’m behind the floats he ses but this is enough for ’ere wot do you think of the imitation of your voice i think i’ve got it exact  if you ask me i ses it sounds like a pollparrot with a cold in the ’ead  and now for your walk he ses looking as pleased as if i’d said something else come to the door and see me go up the wharf  i didn’t like to hurt ’is feelings but i thought i should ha’ bust he walked up that wharf like a dancingbear in a pair of trousers too tight for it but ’e was so pleased with ’imself that i didn’t like to tell ’im so he went up and down two or three times and i never saw anything so ridikerlous in my life  that’s all very well for us he ses but wot about other people that’s wot i want to know i’ll go and ’ave a drink and see whether anybody spots me  afore i could stop ’im he started off to the bull’s head and went in while i stood outside and watched ’im  ’arf a pint o’ four ale he ses smacking down a penny  i see the landlord draw the beer and give it to ’im but ’e didn’t seem to take no notice of ’im then just to open ’is eyes a bit i walked in and put down a penny and asked for a ’arfpint  the landlord was just wiping down the counter at the time and when i gave my order he looked up and stood staring at me with the wet cloth ’eld up in the air he didn’t say a word—not a single word he stood there for a moment smiling at us foolishlike and then ’e let go o’ the beerinjin wot ’e was ’olding in ’is left hand and sat down heavy on the bar floor we both put our ’eads over the counter to see wot had ’appened to ’im and ’e started making the most ’orrible noise i ’ave ever heard in my life i wonder it didn’t bring the fireinjins the actorchap bolted out as if he’d been shot and i was just thinking of follering ’im when the landlord’s wife and ’is two daughters came rushing out and asking me wot i ’ad done to him  there—there—was two of ’im ses the landlord trembling and holding on to ’is wife’s arm as they helped ’im up and got ’im in the chair two of ’im  two of wot ses his wife  two—two watchmen ses the landlord both exac’ly alike and both asking for ’arf a pint o’ four ale  yes yes ses ’is wife  you come and lay down pa ses the gals i tell you there was ses the landlord getting ’is colour back with temper  yes yes i know all about it ses ’is wife you come inside for a bit and gertie you bring your father in a soda—a large soda  they got ’im in arter a lot o’ trouble but three times ’e came back as far as the door ’olding on to them and taking a little peep at me the last time he shook his ’ead at me and said if i did it agin i could go and get my ’arfpints somewhere else  i finished the beer wot the actor ’ad left and arter telling the landlord i ’oped his eyesight ’ud be better in the morning i went outside and arter a careful look round walked back to the wharf  i pushed the wicket open a little way and peeped in the actor was standing just by the fust crane talking to two of the hands off of the saltram he’d got ’is back to the light but ’ow it was they didn’t twig his voice i can’t think  they was so busy talking that i crept along by the side of the wall and got to the office without their seeing me i went into the private office and turned out the gas there and sat down to wait for ’im then i ’eard a noise outside that took me to the door agin and kept me there ’olding on to the doorpost and gasping for my breath the cook of the saltram was sitting on a paraffincask playing the mouthorgin and the actor with ’is arms folded across his stummick was dancing a hornpipe as if he’d gorn mad  i never saw anything so ridikerlous in my life and when i recollected that they thought it was me i thought i should ha’ dropped  a nightwatchman can’t be too careful and i knew that it ’ud be all over wapping next morning that i ’ad been dancing to a tuppennyha’penny mouthorgin played by a ship’s cook a man that does ’is dooty always has a lot of people ready to believe the worst of ’im  i went back into the dark office and waited and by and by i ’eard them coming along to the gate and patting ’im on the back and saying he ought to be in a pantermime instead o’ wasting ’is time nightwatching he left ’em at the gate and then ’e came into the office smiling as if he’d done something clever  wot d’ye think of me for a understudy he ses laughing they all thought it was you there wasn’t one of ’em ’ad the slightest suspicion —not one  and wot about my character i ses folding my arms acrost my chest and looking at him  character he ses staring why there’s no ’arm in dancing it’s a innercent enjoyment  it ain’t one o’ my innercent enjoyments i ses and i don’t want to get the credit of it if they hadn’t been sitting in a pub all the evening they’d ’ave spotted you at once  oh he ses very huffy how  your voice i ses you try and mimic a pollparrot and think it’s like me and for another thing you walk about as though you’re stuffed with sawdust  i beg your pardon he ses the voice and the walk are exact exact  wot i ses looking ’im up and down you stand there and ’ave the impudence to tell me that my voice is like that  i do he ses  then i’m sorry for you i ses i thought you’d got more sense  he stood looking at me and gnawing ’is finger and by and by he ses are you married he ses  i am i ses very short  where do you live he ses  i told ’im  very good he ses p’r’aps i’ll be able to convince you arter all by the way wot do you call your wife missis  yes i ses staring at him but wot’s it got to do with you  nothing he ses nothing only i’m going to try the pollparrot voice and the sawdust walk on her that’s all if i can deceive ’er that’ll settle it  deceive her i ses do you think i’m going to let you go round to my ’ouse and get me into trouble with the missis like that why you must be crazy that dancing must ’ave got into your ’ead  where’s the ’arm he ses very sulky  ’arm i ses i won’t ’ave it that’s all and if you knew my missis you’d know without any telling  i’ll bet you a pound to a sixpence she wouldn’t know me he ses very earnest  she won’t ’ave the chance i ses so that’s all about it  he stood there argufying for about ten minutes but i was as firm as a rock i wouldn’t move an inch and at last arter we was both on the point of losing our tempers he picked up his bag and said as ’ow he must be getting off ’ome  but ain’t you going to take those things off fust i ses  no he ses smiling i’ll wait till i get ’ome tata  he put ’is bag on ’is shoulder and walked to the gate with me follering of ’im  i expect i shall see a cab soon he ses goodbye  wot are you laughing at i ses  on’y thoughts he ses  ’ave you got far to go’ i ses  no just about the same distance as you ’ave he ses and he went off spluttering like a sodawater bottle  i took the broom and ’ad a good sweepup arter he ’ad gorn and i was just in the middle of it when the cook and the other two chaps from the saltram came back with three other sailormen and a brewer’s drayman they ’ad brought to see me dance  same as you did a little while ago bill ses the cook taking out ’is beastly mouthorgin and wiping it on ’is sleeve wot toon would you like  i couldn’t get away from ’em and when i told them i ’ad never danced in my life the cook asked me where i expected to go to he told the drayman that i’d been dancing like a fairy in seaboots and they all got in front of me and wouldn’t let me pass i lost my temper at last and arter they ’ad taken the broom away from me and the drayman and one o’ the sailormen ’ad said wot they’d do to me if i was on’y fifty years younger they sheered off  i locked the gate arter ’em and went back to the office and i ’adn’t been there above ’arf an hour when somebody started ringing the gatebell as if they was mad i thought it was the cook’s lot come back at fust so i opened the wicket just a trifle and peeped out there was a ’ansomcab standing outside and i ’ad hardly got my nose to the crack when the actorchap still in my clothes pushed the door open and nipped in  you’ve lost he ses pushing the door to and smiling all over where’s your sixpence  lost i ses hardly able to speak d’ye mean to tell me you’ve been to my wife arter all—arter all i said to you  i do he ses nodding and smiling agin they were both deceived as easy as easy  both i ses staring at ’im both wot ’ow many wives d’ye think i’ve got wot d’ye mean by it  arter i left you he ses giving me a little poke in the ribs i picked up a cab and fust leaving my bag at aldgate i drove on to your ’ouse and knocked at the door i knocked twice and then an angrylooking woman opened it and asked me wot i wanted  ’it’s all right missis’ i ses ’i’ve got ’arf an hour off and i’ve come to take you out for a walk’  ’wot’ she ses drawing back with a start  ’just a little turn round to see the shops’ i ses ’and if there’s anything particler you’d like and it don’t cost too much you shall ’ave it’  i thought at fust from the way she took it she wasn’t used to you giving ’er things  ’ow dare you’ she ses ’i’ll ’ave you locked up ’ow dare you insult a respectable married woman you wait till my ’usband comes ’ome’  ’but i am your ’usband’ i ses ’don’t you know me my pretty don’t you know your pet sailorboy’  she gave a screech like a steaminjin and then she went next door and began knocking away like mad then i see that i ’ad gorn to number twelve instead of number fourteen your wife your real wife came out of number fourteen—and she was worse than the other but they both thought it was you—there’s no doubt of that they chased me all the way up the road and if it ’adn’t ha’ been for this cab that was just passing i don’t know wot would ’ave ’appened to me  he shook his ’ead and smiled agin and arter opening the wicket a trifle and telling the cabman he shouldn’t be long he turned to me and asked me for the sixpence to wear on his watchchain  sixpence i ses sixpence wot do you think is going to ’appen to me when i go ’ome  oh i ’adn’t thought o’ that he ses yes o’ course  wot about my wife’s jealousy i ses wot about the other and her ’usband a cooper as big as a ’ouse  well well he ses one can’t think of everything it’ll be all the same a hundred years hence  look ’ere i ses taking ’is shoulder in a grip of iron you come back with me now in that cab and explain d’ye see that’s wot you’ve got to do  all right he ses certainly is—is the husband badtempered  you’ll see i ses but that’s your business come along  with pleasure he ses ’elping me in ’arf a mo’ while i tell the cabby where to drive to  he went to the back o’ the cab and afore i knew wot had ’appened the ’orse had got a flick over the head with the whip and was going along at a gallop i kept putting the little flap up and telling the cabby to stop but he didn’t take the slightest notice arter i’d done it three times he kept it down so as i couldn’t open it  there was a crowd round my door when the cab drove up and in the middle of it was my missis the woman next door and ’er husband wot ’ad just come ’ome ’arf a dozen of ’em helped me out and afore i could say a word the cabman drove off and left me there  i dream of it now sometimes standing there explaining and explaining until just as i feel i can’t bear it any longer two policemen come up and ’elp me indoors if they had ’elped my missis outside it would be a easier dream to have                                    ————
