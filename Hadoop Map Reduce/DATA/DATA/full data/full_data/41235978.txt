held up the trap and i descended into the hole that answered the purpose of a cellar     preface   the plot has thickened in the few short months that have intervened since the appearance of the first portion of our manuscripts and bloodshed has come to deepen the stain left on the country by the widespread and bold assertion of false principles this must long since have been foreseen and it is perhaps a subject of just felicitation that the violence which has occurred was limited to the loss of a single life when the chances were and still are that it will extend to civil war that portions of the community have behaved nobly under this sudden outbreak of a lawless and unprincipled combination to rob is undeniable and ought to be dwelt on with gratitude and an honest pride that the sense of right of much the larger portion of the country has been deeply wounded is equally true that justice has been aroused and is at this moment speaking in tones of authority to the offenders is beyond contradiction but while all this is admitted and admitted not altogether without hope yet are there grounds for fear so reasonable and strong that no writer who is faithful to the real interests of his country ought for a single moment to lose sight of them  high authority in one sense or that of political power has pronounced the tenure of a durable lease to be opposed to the spirit of the institutions yet these tenures existed when the institutions were formed and one of the provisions of the institutions themselves guarantees the observance of the covenants under which the tenures exist it would have been far wiser and much nearer to the truth had those who coveted their neighbors goods been told that in their attempts to subvert and destroy the tenures in question they were opposing a solemn and fundamental provision of law and in so much opposing the institutions the capital error is becoming prevalent which holds the pernicious doctrine that this is a government of men instead of one of principles whenever this error shall so far come to a head as to get to be paramount in action the welldisposed may sit down and mourn over not only the liberties of their country but over its justice and its morals even should men be nominally so free as to do just what they please  as the littlepage manuscripts advance we find them becoming more and more suited to the times in which we live there is an omission of one generation however owing to the early death of mr malbone littlepage who left an only son to succeed him this son has felt it to be a duty to complete the series by an addition from his own pen without this addition we should never obtain views of satanstoe lilacsbush ravensnest and mooseridge in their present aspect while with it we may possibly obtain glimpses that will prove not only amusing but instructive  there is one point on which as editor of these manuscripts we desire to say a word it is thought by a portion of our readers that the first mr littlepage who has written cornelius of that name has manifested an undue asperity on the subject of the new england character our reply to this charge is as follows in the first place we do not pretend to be answerable for all the opinions of those whose writings are submitted to our supervision any more than we should be answerable for all the contradictory characters impulses and opinions that might be exhibited in a representation of fictitious characters purely of our own creation that the littlepages entertained new york notions and if the reader will new york prejudices may be true enough but in pictures of this sort even prejudices become facts that ought not to be altogether kept down then new england has long since anticipated her revenge glorifying herself and underrating her neighbors in a way that in our opinion fully justifies those who possess a little dutch blood in expressing their sentiments on the subject those who give so freely should know how to take a little in return and that more especially when there is nothing very direct or personal in the hits they receive for ourselves we have not a drop of dutch or new england blood in our veins and only appear as a bottleholder to one of the parties in this setto if we have recorded what the dutchman says of the yankee we have also recorded what the yankee says and that with no particular hesitation of the dutchman we know that these feelings are bygones but our manuscripts thus far have referred exclusively to the times in which they certainly existed and that too in a force quite as great as they are here represented to be  we go a little farther in our judgment the false principles that are to be found in a large portion of the educated classes on the subject of the relation between landlord and tenant are to be traced to the provincial notions of those who have received their impressions from a state of society in which no such relations exist the danger from the antirent doctrines is most to be apprehended from these false principles the misguided and impotent beings who have taken the field in the literal sense not being a fourth part as formidable to the right as those who have taken it in the moral there is not a particle more of reason in the argument which says that there should be no farmers in the strict meaning of the term than there would be in that which said there should be no journeymen connected with the crafts though it would not be easy to find a man to assert the latter doctrine we dare say if there did happen to exist a portion of the country in which the mechanics were all bosses it would strike those who dwelt in such a state of society that it would be singularly improper and antirepublican for any man to undertake journeywork  on this subject we shall only add one word the column of society must have its capital as well as its base it is only perfect while each part is entire and discharges its proper duty in new york the great landholders long have and do still in a social sense occupy the place of the capital on the supposition that this capital is broken and hurled to the ground of what material will be the capital that must be pushed into its place we know of none half so likely to succeed as the country extortioner and the country usurer we would caution those who now raise the cry of feudality and aristocracy to have a care of what they are about in lieu of king log they may be devoured by king stork     the chainbearer     chapter i      the steady brain the sinewy limb     to leap to climb to dive to swim     the iron frame inured to bear     each dire inclemency of air     nor less confirmed to undergo     fatigues faint chill and famines throerockeby   my father was cornelius littlepage of satanstoe in the county of westchester and state of new york and my mother was anneke mordaunt of lilacsbush a place long known by that name which still stands near kingsbridge but on the island of manhattan and consequently in one of the wards of new york though quite eleven miles from town i shall suppose that my readers know the difference between the island of manhattan and manhattan island though i have found soidisant manhattanese of mature years but of alien birth who had to be taught it lilacsbush i repeat therefore was on the island of manhattan eleven miles from town though in the city of new york and not on manhattan island  of my progenitors further back i do not conceive it necessary to say much they were partly of english and partly of low dutch extraction as is apt to be the case with those who come of new york families of any standing in the colony i retain tolerably distinct impressions of both of my grandfathers and of one of my grandmothers my mothers mother having died long before my own parents were married  of my maternal grandfather i know very little however he having died while i was quite young and before i had seen much of him he paid the great debt of nature in england whither he had gone on a visit to a relative a sir something bulstrode who had been in the colonies himself and who was a great favorite with herman mordaunt as my mothers parent was universally called in new york my father often said it was perhaps fortunate in one respect that his fatherinlaw died as he did since he had no doubt he would have certainly taken sides with the crown in the quarrel that soon after occurred in which case it is probable his estates or those which were my mothers and are now mine would have shared the fate of those of the de lanceys of the philipses of some of the van cortlandts of the floyds of the joneses and of various others of the heavy families who remained loyal as it was called meaning loyalty to a prince and not loyalty to the land of their nativity it is hard to say which were right in such a quarrel if we look at the opinions and prejudices of the times though the littlepages to a man which means only my father and grandfather and self took sides with the country in the way of selfinterest it ought to be remarked however that the wealthy american who opposed the crown showed much the most disinterestedness inasmuch as the chances of being subdued were for a long time very serious while the certainty of confiscation not to say of being hanged was sufficiently well established in the event of failure but my paternal grandfather was what was called a whig of the high caste he was made a brigadier in the militia in 1776 and was actively employed in the great campaign of the succeeding yearthat in which burgoyne was captured as indeed was my father who held the rank of lieutenantcolonel in the new york line there was also a major dirck van volkenburgh or follock as he was usually called in the same regiment with my father who was a sworn friend this major follock was an old bachelor and he lived quite as much in my fathers house as he did in his own his proper residence being across the river in rockland my mother had a friend as well as my father in the person of miss mary wallace a single lady well turned of thirty at the commencement of the revolution miss wallace was quite at ease in her circumstances but she lived altogether at lilacsbush never having any other home unless it might be at our house in town  we were very proud of the brigadier both on account of his rank and on account of his services he actually commanded in one expedition against the indians during the revolution a service in which he had some experience having been out on it on various occasions previously to the great struggle for independence it was in one of these early expeditions of the latter war that he first distinguished himself being then under the orders of a colonel brom follock who was the father of major dirck of the same name and who was almost as great a friend of my grandfather as the son was of my own parent this colonel brom loved a carouse and i have heard it said that getting among the high dutch on the mohawk he kept it up for a week with little or no intermission under circumstances that involved much military negligence the result was that a party of canada indians made an inroad on his command and the old colonel who was as bold as a lion and as drunk as a lord though why lords are supposed to be particularly inclined to drink i never could tell was both shot down and scalped early one morning as he was returning from an adjacent tavern to his quarters in the garrison where he was stationed my grandfather nobly revenged his death scattered to the four winds the invading party and recovered the mutilated body of his friend though the scalp was irretrievably lost  general littlepage did not survive the war though it was not his good fortune to die on the field thus identifying his name with the history of his country it happens in all wars and most especially did it often occur in our own great national struggle that more soldiers lay down their lives in the hospitals than on the field of battle though the shedding of blood seems an indispensable requisite to glory of this nature an ungrateful posterity taking little heed of the thousands who pass into another state of being the victims of exposure and camp diseases to sound the praises of the hundreds who are slain amid the din of battle yet it may be questioned if it do not require more true courage to face death when he approaches in the invisible form of disease than to meet him when openly arrayed under the armed hand my grandfathers conduct in remaining in camp among hundreds of those who had the smallpox the loathsome malady of which he died was occasionally alluded to it is true but never in the manner the death of an officer of his rank would have been mentioned had he fallen in battle i could see that major follock had an honorable pride in the fate of his father who was slain and scalped by the enemy in returning from a drunken carouse while my worthy parent ever referred to the death of the brigadier as an event to be deplored rather than exulted in for my own part i think my grandfathers end was much the most creditable of the two but as such it will never be viewed by the historian or the country as for historians it requires a man to be singularly honest to write against a prejudice and it is so much easier to celebrate a deed as it is imagined than as it actually occurred that i question if we know the truth of a tenth part of the exploits about which we vapor and in which we fancy we glory well we are taught to believe that the time will come when all things are to be seen in their true colors and when men and deeds will be known as they actually were rather than as they have been recorded in the pages of history  i was too young myself to take much part in the war of the revolution though accident made me an eyewitness of some of its most important events and that at the tender age of fifteen at twelvethe american intellect ever was and continues to be singularly precociousi was sent to nassau hall princeton to be educated and i remained there until i finally got a degree though it was not without several long and rude interruptions of my studies although so early sent to college i did not actually graduate until i was nineteen the troubled times requiring nearly twice as long a servitude to make a bachelor of arts of me as would have been necessary in the more halcyon days of peace thus i made a fragment of a campaign when only a sophomore and another the first year i was junior i say the first year because i was obliged to pass two years in each of the two higher classes of the institution in order to make up for lost time a youth cannot very well be campaigning and studying euclid in the academic bowers at the same moment then i was so young that a year more or less was of no great moment  my principal service in the war of the revolution was in 1777 or in the campaign in which burgoyne was met and captured that important service was performed by a force that was composed partly of regular troops and partly of militia my grandfather commanded a brigade of the last or what was called a brigade some six hundred men at most while my father led a regular battalion of one hundred and sixty troops of the new york line into the german intrenchments the memorable and bloody day the last were stormed how many he brought out i never heard him say the way in which i happened to be present in these important scenes is soon told  lilacsbush being on the island of manhattan not manhattan island be it always remembered and our family being whig we were driven from both our town and country houses the moment sir william howe took possession of new york at first my mother was content with merely going to satanstoe which was only a short distance from the enemys lines but the political character of the littlepages being too well established to render this a safe residence my grandmother and mother always accompanied by miss wallace went up above the highlands where they established themselves in the village of fishkill for the remainder of the war on a farm that belonged to miss wallace in fee here it was thought they were safe being seventy miles from the capital and quite within the american lines as this removal took place at the close of the year 1776 and after independence had been declared it was understood that our return to our proper homes at all depended on the result of the war at that time i was a sophomore and at home in the long vacation it was in this visit that i made my fragment of a campaign accompanying my father through all the closing movements of his regiment while washington and howe were manoeuvring in westchester my fathers battalion happening to be posted in such a manner as to be in the centre of the battle at white plains i had an opportunity of seeing some pretty serious service on that occasion nor did i quit the army and return to my studies until after the brilliant affairs at trenton and princeton in both of which our regiment participated  this was a pretty early commencement with the things of active life for a boy of fourteen but in that war lads of my age often carried muskets for the colonies covered a great extent of country and had but few people they who read of the war of the american revolution and view its campaigns and battles as they would regard the conflicts of older and more advanced nations can form no just notion of the disadvantages with which our people had to contend or the great superiority of the enemy in all the usual elements of military force without experienced officers with but few and indifferent arms often in want of ammunition the rural and otherwise peaceful population of a thinly peopled country were brought in conflict with the chosen warriors of europe and this too with little or none of that great sinew of war money to sustain them nevertheless the americans unaided by any foreign skill or succor were about as often successful as the reverse bunker hill bennington saratoga bhemiss heights trenton princeton monmouth were all purely american battles to say nothing of divers others that occurred farther south and though insignificant as to numbers compared with the conflicts of these later times each is worthy of a place in history and one or two are almost without parallels as is seen when bunker hill be named it sounds very well in a dispatch to swell out the list of an enemys ranks but admitting the number itself not to be overrated as so often occurred of what avail are men without arms and ammunition and frequently without any other military organization than a musterroll  i have said i made nearly the whole of the campaign in which burgoyne was taken it happened in this wise the service of the previous year had a good deal indisposed me to study and when again at home in the autumn vacation my dear mother sent me with clothing and supplies to my father who was with the army at the north i reached the headquarters of general gates a week before the affair of bhemiss heights and was with my father until the capitulation was completed owing to these circumstances though still a boy in years i was an eyewitness and in some measure an actor in two or three of the most important events in the whole war being well grown for my years and of a somewhat manly appearance considering how young i really was i passed very well as a volunteer being i have reason to think somewhat of a favorite in the regiment in the last battle i had the honor to act as a sort of aidedecamp to my grandfather who sent me with orders and messages two or three times into the midst of the fire in this manner i made myself a little known and all so much the more from the circumstance of my being in fact nothing but a college lad away from his alma mater during vacation  it was but natural that a boy thus situated should attract some little attention and i was noticed by officers who under other circumstances would hardly have felt it necessary to go out of their way to speak to me the littlepages had stood well i have reason to think in the colony and their position in the new state was not likely to be at all lowered by the part they were now playing in the revolution i am far from certain that general littlepage was considered a cornerpost in the temple of freedom that the army was endeavoring to rear but he was quite respectable as a militia officer while my father was very generally admitted to be one of the best lieutenantscolonel in the whole army  i well remember to have been much struck with a captain in my fathers regiment who certainly was a character in his way his origin was dutch as was the case with a fair proportion of the officers and he bore the name of andries coejemans though he was universally known by the sobriquet of the chainbearer it was fortunate for him it was so else would the yankees in the camp who seem to have a mania to pronounce every word as it is spelled and having succeeded in this to change the spelling of the whole language to accommodate it to certain sounds of their own inventing would have given him a most unpronounceable appellation heaven only knows what they would have called captain coejemans but for this lucky nickname but it may be as well to let the uninitiated understand at once that in new york parlance coejemans is called queemans the chainbearer was of a respectable dutch family one that has even given its queerlooking name to a place of some little note on the hudson but as was very apt to be the case with the cadets of such houses in the good old time of the colony his education was no great matter his means had once been respectable but as he always maintained he was cheated out of his substance by a yankee before he was threeandtwenty and he had recourse to surveying for a living from that time but andries had no head for mathematics and after making one or two notable blunders in the way of his new profession he quietly sunk to the station of a chainbearer in which capacity he was known to all the leading men of his craft in the colony it is said that every man is suited to some pursuit or other in which he might acquire credit would he only enter on it and persevere thus it proved to be with andries coejemans as a chainbearer he had an unrivalled reputation humble as was the occupation it admitted of excellence in various particulars as well as another in the first place it required honesty a quality in which this class of men can fail as well as all the rest of mankind neither colony nor patentee landlord nor tenant buyer nor seller need be uneasy about being fairly dealt by so long as andries coejemans held the forward end of the chain a duty on which he was invariably placed by one party or the other then a practical eye was a great aid to positive measurement and while andries never swerved to the right or to the left of his course having acquired a sort of instinct in his calling much time and labor were saved in addition to these advantages the chainbearer had acquired great skill in all the subordinate matters of his calling he was a capital woodman generally had become a good hunter and had acquired most of the habits that pursuits like those in which he was engaged for so many years previously to entering the army would be likely to give a man in the course of time he took patents to survey employing men with heads better than his own to act as principals while he still carried the chain  at the commencement of the revolution andries like most of those who sympathized with the colonies took up arms when the regiment of which my father was lieutenantcolonel was raised they who could bring to its colors so many men received commissions of a rank proportioned to their services in this respect andries had presented himself early with a considerable squad of chainbearers hunters trappers runners guides etc numbering in the whole something like fiveandtwenty hardy resolute sharpshooters their leader was made a lieutenant in consequence and being the oldest of his rank in the corps he was shortly after promoted to a captaincy the station he was in when i made his acquaintance and above which he never rose  revolutions more especially such as are of a popular character are not remarkable for bringing forward those who are highly educated or otherwise fitted for their new stations unless it may be on the score of zeal it is true service generally classes men bringing out their qualities and necessity soon compels the preferment of those who are the best qualified our own great national struggle however probably did less of this than any similar event of modern times a respectable mediocrity having accordingly obtained an elevation that as a rule it was enabled to keep to the close of the war it is a singular fact that not a solitary instance is to be found in our military annals of a young soldiers rising to high command by the force of his talents in all that struggle this may have been and in a measure probably was owing to the opinions of the people and to the circumstance that the service itself was one that demanded greater prudence and circumspection than qualities of a more dazzling nature or the qualifications of age and experience rather than those of youth and enterprise it is probable andries coejemans on the score of original station was rather above than below the level of the social positions of a majority of the subalterns of the different lines of the more northern colonies when he first joined the army it is true his education was not equal to his birth for in that day except in isolated instances and particular families the dutch of new york even in cases in which money was not wanting were any thing but scholars in this particular our neighbors the yankees had greatly the advantage of us they sent everybody to school and though their educations were principally those of smatterers it is an advantage to be even a smatterer among the very ignorant andries had been no student either and one may easily imagine what indifferent cultivation will effect on a naturally thin soil he could read and write it is true but it was the ciphering under which he broke down as a surveyor i have often heard him say that if land could be measured without figures he would turn his back on no man in the calling in all america unless it might be his excellency who he made no doubt was not only the best but the honestest surveyor mankind had ever enjoyed  the circumstance that washington had practised the art of a surveyor for a short time in his early youth was a source of great exultation with andries coejemans he felt that it was an honor to be even a subordinate in a pursuit in which such a man was a principal i remember that long after we were at saratoga together captain coejemans while we were before yorktown pointed to the commanderinchief one day as the latter rode past our encampment and cried out with emphasistere mortaunt my poytere goes his excellencyit would be te happiest tay of my life coult i only carry chain while he surveyt a pit of a farm in this neighborhoot  andries was more or less dutch in his dialect as he was more or less interested in general he spoke english pretty wellcolony english i mean not that of the schools though he had not a single yankeeism in his vocabulary on this last point he prided himself greatly feeling an honest pride if he did occasionally use vulgarisms a vicious pronounciation or make a mistake in the meaning of a word a sin he was a little apt to commit and that his faults were all honest new york mistakes and no new england gipperish in the course of the various visits i paid to the camp andries and myself became quite intimate his peculiarities seizing my fancy and doubtless my obvious admiration awakening his gratitude in the course of our many conversations he gave me his whole history commencing with the emigration of the coejemans from holland and ending with our actual situation in the camp at saratoga andries had been often engaged and before the war terminated i could boast of having been at his side in no less than six affairs myself viz white plains trenton princeton bhemiss heights monmouth and brandywine for i had stolen away from college to be present at the last affair the circumstance that our regiment was both with washington and gates was owing to the noble qualities of the former who sent off some of his best troops to reinforce his rival as things gathered to a head at the north then i was present throughout at the siege of yorktown but it is not my intention to enlarge on my own military services  while at saratoga i was much struck with the air position and deportment of a gentleman who appeared to command the respect and to obtain the ears of all the leaders in the american camp while he held no apparent official station he wore no uniform though he was addressed by the title of general and had much more of the character of a real soldier than gates who commanded he must have been between forty and fifty at that time and in the full enjoyment of the vigor of his mind and body this was philip schuyler so justly celebrated in our annals for his wisdom patriotism integrity and public services his connection with the great northern campaign is too well known to require any explanations here its success perhaps was more owing to his advice and preparations than to the influence of any one other mind and he is beginning already to take a place in history in connection with these great events that has a singular resemblance to that he occupied during their actual occurrence in other words he is to be seen in the background of the great national picture unobtrusive and modest but directing and controlling all by the power of his intellect and the influence of his experience and character gates1 was but a secondary personage in the real events of that memorable period schuyler was the presiding spirit though forced by popular prejudice to retire from the apparent command of the army our written accounts ascribe the difficulty that worked this injustice to schuyler to a prejudice which existed among the eastern militia and which is supposed to have had its origin in the disasters of st clair or the reverses which attended the earlier movements of the campaign my father who had known general schuyler in the war of 56 when he acted as bradstreets righthand man attributed the feeling to a different cause according to his notion of the alienation it was owing to the difference in habits and opinions which existed between schuyler as a new york gentleman and the yeomen of new england who came out in 1777 imbued with all the distinctive notions of their very peculiar state of society there may have been prejudices on both sides but it is easy to see which party exhibited most magnanimity and selfsacrifice possibly the last was inseparable from the preponderance of numbers it not being an easy thing to persuade masses of men that they can be wrong and a single individual right this is the great error of democracy which fancies truth is to be proved by counting noses while aristocracy commits the antagonist blunder of believing that excellence is inherited from male to male and that too in the order of primogeniture it is not easy to say where one is to look for truth in this life  footnote 1 it may not be amiss to remark in passing that horace walpole in one of his recently published letters speaks of a horatio gates as his godson walpole was born in 1718 and gates in 1728  as for general schuyler i have thought my father was right in ascribing his unpopularity solely to the prejudices of provinces the muse of history is the most ambitious of the whole sisterhood and never thinks she has done her duty unless all she says and records is said and recorded with an air of profound philosophy whereas more than half of the greatest events which affect human interest are to be referred to causes that have little connection with our boasted intelligence in any shape men feel far more than they reason and a little feeling is very apt to upset a great deal of philosophy  it has been said that i passed six years at princeton nominally if not in fact and that i graduated at nineteen this happened the year cornwallis surrendered and i actually served at the siege as the youngest ensign in my fathers battalion i had also the happiness for such it was to me to be attached to the company of captain coejemans a circumstance which clinched the friendship i had formed for that singular old man i say old for by this time andries was every hour of sixtyseven though as hale and hearty and active as any officer in the corps as for hardships forty years of training most of which had been passed in the woods placed him quite at our head in the way of endurance  i loved my predecessors grandfather and grandmother included not only as a matter of course but with sincere filial attachment and i loved miss mary wallace or aunt mary as i had been taught to call her quite as much on account of her quiet gentle affectionate manner as from habit and i loved major dirck follock as a sort of hereditary friend as a distant relative and a good and careful guardian of my own youth and inexperience on a thousand occasions and i loved my fathers negro man jaap as we all love faithful slaves however unnurtured they may be but andries was the man whom i loved without knowing why he was illiterate almost to greatness having the drollest notions imaginable of this earth and all it contained was anything but refined in deportment though hearty and frank had prejudices so crammed into his moral system that there did not seem to be room for anything else and was ever so little addicted moreover to that species of dutch jollification which had cost old colonel van valkenburgh his life and a love for which was a good deal spread throughout the colony nevertheless i really loved this man and when we were all disbanded at the peace or in 1783 by which time i had myself risen to the rank of captain i actually parted from old andries with tears in my eyes my grandfather general littlepage was then dead but government giving to most of us a step by means of brevet rank at the final breaking up of the army my father who had been the full colonel of the regiment for the last year bore the title of brigadier for the remainder of his days it was pretty much all he got for seven years of dangers and arduous services but the country was poor and we had fought more for principles than for the hope of rewards it must be admitted that america ought to be full of philosophy inasmuch as so much of her system of rewards and even of punishments is purely theoretical and addressed to the imagination or to the qualities of the mind thus it is that we contend with all our enemies on very unequal grounds the englishman has his knighthood his baronetcies his peerages his orders his higher ranks in the professions his batons and all the other venial inducements of our corrupt nature to make him fight while the american is goaded on to glory by the abstract considerations of virtue and patriotism after all we flog quite as often as we are flogged which is the main interest affected while on this subject i will remark that andries coejemans never assumed the empty title of major which was so graciously bestowed on him by the congress of 1783 but left the army a captain in name without halfpay or anything but his military lot to find a niece whom he was bringing up and to pursue his old business of a chainbearer     chapter ii      a trusty villain sir that very oft     when i am dull with care and melancholy     lightens my humors with his many jests                         dromio of syracuse   it will be seen that while i got a degree and what is called an education the latter was obtained by studies of a very desultory character there is no question that learning of all sorts fell off sadly among us during the revolution and the twenty years that succeeded it while colonies we possessed many excellent instructors who came from europe but the supply ceased in a great measure as soon as the troubles commenced nor was it immediately renewed at the peace i think it will be admitted that the gentlemen of the country began to be less well educated about the time i was sent to college than had been the case for the previous halfcentury and that the defect has not yet been repaired what the country may do in the first half of the nineteenth century remains to be seen2  footnote 2 the reader will recollect that mr mordaunt littlepage must have written his account of himself and his times about the close of the last or the beginning of this century since that time education has certainly advanced among us sophomores pursuing branches of learning today that were sealed from seniors a few years since learning however advances in this country on the great american principle of imparting a little to a great many instead of teaching a good deal to a feweditor  my connection with the army aided materially in weaning me from home though few youths had as many temptations to return to the paternal roof as myself there were my beloved mother and my grandmother in the first place both of whom doted on me as on an only son then aunt mary almost equally shared in my affections but i had two sisters one of whom was older and the other younger than myself the eldest who was called anneke after our dear mother was even six years my senior and was married early in the war to a gentleman of the name of kettletas mr kettletas was a person of very good estate and made my sister perfectly happy they had several children and resided in dutchess which was an additional reason for my mothers choosing that county for her temporary residence i regarded anneke or mrs kettletas much as all youths regard an elder sister who is affectionate feminine and respectable but little katrinke or kate was my pet she again was four years younger than myself and as i was just twoandtwenty when the army was disbanded she of course was only eighteen this dear sister was a little jumping laughing neverquiet merry thing when i had taken my leave of her in 1781 to join the regiment as an ensign as handsome and sweet as a rosebud and quite as full of promise i remember that old andries and i used to pass much of our time in camp in conversing about our several pets he of his niece and i of my younger sister of course i never intended to marry but kate and i were to live together she as my housekeeper and companion and i as her elder brother and protector the one great good of life with us all was peace with independence which obtained no one in our regiment at least was so little of a patriot as to doubt of the future it was laughable to see with how much gusto and simplicity the old chainbearer entered into all these boyish schemes his niece was an orphan it would seem the only child of an only but a halfsister and was absolutely dependent on him for the bread she put into her mouth it is true that this niece fared somewhat better than such a support would seem to promise having been much cared for by a female friend of her mothers who being reduced herself kept a school and had thus bestowed on her ward a far better education than she could ever have got under her uncles supervision had the last possessed the riches of the van rensselaers or of the van cortlandts as has been substantially stated old andriess forte did not lie in education and they who do not enjoy the blessings of such a character seldom duly appreciate their advantages it is with the acquisitions of the mind as with those of mere deportment and tastes we are apt to undervalue them all until made familiarly acquainted with their power to elevate and to enlarge but the niece of andries had been particularly fortunate in falling into the hands she had mrs stratton having the means and the inclination to do all for her in the way of instruction that was then done for any young woman in new york as long as she lived the death of this kind friend occurring however in 1783 andries was obliged to resume the care of his niece who was now thrown entirely on himself for support it is true the girl wished to do something for herself but this neither the pride nor the affection of the old chainbearer would listen to  what can the gal do andries said to me significantly one day that he was recounting all these particulars she cant carry chain though i do believe morty the chilt has head enough and figures enough to survey it would do your heart good to read the account of her larnin tat te olt woman used to send me though she wrote so excellent a hant herself tat it commonly took me a week to read one of her letters that is from respected friend to humble sarvent as you know them ere tings go  excellent hand why i should think andries the better the hand the easier one could read a letter  all a mistake when a man writes a scrawl himself its natral he shoult read scrawls easiest in his own case now mrs stratton was hometaught and would be likely to get into ways tat a plain man might find difficult to get along wit  do you think then of making a surveyor of your niece i asked a little pointedly  why she is hartly strong enough to travel trough the woots and the callin is not suitaple to her sex tough i woult risk her against te oldest calculator in te province  we call new york a state now captain andries you will recollect  ay tats true and i peg the states pardon well terell be scrambling enough for te land as soon as the war is fairly over and chainbearing will be a sarviceable callin once more do you know morty they talk of gifin all of our line a quantity of land privates and officers which will make me a landholter again the very character in which i started in life you will inherit acres enough and may not care so much apout owning a few huntret more or less but i own the idee is agreeaple enough to me  do you propose to commence anew as a husbandman  not i the pusiness never agreet wit me nor i wit it put a man may survey his own lot i suppose and no offence to greater scholars if i get te grant tey speak of i shall set to work and run it out on my own account and ten we shall see who understants figures and who dont if other people wont trust me it is no reason i shoult not trust myself  i knew that his having broken down in the more intellectual part of his calling was a sore point with old andries and i avoided dwelling on this part of the subject in order to divert his mind to other objects indeed i began to question him a little more closely than i had ever done before on the subject of his niece in consequence of which expedient i now learned many things that were new to me  the name of the chainbearers niece was duss malbone or so he always pronounced it in the end i discovered that duss was a sort of dutch diminutive for ursula ursula malbone had none of the coejemans blood in her notwithstanding she was andriess sisters daughter it seemed that old mrs coejemans was twice married her second husband being the father of dusss mother bob malbone as the chainbearer always called the girls father was an eastern man of very good family but was a reckless spendthrift who married duss the senior as well as i could learn for her property all of which as well as that he had inherited himself was cleverly gotten rid of within the first ten years of their union and a year or two after the girl was born both father and mother died within a few months of each other and in a very happy moment as regards worldly means leaving poor little duss with no one to care for her but her halfuncle who was then living in the forest in his regular pursuits and the mrs stratton i have mentioned there was a halfbrother bob malbone having married twice but he was in the army and had some near female relation to support out of his pay between the chainbearer and mrs stratton with an occasional offering from the brother the means of clothing nourishing and educating the young woman had been found until she reached her eighteenth year when the death of her female protector threw her nearly altogether on the care of her uncle the brother now did his share andries admitted but it was not much that he could do a captain himself his scanty pay barely sufficed to meet his own wants  i could easily see that old andries loved duss better than anything else or any other person when he was a little mellow and that was usually the extent of his debaucheries he would prate about her to me until the tears came into his eyes and once he actually proposed that i should marry her  you woult just suit each other the old man added in a very quaint but earnest manner on that memorable occasion and as for property i know you care little for money and will have enough for halfatozen i swear to you captain littlepagefor this dialogue took place only a few months before we were disbanded and after i had obtained a companyi swear to you captain littlepage te girl is laughing from morning till night and would make one of the merriest companions for an olt soldier that ever promiset to honor and obey try her once lad and see if i teceive you  that may do well enough friend andries for an old soldier whereas you will remember i am but a boy in years  ay in years but olt as a soldier mortyolt as white plains or 76 as i know from hafin seen you unter fire  well be it so but it is the man and not the soldier who is to do the marrying and i am still a very young man  you might do worse take my word for it mortaunt my dear poy for duss is fun itself and i have often spoken of you to her in a way tat will make the courtship as easy as carrying a chain on te jarmen flats  i assured my friend andries that i did not think of a wife yet and that my taste ran for a sentimental and melancholy young woman rather than for a laughing girl the old chainbearer took this repulse goodhumoredly though he renewed the attack at least a dozen times before the regiment was disbanded and we finally separated i say finally separated though it was in reference to our companionship as soldiers rather than as to our future lives for i had determined to give andries employment myself should nothing better offer in his behalf  nor was i altogether without the means of thus serving a friend when the inclination existed my grandfather herman mordaunt had left me to come into possession at the age of twentyone a considerable estate in what is now washington county a portion of our territory that lies northeast from albany and at no great distance from the hampshire grants this property of many thousands of acres in extent had been partially settled under leases by himself previously to my birth and those leases having mostly expired the tenants were remaining at will waiting for more quiet times to renew their engagements as yet ravensnest for so the estate was called had given the family little besides expense and trouble but the land being good and the improvements considerable it was time to look for some return for all our outlays this estate was now mine in fee my father having formally relinquished its possession in my favor the day i attained my majority adjacent to this estate lay that of mooseridge which was the joint property of my father and of his friend majoror as he was styled in virtue of the brevet rank granted at the peacecolonel follock mooseridge had been originally patented by my grandfather the first general littlepage and old colonel follock he who had been slain and scalped early in the war but on the descent of his moiety of the tenantry in common to dirck follock my grandfather conveyed his interest to his own son who ere long must become its owner agreeably to the laws of nature this property had once been surveyed into large lots but owing to some adverse circumstances and the approach of the troubles it had never been settled or surveyed into farms all that its owners ever got for it therefore was the privilege of paying the crown its quitrents taxes or reserved payments of no great amount it is true though far more than the estate had ever yet returned  while on the subject of lands and tenements i may as well finish my opening explanations my paternal grandfather was by no means as rich as my father though the senior and of so much higher military rank his property or neck of satanstoe nevertheless was quite valuable more for the quality of the land and its position than for its extent in addition to this he had a few thousand pounds at interest stocks banks and moneyed corporations of all kinds being then nearly unknown among us his means were sufficient for his wants however and it was a joyful day when he found himself enabled to take possession of his own house again in consequence of sir guy carletons calling in all of his detachments from westchester the morrises distinguished whigs as they were did not get back to morrisania until after the evacuation which took place november 25 1783 nor did my father return to lilacsbush until after that important event the very year my grandfather saw satanstoe he took the smallpox in camp and died  to own the truth the peace found us all very poor as was the case with almost everybody in the country but a few contractors it was not the contractors for the american army that were rich they fared worse than most people but the few who furnished supplies to the french did get silver in return for their advances as for the army it was disbanded without any reward but promises and payment in a currency that depreciated so rapidly that men were glad to spend recklessly their hardearned stock lest it should become perfectly valueless in their hands i have heard much in later years of the celebrated newburgh letters and of the want of patriotism that could lead to their having been written it may not have been wise considering the absolute want of the country to have contemplated the alternative toward which those letters certainly cast an oblique glance but there was nothing in either their execution or their drift which was not perfectly natural for the circumstances it was quite right for washington to act as he did in that crisis though it is highly probable that even washington would have felt and acted differently had he nothing but the keen sense of his neglected services poverty and forgetfulness before him in the perspective as for the young officer who actually wrote the letters it is probable that justice will never be done to any part of his conduct but that which is connected with the elegance of his diction it is very well for those who do not suffer to prate about patriotism but a country is bound to be just before it can lay a high moral claim to this exclusive devotedness to the interests of the majority fine words cost but little and i acknowledge no great respect for those who manifest their integrity principally in phrases this is said not in the way of personal apology for our regiment did not happen to be at newburgh at the disbandment if it had i think my fathers influence would have kept us from joining the malcontents but at the same time i fancy his and my own patriotism would have been much strengthened by the knowledge that there were such places as satanstoe lilacsbush mooseridge and ravensnest to return to the account of our property  my grandfather mordaunt notwithstanding his handsome bequests to me left the bulk of his estate to my mother this would have made the rest of the family rich had it not been for the dilapidations produced by the war but the houses and stores in town were without tenants who paid having been mainly occupied by the enemy and interest on bonds was hard to collect from those who lived within the british lines  in a word it is not easy to impress on the mind of one who witnesses the present state of the country its actual condition in that day as an incident that occurred to myself after i had regularly joined the army for duty will afford a lively picture of the state of things i will relate it and this the more willingly as it will be the means of introducing to the reader an old friend of the family and one who was intimately associated with divers events of my own life i have spoken of jaaf a slave of my fathers and one of about his own time of life at the time to which i allude jaaf was a middleaged grayheaded negro with most of the faults and with all the peculiar virtues of the beings of his condition and race so much reliance had my mother in particular on his fidelity that she insisted on his accompanying her husband to the wars an order that the black most willingly obeyed not only because he loved adventure but because he especially hated an indian and my fathers earliest service was against that portion of our foes although jaaf acted as a bodyservant he carried a musket and even drilled with the men luckily the littlepage livery was blue turned up with red and of a very modest character a circumstance that almost put jaaf in uniform the fellow obstinately refusing to wear the colors of any power but that of the family to which he regularly belonged in this manner jaaf had got to be a queer mixture of the servant and the soldier sometimes acting in the one capacity and sometimes in the other having at the same time not a little of the husbandman about him for our slaves did all sorts of work  my mother had made it a point that jaaf should accompany me on all occasions when i was sent to any distance from my father she naturally enough supposed i had the most need of the care of a faithful attendant and the black had consequently got to be about half transferred to me he evidently liked this change both because it was always accompanied by change of scene and the chances for new adventures and because it gave him an opportunity of relating many of the events of his youth events that had got to be worn threadbare as narratives with his ole masser but which were still fresh with his young  on the occasion to which there is allusion jaaf and i were returning to camp from an excursion of some length on which i had been sent by the general of division this was about the time the continental money made its final fall to nothing or next to nothing it having long stood at about a hundred dollars for one i had provided myself with a little silver and very precious it was and some thirty or forty thousand dollars of continental to defray my travelling expenses but my silver was expended and the paper reduced to two or three thousand dollars when it would require the whole stock of the latter to pay for jaafs and my own dinner nor were the innkeepers very willing to give their time and food for it at any price this vacuum in my purse took place when i had still two long days ride before me and in a part of the country where i had no acquaintances whatever supper and rest were needed for ourselves and provender and stabling for our horses everything of the sort was cheap enough to be sure but absolute want of means rendered the smallest charge impracticable to persons in our situation as for appealing to the patriotism of those who lived by the wayside it was too late in the war patriotism being a very evanescent quality of the human heart and particularly addicted to sneaking like compassion behind some convenient cover when it is to be maintained at any pecuniary cost it will do for a capital in a revolution or a war for the first six months perhaps but gets to be as worthless as continental money itself by the end of that period one militia draft has exhausted the patriotism of thousands of as disinterested heroes as ever shouldered muskets  jaap i asked of my companion as we drew near to the hamlet where i intended to pass the night and the comforts of a warm supper on a sharp frosty evening began to haunt my imaginationjaap how much money may you have about you3  footnote 3 this man is indiscriminately called yaf or yopyork dutch being far from severe  i masser mordauntgolly but dat a berry droll question sah  i ask because my own stock is reduced to just one york shilling which goes by the name of only a ninepence in this part of the world  dat berry little to tell e truit sah for two gentleum and two large hungry hosses berry little indeed sah i wish he war more  yet i have not a copper more i gave one thousand two hundred dollars for the dinner and baiting and oats at noon  yes sahbut dat conternental sah i supposesno great ting ater all  its a great thing in sound jaap but not much when it comes to the teeth as you perceive nevertheless we must eat and drink and our nags must eat tooi suppose they may drink without paying  yes sahdat true nough yahyahyahhow easily that negro laughedbut e cider wonnerful good in dis part of e country young masser just needer sweet nor sourden he strong as e jackass  well jaap how are we to get any of this good cider of which you speak  you tink sah dis part of e country been talk too much lately bout patty rism and e country sah  i am afraid patty has been overdone here as well as in most other counties  i may observe here that jaap always imagined the beautiful creature he had heard so much extolled and commended for her comeliness and virtue was a certain young woman of this name with whom all congress was unaccountably in love at the same time  well den sah dere no hope but our wits let me be masser tonight and you mind ole jaap if he want good supper jest ride ahead masser mordaunt and give he order like general littlepage son and leave it all to old jaap  as there was not much to choose i did ride on and soon ceased to hear the hoofs of the negros horse at my heels i reached the inn an hour ere jaap appeared and was actually seated at a capital supper before he rode up as one belonging only to himself jaap had taken off the littlepage emblems and had altogether a most independent air his horse was stabled alongside of mine and i soon found that he himself was at work on the remnants of my supper as they retreated toward the kitchen  a traveller of my appearance was accommodated with the best parlor as a matter of course and having appeased my appetite i sat down to read some documents that were connected with the duty i was on no one could have imagined that i had only a york shilling which is a pennsylvania levy or a connecticut ninepence in my purse for my air was that of one who could pay for all he wanted the certainty that in the long run my host could not be a loser giving me a proper degree of confidence i had just got through with the documents and was thinking how i should employ the hour or two that remained until it would be time to go to bed when i heard jaap tuning his fiddle in the barroom like most negroes the fellow had an ear for music and had been indulged in his taste until he played as well as half the country fiddlers that were to be met  the sound of a fiddle in a small hamlet of a cool october evening was certain of its result in half an hour the smiling landlady came to invite me to join the company with the grateful information i should not want for a partner the prettiest girl in the place having come in late and being still unprovided for on entering the barroom i was received with plenty of awkward bows and courtesies but with much simple and wellmeaning hospitality jaaps own salutations were very elaborate and altogether of a character to prevent the suspicion of our ever having met before  the dancing continued for more than two hours with spirit when the time admonished the village maidens of the necessity of retiring seeing an indication of the approaching separation jaap held out his hat to me in a respectful manner when i magnificently dropped my shilling into it in a way to attract attention and passed it around among the males of the party one other gave a shilling two clubbed and actually produced a quarter several threw in sixpences or fourpencehalfpennies and coppers made up the balance by way of climax the landlady who was goodlooking and loved dancing publicly announced that the fiddler and his horse should go scotfree until he left the place by these ingenious means of jaaps i found in my purse next morning sevenandsixpence in silver in addition to my own shilling besides coppers enough to keep a negro in cider for a week  i have often laughed over jaaps management though i would not permit him to repeat it passing the house of a man of better condition than common i presented myself to its owner though an entire stranger to him and told him my story without asking any other confirmation than my word this gentleman lent me five silver dollars which answered all my present purposes and which i trust it is scarcely necessary to say were duly repaid  it was a happy hour to me when i found myself a titular major but virtually a freeman and at liberty to go where i pleased the war had offered so little of variety or adventure since the capture of cornwallis and the pendency of the negotiations for peace that i began to tire of the army and now that the country had triumphed was ready enough to quit it the family that is to say my grandmother mother aunt mary and my youngest sister took possession of satanstoe in time to enjoy some of its delicious fruits in the autumn of 1782 and early in the following season after the treaty was signed but while the british still remained in town my mother was enabled to return to lilacsbush as consequences of these early movements my father and myself when we joined the two families found things in a better state than might otherwise have been the case the neck was planted and had enjoyed the advantage of a springs husbandry while the grounds of lilacsbush had been renovated and brought in good condition by the matured and practised taste of my admirable mother and she was admirable in all the relations of life a lady in feeling and habits whatever she touched or controlled imbibed a portion of her delicacy and sentiment even the inanimate things around her betrayed this feature of their connection with one of her sexs best qualities i remember that colonel dirk follock remarked to me one day that we had been examining the offices together something that was very applicable to this trait in my mothers character while it was perfectly just  no one can see mrs littlepages kitchen even he said altough she never seems to enter it without perceivingor perceifing as he pronounced the wordthat it is governed by a lady there are plenty of kitchens that are as clean and as large and as well furnished but it is not common to see a kitchen that gives the same ideas of good taste in the table and about the household  if this was true as to the more homely parts of the habitation how much truer was it when the distinction was carried into the superior apartments there one saw my mother in person and surrounded by those appliances which denote refinement without however any of that elaborate luxury of which we read in older countries in america we had much fine china and a good deal of massive plate regular dinnerservices excepted previously to the revolution and my mother had inherited more than was usual of both but the country knew little of that degree of domestic indulgence which is fast creeping in among us by means of its enormously increased commerce  although the fortunes of the country had undergone so much waste during seven years of internal warfare the elasticity of a young and vigorous nation soon began to repair the evil it is true that trade did not fully revive nor its connecting interests receive their great impulse until after the adoption of the constitution which brought the states under a set of common customhouse regulations nevertheless one year brought about a manifest and most beneficent change there was now some security in making shipments and the country immediately felt the consequences the year 1784 was a sort of breathingtime for the nation though long ere it was past the bone and sinew of the republic began to make themselves apparent and felt then it was that as a people this community first learned the immense advantage it had obtained by controlling its own interests and by treating them as secondary to those of no other part of the world this was the great gain of all our labors     chapter iii                    he tells her something     that makes her blood look out good sooth she is     the queen of curds and creamwinters tale   happy happy lilacsbush never can i forget the delight with which i roamed over its heights and glens and how i rioted in the pleasure of feeling i was again a sort of master in those scenes which had been the haunts of my boyhood it was in the spring of 1784 before i was folded to the arms of my mother and this too after a separation of near two years kate laughed and wept and hugged me just as she would have done five years earlier though she was now a lovely young woman turned of nineteen as for aunt mary she shook hands gave me a kind kiss or two and smiled on me affectionately in her own quiet gentle manner the house was in a tumult for jaap returned with me his wool well sprinkled with gray and there were lots of little satanstoes for such was his family name notwithstanding mrs jaap called herself miss lilacsbush children and grandchildren to welcome him to say the truth the house was not decently tranquil for the first twentyfour hours  at the end of that time i ordered my horse to ride across the country to satanstoe in order to visit my widowed grandmother who had resisted all attempts to persuade her to give up the cares of housekeeping and to come and live at lilacsbush the general for so everybody now called my father did not accompany me having been at satanstoe a day or two before but my sister did as the roads had been much neglected in the war we went in the saddle kate being one of the most spirited horsewomen of my acquaintance by this time jaap had got to be privileged doing just such work as suited his fancy or it might be better to say was not of much use except in the desultory employments that had so long been his principal pursuits and he was sent off an hour or two before we started ourselves to let mrs littlepage or his oleole missus as the fellow always called my grandmother know whom she was to expect to dinner  i have heard it said that there are portions of the world in which people get to be so sophisticated that the nearest of kin cannot take such a liberty as this the son will not presume to take a plate at the table of the father without observing the ceremony of asking or of being asked heaven be praised we have not yet reached this pass in america what parent or grandparent to the remotest living generation would receive a descendant with anything but a smile or a welcome let him come when and how he will if there be not room or preparation the deficiencies must be made up in welcomes or when absolute impossibilities interpose if they are not overcome by means of a quick invention as most such impossibilities are the truth is frankly told and the pleasure is deferred to a more fortunate moment it is not my intention to throw a vulgar and ignorant gibe into the face of an advanced civilization as is too apt to be the propensity of ignorance and provincial habits for i well know that most of the usages of those highly improved conditions of society are founded in reason and have their justification in a cultivated common sense but after all mother nature has her rights and they are not to be invaded too boldly without bringing with the acts themselves their merited punishments  it was just nine on a fine may morning when kate  littlepage and myself rode through the outer gate of lilacsbush and issued upon the old wellknown kingsbridge road kingsbridge that name still remains as do those of the counties of kings and queens and duchess to say nothing of quantities of princes this and that in other states and i hope they always may remain as so many landmarks in our history these names are all that now remain among us of the monarchy and yet have i heard my father say a hundred times that when a young man his reverence for the british throne was second only to his reverence for the church in how short a time has this feeling been changed throughout an entire nation or if not absolutely changed for some still continue to reverence monarchy how widely and irremediably has it been impaired such are the things of the world perishable and temporary in their very natures and they would do well to remember the truth who have much at stake in such changes  we stopped at the door of the inn at kingsbridge to say good morning to old mrs light the landlady who had now kept the house half a century and who had known us and our parents before us from childhood this loquacious housewife had her good and bad points but habit had given her a sort of claim on our attentions and i could not pass her door without drawing the rein if it were only for a moment this was no sooner done than the landlady in person was on her threshold to greet us  ay i dreamt this mr mordaunt the old woman exclaimed the instant she saw mei dreamt this no later than last week it is nonsense to deny it dreams do often come true  and what has been your dream this time mrs light i asked well knowing it was to come and the sooner we got it the better  i dreamt the general had come home last fall and he had come home now the only idee i had to help out that dream was a report that he was to be home that day but you know mr mordaunt or major littlepage they tell me i ought now to call youbut you know mr mordaunt how often reports turn out to be nothing i count a report as no great help to a dream so last week i dreamed you would certainly be home this week and here you are sure enough  and all without any lying report to help you my good landlady  why no great matter a few flying rumors perhaps but as i never believe them when awake its onreasonable to suppose a body would believe em when asleep yes jaaf stopped a minute to water his horse this morning and i foresaw from that moment my dream would come to be true though i never exchanged a word with the nigger  that is a little remarkable mrs light as i supposed you always exchanged a few words with your guests  not with the blacks major its apt to make em sassy sassiness in a nigger is a thing i cant abide and therefore i keep em all at a distance well the times that i have seen major since you went off to the wars and the changes we have had our clergyman dont pray any longer for the king and queenno more than if there wasnt sich people living  not directly perhaps but as a part of the church of god i trust we all pray for congress now  well i hope good will come out of it i must say major that his majestys officers spent more freely and paid in better money than the continental gentlemen ive had em both here by rijjiments and thats the character i must give em in honesty  you will remember they were richer and had more money than our people it is easy for the rich to appear liberal  yes i know that sir and you ought and do know it too the littlepages are rich and always have been and they are liberal too lord bless your smiling pretty faces i knowed your family long afore you knowed it yourselves i knowd old captain hugh roger your greatgrandther and the old general your grandther and now i know the young general and you well this will not be the last of you i dares to say and therell be light hearts and happy ones among the bayards ill answer for it now the wars are over and young major littlepage has got back  this terminated the discourse for by this time i had enough of it and making my bow kate and i rode on still i could not but be struck with the last speech of the old woman and most of all with the manner in which it was uttered the name of bayard was well known among us belonging to a family of which there were several branches spread through the middle states as far south as delaware but i did not happen to know a single individual of them all what then could my return have to do with the smiles or frowns of any of the name of bayard it was natural enough after ruminating a minute or two on the subject that i should utter some of my ideas on such a subject to my companion  what could the old woman mean kate i abruptly commenced by saying there would now be light hearts and happy ones among the bayards  poor mrs light is a great gossip mordaunt and it may be questioned if she know her own meaning half the time all the bayards we know are the family at the hickories and with them you have doubtless heard my mother has long been intimate  i have heard nothing about it child all i know is that there is a place called the hickories up the river a few miles and that it belongs to some of the bayards but i never heard of any intimacy on the contrary i remember to have heard that there was a lawsuit once between my grandfather mordaunt and some old bayard or other and i thought we were a sort of hereditary strangers  that is quite forgotten and my mother says it all arose from a mistake we are decided friends now  im sure i am very glad to hear it for since it is peace let us have peace though old enemies are not apt to make very decided friends  but we never werethat is my grandfather never was an enemy of anybody and the whole matter was amicably settled just before he went to europe on his unfortunate visit to sir harry bulstrode nonomy mother will tell you mordaunt that the littlepages and the bayards now regard each other as very decided friends  kate spoke with so much earnestness that i was disposed to take a look at her the face of the girl was flushed and i fancy she had a secret consciousness of the fact for she turned it from me as if gazing at some object in the opposite direction thereby preventing me from seeing much of it  i am very glad to learn all this i answered a little dryly as i am a littlepage it would have been awkward not to have known it had i accidentally met with one of these bayards does the peace include all of the name or only those of the hickories  kate laughed then she was pleased to tell me that i was to consider myself the friend of all of the name  and most especially of those of the name who dwell at the hickories  how many may there be of this especially peaceful breed six a dozen or twenty  only four so your task will make no very heavy demand on your affections your heart has room i trust for four more friends  for a thousand if i can find them my dear i can accept as many friends as you please but have places for none else all the other niches are occupied  occupiedi hope that is not true mordaunt one place at least is vacant  true i had forgotten a place must be reserved for the brother you will one day give me well name him as soon as you please i shall be ready to love him child  i may never make so heavy a draft on your affections anneke has given you a brother already and a very excellent one he is and that ought to satisfy a reasonable man  ay so all you young women say between fifteen and twenty but you usually change your mind in the end the sooner you tell me who the youth is therefore the sooner i shall begin to like himis he one of the bayardsun chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  kate had a brilliant complexion in common but as i now turned my eyes toward her inquiringly more in mischief however than with the expectation of learning anything new i saw the roses of her cheeks expand until they covered her temples the little beaver she wore and which became her amazingly did not suffice to conceal these blushes and i now really began to suspect i had hit on a vein that was sensitive but my sister was a girl of spirit and though it was no difficult thing to make her change color it was by no means easy to look her down  i trust your new brother mordaunt should there ever be such a person will be a respectable man if not absolutely without reproach she answered but if there be a tom bayard there is also a pris bayard his sister  sosothis is all news to me indeed as to mr thomas bayard i shall ask no questions my interest in him if there is to be any being altogether ex officio as one may say and coming as a matter of course but you will excuse me if i am a little curious on the subject of miss priscilla bayard a lady you will remember i never saw  my eye was on kate the whole time and i fancied she looked gratified though she still looked confused  ask what you will brotherpriscilla bayard can bear a very close examination  in the first place then did that old gossip allude to miss priscilla by saying there would be light hearts and happy ones among the bayards  nay i cannot answer for poor mrs lights conceits put your questions in some other form  is there much intimacy between the people of the bush and those of the hickories  greatwe like them exceedingly and i think they like us  does this intimacy extend to the young folk or is it confined to the old  that is somewhat personal said kate laughing as i happen to be the only young folk at the bush to maintain the said intimacy as there is nothing to be ashamed of however but on the contrary much of which one may be proud i shall answer that it includes all ages and both sexes everybody but yourself in a word  and you like old mr bayard  amazingly  and old mrs bayard  she is a very agreeable person and an excellent wife and mother  and you love pris bayard  as the apple of mine eye the girl answered with emphasis  and you like tom bayard her brother  as much as is decent and proper for one young woman to like the brother of another young woman whom she admits that she loves as the apple of her eye  although it was not easy at least not easy for me to cause kate littlepage to hold her tongue it was not easy for her to cause the telltale blood always to remain stationary she was surprisingly beautiful in her blushes and as much like what i had often fancied my dear mother might have been in her best days as possible at the very moment she was making these replies as steadily as if they gave her no trouble  how is all this then connected with rejoicings among the people of the hickories at my return are you the betrothed of tom bayard and have you been waiting for my return to give him your hand  i am not the betrothed of tom bayard and have not been waiting for your return to give him my hand answered kate steadily as for mrs lights gossipings you cannot expect me to explain them she gets her reports from servants and others of that class and you know what such reports are usually worth but as for my waiting for your return brother in order to announce such an event you little know how much i love you if you suppose i would do any such thing  kate said this with feeling and i thanked her with my eyes but could not have spoken and did not speak until we had ridden some distance after this pause i renewed the discourse with some of its original spirit  on that subject katrinke dear i said i trust we understand each other single or married you will ever be very dear to me and i own i should be hurt to be one of the last to learn your engagement whenever that may happen and now for this priscilla bayarddo you expect me to like her  do i it would be one of the happiest moments of my life mordaunt when i could hear you acknowledge that you love her  this was uttered with great animation and in a way to show that my sister was very much in earnest i felt some surprise when i put this feeling in connection with the landladys remarks and began to suspect there might be something behind the curtain worthy of my knowledge in order to make discoveries however it was necessary to pursue the discourse  of what age is miss bayard i demanded  she is two months my seniorvery suitable is it not  i do not object to the difference which will do very well is she accomplished  not very you know few of us girls who have been educated during the revolution can boast of much in that way though priscilla is better than common  than of her class you mean of course  certainlybetter than most young ladies of our best families  is she amiable  as anneke herself  this was saying a great deal our eldest sister as often happens in families being its paragon in the way of all the virtues and annekes temper being really serenity itself  you give her a high character and one few girls could sustain is she sensible and wellinformed  enough so as often to make me feel ashamed of myself she has an excellent mother mordaunt and i have heard you say often that the mother would have great influence with you in choosing a wife  that must have been when i was very young child before i went to the army where we look more at the young than at the old women but why a wife is it all settled between the old people that i am to propose to this priscilla bayard and are you a party to the scheme  kate laughed with all her heart but i fancied she looked conscious  you make no answer young lady and you must permit me to remind you that there is an express compact between you and me to treat each other frankly on all occasions this is one on which i especially desire to see the conditions of the treaty rigidly enforced does any such project exist  not as a project discussed and plannednocertainly not no a thousand times no but i shall run the risk of frustrating one of my most cherished hopes by saying honestly that you could not gratify my dear mother aunt mary and myself more than by falling in love with pris bayard we all love her ourselves and we wish you to be of the party knowing that your love would probably lead to a connection we should all like more than i can express there you cannot complain of a want of frankness for i have heard it said again and again that the wishes of friends indiscreetly expressed are very apt to set young men against the very person it is desired to make them admire  quite likely to be true as a rule though in my case no effect good or bad will be produced but how do the bayards feel in this matter  how should i know of course no allusion has ever been made to any of the family on the subject and as none of them know you it is imthat is no allusioni meancertainly not to more than one of them i believe some vague remarks may have been ventured to onebut  by yourself and to your friend pris  neversaid kate with emphasis such a subject could never be mentioned between us  then it must have been between the old ladiesthe two mothers probably  i should think not mrs bayard is a woman of reserve and mamma has an extreme sense of propriety as you know yourself that would not be likely to permit such a thing  would the general think of contracting me when my back was turned  not hepapa troubles himself very little about such things ever since his return home he has been courting mamma over again he tells us  surely aunt mary has not found words for such an allusion  she indeed poor dear aunt mary it is little she meddles with any ones concerns but her own do you know mordaunt that mamma has told me the whole of her story lately and the reason why she has refused so many excellent offers i dare say if you ask her she will tell you  i know the whole story already from the general child but if this matter has been alluded to to one of the bayards and neither my father mother nor aunt mary has made the allusion on our side and neither mr bayard his wife nor daughter has been the party to whom the allusion has been made on the other there remain only yourself and tom to hold the discourse i beg you to explain this point with your customary frankness  kate littlepages face was scarlet she was fairly caught though i distrusted the truth from the moment she so stammered and hesitated in correcting her first statement i will own i enjoyed the girls confusion it made her appear so supremely lovely and i was almost as proud of her as i tenderly loved her dear dear kate from my childhood i had my own amusement with her though i do not remember anything like a harsh expression or an unkind feeling that has ever passed or indeed existed between us a finer study than the face of my sister offered for the next minute was never presented to the eye of man and i enjoyed it so much the more from a strong conviction that while so deeply confused she was not unhappy native ingenuousness maiden modesty her habit of frank dealing with me and a wish to continue so to deal were all struggling together in her fine countenance forming altogether one of the most winning pictures of womanly feelings i had ever witnessed at length the love of fairdealing and love of me prevailed over a factitious shame the color settled back to those cheeks whence it had appeared to flash as it might be remaining just enough heightened to be remarked and kate looked toward me in a way that denoted all the sisterly confidence and regard that she actually felt  i did not intend to be the one to communicate to you a fact mordaunt in which i know you will feel a deep interest for i had supposed my mother would save me the confusion of telling it to you but now there is no choice between resorting to equivocations that i do not like and using our old longestablished frankness  the long and short of which my dear sister is to say that you are engaged to mr bayard  no not as strong as that brother mr bayard has offered and my answer is deferred until you have met him i would not engage myself mordaunt until you approved of my choice  i feel the compliment katrinke and will be certain to repay it in kind depend on it you shall know in proper season when it is my wish to marry and shall be heard  there is a difference between the claims of an elder and an only brother and of a mere girl who ought to place much dependence on the advice of friends in making her own selection  you will not be a mere girl when that time comes but a married woman yourself and competent to give good counsel from your own experience to return to tom however he is the member of his family to whom the allusion was made  he was mordaunt answered kate in a low voice  and you were the person who made it  very truewe were talking of you one day and i expressed a strong hope that you would see priscilla with the eyes with which i can assure you all the rest of your family see her that was all  and that was quite enough child to cause tom bayard to hang himself if he were a lover of the true temper  hang himself brother i am sure i do not understand why  oh merely at the palpable discouragement such a wish would naturally convey to the brother of the young lady since he must have seen you were willing to connect the two families by means other than giving him your own hand  kate laughed but as she did not look much confused or at all alarmed i was induced to believe that more important encouragement than could be afforded by means of her wish of marrying me to her suitors sister had been given master tom and that my disapproval of the gentleman would cause her more concern than she chose to avow we rode on however some little distance without eithers offering to renew the discourse at length as became my sex i spoke  when am i to see this paragon young man and paragon young woman kate since see both i must  not paragon young man brother i am certain i have called him by no such name tom bayard is a good fellow but i do not know that he is by any means a paragon  he is a goodlooking fellow in the bargain i take it for granted  not so much so as you are yourself if that will gratify your vanity  it ought to coming from such a quarter my question is still unanswered notwithstanding  to own the truth to you mordaunt i expect we shall find tom bayard and pris at satanstoe to dine with my grandmother she wrote me word a day or two since that both are asked and that she hoped both would accept  the old lady is then in the plot and intends to marry me will ye nill ye i had thought this visit altogether a scheme of my own  kate again laughed and told me i might make my own observations on that point and judge for myself as for the visit i had only accidentally favored a project of others the conversation now changed and for several miles we rode along conversing of the scenes of the war without adverting to the bayards or to marriages  we were within half a mile of the gate of the neck and within a mile of the house when we met jaap returning to lilacsbush and carrying some fruit to my mother after having discharged his commission of an avantcourier from kates remark i had discovered we had been invited by letter to take this excursion though the ceremony of sending the negro across with his message had been observed for reasons that were not very natural under the circumstances i made no remark however determining to see and judge for myself  as a matter of course we drew our reins and stopped to exchange a few words with the black  well jaap how did the neck look after so long an absence i inquired  it look sah no means as well as ole missus who do look capital for such a lady dey do woners with e neck sah if you just believe all young nigger say but what you tink masser mordy i hear at e tavern where i jist stop sah to water ole dick  and to get a sup of cider for old jaaphereupon the negro laughed heartily though he had the impudence neither to own nor to deny the imputation his weakness in favor of wringjaw being a wellestablished failingwell what did you hear while taking down the usual mug  i ony get half a mug dis time sah ole ole missus nebber forgettin to give me jist as much as i want well sah while old dick drink e new landlady who come from connetick you know sah she say to me where you go ole color gentleum dat war civil anyhow  to which you answered  i answer her sah and say i go to satanstoe whar i come from long time go  whereupon she made some observation or otherwell what was ityou keep miss littlepage waiting  lor bless her sahit my business to wait on miss katrinke not her business to wait on mewhy you speak so droll now masser mordy  never mind all that jaap what did the new connecticut lady say when you told her you were going to satanstoe the place where you had come from a long time ago  what she say masser mordy sahshe say great foolishness and make me mad what you call by dat awful name she say making face like as if she see a spook you must mean dibbleton she saydat e way all e people as is genteel call e neck did you ebber hear e like sah  oh yes i heard the like of it as soon as i was born the attempt to change the name of our old place having existed now these thirty years why some people call hellgate hurlgate after that one may expect anything do you not know jaap a yankee is never satisfied unless he is effecting changes one half his time he is altering the pronunciation of his own names and the other half he is altering ours let him call the place what he will you and i will stick to satanstoe  dat we will sahgib e debbil his due sah dat an ole sayin im sure anybody as has eyes can see where his toe hab turn up e sile and shape it he own wayno dibble dere sah  thus saying jaap rode on my sister and myself doing the same pursuing the discourse that had thus accidentally arisen among us  is it not odd brother that strangers should have this itching to alter the name of my grandmothers place said kate after we had parted from the black it is a homely name certainly but it has been used now a good deal more than a century and time at least should entitle it to be let alone  ay my dear but you are not yet aware of the desires and longings and efforts and ambition of a little learning i have seen enough in my short career to know there is a spirit up among us that calls itself by the pretending title of the spirit of improvement which is likely to overturn more important things than the name of our poor neck it is a spirit that assumes the respectable character of a love of liberty and under that mask it gives play to malice envy covetousness rapacity and all the lowest passions of our nature among other things it takes the provincial pretence of a mockrefinement and flatters an elegance of thought that is easiest attained by those who have no perceptions of anything truly elevated by substituting sqeamishness and affectations for the simplicity of nature and a good tone of manners     chapter iv      beat against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner     bene fair beatrice i thank you for your pains     beat i took no more pains for these thanks than           you take pains to thank me if it had been painful           i would not have comemuch ado about nothing   in the porch of the house at satanstoe stood my dear grandmother and the notable tom bayard to receive us the first glance at the latter told me that he was a proper man and by the second i got the pleasing assurance that he had no eye just then but for kate this was pleasant to know as i never could have been happy in consenting to yield that dear girl to any but a man who appreciated her worth and fully admired her beauty as to my dear ole ole grandmother who was not so very old neither being still under seventy her reception of us was just what i had ever found it warm affectionate and gentle she called my father the general corny even when she spoke to him in a room full of company though for that matter i have heard my mother who was much more of a woman of the world having lived a great deal in society do the same thing when she thought herself alone i have read some priggish book or other written no doubt by one who knew men only through pages like his own decry such familiarities but i have generally found those the happiest families and at the bottom the best toned where it was jack and tom and bob and dick and bess and di as for your louisa adelinas and robert augustuses and all such elaborate respect i frankly declare i have a contempt for it those are the sort of people who would call satanstoe dibbleton hellgate hurlgate and themselves accomplished thank heaven we had no such nonsense at lilacsbush or at the neck my father was corny my mother anneke katrinke kate and i was mordy or mord or when there was no hurry mordaunt  tom bayard met my salutations frankly and with a gentlemanlike ease though there was a slight color on his cheek which said to me i mean to get your sister yet i liked the fellows manner there was no grasping of the hand and coming forward to rush into an intimacy at the first moment we met but he returned my bow graciously and gracefully and his smile as he did so seemed to invite farther and better acquaintance  now i have seen a man cross a whole room to shake hands at an introduction to an utter stranger and maintain a countenance the whole time as sombre as if he were condoling with him on the loss of his wife this habit of shaking hands dolefully is growing among us and is imported from some of our sister states for it is certainly not a new york custom except among intimates and it is a bad usage in my opinion as it destroys one of the best means of graduating feelings and is especially ungraceful at an introduction but alas there are so many such innovations that one cannot pretend to predict where they are to stop i never shook hands at an introduction unless it were under my own roof and when i wished to denote a decidedly hospitable feeling until after i was forty it was thought vulgar in my younger days and i am not quite certain it is not thought so now  in the little oldfashioned drawingroom as of late years my good grandmother had been persuaded to call what was once only the best parlor we found miss priscilla bayard who for some reason that was unexplained did not come to the porch to meet her friend she was in truth a charming girl with fine dark eyes glossy hair a delicate and ladylike form and a grace of manner that denoted perfect familiarity with the best company of the land kate and pris embraced each other with a warmth and sincerity that spoke in favor of each and with perfect nature an affected american girl by the way is very uncommon and nothing strikes me sooner when i see my own countrywomen placed at the side of europeans than the difference in this respect the one seems so natural while the other is so artificial  my own reception by miss bayard was gracious though i fancied it was not entirely free from the consciousness of having on some idle occasion heard her own name intimately connected with mine perhaps kate in their confidential moments may have said something to this effect or i may have been mistaken  my grandmother soon announced that the whole party was to pass the night at satanstoe as we were accustomed to such plans neither kate nor myself raised the least objection while the bayards submitted to orders which i soon discovered even they were not unused to with perfect good will and submission thus brought together in the familiarity of a quiet and small party in a country house we made great progress in intimacy and by the time dinner was over or by four oclock i felt like an old acquaintance with those who had so lately been strangers to me even by name as for bayard and my sister they were in the best of humors from the start and i felt satisfied their affair was a settled thing in their own minds but miss priscilla was a little under constraint for an hour or two like a person who felt a slight embarrassment this wore off however and long before we left the table she had become entirely herself and a very charming self it was i was forced to admit i say forced for spite of all i had said and a certain amount of good sense i hope it was impossible to get rid of the distrust which accompanied the notion that i was expected to fall in love with the young lady my poor grandmother contributed her share too to keeping this feeling alive the manner in which she looked from one to the other and the satisfied smile that passed over her countenance whenever she observed pris and myself conversing freely betrayed to me completely that she was in the secret and had a hand in what i chose to regard as a sort of plot  i had heard that my grandmother had set her heart on the marriage of my parents a year or two before matters came round and that she always fancied she had been very instrumental in forming a connection that had been as happy as her own the recollection or the fancy of this success most probably encouraged her to take a share in the present scheme and i have always supposed that she got us all together on that occasion in order to help the great project along  a walk on the neck was proposed in the cool of the evening for satanstoe had many a pleasant path pretty vista and broad view away we went then the four of us kate leading the way as the person most familiar with the capabilities we were soon on the shore of the sound and at a point where a firm wide beach of sand had been left by the receding waters rocks fringing the inner boundary toward the main here one could walk without confinement of any sort there being room to go in pairs or all abreast as we might choose miss bayard seeming a little coy and manifesting a desire to keep near her friend i abandoned the intention of walking at her side but fell behind a little and got into discourse with her brother nor was i sorry to have this early opportunity of sounding the party who was likely soon to become so nearly connected with me after a few minutes the conversation turned on the late revolution and the manner in which it was likely to influence the future fortunes of the country i knew that a portion of the family of my companion had adhered to the crown losing their estates by the act of confiscation but i also knew that a portion did not and i was left to infer that toms branch belonged to the latter division of his name inasmuch as his father was known to be very easy in his circumstances if not absolutely rich it was not long however before i ascertained that my new friend was a mild tory and that he would have been better pleased had the rights we had sought and which he was willing enough to admit had been violated been secured without a separation of the two countries as the littlepages had actually been in arms against the crown three generations of them too at the same time and the fact could be no secret i was pleased with the candor with which tom bayard expressed his opinions on these points for it spoke well of the truth and general sincerity of his character  does it not strike you as a necessary consequence of the distance between the two countries i remarked in the course of the conversation that a separation must sooner or later have occurred it is impossible that two countries should long have common rulers when they are divided by an ocean admitting that our separation has been a little premature a circumstance i should deny in a particular discussion it is an evil that every hour has a tendency to lessen  separations in families are always painful major littlepage when accompanied by discussions doubly so  quite true yet they always happen if not in this generation in the next  i do think said tom bayard looking at me a little imploringly that we might have got along with our difficulties without casting aside our allegiance to the king  ay that has been the stumblingblock with thousands and yet it is in truth the very weakest part of the transatlantic side of the question of what avail is allegiance to the king if parliament uses its power in a way to make american interests subservient to those of england a great deal may be said that is reasonable in favor of kingly power that i am ready enough to allow but very little that renders one people subject to another this thing called loyalty blinds men to facts and substitutes a fancied for a real power the question has been whether england by means of a parliament in which we have no representative is to make laws for us or not and not whether george iii is to be our sovereign or whether we are to establish the sovereignty of the people4  footnote 4 this short dialogue is given in the text because it is found in mr mordaunt littlepages manuscript and not because the state of feeling in this country today has any connection with the opinions expressed the american nation as a whole is now as completely emancipated from english political influence as if the latter never had an existence the emancipation is too complete indeed the effect having brought with it a reaction that is on many points running into error in a contrary direction the third of our manuscripts having something to do with these excesses of opinion but mr mordaunt littlepage appears to have some near glimmerings of the principles which lay at the root of the american revolution though the principle itself does not appear to have been openly recognized anywhere at the time the king of england was originally king of america as he was king of ireland and king of scotland it is true there was no american flag the system excluding the colonies from any power on the ocean then each colony existed as independent of the others except through their common allegiance the revolution of 1688 slowly brought parliament into the ascendant and by the time george iii ascended the throne that ascendancy had got to be almost undisputed now america had no proper connection with parliament which in that day represented england and wales only and this was a state of things which made one country dependent on the other a subserviency of interests that clearly could last only so long as the party governed was too weak to take care of itself  bayard bowed civilly enough to my remark and he changed the subject sufficient had been said however to satisfy me that there would be little political sympathy between us let the family tie be drawn as close as it might the girls joined us before we had got altogether into another vein of discourse and i was a little chagrined at finding that kate entered rather more into her admirers views of such subjects than comported with the true feelings as i fancied of a littlepage after all that had passed still as i should have liked the woman i loved to agree with me in opinion as much as possible in everything i was not disposed to judge harshly of my sister on that account on the other hand to my surprise i found miss priscilla a zealous and to say the truth a somewhat blind patriot condemning england the king and the efforts of parliament with a warmth that was only equal to that with which she defended everything act measure principle or policy that was purely american  i cannot say i had as much tolerance for the patriotism of miss bayard as i had for the petit treason of my sister it seemed natural enough that kate should begin to look at things of this nature with the eyes of the man she had made up her mind to marry but it looked far more like management in her friend who belonged to a tory family to volunteer so freely the sentiments of one she could not yet love inasmuch as until that day she had never even seen him  is it not so major littlepage cried this lovely creature for very lovely she was beyond all dispute and feminine and delicate and ladylike and all i could have wished her had she only been a little less of a whig and a good deal more of a tory her eyes sparkling and flashing at the same time as if she felt all she was saying from the very bottom of her heartis it not so major littlepageamerica has come out of this war with imperishable glory and her history a thousand years hence will be the wonder and admiration of all who read it  that will somewhat depend on what her history may prove to be between that day and this the early history of all great nations fills us with admiration and interest while mightier deeds effected by an insignificant people are usually forgotten  still this revolution has been one of which any nation might have been proud  as it would not have been proper to deny this i bowed and strayed a little from the rest of the party under the pretence of looking for shells my sister soon joined me when the following short conversation passed between us  you find pris bayard a stanch whig major littlepage commenced my warmhearted sister  very much so but i had supposed the bayards excessively neutral if not absolutely the other way  oh that is true enough of most of them but not with pris who has long been a decided whig there is tom now rather moderate in his opinions while the father and mother are what you call excessively neutral but pris has been a whig almost as long as i have known her  almost as long she was then a tory once  hardly though certainly her opinions have undergone a very gradual change we are both young you will remember and girls at their first coming out do very little of their own thinking for the last three years certainly or since she was seventeen pris has been getting to be more and more of a whig and less and less of a tory do you not find her decidedly handsome mordaunt  very decidedly so and very winning in all that belongs to her sexgentle feminine ladylike lovely and withal a whig  i knew you would admire her cried kate in triumph i shall live to see my dearest wish accomplished  i make no doubt you will child though it will not be by the marriage of a mr littlepage to a miss bayard  i got a laugh and a blush for this sally but no sign of submission on the contrary the positive girl shook her head until her rich curls were all in motion and she laughed none the less we immediately joined our companions and by one of those crossings over and figurings in that are so familiar to the young of the two sexes we were soon walking along the sands again tom at kates side and i at that of priscilla bayards what the other two talked about i never knew though i fancy one might guess but the young lady with me pursued the subject of the revolution  you have probably been a little surprised major littlepage she commenced to hear me express myself so warmly in favor of this country as some of the branches of my family have been treated harshly by the new government  you allude to the confiscations i never justified them and wish they had not been made for they fall heaviest on those who were quite inoffensive while most of our active enemies have escaped still it is no more than is usual in civil wars and what would surely have befallen us had it been our fortune to be the losing party  so i have been told but as no loss has fallen on any who are very near to me my public virtue has been able to resist private feeling my brother as you may have seen is less of an american than i am myself  i have supposed he is one of the extremely neutral and they i have thought always incline a little in favor of the losing party  i hope however his political bias which is very honest though very much in error will not materially affect him in your good opinion too much depends on that for me not to be anxious on the subject and being the only decided whig in the family i have thought i would venture to speak in behalf of a very dearly beloved brother  well i said to myself this is being sufficiently managing but i am not quite so unpractised as to be the dupe of an artifice so little concealed the deuce is in the girl yet she seems in earnest looks at me with the good faith and simplicity of a sister who feels even more than she expresses and is certainly one of the loveliest creatures i ever laid eyes on i must not let her see how much i am on my guard but must meet management with management it will be singular indeed if i who have commanded a company of continentals with some credit cannot get along with a girl of twenty though she were even handsomer and looked still more innocent than this pris bayard which would be no easy matter by the way  the reader will understand this was what i said to myself and it was soon uttered for one talks surprisingly fast to himself but that which i said to my fair companion after a moments hesitation was very different in language and import  i do not understand in what way mr bayard can be affected by my opinion let it be for or against him i answered with just as much innocency of expression according to my notion of the matter as the young lady herself had thrown into her own pretty countenance thereby doing myself infinite credit in my own conceit though i am far from judging any man severely because he happens to differ from me in his judgment of public things the question was one of great delicacy and the most honest men have differed the widest on its merits  you do not know how glad i am to hear you say this mr littlepage returned my companion with one of the sweetest smiles woman ever bestowed on man it will make tom completely happy for i know he has been sadly afraid of you on this very point  i did not answer instantly for i believe i was watching the traces of that bewitching smile and speculating against its influence with the pertinacity of a man who was determined not to be taken in that smile haunted me for a week and it was a long time before i fully comprehended it i decided however to come to the point at once as respects bayard and my sister and not be beating the bush with indirect allusions  in what manner can my opinion influence your brother miss bayard i asked as soon as i was ready to say anything to prevent misconceptions let me beg of you to be a little more explicit  you can hardly be ignorant of my meaning i should think answered priscilla with a little surprise one has only to look at the couple before us to comprehend how your opinion of the gentleman might have an influence on himself at least  the same might be said of us miss bayard so far as my inexperienced eye can tell they are a young couple walking together the gentleman appearing to admire the lady i will confess and we are a young couple walking together the gentleman appearing to admire the lady or he does no credit to his taste or sensibility  there said i to myself again that is giving her quite as good as i received let me see how you take that  pris took it very well laughing and blushing just enough to make her appear the loveliest creature i had ever laid eyes on she shook her head very much as my sister had done not long before and disclaimed the analogy first in her manner and next with her tongue  the cases are very different sir she answered we are strangers to each other while tom bayard and kate littlepage are acquaintances of years standing we do not love each other in the least not a bit though we are inclined to think very well of each other on account of the interest we take in the couple before us and because i am the intimate friend of your only sister and because you are the only brother of my intimate friend there however and she now spoke with emphasis our interest ceases never to be increased beyond a friendly regard that i trust will grow up out of our respective merits and respective discernment it is very very different with the couple before us here again the flexible girl spoke with extreme feeling every tone and cadence of her voice denoting lively sensibility they have been long attached not admirers of each other as you call it major littlepage but attached and your opinion of my brother just at this moment is of the last importance to him i hope i have at last made myself understood  perfectly and i intend to be just as explicit in the first place i enter a solemn protest against all that you have said about the other couple with the exception of the interest we each feel in the brother or sister next i proclaim kate littlepage to be her own mistress so far as her brother mordaunt is concerned and lastly i announce that i see or know nothing in the character connections fortune person or position of her suitor thomas bayard of the hickories esquire that is in the least below her pretensions or merits i hope that is sufficiently satisfactory  entirely so and from the bottom of my heart i thank you for it i will own i have had some little apprehensions on the subject of toms political opinions but those removed nothing else can remain to create the smallest uneasiness  how is it possible that any of you could consider my notions of so much importance when kate has a father a mother and a grandmother living all of whom as i understand things approve of her choice  ah mr littlepage you are not conscious of your importance in your own family i see i know it better than you appear to know it yourself father mother grandmother and sister all think and speak of mordaunt alike to hear the general converse of the war you would suppose that he had commanded a company and captain littlepage the regiment mr littlepage defers to mordaunts taste and mordaunts opinions and mordaunts judgment even in housekeeping and hemstitching kate is forever saying my brother says this my brother writes that my brother does tother and as for the old lady here at the toe she would hardly think her peaches and cherries could ripen unless mordaunt littlepage the son of her son corny littlepageby no accident does she ever call him generalwere on the face of the earth to create an eternal sunshine  was there ever a girl like this that speech was made too in the quietest most gentle ladylike manner possible that the young lady had spirit and humor enough was very apparent and for a moment i doubted whether both were not accompanied by the most perfect simplicity of character and the most perfect good faith subsequent remarks and occurrences however soon revived all my original distrusts  this is a vivid picture of family weaknesses that you have so graphically drawn miss bayard i answered and i shall not easily forget it what renders it the more lively and pointed and the more likely to be relished by the world is the fact that mordaunt so little deserves the extreme partiality of the friends you have mentioned  the last feature forms no part of my picture major littlepage and i disown it as for the world it will never know anything about it you and i are not the world nor are we at all likely ever to be the world to each other i wish you particularly to understand that which is the reason i am so frank with you on so short an acquaintance i tell you your opinion is of the last importance to tom as your sister would not marry him did she believe you thought in the least ill of him  and she would did i think well of him  that is a question a lady must answer for herself and now we will say no more on the subject for my mind is easy since i find you entertain no political hostility to tom  men are much less apt to entertain such feelings i fancy after they have fairly fought out a quarrel than when they only talk over its heads besides the winning party is commonly the least rancorous and success will make us whigs forgiving i give you my honor no objection will be raised against your brother by me on account of his opinions of the revolution my dear mother herself has been half a tory the whole war and kate i find has imbibed all her charity  a singular and as i found a painful smile crossed the sweet face of priscilla bayard as i made this remark but she did not answer it it seemed to me she was now desirous of quitting the subject entirely and i immediately led the discourse to other things  kate and i remained at satanstoe several days and tom bayard was a daily visitor the distance between the neck and the hickories being no great matter i saw the young lady twice during the interval once by riding over to her fathers residence with that express object and once when she came across on horseback to see her friend i confess i was never more at a loss to understand a character than i was that of this young woman she was either profoundly managing or as innocent and simple as a child it was easy to see that her brother my sister my grandmother and as i fancied the parents of the young lady herself were anxious that i should be on as good terms as possible with pris as they all called her though i could not fathom her own feelings on the subject it would have been unnatural not to have loved to gaze on her exceeding beauty or not to have admired her extremely graceful and feminine manner which was precisely all that one could wish it to be in the way of ease and selfpossession without being in the least free or forward and i did gaze on the one and admire the other at the very moment i was most disposed to distrust her sincerity and to believe her nature the very perfection of art there were times when i was disposed to fancy this pris bayard as profound and skilful an actor as one of her sex years and condition in life could well become without falling altogether and there were moments too when she seemed to be instinct with all the sensitive and best qualities of her sex  it is scarcely necessary to say i remained heartwhole under such circumstances notwithstanding the obvious wishes of my friends and the young ladys great advantages a man no more falls blindly in love when he distrusts anything amiss than he sees anything amiss when he is blindly in love it has often been a matter of surprise to me how often and how completely the wisest of the earthly races conspire to deceive themselves when suspicions are once excited testimony is not needed condemnation following much as a logical induction though founded on nothing better than plausible distrusts while on the other hand where confidence exists testimony is only too apt to be disregarded women in particular are peculiarly apt to follow the bias of their affections rather than of their reasons in all cases connected with guilt they are hard to be convinced of the unworthiness of those who belong to them through the affections because the affections are usually stronger with them than their reasoning powers how they cling to their priests for instance when the cooler heads and greater experience of men condemn and that merely because their imaginations choose to adorn the offenders with the graces of that religion which they venerate and on which they rely he is a shrewd man who can draw the line between the real and the false in these matters but he is truly a weak one who disregards evidence when evidence is complete and clear that we all have our sins and our failings is true but there are certain marks of unworthiness which are infallible and which ought never to be disregarded since they denote the existence of the want of principle that taints a whole character     chapter v       he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway      between him and benedick the one is too like an image and      says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son      evermore tattlingbeatrice   the very day my sister and i left satanstoe there was an interesting interview between my grandmother and myself that it may be well to relate it took place in the cool of the morning before breakfast indeed and previously to the appearance of any of the rest of the party for tom bayard and his sister had again ridden across the country to pass the night and see us off my grandmother had requested me to meet her thus early in a sort of little piazza that modern improvements had annexed to one end of the old buildings and in which we both appeared accordingly with the utmost punctuality i saw by a certain sort of importance that my good grandmother wore in her countenance that she had weighty matters on her mind and took the chair she had set for me with some little curiosity to learn what was to follow the chairs were placed side by side or nearly so but looking different ways and so close together that when seated we were quite face to face my grandmother had on her spectacles and she gazed wistfully through them at me parting the curls on my forehead as had been her wont when i was a boy i saw tears rolling out from behind the glasses and felt apprehensive i might have said or done something to have wounded the spirit of that excellent and indulgent parent  for heavens sake grandmother what can this mean i cried have i done anything amiss  no my child no but much to the contrary you are and ever have been a good and dutiful son not only to your real parents but to me but your name ought to have been hughthat i will maintain long as i live i told your father as much when you were born but he was mordaunt mad then as indeed he has remained pretty much ever since not that mordaunt is not a good name and a respectable name and they say it is a noble name in england but it is a family name and family names are not for christian names at the best hugh should have been your name if i could have had my way and if not hugh corny well it is too late for that now as mordaunt you are and mordaunt you must live and die did any one ever tell you my child how very very like you are to your honored grandfather  my mother frequentlyi have seen the tears start into her eyes as she gazed at me and she has often told me my family name ought to have been mordaunt so much do i resemble her father  her fatherwell anneke does get some of the strangest conceits into her head a better woman or a dearer does not breathei love your mother my child quite as much as if she had been born my own daughter but i must say she does get some of the strangest notions into her head that mortal ever imagined you like herman mordaunt you are the very image of your grandfather littlepage and no more like herman mordaunt than you are like the king  the revolution was then and is now still too recent to prevent these constant allusions to royalty notwithstanding my grandfather had been as warm a whig as there was in the colonies from the commencement of the struggle as for the resemblance spoken of i have always understood i was a mingled repetition of the two families as so often happens a circumstance that enables my different relatives to trace such resemblances as best suit their respective fancies this was quite convenient and may have been a reason in addition to the fact of my being an only son that i was so great a favorite with the females of my family my dear old grandmother who was then in her sixtyninth year was so persuaded of my likeness to her late husband the old general as he was now called that she would not proceed in her communications until she had wiped her eyes and gratified her affections with another long and wistful gaze  oh those eyes she murmuredand that foreheadthe mouth too and the nose to say nothing of the smile which is as much alike as one pea is like another  this left very little for the mordaunts it must be owned the chin and ears being pretty much all that were not claimed for the direct line it is true my eyes were blue and the old generals had been as black as coals my nose was grecian and his a most obtrusive roman and as for the mouth i can only say mine was as like that of my mothers as a mans could well be like a womans the last i had heard my father say a thousand times but no matter age and affection and the longings of the parent caused my grandmother to see things differently  well mordaunt the good old lady at length continued how do you like this choice of your sister kates mr bayard is a charming young man is he not  is it then a choice grandmother has kate actually made up her mind  pshaw answered my grandmother smiling as archly as if she were sixteen herselfthat was done long agoand papa approved and mamma was anxious and i consented and sister anneke was delighted and everything was as smooth as the beach at the end of the neck but waiting for your approbation it would not be right grandmother for me to engage myself while mordaunt is away and without his even knowing the gentleman so i will not answer until i get his approbation too said kate that was very pretty in her was it not my child all your fathers children have a sense of propriety  indeed it was and i shall not forget it soon but suppose i had disapproved what would have followed grandmother  you should never ask unpleasant questions saucy fellow though i dare to say kate would at least have asked mr bayard to wait until you had changed your mind giving him up altogether would be out of the question and unreasonable but she might have waited a few months or so until you changed your mind and i would have advised her so to do but all that is unnecessary as matters are for you have expressed your approbation and kate is perfectly happy the last letter from lilacsbush which jaap brought gives the formal consent of your dear parentsand what parents you have my childso kate wrote an acceptance yesterday and it was as prettily expressed a note as i have seen in many a day your own mother could not have done better in her young days and anneke mordaunt worded a note as genteelly as any young woman i ever knew  i am glad everything has gone right and am sure no one can wish the young couple more happiness than i do myself kate is a dear good girl and i love her as much as a brother can love a sister  is she not and as thorough a littlepage as ever was born i do hope she will be happy all the marriages in our family have proved so hitherto and it would be strange if this should turn out differently well now mordaunt when kate is married you will be the only one left  that is true grandmother and you must be glad to find there will be one of us left to come and see you without bringing nurses and children at his heels  ii glad of anything of the sort no indeed my child i should be sorry enough did i think for a moment you would not marry as soon as is prudent now that the war is over as for the children i dote on them and i have ever thought it a misfortune that the littlepages have had so few especially sons your grandfather my general was an only son your father was an only son and you are an only son that is so far as coming to mens estates are or were concerned no mordaunt my child it is the warmest wish of my heart to see you properly married and to hold the littlepages of the next generation in my arms two of you i have had there already and i shall have lived the life of the blessed to be able to hold the third  my dear good grandmotherwhat am i to understand by all this  that i wish you to marry my child now that the war is ended that your father wishes you to marry that your mother wishes you to marry and that your sister wishes you to marry  and all of you wish me to marry the same person is it not so  my grandmother smiled but she fidgeted fancying as i suspected that she had been pushing matters a little too fast it was not easy however for one of her truth and simplicity of character to recede after having gone so far and she wisely determined to have no reserves with me on the subject  i believe you are right mordaunt she answered after a short pause we do all wish you to fall in love as soon as you can to propose as soon as you are in love and to marry priscilla bayard the instant she will consent to have you  this is honest and like yourself my dear grandmother and now we both know what is intended and can speak plainly in the first place do you not think one connection of this sort between families quite sufficient if kate marry the brother may i not be excused for overlooking the attractions of the sister  priscilla bayard is one of the loveliest girls in york colony mordaunt littlepage  we call this part of the world york state now dearest grandmother i am far from denying the truth of what you saypriscilla bayard is very lovely  i do not know what more you can wish than to get such a girl  i shall not say that the time will not come when i may be glad to obtain the consent of the young lady to become my wife but that time has not yet arrived then i question the expediency when friends greatly desire any particular match of saying too much about it  my poor grandmother looked quite astounded like one who felt she had innocently done mischief and she sat gazing fondly at me with the expression of a penitent child painted in her venerated countenance  nevertheless mordaunt i had a great share in bringing about the union between your own dear parents she at length answered and that has been one of the happiest marriages i have ever known  i had often heard allusions of this nature and i had several times observed the quiet smile of my mother as she listened to them smiles that seemed to contradict the opinion to which my grandmothers mistaken notions of her own influence had given birth on one occasion i was still quite a boy i remember to have asked my mother how the fact was when the answer was i married your father through the influence of a butchers boy a reply that had some reference to a very early passage in the lives of my parents but i well know that cornelius littlepage nor anneke mordaunt was a person to be coaxed into matrimony and i resolved on the spot their only son should manifest an equal independence i might have answered my grandmother to this effect and in language stronger than was my practice when addressing that reverend parent had not the two girls appeared on the piazza at that moment and broke up our private conference  sooth to say priscilla bayard came forth upon me that morning with something like the radiance of the rising sun both the girls had that fresh attractive look that is apt to belong to the toilets of early risers of their sex and which probably renders them handsomer at that hour than at any other part of the day my own sister was a very charming girl as any one would allow but her friend was decidedly beautiful i confess i found it a little difficult not to give in on the spot and to whisper my anxious grandmother that i would pay proper attention to the young lady and make an offer at the suitable time as she advanced toward us exchanging the morning salutations with just enough of ease to render her perfectly graceful and yet with a modesty and retenue that were infinitely winning  mordaunt is about to quit me for the whole summer miss bayard said my grandmother who would be doing while there was a chance and i have had him out here to converse a little together before we part kate i shall see often during the pleasant season i trust but this is to be the last of mordaunt until the cold weather return  is mr littlepage going to travel inquired the young lady with just as much interest as good breeding demanded and not a particle more for lilacsbush is not so distant but he might ride over once a week at least to inquire how you do  oh he is going a great great distance and to a part of the world i dread to think of  miss bayard now looked really startled and a good deal astonished questioning me with her very fine eyes though she said nothing with her tongue of coejemans who bears this appellation and who has contracted to get the necessary surveys made though he fills the humble post of a chainbearer himself not being competent to make the calculations  how can a mere chainbearer contract for a full survey asked tom bayard who had joined the party and had been listening to the discourse the chainbearers in general are but common laborers and are perfectly irresponsible  that is true as a rule but my old friend forms an exception he set out for a surveyor but having no head for sines and cosines and tangents he was obliged to lower his pretensions to the humbler duty he now discharges still he has long contracted for jobs of this nature and gets as much as he can do hiring surveyors himself the owners of property having the utmost confidence in his measurements let me tell you the man who carries chain is not the least important member of a surveying party in the woods old andries is as honest as noonday and everybody has faith in him  his true name is coejemans i think you said major littlepage asked priscilla as it struck me assuming an air of indifference  it is andries coejemans and his family is reputable if not absolutely of a high caste but the old man is so inveterate a woodsman that nothing but patriotism and his whig propensities could have drawn him out into the open country after serving most gallantly through the whole war he has gone back to his chains and many is the joke he has about remaining still in chains after fighting so long and so often in the cause of liberty  priscilla appeared to hesitatei thought her color increased a littlethen she asked the question that was apparently uppermost in her thoughts with surprising steadiness  did you ever see the chainbearers niece dus malbone  this question not a little surprised me for though i had never seen ursula the uncle had talked so much to me of his ward that i almost fancied she was an intimate acquaintance it often happens that we hear so much of certain persons that we think and speak of them as of those we know and had miss bayard questioned me of one of my late comrades in the service i should not have been a whit more startled than i was at hearing her pronounce the familiar name of dus malbone  where in the name of all that is curious did you ever hear of such a person i exclaimed a little inconsiderately since the world was certainly wide enough to admit of two young womens being acquainted without my consent more especially as one of them i had never seen and the other i had met for the first time only a fortnight before old andries was always speaking to me of his niece but i could not suppose she was an acquaintance of one of your position in life  notwithstanding we were something more than schoolfellowsfor we were and i trust are still very very good friends i like dus exceedingly though she is quite as singular in her way as i have heard her uncle described to be in his  this is odd will you allow me to ask one question you will think it singular perhaps after what you have just told mebut curiosity will get the better of my mannersis dus malbone a ladythe equal and companion of such a person as miss priscilla bayard  that is a question not so easily answered perhaps since in some respects she is greatly the superior of any young woman i know her family i have always heard was very good on both sides she is poor poor even to poverty i fear now here pris paused there was a tremor in her voice even and i detected tears starting to her eyes poor dus she continuedshe had much to support in the way of poverty even while at school where she was indeed as a dependent rather than as a boarder but no one among us all could presume to offer her favors i was afraid even to ask her to accept a ribbon as i should not hesitate to do to kate here or any other young lady with whom i was intimate i never knew a noblerminded girl than ursula malbone though few persons understand her i think  this is old andries over again he was poor enough heaven knows and i have known him actually suffer in order to do his duty by this girl and to make a proper appearance at the same time as a captain in the new york line yet none of us not even my father could ever induce him to borrow a single dollar he would give but he would not receive  i can believe this readily it is so like dus if she has her peculiarities she has noble qualities enough to redeem of coejemans who bears this appellation and who has contracted to get the necessary surveys made though he fills the humble post of a chainbearer himself not being competent to make the calculations  how can a mere chainbearer contract for a full survey asked tom bayard who had joined the party and had been listening to the discourse the chainbearers in general are but common laborers and are perfectly irresponsible  that is true as a rule but my old friend

redeem a thousand foibles still i would not have you to think ursula malbone is not an excellent creature in all respects though she certainly has her peculiarities  which doubtless she has inherited from the coejemans as her uncle the chainbearer has his peculiarities too  the malbones have none of the blood of the coejemans answered the lady quickly though it is respectable and not to be ashamed of dus malbones mother was only halfsister to captain coejemans and they had different fathers  i thought pris looked a little confused and as if she were sorry she had said so much on the subject at all the instant she had betrayed so much intimacy with the malbone genealogy for she shrunk back plucked a rose and walked away smelling the flower like one who was indisposed to say any more on the subject a summons to breakfast however would otherwise have interrupted us and no more was said about the chainbearer and his marvellous niece dus malbone as soon as the meal was ended our horses were brought round and kate and i took our leave jaap having preceded us as usual an hour or more with our luggage the reader is not to suppose that we always moved in the saddle in that day on the contrary my mother had a very neat chaise in which she used to drive about the country with a mounted postilion my father had a phaeton and in town we actually kept a chariot for the union of the mordaunt and littlepage properties had made us very comfortable and comfortably we lived but young ladies liked the saddle twentyfive years ago more than they do today and kate being a capital horsewoman like her mother before her we were often out together it was choice then and not necessity a little aided by bad roads perhaps that induced us to ride across to satanstoe so often when we wished to visit our grandmother  i kissed my dear old parent very affectionately at parting for i was to see her no more that summer and i got her blessing in return as for tom bayard a warm brotherly shake of the hand sufficed inasmuch as it was pretty certain i should see him at lilacsbush before i left home approaching his sister who held out her hand to me in a friendly manner i said as i took it  i hope this is not the last time i am to see you before i start for the new countries miss bayard you owe my sister a visit i believe and i shall trust to that debt for another opportunity of saying the unpleasant word farewell  this is not the way to win a ladys heart mordaunt cried kate gayly it is only fifteen miles from your fathers door to the hickories you ought to know sir and you have a standing invitation to darken its door with your military form  from both my father and brotherput in priscilla a little hastily they will always be happy to see major littlepage most certainly  and why not from yourself miss prude added kate who seemed bent on causing her friend some confusion we are not now such total strangers to each other as to render that little grace improper  when i am mistress of a house of my own should that day ever arrive i shall take care not to lose my reputation for hospitality answered pris determined not to be caught by neglecting to include all the littlepage family in my invitations until then toms and papas welcomes must suffice  the girl looked amazingly lovely all the time and stood the smiles of those around her with a selfpossession that showed me she knew perfectly well what she was about i was never more at a loss how to understand a young woman and it is very possible had i remained near her for a month longer the interest such uncertainty is apt to awaken might have sent me away desperately in love but providence had determined otherwise  during our ride toward the bush my sister with proper blushes and a becoming hesitation let me into the secret of her having accepted tom bayard they were not to be married until after my return from the north an event that was expected to take place in the ensuing autumn  then i am to lose you kate almost as soon as i find you i said a little despondingly  not lose me brother no no not lose me but find me more than ever i am to be transplanted into a family whither you will soon be coming to seek a wife yourself  were i to come what reason have i for supposing it would be successful  that is a question you have no right to ask did i even know of any particular reason for believing your reception would be favorable you cannot believe me sufficiently treacherous to betray my friend young ladies are not of the facility of character you seem to suppose sir and no method but the direct one will succeed i have no other reason for believing you would succeed than the facts that you are an agreeable goodlooking youth however of unexceptionable family and fortune living quite near the hickories and of a suitable age temper habits character etc etc etc are not these reasons sufficient to encourage you to persevere my brave major  perseverance implies commencement and i have not yet commenced i scarcely know what to make of your friend child she is either the perfection of nature and simplicity or the perfection of art  art pris bayard artful mordaunt you never did a human being greater injustice a child cannot have greater truth and sincerity than toms sister  ay thats just it toms sister is ex officio perfection but you will please to remember that some children are very artful all i can say on the subject at present is that i like tom and i like his parents but i do not know what to think of your friend  kate was a little offended so she made me no answer her good humor returned however before we had gone far and the rest of our ride passed pleasantly enough no allusions being made to any of the name of bayard though i dare say my companion thought a great deal of a certain tom of that name as i certainly did of his handsome and inexplicable sister  at the kingsbridge inn we had another short brush with that untiring gossip its landlady  a pleasant time it has been over at the toe i dares to say exclaimed mrs light the instant she thrust her head out of the door a most agreeable and amusing time both for the young gentleman and for the young lady mr thomas bayard and miss pris bayard have been with you days and days and old madam littlepage is delighted oh the toe has always been a happy house and happy faces have i long been used to see come out of it and happy faces do i see today yes yes the toe has always sent happy contented faces down the road and a happy roof it has been by all accounts these hundred years  i dare say this was all true enough i have always heard that the old place contained contented hearts and contented hearts make happy faces kates face was happiness itself as she sat in the saddle listening to the crone and my countenance is not one of illnature the toe was ever a happy house it recalls old times to hear a house thus familiarly spoken of for a set is rising up among us which is vastly too genteel to admit that any oneman woman child or satan ever had a member so homely as a toe     chapter vi          they love their land because it is their own         and scorn to give aught other reason why         would shake hands with a king upon his throne         and think it kindness to his majesty         a stubborn race fearing and flattering none         such are they nurtured such they live and die         all but a few apostates who are meddling     with merchandise pounds shillings pence and peddling                                                halleck   a day or two after my return to lilacsbush was presented one of these family scenes which are so common in the genial month of june on the shores of the glorious old hudson i call the river the old hudson for it is quite as old as the tiber though the world has not talked of it as much or as long a thousand years hence this stream will be known over the whole earth and men will speak of it as they now speak of the danube and the rhine as good wine may not be made on its banks as is made on the acclivities of the latter river but even today better both as to quality and variety is actually drunk on this last point all intelligent travellers agree  there stands a noble linden on the lawn of lilacsbush at no great distance from the house and necessarily within a short distance of the water the tree had been planted there by my grandmother mordaunts father to whom the place once belonged and was admirably placed for the purposes of an afternoons lounge beneath its shade we often took our dessert and wine in the warm months and thither since their return from the army general littlepage and colonel dirck follock used to carry their pipes and smoke over a campaign or a bottle as chance directed the discourse for that matter no battlefield had ever been so veiled in smoke as would have been the case with the linden in question could there have been a concentration of all the vapor it had seen  the afternoon of the day just mentioned the whole family were seated beneath the tree scattered round as shade and inclination tempted though a small table holding fruits and wine showed that the usual business of the hour had not been neglected the wines were madeira and claret those common beverages in the country and the fruits were strawberries cherries oranges and figs the two last imported of course it was a little too early for us to get pines from the islands a fruit which is so common in its season as to be readily purchased in town at the rate of four of a good size for a dollar but the abundance and even luxury of a better sort of the common american tables is no news viands liquors and fruits appearing on them that are only known to the very rich and very luxurious in the countries of europe if the service were only as tasteful and the cooking as good with us as both are in france for instance america would be the very paradise of the epicure let superficial travellers say what they please to the contrary i have been abroad in these later times and speak of what i know  no one sat at the table though my father colonel  dirck and i were near enough to reach our glasses at need my mother was next to me and reasonably close for i did not smoke while aunt mary and kate had taken post just without the influence of the tobacco on the shore was a large skiff that contained a tolerably sized trunk or two and a sort of clothesbag in the first were a portion of my clothes while those of jaap filled the bag the negro himself was stretched on the grass about halfway between the tree and the shore with two or three of his grandchildren rolling about at his feet in the skiff was his son seated in readiness to use the sculls as soon as ordered  all this arrangement denoted my approaching departure for the north the wind was at the south and sloops of various degrees of promise and speed were appearing round the points coming on one in the wake of another as each had been able to quit the wharves to profit by the breeze in that day the river had not a tenth part of the craft it now possesses but still it had enough to make a little fleet so near town and at a moment when wind and tide both became favorable at that time most of the craft on the hudson belonged up the river and they partook largely of the taste of our dutch ancestors notable travellers before the gales they did very little with foul winds generally requiring from a week to a fortnight to tide it down from albany with the wind at all from the south nevertheless few persons thought of making the journey between the two largest towns of the state york and albany without having recourse to one of these sloops i was at that moment in waiting for the appearance of a certain eagle of albany captain bogert which was to run in close to lilacsbush and receive me on board agreeably to an arrangement previously made in town i was induced to take a passage in this vessel from the circumstance that she had a sort of aftercabin that was screened by an ample green curtain an advantage that all the vessels which then plied on the river did not possess though great improvements have been making ever since the period of which i am now writing  of course the interval thus passed in waiting for the appearance of the eagle was filled up more or less by discourse jaap who was to accompany me in my journey to ravensnest knew every vessel on the river as soon as he could see her and we depended on him to let us know when i was to embark though the movements of the sloop herself could not fail to give us timely notice of the necessity of taking leave  i should like exceedingly to pay a visit to old mrs vander heyden at kinderhook mordaunt said my mother after one of the frequent pauses that occurred in the discourse she is a relation and i feel a great regard for her so much the more from the circumstance of her being associated in my mind with that frightful night on the river of which you have heard me speak  as my mother ceased speaking she glanced affectionately toward the general who returned the look as he returned all my mothers looks with one filled with manly tenderness a more united couple than my parents never existed they seemed to me ordinarily to have but one mind between them and when there did occur any slight difference of opinion the question was not which should prevail but which should yield of the two my mother may have had the most native intellect though the general was a fine manly sensible person and was very universally respected  it might be well anneke said my father if the major were to pay a visit to poor guerts grave and see if the stones are up and that the place is kept as it should be i have not been there since the year 68 when it looked as if a friendly eye might do some good at no distant day  this was said in a low voice purposely to prevent aunt mary from hearing it and as she was a little deaf it is probable the intention was successful not so however with colonel dirck who drew the pipe from his mouth and sat attentively listening in the manner of one who felt great interest in the subject another pause succeeded  ten tere ist my lort howe corny observed the colonel how is it wit his grave  oh the colony took good care of that they buried him in the main aisle of st peters i believe and no doubt all is right with him as for the other major it might be well to look at it  great changes have taken place at albany since we were there as young people observed my mother thoughtfully the cuylers are much broken up by the revolution while the schuylers have grown greater than ever poor aunt schuyler she is no longer living to welcome a son of ours  time will bring about such changes my love and we can only be thankful that so many of us remain after so long and bloody a war  i saw my mothers lips move and i knew she was murmuring a thanksgiving to the power which had preserved her husband and son through the late struggle  you will write as often as opportunities occur mordaunt said that dear parent after a longer pause than usual now there is peace i can hope to get your letters with some little regularity  they tell me cousin annekefor so the colonel always called my mother when we were alonethey tell me cousin anneke said colonel dirck tat tey actually mean to have a mail tree times a week petween alpany and york tere ist no knowing general what tis glorious revolution will not do for us  if it bring me letters three times a week from those i love rejoined my mother i am sure my patriotism will be greatly increased how will letters get out from ravensnest to the older parts of the colonyi should say state mordaunt  i must trust to the settlers for that hundreds of yankees they tell me are out looking for farms this summer i may use some of them for messengers  dont trust em too much or too manygrowled colonel dirck who had the old dutch grudge against our eastern brethren see how they behavt to schuyler  yes said my father replenishing his pipe they might have manifested more justice and less prejudice to wise philip but prejudices will exist all over the world even washington has had his share  tat is a great man exclaimed colonel dirck with emphasis and in the manner of one who felt certain of his point a ferry great man  no one will dispute with you colonel on that subject but have you no message to send to our old comrade andries coejemans he must have been at mooseridge with his party of surveyors now near a twelvemonth and ill warrant you has thoroughly looked up the old boundaries so as to be ready for mordaunt to start afresh as soon as the boy reaches the patent  i hope he has not hiret a yankee surveyor corny put in the colonel in some little alarm if one of tem animals gets upon the tract he will manage to carry off half of the lant in his compassbox i hope olt andries knows petter  i dare say hell manage to keep all the land as well as to survey it it is a thousand pities the captain has no head for figures for his honesty would have made his fortune but i have seen him tried and know it will not do he was a week once making up an account of some stores received from headquarters and the nearest he could get to the result was twentyfive per cent out of the way  i would sooner trust andries coejemans to survey my property figures or no figures cried colonel dirck positively than any dominie in new england  well that is as one thinks returned my father tasting the madeira for my part i shall be satisfied with the surveyor he may happen to select even though he should be a yankee andries is shrewd if he be no calculator and i dare to say he has engaged a suitable man having taken the job at a liberal price he is too honest a fellow not to hire a proper person to do the headwork as for all the rest i would trust him as soon as i would trust any man in america  tat is gospel mordaunt will haf an eye on matters too seein he has so great an interest in the estate tere is one ting major you must not forget five hundred goot acres must be surveyed off for sister anneke and five hundred for pretty kate here as soon as tat is done the general and i will give each of the gals a deet  thank you dirck said my father with feeling ill not refuse the land for the girls who may be glad enough to own it some time or other  its no great matter now corny put as you say it may be of use one day suppose we make old andries a present of a farm in his pargain  with all my heart cried my father quickly a couple of hundred acres might make him comfortable for the rest of his days i thank you for the hint dirck and we will let mordaunt choose the lot and send us the description that we may prepare the deed  you forget general that the chainbearer has or will have his military lot as a captain i ventured to remark besides land will be of little use to him unless it might be to measure it i doubt if the old man would not prefer going without his dinner to hoeing a hill of potatoes  andries had three slaves while he was with us a man a woman and their daughter returned my father he would not sell them he said on any consideration and i have known him actually suffering for money when he was too proud to accept it from his friends and too benevolent to part with family slaves in order to raise it they were born coejemans he always said as much as i was born one myself and they shall die coejemans he doubtless has these people with him at the ridge where you will find them all encamped near some spring with gardenstuff and other small things growing around him if he can find open land enough for such a purpose he has permission to cut and till at pleasure  this is agreeable news to me general i answered since it promises a sort of home if the chainbearer has really these blacks with him and has hutted judiciously i dare say we shall have quite as comfortable a time as many of those we passed together in camp then i shall carry my flute with me for miss priscilla bayard has given me reason to expect a very wonderful creature in dus the niece of which old andries used to talk so much you remember to have heard the chainbearer speak of such a person i dare say sir for he was quite fond of mentioning her  perfectly well dus malbone was a sort of toast among the young men of the regiment at one time though no one of them all ever could get a sight of her by hook or by crook  happening to turn my head at that moment i found my dear mothers eyes turned curiously on me brought there i fancy by the allusion to toms sister  what does priscilla bayard know of this chainbearers niece that beloved parent asked as soon as she perceived that her look had attracted my attention  a great deal it would seem since she tells me they are fast friends quite as great i should judge from miss bayards language and manner as kate and herself  that can scarcely be returned my mother slightly smiling since there the principal reason must be wanting then this dus can hardly be priscilla bayards equal  one never knows such a thing mother until he has had an opportunity of making comparisons though miss bayard herself says dus is much her superior in many things i am sure her uncle is my superior in some respects in carrying chain particularly so  ay but scarcely in station mordaunt  he was the senior captain of the regiment  true but revolutions are revolutions what i mean is that your chainbearer can hardly be a gentleman  that is a point not to be decided in a breath he is and he is not old andries is of a respectable family though but indifferently educated men vastly his inferiors in birth in habits in the general notions of the caste in the new england states are greatly his superiors in knowledge nevertheless while we must all admit how necessary a certain amount of education has become at the present time to make a gentleman i think every gentleman will allow hundreds among us have degrees in their pockets with small claims to belong to the class three or four centuries ago i should have answered that old andries was a gentleman though he had to bite the wax with his teeth and make a cross for want of a better signature  and he what you call a chainbearer mordaunt exclaimed my sister  as well as late senior captain in your fathers regiment miss littlepage but no matter andries and dus are such as they are and i shall be glad to have them for companions this summer jaap is making signals and i must quit you all heigho it is very pleasant here under this linden and home begins to entwine its fibres around my heart never mind it will soon be autumn and i shall see the whole of you i trust as i leave you well and happy in town  my dear dear mother had tears in her eyes when she embraced me so had kate who though she did love tom bayard most loved me very warmly too aunt mary kissed me in her quiet but affectionate way and i shook hands with the gentlemen who accompanied me down to the boat i could see that my father was affected had the war still continued he would have thought nothing of the separation but in that piping time of peace it seemed to come unseasonably  now dont forget the great lots for anneke and katrinke said colonel dirck as we descended to the shore let andries pick out some of the best of the lant tat is well watered and timbered and well call the lots after the gals that is a goot idea corny  excellent my friend mordaunt my son if you come across any places that look like graves i wish you would set up marks by which they may be known it is true a quarter of a century or more makes many changes in the woods and it is quite likely no such remains will be found  a quarter of a century in the american forests sir i answered is somewhat like the same period in the wanderings of a comet lost in the numberless years of its growth a single tree will sometimes outlast the generations of an entire nation  you wilt rememper mordaunt that i wilt haf no yankee tenants on my estate your father may lease em onehalf of a lot if he please but i will not lease tother  as you are tenants in common gentlemen i answered smiling it will not be easy to separate the interests in this manner i believe i understand you however i am to sell the lands of mooseridge or covenant to sell as your attorney while i follow out my grandfather mordaunts ideas and lease those that are not yet leased on my own estate this will at least give the settlers a choice and those who do not like one plan of obtaining their farms may adopt the other  i now shook hands again with the gentlemen and stepping into the skiff we pulled away from the shore jaap had made this movement in good season and we were compelled to row a quarter of a mile down the river to meet the sloop although the wind was perfectly fair it was not so fresh as to induce mr bogert to roundto but throwing us a rope it was caught when we were safely transferred bag and baggage to the decks of the eagle  captain bogert was smoking at the helm when he returned my salute removing the pipe after a puff or two he pointed with the stem toward the group on the shore and inquired if i wished to say goodby  allponnyso the dutch were wont to pronounce the name of their town in the last centuryis a long way off he said and maype you woult like to see the frients agin  this business of waving hats and handkerchiefs is a regular thing on the hudson and i expressed my willingness to comply with the usage as a matter of course5 in consequence mr bogert deliberately sheered in toward the shore and i saw the whole family collecting on a low rock near the water to take the final look in the background stood the satanstoes a dark woolly group including mrs jaap and two generations of descendants the whites were weeping that is to say my dear mother and kate and the blacks were laughing though the old lady kept her teeth to herself about as much as she exposed them a sensation almost invariably produces laughter with a negro the only exceptions being on occasions of singular gravity  footnote 5 such were the notions of mr mordaunt littlepage at the commencement of this century and such his feeling shortly after the peace of 1783 nothing of the sort more completely illustrates the general change that has come over the land in habits and material things than the difference between the movements of that day and those of our own then the departure of a sloop or the embarkation of a passenger along the shore brought parties to the wharves and wavings of handkerchiefs as if those who were left behind felt a lingering wish to see the last of their friends now literally thousands come and go daily passing about as many hours on the hudson as their grandfathers passed days and the shaking of hands and leavetakings are usually done at home it would be a bold woman who would think now of waving a handkerchief to a hudson river steamboateditor  i believe if the truth were known mr bogert greatly exulted in the stately movement of his sloop as she brushed along the shore at no great distance from the rocks with her mainboom guyed out to starboard and studdingsail boom to port the flyingtopsail too was set and the eagle might be said to be moving in all her glory she went so near the rocks too as if she despised danger those were not the days of close calculations that have succeeded then an albany skipper did not mind losing a hundred or two feet of distance in making his run whereas now it would not be an easy matter to persuade a liverpool trader to turn as much aside in order to speak a stranger in the centre of the atlantic unless indeed he happened to want to get the others longitude  as the sloop swept past the rocks i got bows waving of hats and handkerchiefs and good wishes enough to last the whole voyage even jaap had his share and goodby jaap came to my ears from even the sweet voice of kate away we went in stately dutch movement slow but sure in ten minutes lilacsbush was behind us and i was once more alone in the world for months to come  there was now time to look about me and to ascertain who were my companions in this voyage the skipper and crew were as usual the masters and the pilots both whites and both of dutch extraction an old wrinkled negro who had passed his life on the hudson as a foremast hand and two younger blacks one of whom was what was dignified with the name of cabinsteward then there were numerous passengers some of whom appeared to belong to the upper classes they were of both sexes but all were strangers to me on the maindeck were six or eight sturdy decent quiet respectablelooking laborers who were evidently of the class of husbandmen their packs were lying in a pile near the foot of the mast and i did not fail to observe that there were as many axes as there were packs  the american axe it has made more real and lasting conquests than the sword of any warlike people that ever lived but they have been conquests that have left civilization in their train instead of havoc and desolation more than a million of square miles of territory6 have been opened up from the shades of the virgin forest to admit the warmth of the sun and culture and abundance have been spread where the beast of the forest so lately roamed hunted by the savage most of this too has been effected between the day when i went on board the eagle and that on which i am now writing a brief quarter of a century has seen these wonderful changes wrought and at the bottom of them all lies this beautiful wellprized ready and efficient implement the american axe  footnote 6 more than two millions at the present day  it would not be easy to give the reader a clear notion of the manner in which the young men and men of all ages of the older portions of the new republic poured into the woods to commence the business of felling the forests and laying bare the secrets of nature as soon as the nation rose from beneath the pressure of war to enjoy the freedom of peace the history of that day in new york which state led the van in the righteous strife of improvement and has ever since so nobly maintained its vantageground has not yet been written when it is properly recorded names will be rescued from oblivion that better deserve statues and niches in the temple of national glory than those of many who have merely got the start of them by means of the greater facility with which the public mind is led away in the train of brilliant exploits than it is made sensible of the merits of those that are humane and useful  it was not usual for settlers as it has become the practice to term those who first take up and establish themselves on new lands to make their journeys from the neighborhood of the sea to the interior other than by land but a few passed out of connecticut by the way of new york and thence up the river in sloops of this character were those found on board the eagle in all we had seven of these men who got into discourse with me the first day of our passage and i was a little surprised at discovering how much they already knew of me and of my movements jaap however soon suggested himself to my mind as the probable means of the intelligence they had gleaned and on inquiry such i ascertained was the fact  the curiosity and the questioning propensities of the people of new england have been so generally admitted by writers and commentators on american character that i suppose one has a right to assume the truth of these characteristics i have heard various ways of accounting for them and among others the circumstances of their disposition to emigrate which brings with it the necessity of inquiring after the welfare of friends at a distance it appears to me however this is taking a very narrow view of the cause which i attribute to the general activity of mind among a people little restrained by the conventional usages of more sophisticated conditions of society the practice of referring so much to the common mind too has a great influence on all the opinions of this peculiar portion of the american population seeming to confer the right to inquire into matters that are elsewhere protected by the sacred feeling of individual privacy  let this be as it might my axemen had contrived to get out of jaap all he knew about ravensnest and mooseridge as well as my motives in making the present journey this information obtained they were not slow in introducing themselves to me and of asking the questions that were uppermost in their minds of course i made such answers as were called for by the case and we established a sort of business acquaintance between us the very first day the voyage lasting several days by the time we reached albany pretty much all that could be said on such a subject had been uttered by one side or the other  as respected ravensnest my own property my grandfather had requested in his will that the farms might be leased having an eye to my childrens profit rather than to mine his request was a law to me and i had fully determined to offer the unoccupied lands of that estate or quite threefourths of the whole patent on leases similar in their conditions to those which had already been granted on the other hand it was the intention to part with the lots of mooseridge in fee these conditions were made known to the axemen as my first essay in settling a new country and contrary to what had been my expectation i soon discovered that these adventurers inclined more to the leases than to the deeds it is true i expected a small payment down in the case of each absolute sale while i was prepared to grant leases for three lives at very low rents at the best and in the cases of a large proportion of the lots those that were the least eligible by situation or through their quality to grant them leases without any rent at all for the first few years of their occupation these last advantages and the opportunity of possessing lands a goodly term of years for rents that were put as low as a shilling an acre were strong inducements as i soon discovered with those who carried all they were worth in their packs and who thus reserved the little money they possessed to supply the wants of their future husbandry  we talked these matters over during the week we were on board the sloop and by the time we came in sight of the steeples of albany my mens minds were made up to follow me to the nest these steeples were then two in number viz that of the english church that stood near the margin of the town against the hill and that of the dutch church which occupied an humbler site on the low land and could scarcely be seen rising above the pointed roofs of the adjacent houses though these last themselves were neither particularly high nor particularly imposing     chapter vii      who is that graceful female here     with yon red hunter of the deer     of gentle mien and shape she seems       for civil halls designd     yet with the stately savage walks       as she were of his kindpinckney   i made little stay in albany but giving the direction to the patent to the axemen left it the very day of our arrival there were very few public conveyances in that early day and i was obliged to hire a wagon to transport jaap and myself with our effects to ravensnest a sort of dull calm had come over the country after the struggles of the late war but one interest in it appearing to be alive and very active that interest fortunately for me appeared to be the business of landhunting and settling of this i had sufficient proof in albany itself it being difficult to enter the principal street of that town and not find in it more or less of those adventurers the emblems of whose pursuit were the pack and the axe nine out of ten came from the eastern or new england states then the most peopled while they were not very fortunate in either soil or climate  we were two days in reaching ravensnest a property which i had owned for several years but which i now saw for the first time my grandfather had left a sort of agent on the spot a person of the name of jason newcome who was of my father the generals age and who had once been a schoolmaster in the neighborhood of satanstoe this agent had leased extensively himself and was said to be the occupant of the only mills of any moment on the property with him a correspondence had been maintained and once or twice during the war my father had managed to have an interview with this representative of his and my interests as for myself i was now to see him for the first time we knew each other by reputation only and certain passages in the agency had induced me to give mr newcome notice that it was my intention to make a change in the management of the property  any one who is familiar with the aspect of things in what is called a new country in america must be well aware it is not very inviting the lovers of the picturesque can have little satisfaction in looking even on the finest natural scenery at such moments the labor that has been effected usually having done so much to mar the beauties of nature without having yet had time to supply the deficiencies by those of art piles of charred or halfburned logs fields covered with stumps or ragged with stubs fences of the rudest sorts and filled with brambles buildings of the meanest character deserted clearings and all the other signs of a state of things in which there is a manifest and constant struggle between immediate necessity and future expediency are not calculated to satisfy either the hopes or the tastes occasionally a different state of things however under circumstances peculiarly favorable does exist and it may be well to allude to it lest the reader form but a single picture of this transition state of american life when the commerce of the country is active and there is a demand for the products of new lands a settlement often presents a scene of activity in which the elements of a thriving prosperity make themselves apparent amid the smoke of fallows and the rudeness of border life neither however was the case at ravensnest when i first visited the place though the last was to a certain extent its condition two or three years later or after the great european war brought its wheat and ashes into active demand  i found but few more signs of cultivation between the point where i left the great northern road and the bounds of the patent than had been found by my father as he had described them to me in his first visit which took place a quarter of a century earlier than this of mine there was one log tavern it is true in the space mentioned but it afforded nothing to drink but rum and nothing to eat but salted pork and potatoes the day i stopped there to dine but there were times and seasons when by means of venison wildfowl and fish a luxurious board might have been spread that this was not the opinion of my landlady nevertheless was apparent from the remarks she made while i was at table  you are lucky major littlepage she said in not having come among us in one of what i call our starving timesand awful times they be if a body may say what she thinks on em  starvation is a serious matter at any time i answered though i did not know you were ever reduced to such difficulties in a country as rich and abundant as this  of what use is riches and abundance if a man will do nothing but fish and shoot ive seen the day when there wasnt a mouthful to eat in this house but a dozen or two of squabs a string of brook trout and maybe a deer or a salmon from one of the lakes  a little bread would have been a welcome addition to such a meal  oh as for bread i count that for nothin we always have bread and potatoes enough but i hold a family to be in a desperate way when the mother can see the bottom of the pork barrel give me the children thats raised on good sound pork afore all the game in the country games good as a relish and sos bread but pork is the staff of life to have good pork a body must have good corn and good corn needs hoeing and a hoe isnt a fishpole or a gun no my children i calkerlate to bring up on pork with just as much bread and butter as they may want  this was american poverty as it existed in 1784 bread butter and potatoes ad libitum but little pork and no tea game in abundance in its season but the poor man who lived on game was supposed to be keeping just as poor an establishment as the epicure in town who gives a dinner to his brethren and is compelled to apologize for there being no game in the market curious to learn more from this woman i pursued the discourse  there are countries i have read i continued in which the poor do not taste meat of any sort not even game from the beginning of the year to its end and sometimes not even bread  well im no great hand for bread as i said afore and should eat no great matter of it so long as i could get pork the woman answered evidently interested in what i had said but i shouldnt like to be without it altogether and the children especially do love to have it with their butter living on potatoes alone must be a wild animal sort of a life  very tame animals do it and that from dire necessity  is there any law agin their using bread and meat  no other law than the one which forbids their using that which is the property of another  good land this is a very common american expression among the womengood land why dont they go to work and get in crops so they might live a little  simply because they have no land to till the land belongs to others too  i should think they might hire if they couldnt buy its about as good to hire as it is to buysome folks folk think its better why dont they take land on shares and live  because land itself is not to be had with us land is abundant we have more of it than is necessary or than will be necessary for ages to come perhaps it would be better for our civilization were there less of it but in the countries of which i speak there are more people than there is land  well land is a good thing i admit and its right there should be an owner to it yet there are folks who would rather squat than buy or hire any day squatting comes natral to em  are there many squatters in this part of the country  the woman looked a little confused and she did not answer me until she had taken time to reflect on what she should say  some folks call us squatters i spose was the reluctant answer but i do not we have bought the betterments of a man who hadnt much of a title i think likely but as we bought his betterments fairly mr tinkumthat was the husbands nameis of opinion that we live under title as it is called what do you say to it major littlepage  i can only say that naught will produce naught nothing nothing if the man of whom you purchased owned nothing he could sell nothing the betterments he called his were not his and in purchasing them you purchased what he did not own  well its no great shakes if he hadnt any right sin tinkum only gin an old saddle that warnt worth two dollars and part of a set of single harness that id defy a conjuror to make fit any mule for the whull right one years rent of this house is worth all put together and that twice over if the truth must be said and weve been in it now seven years my four youngest were all born under this blessed roof such as it is  in that case you will not have much reason to complain when the real owner of the soil appears to claim it the betterments came cheap and they will go as cheap  thats just it though i dont call ourselves much of squatters ater all seein we have paid suthin for the betterments they say an old nail paid in due form will make a sort of title in the highest court of the state im sure the laws should be considerate of the poor  not more so than of the rich the laws should be equal and just and the poor are the last people who ought to wish them otherwise since they are certain to be the losers when any other principle governs rely on it my good woman the man who is forever preaching the rights of the poor is at bottom a rogue and means to make that cry a stalkinghorse for his own benefit since nothing can serve the poor but severe justice no class suffers so much by a departure from the rule as the rich have a thousand other means of attaining their ends when the way is left clear to them by setting up any other master than the right  i dont know but it may be so but i dont call ourselves squatters there is dreadful squatters about here though and on your lands too by the tell  on my lands i am sorry to hear it for i shall feel it a duty to get rid of them i very well know that the great abundance of land that we have in the country its little comparative value and the distance at which the owners generally reside from their estates have united to render the people careless of the rights of those who possess real property and i am prepared to view things as they are among ourselves rather than as they exist in older countries but i shall not tolerate squatters  well by all i hear i think youll call old andries the chainbearer a squatter of the first class they tell me the old chap has come back from the army as fierce as a catamount and that there is no speaking to him as one used to could in old times  you are then an old acquaintance of the chainbearer  i should think i was tinkum and i have lived about a good deal in our day and old andries is a despate hand for the woods he surveyed out for us once or halfsurveyed another betterment but he proved to be a spiteful rogue afore he got through with the business and we have not set much store by him ever sin that time  the chainbearer a rogue andries coejemans any thing but an honest man you are the first person mrs tinkum i have ever heard call in question his sterling integrity  sterling money doesnt pass now i conclude sin its revolution times we all know which side your family was on in the war major littlepage so its no offence to you a proper sharp lookout they had of it here when you quit college for some said old herman mordaunt had ordered in his will that you should uphold the king and then most of the tenants concluded they would get the lands altogether it is a sweet thing major for a tenant to get his farm without paying for it as you may judge some folks was despate sorry when they heern tell that the littlepages went with the colonies  i hope there are few such knaves on the ravensnest estate as to wish anything of the sort but let me hear an explanation of your charge against the chainbearer i have no great concern for my own rights in the patent that i claim  the woman had the audacity or the frankness to draw a long regretful sigh as it might be in my very face that sigh expressed her regrets that i had not taken part with the crown in the last struggle in which case i do suppose she and tinkum would have contrived to squat on one of the farms of ravensnest having sighed however the landlady did not disdain to answer  as for the chainbearer the simple truth is this she said tinkum hired him to run a line between some betterments we had bought and some that had been bought by a neighbor of ourn this was long afore the war and when titles were scarcer than theyre gettin to be now some of the landlords living across the water well what do you think the old fellow did major he first asked for our deeds and we showed them to him as good and lawful warrantees as was ever printed and filled up by a squire he then set to work all by himself jobbing the whull survey as it might be and a prettier line was never run as far as he went which was about halfway i thought it would make etarnel peace atween us and our neighbor for it had been etarnel war afore that for three whull years sometimes with clubs and sometimes with axes and once with scythes but somehowi never knowd howbut somehow old andries found out that the man who deeded to us had no deed to himself or no mortal right to the land any more than that sucking pig you see at the door there when he gin right up refusing to carry out another link or pint another needle he did warnt that being crossgrained and wilful no theres no dependence to be put on the chainbearer  wilful in the cause of right as glorious old andries always is i love and honor him all the better for it  la do you love and honor sich a one as him well i should have expected suthin else from sich a gentleman as you id no idee major littlepage could honor an old wornout chainbearer and he a man that couldnt get up in the world too when he had hands and feet all on em together on some of the very best rounds of the ladder why i judge that even tinkum would have gone ahead if he had been born with sich a chance  andries has been a captain in my own regiment it is true and was once my superior officer but he served for his countrys sake and not for his own have you seen him lately  that we have he passed here about a twelvemonth ago with his whull party on their way to squat on your own land or im mistaken there was the chainbearer himself two helpers dus and young malbone  young who i asked with an interest that induced the woman to turn her keen sunken but sharp gray eyes intently on me  young malbone i said duss brother and the youngster who does all old andriess rithmetic i suppose you know as well as i do that the chainbearer cant calkerlate any more than a wild goose and not half as well as a crow for that matter ive known crows that in plantin time would measure a field in half the number of minutes that the state surveyor would be hours at it  this young malbone then is the chainbearers nephew and he it is who does the surveying  he does the rithmetic part and he is a brother of old andriess niece i knowd the coejemans when i was a gal and ive known the malbones longer than i want to know them  have you any fault to find with the family that you speak thus of them  nothin but their desperate pride which makes them think themselves so much better than everybody else yet they tell me dus and all on em are just as poor as i am myself  perhaps you mistake their feeling good woman a thing i think the more probable as you seem to fancy money the source of their pride at the very moment you deny their having any money is a thing on which few persons of cultivated minds pride themselves the purseproud are almost invariably the vulgar and ignorant  no doubt this was a moral thrown away with such an auditor but i was provoked and when a man is provoked he is not always wise the answer showed the effect it had produced  i dont pretend to know how that is but if it isnt pride what is it that makes dus malbone so different from my daters shed no more think of being like one on em scouring about the lots riding barebacked and scampering through the neighborhood than youd think of cooking my dinnerthat she wouldnt  poor mrs tinkumor as she would have been apt to call herself miss tinkum she had betrayed one of the commonest weaknesses of human nature in thus imputing pride to the chainbearers niece because the latter behaved differently from her and hers how many persons in this good republic of ours judge their neighbors on precisely the same principle inferring something unsuitable because it seems to reflect on their own behavior but by this time i had got to hear the name of dus with some interest and i felt disposed to push the subject further  miss malbone then i said does not ride bareback  la major what in natur puts it into your head to call the gal miss malbone theres no miss malbone living sin her own mother died  well dus malbone i mean she is above riding barebacked  that she is even a pillion would be hardly grand enough for her allowing her own brother to use the saddle  her own brother this young surveyor then is duss brother  sort o and sort o not like they had the same father but different mothers  that explains it i never heard the chainbearer speak of any nephew and it seems the young man is not related to him at allhe is the halfbrother of his niece  why cant that niece behave like other young women thats the question i ask my girls hasnt as much pride as would be good for em not they if a body wants to borrow an article over at the nest and thats seven miles off the whull way in the woods just name it to poll and shed jump on an ox if there warnt a hoss and away shed go ater it with no more bit of a saddle and may be nothin but a halter like a deer give me poll afore all the gals i know for arnds  by this time disrelish for vulgarity was getting the better of curiosity and my dinner of fried pork being done i was willing to drop the discourse i had learned enough of andries and his party to satisfy my curiosity and jaap was patiently waiting to succeed me at the table throwing down the amount of the bill i took a fowlingpiece with which we always travelled in those days bade mrs tinkum goodday ordered the black and the wagoner to follow with the team as soon as ready and went on toward my own property on foot  in a very few minutes i was quite beyond the tinkum betterments and fairly in the forest again it happened that the title to a large tract of land adjoining ravensnest was in dispute and no attempt at a serious settlement had ever been made on it some one had squatted at this spot to enjoy the advantage of selling rum to those who went and came between my own people and the inner country and the place had changed hands half a dozen times by fraudulent or at least by worthless sales from one squatter to another around the house by this time a decaying pile of logs time had done a part of the work of the settler and aided by that powerful servant but fearful master fire had given to the small clearing somewhat of the air of civilized cultivation the moment these narrow limits were passed however the traveller entered the virgin forest with no other sign of man around him than what was offered in the little worked and little travelled road the highway was not much indebted to the labors of man for any facilities it afforded the traveller the trees had been cut out of it it is true but their roots had not been extracted and time had done more toward destroying them than the axe or the pick time had done a good deal however and the inequalities were getting to be smooth under the hoof and wheel a tolerably good bridlepath had long been made and i found no difficulty in walking in it since that answered equally well for man and beast  the virgin forest of america is usually no place for the ordinary sportsman the birds that are called game are but rarely found in it one or two excepted and it is a wellknown fact that while the frontierman is certain death with a riflebullet knocking the head off a squirrel or a wild turkey at his sixty or eighty yards it is necessary to go into the older parts of the country and principally among sportsmen of the better classes in order to find those who knock over the woodcock snipe quail grouse and plover on the wing i was thought a good shot on the plains and over the heaths or commons of the island of manhattan and among the rocks of westchester but i saw nothing to do up there where i then was surrounded by trees that had stood there centuries it would certainly have been easy enough for me to kill a blue jay now and then or a crow or even a raven or perhaps an eagle had i the proper shot but as for anything that is ordinarily thought to adorn a gamebag not a feather could i see for the want of something better to do then if a young man of three or four and twenty ought thus to express himself i began to ruminate on the charms of pris bayard and on the singularities of dus malbone in this mood i proceeded getting over the grounds at a rapid rate leaving miss tinkum the clearing with its betterments and the wagon far behind me  i had walked an hour alone when the silence of the woods was suddenly interrupted by the words of a song that came not from any of the feathered race though the nightingale itself could hardly have equalled the sweetness of the notes which were those of a female voice the low notes struck me as the fullest richest and most plaintive i had ever heard and i fancied they could not be equalled until the strain carried the singers voice into a higher key where it seemed equally at home i thought i knew the air but the words were guttural and in an unknown tongue french and dutch were the only two foreign languages in which one usually heard any music in our part of the woods at that day and even the first was by no means common but with both these languages i had a little acquaintance and i was soon satisfied that the words i heard belonged to neither at length it flashed on my mind that the song was indian not the music but the words the music was certainly scotch or that altered italian that time has attributed to the scotch and there was a moment when i fancied some highland girl was singing near me one of the celtic songs of the country of her childhood but closer attention satisfied me that the words were really indian probably belonging to the mohawk or some other language that i had often heard spoken  the reader may be curious to know whence these sounds proceeded and why i did not see the being who gave birth to such delicious harmony it was owing to the fact that the song came from out of a thicket of young pines that grew on an ancient opening at a little distance from the road and which i supposed contained a hut of some sort or other these pines however completely concealed all within them so long as the song lasted no tree of the forest was more stationary than myself but when it ended i was about to advance toward the thicket in order to pry into its mysteries when i heard a laugh that had scarcely less of melody in it than the strains of the music itself it was not a vulgar clamorous burst of girlish impulses nor was it even loud but it was lighthearted mirthful indicating humor if a mere laugh can do so much and in a sense it was contagious it arrested my movement in order to listen and before any new impulse led me forward the branches of the pines opened and a man passed out of the thicket into the road a single glance sufficed to let me know that the stranger was an indian  notwithstanding i was apprised of the near vicinity of others i was a little startled with this sudden apparition not so with him who was approaching he could not have known of my being anywhere near him yet he manifested no emotion as his cold undisturbed glance fell on my form steadily advancing he came to the centre of the road and as i had turned involuntarily to pursue my own way not sure it was prudent to remain in that neighborhood alone the red man fell in with his moccasined foot at my elbow and i found that we were thus strangely pursuing our journey in the same direction side by side  the indian and myself walked in this manner within a yard of each other in the midst of that forest for two or three minutes without speaking i forbore to say anything because i had heard that an indian respected those most who knew best how to repress their curiosity which habit most probably had its effect on my companion at length the red man uttered in the deep guttural manner of his people the common conventional salutation of the frontier  saago  this word which has belonged to some indian language once passes everywhere for indian with the white man and quite likely for english with the indian a set of such terms has grown up between the two races including such words as moccasin pappoose tomahawk squaw and many others saago means how dye do  saagoi answered to my neighbors civil salutation  after this we walked along for a few minutes more neither party speaking i took this opportunity to examine my red brother an employment that was all the easier from the circumstance that he did not once look at me the single glance sufficing to tell him all he wanted to know in the first place i was soon satisfied that my companion did not drink a rare merit in a red man who lived near the whites this was evident from his countenance gait and general bearing as i thought in addition to the fact that he possessed no bottle or anything else that would hold liquor what i liked the least was the circumstance of his being completely armed carrying knife tomahawk and rifle and each seemingly excellent of its kind he was not painted however and he wore an ordinary calico shirt as was then the usual garb of his people in the warm season the countenance had the stern severity that is so common to a red warrior and as this man was turned of fifty his features began to show the usual signs of exposure and service still he was a vigorous respectablelooking red man and one who was evidently accustomed to live much among civilized men i had no serious uneasiness of course at meeting such a person although we were so completely buried in the forest but as a soldier i could not help reflecting how inferior my fowlingpiece would necessarily prove to be to his rifle should he see fit to turn aside and pull upon me from behind a tree for the sake of plunder tradition said such things had happened though on the whole the red man of america has perhaps proved to be the most honest of the two as compared with those who have supplanted him  how ole chief the indian suddenly asked without even raising his eyes from the road  old chief do you mean washington my friend  not somean ole chief out here at nest mean fader  my father do you know general littlepage  be sure know him your faderseeholding up his two forefingersjust likedat him dis you  this is singular enough and were you told that i was coming to this place  hear dat too always talk about chief  is it long since you saw my father  see him in wartimenebber hear of ole sureflint  i had heard the officers of our regiment speak of such an indian who had served a good deal with the corps and been exceedingly useful in the two great northern campaigns especially he never happened to be with the regiment after i joined it though his name and services were a good deal mixed up with the adventures of 1776 and 1777  certainly i answered shaking the red man cordially by the hand certainly have i heard of you and something that is connected with times before the war did you never meet my father before the war  sartain meet in ole war ginral young man denjust like son  by what name were you then known oneida  no oneidaonondagosober tribe hab plenty name sometime one sometime anoder paleface say trackless cause he cant find his trailwarrior call him susquesus     chapter viii      with what free growth the elm and plane       fling their huge arms across my way     gray old and cumberd with a train       of vines as huge and old and gray     free stray the lucid streams and find       no taint in these fresh lawns and shades     free spring the flowers that scent the wind       where never scythe has swept the gladesbryant   i had heard enough of my fathers early adventures to know that the man mentioned in the last chapter had been a conspicuous actor in them and remembered that the latter enjoyed the fullest confidence of the former it was news to me however that sureflint and the trackless were the same person though when i came to reflect on the past i had some faint recollection of having once before heard something of the sort at any rate i was now with a friend and no longer thought it necessary to be on my guard this was a great relief in every point of view as one does not like to travel at the side of a stranger with an impression however faint that the latter may blow his brains out the first time he ventures to turn his own head aside  susquesus was drawing near to the decline of life had he been a white man i might have said he was in a green old age but the term of red old age would suit him much better his features were still singularly fine while the cheeks without being very full had that indurated solid look that flesh and muscles get from use and exposure his form was as erect as in his best days a red mans frame rarely yielding in this way to any pressure but that of exceeding old age and that of rum susquesus never admitted the enemy into his mouth and consequently the citadel of his physical man was secure against every invader but time intoed and yielding in his gait the old warrior and runner still passed over the ground with an easy movement and when i had occasion to see him increase his speed as soon after occurred i did not fail to perceive that his sinews seemed strung to their utmost force and that every movement was free  for a time the indian and i talked of the late war and of the scenes in which each of us had been an actor if my own modesty was as obvious as that of sureflint i had no reason to be dissatisfied with myself for the manner in which he alluded to events in which i knew he had been somewhat prominent was simple and entirely free from that boasting in which the red man is prone to indulge more especially when he wishes to provoke his enemies at length i changed the current of the discourse by saying abruptly  you were not alone in that pine thicket susquesus that from which you came when you joined me  nosartain wasnt alone plenty people dere  is there an encampment of your tribe among those bushes  a shade passed over the dark countenance of my companion and i saw a question had been asked that gave him pain he paused some little time before he answered and when he did it was in a way that seemed sad  susquesus got tribe no longer quit onondagos tirty summer now dont like mohawk  i remember to have heard something of this from my father who told me at the same time that the reason why you left your people was to your credit but you had music in the thicket  yes gal singgal love sing warrior like to listen  and the song in what language were the words  onondago answered the indian in a low tone  i had no idea the music of the red people was so sweet it is many a day since i have heard a song that went so near to my heart though i could not understand what was said  bird pretty birdsing like wren  and is there much of this music in your family susquesus if so i shall come often to listen  why not come path got no briar short path too gal sing when you want  then i shall certainly be your guest some day soon where do you live now are you sureflint or trackless today i see you are armed but not painted  hatchet buried berry deep dis time no dig him up in great many year mohawk make peace oneida make peace onondago make peaceall bury e hatchet  well so much the better for us landholders i have come to sell and lease my lands perhaps you can tell me if many young men are out hunting for farms this summer  wood full plenty as pigeons how you sell land  that will depend on where it is and how good it is do you wish to buy trackless  injin own all land for what he want now i make wigwam where i want make him too when i want  i know very well that you indians do claim such a right and so long as the country remains in its present wild state no one will be apt to refuse it to you but you cannot plant and gather as most of your people do in their own country  got no squawgot no papooselittle corn do for susquesus no tribeno squawno pappose  this was said in a low deliberate voice and with a species of manly melancholy that i found very touching complaining men create very little sympathy and those who whine are apt to lose our respect but i know no spectacle more imposing than that of one of stern nature smothering his sorrows beneath the mantle of manliness and selfcommand  you have friends susquesus i answered if you have no wife nor children  fader good friend hope son friend too grandfader great friend once but he gone far away and nebber come back know moder know faderall good  take what land you want tracklesstill it sell itdo what you wish with it  the indian eyed me keenly and i detected a slight smile of pleasure stealing over his weatherworn face it was not easy to throw him off his habitual guard over his emotions however and the gleam of illumination passed away like a ray of sunshine in midwinter the sternest white man might have grasped my hand and something like a sign of gratitude would probably have escaped him but the little trace of emotion i have mentioned having disappeared nothing remained on the dark visage of my companion that in the least resembled an evidence of yielding to any of the gentler feelings nevertheless he was too courteous and had too much of the innate sentiment of a gentleman not to make some return for an offer that had so evidently and spontaneously come from the heart  goodhe said after a long pause berry good dat good to come from young warrior to ole warrior tankeebird plenty fish plenty message plenty now and dont want land time come maybespose he must comecome to all old red men hereabout so spose must come  what time do you mean trackless let it come when it may you have a friend in me what time do you mean my brave old sureflint  the trackless stopped dropped the breech of his rifle on the ground and stood meditating a minute motionless and as grand as some fine statue  yes time come do spose he continued one time ole warrior live in wigwam and tell young warrior of scalp and councilfire and hunt and warpath now make broom and basket  it was not easy to mistake this and i do not remember ever to have felt so lively an interest on so short an acquaintance as i began to feel in this onondago priscilla bayard herself however lovely graceful winning and feminine had not created a feeling so strong and animated as that which was awakened within me in behalf of old sureflint but i fully understood that this was to be shown in acts and not in words contenting myself for the present after the fashion of the palefaces by grasping and squeezing the sinewy hand of the warrior we walked on together making no farther allusion to a subject that i can truly say was as painful to me as it was to my companion  i have heard your name mentioned as one of those who were at the nest with my father when he was a young man susquesus i resumed and when the canada indians attempted to burn the house  goodsusquesus dereyoung dutch chief kill dat time  very truehis name was guert ten eyke and my father and mother and your old friend colonel follock who was afterward major of our regiment you will remember they love his memory to this day as that of a very dear friend  dat all love memory now asked the indian throwing one of his keenest glances at me  i understood the allusion which was to aunt mary whom i had heard spoken of as the betrothed or at least as the beloved of the young albanian  not all for there is a lady who still mourns his loss as if she had been his widow  gooddo squaw dont mourn fery long time sometime not always  pray trueflint do you happen to know any thing of a man called the chainbearer he was in the regiment too and you must have seen him in the war  sartainknow chainbearerknow him on warpathknow him when hatchet buried knew chainbearer afore ole french war live in wood wid himone of us chainbearer my friend  i rejoice to hear this for he is also mine and i shall be glad to come into the compact as a friend of both  goodsusquesus and young landlord friend of chainbearergood  it is good and a league that shall not be forgotten easily by me the chainbearer is as honest as light and as certain as his own compass trueflinttrue as yourself  fraid he make broom fore great while too said the indian expressing the regret i have no doubt he felt very obviously in his countenance  poor old andries but for the warm and true friends he had in my father colonel dirck and myself there was some danger this might be the case indeed the fact that he had served his country in a revolution would prove of little avail that country being too poor to provide for its old servants and possibly indisposed had she the means7 i say this without intending to reflect on either the people or the government for it is not easy to make the men of the present day understand the deep depression in a pecuniary sense that rested on the land for a year or two after peace was made it recovered as the child recovers from indisposition by the vigor of its constitution and the power of its vitality and one of the means by which it recovered was by turning to the soil and wielding the sickle instead of the sword to continue the discourse  footnote 7 this must pass for one of the hits the republic is exposed to partly because it deserves them and partly because it is a republic one hears a great deal of this ingratitude of republics but few take the trouble of examining into the truth of the charge or its reason if true i suppose the charge to be true in part and for the obvious reason that a government founded on the popular will is necessarily impulsive in such matters and feels no necessity to be just in order to be secure then a democracy is always subject to the influence of the cant of economy which is next thing to the evil of being exposed to the waste and cupidity of those who take because they have the power as respects the soldiers of the revolution however america under the impulsive feeling rather than in obedience to a calm deliberate desire to be just has since the time of mr mordaunt littlepage made such a liberal provision for pensioning them as to include a good many of her enemies as well as all her friendseditor  the chainbearer is an honest man and like too many of his class poor i answered but he has friends and neither he nor you sureflint shall be reduced to that womans work without your own consent so long as i have an unoccupied house or a farm at ravensnest  again the indian manifested his sense of my friendship for him by that passing gleam on his dark face and again all signs of emotion passed slowly away  how long since see him he asked me suddenly  see himthe chainbearer do you mean i have not seen him now for more than a twelvemonth not since we parted when the regiment was disbanded  dont mean chainbearermean him pointing aheadhouse tree farm land nest  oh how long is it since i saw the patent i never saw it sureflint this is my first visit  dat queer how you own land when nebber see him  among the palefaces we have such laws that property passes from parent to child and i inherit mine in this neighborhood from my grandfather herman mordaunt  what dat mean herit how man haf land when he dont keep him  we do keep it if not by actually remaining on the spot by means of our laws and our titles the palefaces regulate all these things on paper sureflint  tink dat good why no let man take land where he want him when he want him plenty land got more land dan got people nough for ebberybody  that fact makes our laws just if there were not land enough for everybody these restrictions and divisions might seem to be and in fact be unjust now any man can have a farm who will pay a very moderate price for it the state sells and landlords sell and those who dont choose to buy of one can buy of the other  dat true nough but dont see need of dat paper when he want to stay on land let him stay when he want to go somewhere let noder man come what good pay for betterment  so as to have betterments these are what we call the rights of property without which no man would aim at being anything more than clad and fed who would hunt if anybody that came along had a right to pick up and skin his game  see dat well noughnebber do no nebber dont see why land go like skin when skin go wid warrior and hunter and land stay where he be  that is because the riches of you red men are confined to movable property and to your wigwams so long as you choose to live in them thus far you respect the rights of property as well as the palefaces but you must see a great difference between your people and mine between the red man and the white man  be sure differ one strong toder weakone rich toder poorone great toder littleone drive way toder haf to goone get all toder keep nuttinone march large army toder go indian file fifty warrior prapsdat reason ting so  and why can the palefaces march in large armies with cannon and horses and bayonets and the red man not do the same  cause he no got emno got warriorno got gunno got baggonetno got nuttin  you have given the effect for the cause sureflint or the consequences of the reason for the reason itself i hope i make you understand me listen and i will explain you have lived much with the white men susquesus and can believe what i say there are good and there are bad among all people color makes no difference in this respect still all people are not alike the white man is stronger than the red man and has taken away his country because he knows most  he most too count army den count wartrail you see  it is true the palefaces are the most numerous now but once they were not do not your traditions tell you how few the yangeese were when they first came across the salt lake  come in big canoetwo tree fullno more  why then did two or three shipfuls of white men become so strong as to drive back from the sea all the red warriors and become masters of the land can you give a reason for that  cause he bring firewater wid him and red man big fool to drink  even that firewater which doubtless has proved a cruel gift to the indians is one of the fruits of the white mans knowledge no susquesus the redskin is as brave as the paleface as willing to defend his rights and as ablebodied but he does not know as much he had no gunpowder until the white man gave it to himno rifleno hoe no knife no tomahawk but such as he made himself from stones now all the knowledge and all the arts of life that the white man enjoys and turns to his profit come from the rights of property no man would build a wigwam to make rifles in if he thought he could not keep it as long as he wished sell it when he pleased and leave it to his son when he went to the land of spirits it is by encouraging mans love of himself in this manner that he is got to do so much thus it is too that the father gives to the son what he has learned as well as what he has built or bought and so in time nations get to be powerful as they get to be what we called civilized without these rights of property no people could be civilized for no people would do their utmost unless each man were permitted to be master of what he can acquire subject to the great and common laws that are necessary to regulate such matters i hope you understand my meaning trackless  sartainno like trackless moccasinmy young friends tongue leave trail but you tink great spirit say who shall haf land who no haf him  the great spirit has created man as he is and the earth as it is and he has left the one to be master of the other if it were not his pleasure that man should not do as he has done it would not be done different laws and different feelings would then bring about different ends when the law places all men on a level as to rights it does as much as can be expected of it now this level does not consist in pulling everything to pieces periodically but in respecting certain great principles that are just in themselves but which once started must be left to follow their own course when the rights of property are first established they must be established fairly on some admitted rule after which they are to remain inviolablethat is to say sacred  understandno live in clearin for nuttin mean haf no head widout haf farm  that is the meaning substantially sureflint though i might have explained it a little differently i wish to say palefaces would be like the red man without civilization and without civilization if they had no rights in their land no one will work for another as he will work for himself we see that every day in the simplest manner when we see that the desire to get good wages will not make the common laborer do as much by the day as he will do by the job  dat true answered the indian smiling for he seldom laughed and repeating a common saying of the countrybydedaybydedayby de job job job dat paleface religion young chief  i dont know that our religion has much to do with it but i will own it is our practice i fancy it is the same with all races and colors a man must work for himself to do his most and he cannot work for himself unless he enjoy the fruits of his labor thus it is that he must have a right of property in land either bought or hired in order to make him cause that land to produce all that nature intended it should produce on this necessity is founded the rights of property the gain being civilization the loss ignorance and poverty and weakness it is for this reason then that we buy and sell land as well as clothes and arms and beads  tink understand great spirit den say must have farm  the great spirit has said we must have wants and wishes that can be met or gratified only by having farms to have farms we must have owners and owners cannot exist unless their rights in their lands are protected as soon as these are gone the whole building would tumble down about our ears susquesus  well spose him so we see some time young chief know where he is  not exactly but i suppose we are drawing near to the lands of ravensnest  well queer nough too own land but dont know him seemarked treedat sign your land begin  thank you sureflinta parent would not know his own child when he saw him for the first time if i am owner here you will remember that this is my first visit to the spot  while conversing the trackless had led me from the highway into a footpath which as i afterward discovered made a shortcut across some hills and saved us near two miles in the distance in consequence of this change in our course jaap could not have overtaken me had he moved faster than he did but owing to the badness of the road our gait on foot was somewhat faster than that of the jaded beasts who dragged the wagon my guide knew the way perfectly and as we ascended a hill he pointed out the remains of an old fire near a spring as a spot where he was accustomed to camp when he wished to remain near but not in the nest  too much rum in tavern he said no good stay near rum  this was extraordinary forbearance for an indian but susquesus i had ever understood was an extraordinary indian even for an onondago he was temperate and selfdenying the reason why he lived away from his tribe was a secret from most persons though i subsequently ascertained it was known to the chainbearer as well as my father old andries always affirmed it was creditable to his friend but he would never betray the secret indeed i found that the sympathy which existed between these two men each of whom was so singular in his way was cemented by some occurrences of their early lives to which occasional but vague allusions were made but which neither ever revealed to me or to any other person so far as i could ascertain  soon after passing the spring sureflint led me out to a cleared spot on the eminence which commanded an extensive view of most of that part of my possessions which was under lease and occupied here we halted seating ourselves on a fallen tree for which one could never go amiss in that region and at that day and i examined the view with the interest which ownership is apt to create in us all the earth is very beautiful in itself but it is most beautiful in the eye of those who have the largest stake in it i fear  although the property of ravensnest had been settled fully thirty years when i first saw it none of those signs of rapid and energetic improvement were visible that we have witnessed in the efforts of similar undertakings since the revolution previously to that great event the country filled up very slowly and each colony seemed to regard itself in some measure as a distinct country thus it was that we in new york obtained very few immigrants from new england that great hive which has so often swarmed since and the bees of which have carried their industry and ingenuity over so much of the republic in our own time we of new york have our prejudices against the yankees and have long looked upon them with eyes of distrust and disfavor they have repaid us in kind perhaps but their dislikes have not been strong enough to prevent them from coming to take possession of our lands for my own part while i certainly see much in the new england character that i do not like more in their manners and minor ways perhaps than in essentials i as certainly see a great deal to command my respect if the civilization that they carry with them is not of a very high order as is connected with the tastes sentiments and nicer feelings it is superior to that of any other country i have visited in its commonsense provisions and in its care over the intellectual being considered in reference to the foundations of learning more persons are dragged from out the mire of profound ignorance under their system than under that of any other people and a greater number of candidates are brought forward for intellectual advancements that so few of these candidates rise very high in the scale of knowledge is in part owing to the circumstance that their lives are so purely practical and possibly in part to the fact that while so much attention has been paid to the foundations of the social edifice that little art or care has as yet been expended on the superstructure nevertheless the millions of yankees that are spreading themselves over the land are producing and have already produced a most salutary influence on its practical knowledge on its enterprise on its improvements and consequently on its happiness if they have not done much for its tastes its manners and its higher principles it is because no portion of the earth is perfect i am fully aware that this is conceding more than my own father would have conceded in their favor and twice as much as could have been extracted from either of my grandfathers but prejudice is wearing away and the dutchman and the yankee in particular find it possible to live in proximity and charity it is possible that my son may be willing to concede even more our immigrant friends should remember one thing however and it would render them much more agreeable as companions and neighbors which is thishe who migrates is bound to respect the habits and opinions of those whom he joins it not being sufficient for the perfection of everything under the canopy of heaven that it should come from our own little corner of the earth even the pumpkinpies of the middle states are vastly better than those usually found in new england to return to ravensnest  the thirty years of the settlement of my patent then had not done much for it in the way of works of art time it is true had effected something and it was something in a manner that was a little peculiar and which might be oftener discovered in the country at the time of which i am writing than at the present day the timber of the nest with the exception of some mountainland was principally what in american parlance is termed hard wood in other words the trees were not perennial but deciduous and the merest tyro in the woods knows that the roots of the last decay in a fourth of the time that the roots of the first endure after the trunk is severed as a consequence the stumps had nearly all disappeared from the fields a fact that of itself gave to the place the appearance of an old country according to our american notions it is true the virgin forest still flourished in immediate contact with those fields shorn tilled and smoothed as they were giving a wild and solemn setting to the rural picture the latter presented the contrast was sufficiently bold and striking but it was not without its soft and pleasant points from the height whither the indian had led me i had a foreground of open land dotted with cottages and barns mostly of logs beautified by flourishing orchards and garnished with broad meadows or enriched by fields in which the corn was waving under the currents of a light summer air two or three roads wound along the settlement turning aside with friendly interest to visit every door and at the southern termination of the open country there was a hamlet built of wood framed which contained one house that had little taste but a good deal more of pretension than any of its neighbors another that was an inn a store a blacksmithsshop a schoolhouse and three or four other buildings besides barns sheds and hogpens near the hamlet or the nest village as the place was called were the mills of the region these were a gristmill a sawmill a fullingmill and an oilmill all were of moderate dimensions and most probably of moderate receipts even the best house was not painted though it had some very ambitious attempts at architecture and enjoyed the benefits of no less than four exterior doors the uses of one of which as it opened into the air from the second story it was not very easy to imagine doubtless some great but unfinished project of the owner lay at the root of this invention but living out of doors as it were is rather a characteristic of a portion of our people  the background of this picture to which a certain degree of rural beauty was not wanting was the boundless woods woods stretched away north and south and east far as eye could reach woods crowned the sides and summits of all the mountains in view and woods rose up with their leafy carpeting from out the ravines and dells the war had prevented any very recent attempts at clearing and all the open ground wore the same aspect of homely cultivation while the dark shades of an interminable forest were spread around forming a sort of mysterious void that lay between this obscure and remote people and the rest of their kind that forest however was not entirely savage there were other settlements springing up in its bosom a few roads wound their way through its depth and here and there the hunter the squatter or the red man had raised his cabin and dwelt amid the sullen but not unpleasant abundance and magnificence of the wilderness     chapter ix      o masters if i were disposed to stir     your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage     i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong     who you all know are honorable men     i will not do them wrong i rather choose     to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you     than i will wrong such honorable menshakspeare   this then is ravensnest i exclaimed after gazing on the scene for several minutes in silence the estate left me by my grandfather and where events once occurred that are still spoken of in my family as some of the most momentous in its history events susquesus in which you were an actor  the indian made a low interjection but it is not probable he fully understood me what was there so remarkable in a savage inroad a house besieged men slain and scalps taken that he should remember such things for a quarter of a century  i do not see the nest itself trueflint i added the house in which my grandfather once lived  the onondago did not speak but he pointed with a finger in a northeasterly direction making the action distinct and impressive as is usual with his people i knew the place by the descriptions i had heard though it was now mouldering and had gone far into decay logs piled up green and confined in such a structure will last some thirty or forty years according to the nature of the trees from which they come and the manner in which they have been covered at that distance i could not well distinguish how far or how much time had done its work but i fancied i knew enough of such matters to understand i was not to expect in the nest a very comfortable home a family dwelt in the old place and i had seen some cheeses that had been made on the very fine farm that was attached to it there was a large and seemingly a flourishing orchard and the fields looked well but as for the house at that distance it appeared sombre dark and was barely to be distinguished by its form and chimneys from any other pile of logs  i was struck with the silent dreamy sabbathlike air of the fields far and near with the exception of a few halfnaked children who were visible around the dwellings to which we were the closest not a human being could i discover the fields were tenantless so far as men were concerned though a good many horned cattle were to be seen grazing  my tenants are not without stock i find trueflint i remarked there are plenty of cattle in the pastures  you see all young answered the onondago war do dat kill ole one for soldier  by the way as this settlement escaped plunder i should think its people may have done something by selling supplies to the army provisions of all kinds were very high and scarce i remember when we met burgoyne  sartain your people sell both sidegood trade den feed yankeesfeed yengeese  well i make no doubt it was so for the husbandman is not very apt to hesitate when he can get a good price and if he were the conscience of the drover would stand between him and treason but where are all the men of this country i do not see a single man far or near  no see himdere answered the indian pointing in the direction of the hamlet squire light councilfire today spose and make speech  true enoughthere they are gathered about the schoolhouse but whom do you mean by the squire who is so fond of making speeches  ole schoolmaster come from salt lakegreat friend of grandfader  oh mr newcome my agenttrue i might have known that he was king of the settlement well trueflint let us go on and when we reach the tavern we shall be able to learn what the great council is about say nothing of my business for it will be pleasant to look on a little before i speak myself  the indian arose and led the way down the height following a footpath with which he appeared to be familiar in a few minutes we were in a highway and at no great distance from the hamlet i had laid aside most of the dress that it was the fashion of gentlemen to wear in 1784 and put on a huntingshirt and leggings as more fitting for the woods consequently it would not have been easy for one who was not in the secret to imagine that he who arrived on foot in such a garb carrying his fowlingpiece and accompanied by an indian was the owner of the estate i had sent no recent notice of my intended arrival and as we went along i took a fancy to get a faint glimpse of things incognito in order to do this it might be necessary to say a word more to the indian  susquesus i added as we drew near the schoolhouse which stood between us and the tavern i hope you have understood methere is no need of telling any one who i am if asked you can answer i am your friend that will be true as you will find as long as you live  goodyoung chief got eyes want to look wid em himself goodsusquesus know  in another minute we stopped in the crowd before the door of the schoolhouse the indian was so well known and so often at the nest that his appearance excited no attention some important business appeared on the carpet for there was much caucusing much private conversation many eager faces and much putting together of heads while the public mind was thus agitated few were disposed to take any particular notice of me though i had not stood long in the outer edge of the crowd which may have contained sixty or seventy men besides quite as many wellgrown lads before i overheard an interrogatory put as to who i was and whether i had a right to a vote my curiosity was a good deal excited and i was on the point of asking some explanation when a man appeared in the door of the schoolhouse who laid the whole matter bare in a speech this person had a shrivelled careworn but keen look and was somewhat better dressed than most around him though not particularly elegant or even very neat in his toilette he was grayheaded of a small thin figure and might have been drawing hard upon sixty he spoke in a deliberate selfpossessed manner as if long accustomed to the sort of business in which he was engaged but in a very decided connecticut accent i say connecticut in contradistinction to that of new england generally for while the eastern states have many common peculiarities in this way a nice and practised ear can tell a rhodeislander from a massachusetts man and a connecticut man from either as the orator opened his mouth to remove a chew of tobacco previously to opening it to speak a murmur near me saidhist theres the squire now we shall get suthin this then was mr jason newcome my agent and the principal resident in the settlement  fellowcitizensmr newcome commencedyou are assembled this day on a most important and i may say trying occasion an occasion calculated to exercise all our spirits your business is to decide on the denomination of the church building that you are about to erect and the futur welfare of your souls may in one sense be said to be interested in your decision your deliberations have already been opened by prayer and now you are about to come to a final vote differences of opinion have and do exist among you but differences of opinion exist everywhere they belong to liberty the blessings of which are not to be enjyed without full and free differences of opinion religious liberty demands differences of opinion as a body might say and without them there would be no religious liberty you all know the weighty reason there is for coming to some conclusion speedily the owner of the sile will make his appearance this summer and his family are all of a desperate tendency toward an idolatrous church which is unpleasant to most of you to prevent any consequences therefore from his interference we ought to decide at once and not only have the house raised but ruffed in afore he arrives among ourselves however we have been somewhat divided and that is a different matter on the former votes it has stood twentysix for congregational to twentyfive presbytery fourteen methodist nine baptist three universal and one episcopal now nothin is clearer than that the majority ought to rule and that it is the duty of the minority to submit my first decision as moderator was that the congregationals have it by a majority of one but some being dissatisfied with that opinion i have been ready to hear reason and to take the view that twentysix is not a majority but a plurality as it is called as twentysix or twentyfive however is a majority over nine and over three and over one taking their numbers singly or together your committee report that the baptists universals and episcopals ought to be dropped and that the next vote now to be taken shall be confined to the three highest numbers that is to say to the congregationals the presbyterians and the methodists everybody has a right to vote for which he pleases provided he vote for one of them three i suppose i am understood and shall now put the question unless some gentleman has any remarks to make  mr moderator cried out a burly heartylooking yeoman is it in order now to speak  quite so sirorder gentlemen ordermajor hosmer is up  up we all were if standing on ones feet be up but the word was parliamentary and it appeared to be understood  mr moderator i am of the baptist order and i do not think the decision just sin it compels us baptists to vote for a denomination we dont like or not to vote at all  but you will allow that the majority ought to rule interrupted the chair  sartaini agree to that for that is a part of my religion too returned the old yeoman heartily and with an air of perfect good faiththe majority ought to rule but i do not see that a majority is in favor of the congregationals any more than it is of the baptists  we will put it to vote agin major just for your satisfaction returned mr newcome with an air of great candor and moderation gentlemen those of you who are in favor of the baptists not being included in the next vote for denomination will please to hold up your hands  as every man present who was not a baptist voted ay there were sixtynine hands shown the nos were then demanded in the same way and the baptists got their nine own votes as before major hosmer admitted he was satisfied though he looked as if there might be something wrong in the procedure after all as the baptists were the strongest of the three excluded sects the other two made a merit of necessity and said nothing it was understood they were in a minority and a minority as it very often happens in america has very few rights  it now remains gentlemen resumed the moderator who was a model of submission to the public voice to put the vote as between the congregationals the presbyterians and the methodists i shall first put the congregationalists those who are in favor of that sect the old connecticut standing order will please to hold up their hands  the tone of voice the coaxing expression of the eye and the words old connecticut standing order let me at once into the secret of the moderators wishes at first but thirtyfour hands appeared but the moderator having counted these he looked round the crowd until he fairly looked up three more after which he honestly enough announced the vote to be thirtyseven for the congregationalists so eleven of the thirteen of silenced sects had most probably voted with the moderator the presbyterians came next and they got their own people and two of the baptists making twentyseven in all on a trial in their behalf the methodists got only their own fourteen  it evidently appearing gentleman said the moderator that the methodists gain no strength and being less than half the congregational vote and much lower than the presbyterian i put it to their own wellknown christian humility whether they ought not to withdraw  put it openly to vote as you did agin us came out a baptist  is that your pleasure gentlemen seeing that it is i will now try the vote those who are in favor of the methodists withdrawing will hold up their hands  sixtyfour hands were raised for and fourteen against the withdrawal  it is impossible for any religion to flourish agin such a majority said the moderator with great apparent candor and though i regret it for i sincerely wish we were strong enough to build meetinhouses for every denomination in the world but as we are not we must take things as they are and so the methodists must withdraw gentlemen the question is now narrowed down to the congregationals and the presbyterians there is not much difference between them and it is a thousand pities there should be any are you ready for the question gentlemen no answer being given i shall put the vote  and the vote was put the result being thirtynine to thirtynine or a tie i could see that the moderator was disappointed and supposed he would claim a casting vote in addition to the one he had already given but i did not know my man mr newcome avoided all appearances of personal authority majorities were his cardinal rule and to majorities alone he would defer whenever he chose to govern it was by means of majorities the exercise of a power as accidentally bestowed as that of presiding officer might excite heartburnings and envy but he who went with a majority was certain of having the weight of public sympathies on his side nonomr newcome never had an opinion as against numbers  i am sorry to say that very mistaken notions of the power of majorities are beginning to take root among us  it is common to hear it asserted as a political axiom that the majority must rule the axiom may be innocent enough when its application is properly made which is simply to say that in the control of those interests of which the decision is referred to majorities majorities must rule but god forbid that the majorities should ever rule in all things in this republic or anywhere else such a state of things would soon become intolerable rendering the government that admitted of its existence the most odious tyranny that has been known in christendom in modern times the government of this country is the sway of certain great and incontestable principles that are just in themselves and which are set forth in the several constitutions and under which certain minor questions are periodically referred to local majorities or of necessity out of the frequency of which appeals has arisen a mistake that is getting to be dangerously general god forbid i repeat that a mere personal majority should assume the power which alone belongs to principles  mr newcome avoided a decision as from the chair but three several times did he take the vote and each time was there a tie i could now perceive that he was seriously uneasy such steadiness denoted that men had made up their minds and that they would be apt to adhere to them since one side was apparently as strong as the other the circumstance called for a display of democratical tactics and mr newcome being very expert in such matters he could have little difficulty in getting along with the simple people with whom he had to deal  you see how it is fellowcitizens the public has taken sides and formed itself into two parties from this moment the affair must be treated as a party question and be decided on party principles though the majority must rule oh here neighbor willis will you just step over to my house and ask miss newcome anglice mrs newcome to hand you the last volume of the state laws perhaps they have a word to say in the matter here neighbor willis did as desired and moved out of the crowd as i afterward discovered he was a warm presbyterian who happened unfortunately for his sect to stand so directly before the moderator as unavoidably to catch his eye i suspected that squire newcome would now call a vote on the main question but i did not know my man this would have been too palpably a trick and he carefully avoided committing the blunder there was plenty of time since the moderator knew his wife could not very readily find a book he had lent to a magistrate in another settlement twenty miles off so that he did not hesitate to have a little private conversation with one or two of his friends  not to be losing time mr moderator said one of squire newcomes confidants i will move you that it is the sense of this meeting that the government of churches by means of a presbytery is antirepublican opposed to our glorious institutions and at variance with the best interests of the human family i submit the question to the public without debate being content to know the unbiased sentiments of my fellowcitizens on the subject  the question was duly seconded and put the result being thirtynine for and thirtyeight against or a majority of one that presbyterian rule was antirepublican this was a great coup de maître having settled that it was opposed to the institutions to have a presbytery a great deal was gained toward establishing another denomination in the settlement no religion can maintain itself against political sentiments in this country politics coming home daily to mens minds and pockets  it is odd enough that while all sects agree in saying that the christian religion comes from god and that its dogmas are to be received as the laws of infinite wisdom men should be found sufficiently illogical or sufficiently presumptuous to imagine that any the least of its rules are to be impaired or strengthened by their dissemblance or their conformity to any provisions of human institutions as well might it be admitted at once that christianity is not of divine origin or the still more extravagant position be assumed that the polity which god himself has established can be amended by any of the narrow and shortsighted devices of man nevertheless it is not to be concealed that here as elsewhere churches are fashioned to suit the institutions and not the institutions to suit the church  having achieved so much success the moderators confidant pushed his advantage  mr moderator he continued as this question has altogether assumed a party character it is manifestly proper that the party which has the majority should not be encumbered in its proceedings by the movements of the minority presbytery has been denounced by this meeting and its friends stand in the light of a defeated party at a state election they can have nothin to do with the government i move therefore that those who are opposed to presbytery go into caucus in order to appoint a committee to recommend to the majority a denomination which will be acceptable to the people of ravensnest i hope the motion will be put without debate the subject is a religious one and it is unwise to awaken strife on anything at all connected with religion  alas alas how much injury has been done to the cause of christianity how much wrong to the laws of god and even to good morals by appeals of this nature that are intended to smother inquiry and force down on the timid the schemes of the designing and fraudulent integrity is ever simple and frank while the devil resorts to these plans of plausible forbearance and seeming concessions in order to veil his nefarious devices  the thing took however for popular bodies once under control are as easily managed as the vessel that obeys her helm the strength of the current always giving additional power to that material portion of the ship the motion was accordingly seconded and put as there was no debate which had been made to appear antireligious the result was precisely the same as on the last question in other words there was one majority for disfranchising just onehalf the meeting counting the above man and this too on the principle that the majority ought to rule after this the caucus people went into the schoolhouse where it was understood a committee of twentysix was appointed to recommend a denomination to the majority this committee so respectable in its character and of so much influence by its numbers was not slow in acting as became its moral weight it unanimously reported that the congregational polity was the one most acceptable to the people of ravensnest this report was accepted by acclamation and the caucus adjourned sine die  the moderator now called the whole meeting to order again  mr moderator said the confidant it is time that this community should come to some conclusion in the premises it has been agitated long enough in its religious feelings and further delay might lead to unpleasant and lasting divisions i therefore move that it is the sense of this meetin that the people of ravensnest ardently wish to see the new meetinus which is about to be raised devoted and set apart for the services of the congregational church and that a congregational church be organized and a congregational pastor duly called i trust this question like all the others will be passed in perfect harmony and without debate as becomes the solemn business we are on  the question was taken and the old majority of one was found to be in its favor just as mr moderator meekly announced the result his messenger appeared in the crowd bawling out squire miss newcome says she cant noway find the volum which she kind o thinks youve lent  bless me so i have exclaimed the surprised magistrate its not in the settlement i declare but its of no importance now as a majority has fairly decided fellowcitizens we have been dealing with the most important interest that consarns man his religious state government and wellbeing unanimity is very desirable on such a question and as it is to be presumed no one will oppose the poplar will i shall now put the question to vote for the purpose of obtaining that unanimity those who are in favor of the congregationals or who ardently wish that denomination will hold up their hands  about threefourths of the hands went up at once cries of unanimityunanimityfollowed until one hand after another went up and i counted seventythree the remaining voters continued recusant but as no question was taken on the other side the vote may be said to have been a very decided one if not positively unanimous the moderator and two or three of his friends made short speeches commending the liberality of a part of the citizens and congratulating all when the meeting was adjourned  such were the facts attending the establishment of the congregational church in the settlement of ravensnest on purely republican principles the question having been carried unanimously in favor of that denomination although fiftytwo votes out of seventyeight were pretty evidently opposed to it but republican principles were properly maintained and the matter was settled the people having solemnly decided that they ardently wished for a church that in truth they did not desire at all  no complaints were made on the spot at least the crowd dispersed and as mr newcome walked through it with the air of a beaten rather than of a successful man i came under his observation for the first time he examined me keenly and i saw a certain air of doubt and misgiving in his manner just at that moment however and before he had time to put a question jaap drove up in the wagon and the negro was an old acquaintance having often been at the nest and knowing the squire for more than a quarter of a century this explained the whole affair a certain mixed resemblance to both father and mother which i am said to bear probably aiding in making the truth more apparent  mr newcome was startledthat was apparent in his countenancebut he was nevertheless selfpossessed approaching he saluted me and at once let me know he understood who i was  this is major littlepage i spose he said i can see a good deal of the ginral in you as i knowd your father when a young man and something of herman mordaunt your mothers father how long is it sin your arrival major littlepage  but a few minutes i answered evasively you see my wagon and servant there and we are fresh from albany my arrival has been opportune as all my tenants must be collected here at this moment  why yes siryes here are pretty much the whull of them we have had a little meetin today to decide on the natur of our religion as one might say i spose the major didnt get here until matters were coming to a head  you are quite right mr newcome matters were coming to a head as you say before i got on the ground  the squire was a good deal relieved at this for his conscience doubtless pricked him a little on the subject of the allusion he had made to me and my own denomination as for myself i was not sorry to have got so early behind the curtain as to the character of my agent it was pretty clear he was playing his own game as to some things and it might be necessary for me to see that this propensity did not extend itself into other concerns it is true my mind was made up to change him but there were long and intricate accounts to settle  yes sir religion is an interest of the greatest importance to mans welfare and it has ben anglice been too long neglected among us continued the late moderator you see yonder the frame of a meetinus the first that was ever commenced in this settlement and it is our intention to put it up this aternoon the bents are all ready the pikepoles are placed and all is waiting for the word to heave youll perceive squire it was judicious to go to a sartain pint afore we concluded on the denomination up to that pint every man would natrally work as if he was workin for his own order and weve seen the benefit of such policy as there you can see the clapboards planed the sash made and glazed stuff cut for pews and everything ready to put together the very nails and paints are bought and paid for in a word nothing remains to be done but to put together and finish off and preach  why did you not erect the edifice and finish off as you call it before you came to the testvote that i perceive you have just taken  that would have been goin a leeetle too far majora very leeetle if you give a man too tight a hold he doesnt like to let go sometimes we talked the matter over among us and concluded to put the question before we went any further all has turned out happily and we have unanimously resolved to be congregational unanimity in religion is a blessed thing  do you apprehend no falling off in zeal in consequence of this work no refusing to help pay the carpenters and painters and priest  no mucha little perhaps but no great matter i should judge your own liberal example major has had its influence and i make no doubt will produce an effect  my example sir i do not understand you mr newcome never having heard of the church until i heard your own allusions to it as chairman of this very meeting  squire newcome hemmed cleared his throat took an extrasized chew of tobacco and then felt himself equal to attempting an answer  i call it your example sir though the authority for what i have done came from your honored father general littlepage as long ago as before the revolution wartimes you know major is no time for buildin meetinuses so we concluded to defer the matter until peace peace we have and our own eends are fast approaching and i thought if the work was ever to be done so that this generation should get the benefit of it it should be done now i was in hopes we should have had preachin in the house afore your arrival and surprised you with the cheerin sight of a worshipping people on your lands here is your fathers letter from which i read a paragraph to the people half an hour sin  i trust the people have always been worshippers though it may not have been in a house built expressly for the purpose with your permission i will read the letter  this document bore the date of 1770 or fourteen years before the time the building was erected and five years before the battle of lexington was fought i was a little surprised at this but read on among other things i found that my father had given a general consent to credit his tenants with five hundred dollars to aid in the erection of a place of worship reserving to himself as my guardian a voice in the choice of the denomination i may add here that on examining the leases i found credits had been given in 1770 for the full amount and that the money or what passed for money the proceeds of work produce cattle butter cheese c had been in mr newcomes hands the whole of the intervening time no doubt to his great advantage thus by a tardy appropriation of my fathers bounty the agent was pretty certain of being able to finish the job in hand even admitting that some of the people should prove restive under the recent decision  and the money thus appropriated has gone to its destination i asked on returning the letter  every copper has thus gone major or will soon go when the first congregational of ravensnest is up you can contemplate the house with the satisfaction of knowing that your own money has largely aided in the good work of its erection what a delightful sentiment that must awaken it must be a great blessin to landlords to be able to remember how much of their money goes for the good of their fellowmortals  in my case it certainly should as i understand my father and indeed have myself seen by the accounts rendered to me that not one dollar of rent has ever yet left the settlement to go into the pocket of the owner of the estatenay that the direct outlays of my grandfather were considerable in addition to the first cost of the patent  i do not deny it major i do not deny it it is quite probable but you will consider what the spirit of public improvement demands and you gentlemenproprietors natrally look forward to futur generations for your rewardyes sir to futur generations then will come the time when these leased lands will turn to account and you will enjy the fruits of your liberality  i bowed but made no answer by this time the wagon had reached the inn and jaap was getting out the trunk and other luggage a rumor had gone forth among the people that their landlord had arrived and some of the older tenants those who had known herman mordaunt as they all called my grandfather crowded around me in a frank hearty manner in which good feeling was blended with respect they desired to take my hand i shook hands with all who came and can truly say that i took no mans palm into my own that day without a sentiment that the relation of landlord and tenant was one that should induce kind and confidential feelings the ravensnest property was by no means necessary to my comfortable subsistence and i was really well enough disposed to look forward if not to future generations at least to a future day for the advantages that were to be reaped from it i asked the crowd in ordered a tub of punch made for in that day liquor was a necessary accompaniment of every welcome and endeavored to make myself acceptable to my new friends a throng of women of whom i have not yet spoken were also in attendance and i had to go through the ceremony of being introduced to many of the wives and daughters of ravensnest on the whole the meeting was friendly and my reception warm     chapter x      bear through sorrow wrong and ruth     in thy heart the dew of youth     on thy lips the smile of truthlongfellow   the ceremony of the introduction was not half through when there was a noisy summons to the pikepoles this called away the crowd in a body a raising in the country being an incident of too much interest to be overlooked i profited by the occasion to issue a few orders that related to my own comfort when i went myself to the scene of present toil and future congregationalism  everybody in america a few inveterate cockneys excepted have seen a raising most people have seen hundreds and as for myself i believe i should be safe in saying i had even at that day seen a thousand in this particular instance there were great felicitations among the yeomen because the frame had come together well i was congratulated on this score the hearty old rhode islander my brother major assuring me that he couldnt get the blade of his knife and its no great matter of a knife either into a single jint and what is more squireas the sturdy yeoman was a major himself though only in the militia that title would not have been honorable enough for his landlordand what is more squire they tell me not a piece was ever tried until we put the bents together this aternoon ourselves now down country i never seed sich a thing but up here the carpenters go by what they call the squarerule and quick work they make ont this speech contained the substance of one of the contrivances by which the new countries were endeavoring to catch up with the old as i learned on further inquiries  it may be well to describe the appearance of the place when i reached the site of the new meetinus the great body of the people had just taken their stands at the first bent ready for a lift while trusty men stood at the feet of the posts armed with crowbars broadaxes or such other suitable implements as offered in readiness to keep those essential uprights in their places for on the steadiness of these persons depended the limbs and lives of those who raised the bent as this structure was larger than common the danger was increased and the necessity of having men that could be relied on was obviously so much the greater of one post in particular for some reason that i do not know all the trusty men seemed shy each declaring that he thought some one else better suited to take charge of it than he was himself the bossthat manhattanese word having travelled up to ravensnestcalled out for some one to take the delicate station as nothing detained the work but the want of a hand there and one looked at another to see who would step forward when a sudden cry arose of the chainbearerthe chainbearer heres your man  sure enough there came old andries coejemans hale upright vigorous and firmtreading though he had actually seen his threescore years and ten my ancient comrade had thrown aside nearly every trace of his late military profession though the marchings and drillings of eight years were not to be worked out of a mans air and manner in a twelvemonth the only sign of the soldier other than in his bearing i could trace about my brother captain was the manner in which his queue was clubbed andries wore his own hair this his early pursuits in the forest rendered necessary but it had long been clubbed in a sort of military fashion and to that fashion he now adhered in other respects he had transformed himself entirely into a woodsman he wore a huntingshirt like myself leggings moccasons and a cap of skins that had been deprived of their furs so far from lessening in any degree the fine effect of his green old age however this attire served to increase it andries coejemans stood six feet at seventy was still as erect as he had been at twenty and so far from betraying the inroads of age on his frame the last appeared to be indurated and developed by what it had borne his head was as white as snow while his face had the ruddy weatherbeaten color of health and exposure the face had always been handsome having a very unusual expression of candor and benevolence impressed on features that were bold and manly  the chainbearer could not have seen me until he stepped upon the frame then indeed there was no mistaking the expression of his countenance which denoted pleasure and friendly interest striding over the timber with the step of a man long accustomed to tread among dangers of all sorts he grasped my hand and gave it such a squeeze as denoted the good condition of his own muscles and sinews i saw a tear twinkling in his eye for had i been his own son i do not think he could have loved me more  mortaunt my poy youre heartily welcome said my old comrade you haf come upon tese people i fancy as te cat steals upon te mice but i had titings of your march and have peen a few miles town te roat to meet you how or where you got past me is more tan i know for i haf seen nuttin of you or of your wagon  yet here we both are my excellent old friend and most happy am i to meet you again if you will go with me to the tavern we can talk more at our ease  enough enough for te present young comrate pusiness is standing still a little for te want of my hant step off the frame lat and let us get up tese pents when i am your man for a week or a year  exchanging looks and renewing the warm and friendly pressure of the hand we parted for the moment i quitting the frame while the chainbearer went at once to the foot of the important post or to that station no one else would assume then commenced without further delay the serious toil of raising a bent this work is seldom entirely free from hazard and on this particular occasion when the force in men was a little disproportioned to the weight of the timber it was doubly incumbent on every man to be true and steady my attention was at once attracted to the business in hand and for several minutes i thought of little else the females had drawn as near the spot where their husbands brothers and lovers were exerting every muscle and nerve as comported with prudence and a profound and anxious quiet pervaded the whole of a crowd that was gay with rustic finery if not very remarkable for taste or refinement still the cluster of females had little in it that was coarse or even unfeminine if it had not much that would be so apt to meet the eye in the way of the attractive in a similar crowd of the present day the improvement in the appearance and dress of the wives and daughters of husbandmen has been very marked among us within the last fiveandtwenty years fully onehalf of those collected on this occasion were in short gowns as they were called a garb that has almost entirely disappeared and the pillions that were to be seen on the bodies of nearly all the horses that were fastened to the adjacent fences showed the manner in which they had reached the ground the calicoes of that day were both dear and homely and it required money to enable a woman to appear in a dress that would be thought attractive to the least practised eye nevertheless there were many pretty girls in that row of anxious faces with black eyes and blue light black and brown hair and of the various forms and hues in which female beauty appears in the youthful  i flatter myself that i was as comely as the generality of young men of my age and class and that on ordinary occasions i could not have shown myself before that cluster of girls without drawing to myself some of their glances such was not the case however when i left the frame which now attracted all eyes on that and on those who surrounded it every eye and every anxious face was turned my own included it was a moment of deep interest to all and most so to those who could only feel and not act  at the word the men made a simultaneous effort and they raised the upper part of the bent from the timber on which it lay it was easy to see that the laborers stout and willing as they were had as much as they could lift boys stood ready however with short pieces of scantling to place upright beneath the bent and the men had time to breathe i felt a little ashamed of having nothing to do at such a moment but fearful of doing harm instead of good i kept aloof and remained a mere spectator  now men said the boss who had taken his stand where he could overlook the work we will make ready for another lift all at once makes light workare you readyheave  heave or lift the stout fellows did and with so much intelligence and readiness that the massive timber was carried up as high as their heads there it stopped supported as before by short pieces of scantling  the pikepoles next came in play this is always the heaviest moment of a lift of that sort and the men made their dispositions accordingly short poles were first got under the bent by thrusting the unarmed ends into the cavity of the foundation and a few of the stoutest of the men stood on blocks prepared to apply their strength directly  are you ready men called out the boss this is our heaviest bent and we come to it fresh look out well to the foot of each postchainbearer i count on youyour post is the kingpost of the whole frame if that goes all goes make ready men heave altogetherthats a lift heave again menheavealtogether nowheeave up she goes heeavemore pikepolesstand to the frame boysget along some studsheeavein with your propsso catch a little breath men  it was time to take breath of a certainty for the effort had been tremendously severe the bent had risen however and now stood supported as before by props at an angle of some fifteen degrees with the plane of the building which carried all but the posts beyond the reach of hands the pikepole was to do the rest and the next ten degrees to be overcome would probably cause the greatest expenditure of force as yet all had gone well the only drawback being the certainty which had been obtained that the strength present was hardly sufficient to get up so heavy a bent nevertheless there was no remedy every person on the ground who could be of use but myself having his station a welllooking semigenteel young man whose dress was twothirds forest and onethird town had come from behind the row of females stepped upon the frame and taken his post at a pikepole the uninitiated reader will understand that those who raise a building necessarily stand directly under the timber they are lifting and that a downfall would bring them beneath a fearful trap bents do sometimes come down on the laborers and the result is almost certain destruction to those who are caught beneath the timber notwithstanding the danger and the difficulty in the present case goodhumor prevailed and a few jokes were let off at the expense of the congregationalists and the late moderator  agree squire called out the hearty old rhode islander to let in some of the other denominations occasionally and see how the bent will go up presbytery is holding back desperately  i hope no one supposes answered mr moderator that religious liberty doesnt exist in this settlement sartainlysartainlyother denominations can always use this house when it isnt wanted by the right owners  those words right owners were unfortunate the stronger the right the less the losing party liking to hear of it notwithstanding there was no disposition to skulk or to abandon the work and two or three of the dissentients took their revenge on the spot by hits at the moderator fearful that there might be too much talk the boss now renewed his call for attention to the work  let us all go together men he added weve got to the pinch and must stand to the work like wellbroke cattle if every man at the frame will do his best for just one minute the hardest will be over you see that upright stud there with that boy tim trimmer at it just raise the bent so that timmy can get the eend of that stud under it and all will be safe look to the lower eend of the stud tim is it firm and well stopped  tim declared it was but two or three of the men went and examined it and after making a few alterations they too assured the boss it could not get away a short speech was then made in which every man was exhorted to do his best and everybody in particular was reminded of the necessity of standing to his work after that speech the men raised the pikepoles and placed themselves at their stations silent expectation succeeded  as yet not a sign look or word had intimated either wish or expectation that i was to place myself in the ranks i will confess to an impulse to that effect for who can look on and see their fellowcreatures straining every muscle and not submit to human sympathy but the recollection of military rank and private position had not only their claims but their feelings i did go a step or two nearer to the frame but i did not put my foot on it  get ready mencalled the boss for a last time altogether at the wordnows your timeheeaveheeeaveheeeeave  the poor fellows did heave and it was only too evident that they were staggering under the enormous pressure of the massive timber i stepped on the frame at the very centre or at the most dangerous spot and applied all my strength to a pikepole  hurrah shouted the bossthere comes the young landlordheeave every man his bestheeeeave  we did heave our best and we raised the bent several feet above its former props but not near enough to reach the new ones by an inch or two twenty voices now called on every man to stand to his work for everybody felt the importance of even a boys strength the boss rushed forward like a man to our aid and then tim fancying his stud would stand without his support left it and flew to a pikepole at this mistake the stud fell a little on one side where it could be of no use my face was so placed that i saw this dangerous circumstance and i felt that the weight i upheld individually grew more like lead at each instant i knew by this time that our force was tottering under the downward pressure of the enormous bent  heeeave menfor your lives heeave exclaimed the boss like one in the agony  the tones of his voice sounded to me like those of despair had a single boy deserted us then and we had twenty of them on the frame the whole mass of timber must have come down upon us talk of charging into a battery what is there in that to try mens nerves like the situation in which we were placed the yielding of a muscle in all that straining lifting body might have ruined us a most fearful frightful twenty seconds followed and just as i had abandoned hope a young female darted out of the anxious palefaced crowd that was looking on in a terror and agony that may be better conceived than described and seizing the stud she placed it alongside of the post but an inch was wanted to gain its support but how to obtain that inch i now raised my voice and called on the fainting men to heave they obeyed and i saw that spirited trueeyed firmhanded girl place the prop precisely where it was wanted all that end of the bent felt the relief instantly and man after man cautiously withdrew from under the frame until none remained but those who upheld the other side we flew to the relief of those and soon had a number of props in their places when all drew back and looked on the danger from which they had escaped breathless and silent for myself i felt a deep sense of gratitude to god for the escape  this occurrence made a profound impression everybody was sensible of the risk that had been run and of the ruin that might have befallen the settlement i had caught a glimpse of the rare creature whose decision intelligence and presence of mind had done so much for us all and to me she seemed to be the loveliest being of her sex my eyes had ever lighted on her form in particular was perfection being just the medium between feminine delicacy and rude health or just so much of the last as could exist without a shade of coarseness and the little i saw of a countenance that was nearly concealed by a maze of curls that might well be termed golden appeared to me to correspond admirably with that form nor was there anything masculine or unseemly in the deed she had performed to subtract in any manner from the feminine character of her appearance it was decided useful and in one sense benevolent but a boy might have executed it so far as physical force was concerned the act required coolness intelligence and courage rather than any masculine power of body  it is possible that aware as i was of the jeopardy in which we were all placed my imagination may have heightened the effect of the fair apparition that had come to save us as it might be like a messenger from above but even there where i stood panting from the effect of exertions that i have never equalled in my own case most certainly exhausted nearly breathless and almost unable to stand my mindseye saw nothing but the flexible form the elastic ready step the golden tresses the cheek suffused by excitement the charming lips compressed with resolution and the whole air attitude and action characterized as was each and all by the devotion readiness and loveliness of her sex when my pulses beat more regularly and my heart ceased to throb i looked around in quest of that strange vision but saw no one who could in the least claim to be connected with it the females had huddled together like a covey that was frightened and were exclaiming holding up their hands and indulging in the signs of alarm that are customary with their sex and class the vision was certainly not in that group but had vanished as suddenly as it had appeared  at this juncture the chainbearer came forward and took the command i could see he was agitatedaffected might be a better wordbut he was nevertheless steady and authoritative he was obeyed too in a manner i was delighted to see the order of the boss had produced no such impressions as those which old andries now issued and i really felt an impulse to obey them myself as i would have done eighteen months before when he stood on the right of our regiment as its oldest captain  the carpenter yielded his command to the chainbearer without a murmur even squire newcome evidently felt that andries was one who in a certain way could influence the minds of the settlers more than he could do it himself in short everybody listened everybody seemed pleased and everybody obeyed nor did my old friend resort to any of the coaxing that is so common in america when men are to be controlled in the country in the towns and wherever men are to be commanded in bodies authority is as well understood as it is in any other quarter of the world but in the interior and especially among the people of new england habits very few men carry sufficient command with them to say john do this or john do that but it is johnny why wont you do this or johnny dont you think youd better do that the chainbearer had none of this mystified nonsense about him he called things by their right names and when he wanted a spade he did not ask for a hoe as a consequence he was obeyed command being just as indispensable to men on a thousand occasions as any other quality  everything was soon ready again with the men stationed a little differently from what they had previously been this change was the chainbearers who understood mechanics practically better perhaps than if he had been a firstrate mathematician the word was given to heave all of us being at the pikepoles when up went the bent as if borne upon by a force that was irresistible such was the effect of old andries habits of command which not only caused every man to lift with all his might but the whole to lift together a bent that is perpendicular is easily secured and then it was announced that the heaviest of the work was over the other bents were much lighter and one up there were means of aiding in raising the rest that were at first wanting  the congregationals has got the best ont cried out the old rhode islander laughing as soon as the bent was staylathed by the help of the chainbearer and somebody else i wunt name well our turn will come some day for ravensnest is a place in which the people wont be satisfied with one religion a country is badly ont that has but one religion int priests getting lazy and professors dull  you may be sure of tat answered the chainbearer who was evidently making preparations to quit the frame ravensnest will get as many religions in time as tere are discontented spirits in it and tey will need many raisings and more priests  do you intend to leave us chainbearer theres more posts to hold and more bents to lift  the worst is over and youve force enough witout me for what remains to be tone i haf te lantlort to take care of go to your work men and if you can rememper you haf a peing to worship in tis house tat is neiter congregational nor presbyterian nor anything else of the nature of your disputes and selfconceit squire newcome wilt gif you a leat in te way of larning and te carpenter can act boss well enough for te rest of te tay  i was surprised at the coolness with which my old friend delivered himself of sentiments that were not very likely to find favor in such a company and the deference that he received while thus ungraciously employed but i afterward ascertained andries commanded respect by means of his known integrity and his opinions carried weight because he was a man who usually said come boys and not one who issued his orders in the words go boys this had been his character in the army where in his own little circle he was known as one ever ready to lead in person then andries was a man of sterling truth and such a man when he has the moral courage to act up to his native impulses mingled with discretion enough to keep him within the boundaries of common prudence insensibly acquires great influence over those with whom he is brought in contact men never fail to respect such qualities however little they put them in practice in their own cases  come morty my poy said the chainbearer as soon as we were clear of the crowd i will pe your guite ant take you to a roof unter which you will pe master  you surely do not mean the nest  tat and no oter te olt place looks like us olt soltiers a little rusty and te worse for sarvice put it is comfortaple and i haf had it put in order for you poy your grantfaters furniture is still tere and frank malpone dus and i haf mate it headquarters since we haf peen in tis part of te country you know i haf your orters for tat  certainly and to use anything else that is mine but i had supposed you fairly hutted in the woods of mooseridge  tat hast peen tone too sometimes we are at one place and sometimes at anoter my niggers are at te hut put frank and dus and i haf come ofer to welcome you to te country  i have a wagoner here and my own blacklet me step to the inn and order them to get ready for us  mortaunt you and i haf peen uset to our feet the soltier marches and countermarches wit no wagon to carry him he leafs tem to te paggage and te paggageguart  come on old andries i will be your comrade on foot or on horseback it can only be some three or four miles and jaap can follow with the trunks at his leisure  a word spoken to the negro was all that was necessary though the meeting between him and the chainbearer was that of old friends jaap had gone through the whole war with the regiment sometimes acting as my fathers servant sometimes carrying a musket sometimes driving a team and at the close of his career as my particular attendant he consequently regarded himself as a sort of soldier and a very good one had he proved himself to be on a great many occasions  one word before we start chainbearer i said as old andries and jaap concluded their greetings i fell in with the indian you used to call sureflint in the woods and i wish to take him with us  he hast gone aheat to let your visit pe known answered my friend i saw him going up te roat at a quick trot half an hour since he is at te nest py tis time  no more remained to be said or done and we went our way leaving the people busily engaged in getting up the remainder of the frame i had occasion to observe that my arrival produced much less sensation in the settlement than it might have done had not the meetinghouse been my competitor in attracting attention one was just as much of a novelty as the other just as much of a stranger although born in a christian land and educated in christian dogmas very few of those who dwelt on the estate of ravensnest and who were under the age of fiveandtwenty had ever seen an edifice that was constructed for the purpose of christian worship at all such structures were rare indeed in the year 1784 and in the interior of new york albany had but two i believe the capital may have had a dozen and most of the larger villages possessed at least one but with the exception of the old counties and here and there one on the mohawk the new state could not boast of many of those silent fingers pointing to the sky rising among its trees so many monitors of a future world and of the great end of life as a matter of course all those who had never seen a church felt the liveliest desire to judge of the form and proportions of this and as the chainbearer and i passed the crowd of females i heard several goodlooking girls expressing their impatience to see something of the anticipated steeple while scarce a glance was bestowed on myself  well my old friend here we are together again marching on a public highway i remarked but with no intention of encamping in front of an enemy  i hope not returned andries dryly tough all is not golt tat glitters we have fought a hard battle major littlepage i hope it will turn out for a goot end  i was a little surprised at this remark but andries was never very sanguine in his anticipations of good like a true dutchman he particularly distrusted the immigration from the eastern states which i had heard him often say could bring no happy results  all will come round in the end chainbearer i answered and we shall get the benefits of our toil and dangers but how do you come on at the ridge and who is this surveyor of yours  tings do well enough at te ridge mortaunt for tere tere is not a soul yet to make trouple we have prought you a map of ten tousant acres laid off in huntret acre lots which i will venture to say haf peen as honestly and carefully measuret as any other ten tousant acres in te state we pegan next to tis property and you may pegin to lease on your faters lant just as soon as you please  and the frank malbone you have written about did the surveying  he worket up my measurements lat and closely tone tey are ill answer for it tis frank malbone is te broter of dustat is to say her halfbroter peing no nephew of mine dus you know is only a halfniece in bloot but she is a full dater in lofe as for frank he is a goot fellow and tough tis is his first jop at surfeying he may be dependet on wit as much confitence as any oter man going  no matter if a few mistakes are made andries land is not diamonds in this country there is plenty for us all and a great deal to spare it would be a different matter if there was a scarcity but as it is give good measure to the tenant or the purchaser a first survey can only produce a little loss or gain whereas surveys between old farms are full of trouble  ant lawsuitsput in the chainbearer nodding his head to tell you my mint mortaunt i would rater take a jop in a dutch settlement at halfprice tan run a line petween two yankees for twice the money among te dutch te owners light their pipes and smoke whilst you are at work but the yankees are the whole time trying to cut off a little here and to gain a little tere so tat it is as much as a mans conscience is wort to carry a chain fairly petween em  as i knew his prejudice on this subject formed the weak point in the chainbearer i gave the discourse a new turn by leading it to political events of which i knew him to be fond we walked on conversing on various topics connected with this theme for near an hour when i found myself rather suddenly quite near to my own particular house near by the building had more of shape and substance than it had seemed to possess when seen from the height and i found the orchards and meadows around it free from stumps and other eyesores and in good order still the place on its exterior had a sort of jail look there being no windows nor any other outlet than the door on reaching the latter which was a gate rather than an ordinary entrance we paused a moment to look about us while we stood there gazing at the fields a form glided through the opening and sureflint stood by my side he had hardly got there when there arose the strains of the same full rich female voice singing indian words to a civilized melody as i had heard issuing from the thicket of pines among the second growth of the forest from that moment i forgot my fields and orchards forgot the chainbearer and sureflint and could think of nothing but the extraordinary circumstance of a native girls possessing such a knowledge of our music the indian himself seemed entranced never moving until the song or verses were ended old andries smiled waited until the last strain was finished pronounced the word dus with emphasis and beckoned for me to follow him into the building     chapter xi       the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wood in      good time if the prince be too important tell him there is      measure for every thing and so dance out the      answerbeatrice   dus i repeated to myselfthis then is dus and no indian girl the chainbearers dus priscilla bayards dus and sureflints wren  andries must have overheard me in part for he stopped just within the court on which the gate opened and said  yes tat is dus my niece the girl is like a mockingpird and catches the songs of all languages and people she is goot at dutch and quite melts my heart mortaunt when she opens her throat to sing one of our melancholy dutch songs and she gives the english too as if she knowet no oter tongue  but that song was indianthe words at least were mohawk or oneida  onondagotere is little or no tifference yes youre right enough the worts are indian and they tell me te music is scotch come from where it will it goes straight to the heart poy  how came dushow came miss ursulathat is your niece to understand an indian dialect  didnt i tell you she is a perfect mockingbird and that she imitates all she hears yes dus would make as goot a surveyor as her broter after a weeks trial youve heart me say how much i livet among the tripes before te war and dus was ten wit me in that manner she has caught the language and what she has once larnet she nefer forget dus is half wilt from living so much in the woots and you must make allowances for her put she is a capital gal and te very prite of my heart  tell me one thing before we enter the housedoes any one else sing indian about herehas sureflint any women with him  not hete creatur hast noting to do wit squaws as for any one elses singing intian i can only tell you i never heart of such a person  but you told me you were down the road to meet me this morningwere you alone  not at allwe all went sureflint frank dus and i i tought it due to a lantlort mortaunt to gif him a hearty welcome tough dus did mutiny a little and sait tat lantlort or no lantlort it was not proper for a young gal to go forth to meet a young man i might have tought so too if it hadnt peen yourself my poy but with you i couldnt play stranger as one woult wit a straggling yankee i wishet to welcome you wit the whole family put ill not conceal duss unwillingness to be of te party  but dus was of your party it is very odd we did not meet  now you speak of it i do pelief it wast all owin to a scheme of tat cunnin gal you must know mortaunt ater we had got a pit down te roat she persuatet us to enter a ticket of pines in order to eat a moutful and i do pelief the cunnin hussy just did it tat you might slip past and she safe her female dignity  and from those pines sureflint came just after dus as you call her but miss ursula malbone as i ought to style her had been singing this very song  wast you near enough to know all tis poy and we miss you the gal dit sing tat ferry song yes i rememper it and a sweet goot song it is call her miss ursula malbone why shouldnt you call her dus as well as frank and i  for the simple reason that you are uncle and frank her brother while i am a total stranger  pohpohmorty tis is peing particlar i am only a halfuncle in the first place and frank is only a halfbroter and i dares to say you wilt pe her whole frient ten you are not a stranger to any of te family i can tell you lat for i have talket enough apout you to make bot te poy and te gal lofe you almost as much as i do myself  poor simplehearted upright old andries what an unpleasant feeling did he give me by letting me into the secret that i was about to meet persons who had been listening to his partial accounts for the last twelve months it is so difficult to equal expectations thus awakened and i will own that i had begun to be a little sensitive on the subject of this dus the song had been ringing in my ears from the moment i first heard it and now that it became associated with priscilla bayards ursula malbone the latter had really become a very formidable person to my imagination there was no retreating however had i wished it and a sign induced the chainbearer to proceed face the young woman i must and the sooner it was done the better  the nesthouse as my homely residence was termed had been a sort of fortress or garrison in its day having been built around three sides of a parallelogram with all its windows and doors opening on the court on the fourth side were the remains of pickets or palisades but they were mostly rotted away being useless as a fence from the circumstance that the buildings stood on the verge of a low cliff that of itself formed a complete barrier against the invasions of cattle and no insignificant defence against those of man  the interior of the nesthouse was far more inviting than its exterior the windows gave the court an appearance of life and gayety at once converting that which was otherwise a pile of logs thrown together in the form of a building into a habitable and inhabited dwelling one side of this court however was much neater and had much more the air of comfort than the other and toward the first andries led the way i was aware that my grandfather mordaunt had caused a few rooms in this building to be furnished for his own particular purposes and that no orders had ever been given to remove or to dispose of the articles thus provided i was not surprised therefore on entering the house to find myself in apartments which while they could not be called in any manner gayly or richly furnished were nevertheless quite respectably supplied with most of the articles that are thought necessary to a certain manner of living  we shall fint dus in here i dare say observed the chainbearer throwing open a door and signing for me to precede him go in and shake te gals hand mortaunt she knows you well enough name and natur as a poty may say  i did go in and found myself within a few feet of the fair goldenhaired girl of the raising she who had saved the frame from falling on us all by a decision of mind and readiness of exertion that partook equally of courage and dexterity she was in the same dress as when first seen by me though the difference in attitude and employment certainly gave her air and expression a very different character ursula malbone was now quietly occupied in hemming one of those coarse checked handkerchiefs that the poverty of her uncle compelled him or at least induced him to use and of which i had seen one in his hands only a minute before on my entrance she rose gravely but not discourteously answering my bow with a profound courtesy neither spoke though the salutes were exchanged as between persons who felt no necessity for an introduction in order to know each other  well now put in andries in his strongest dutch accent tis wilt never do ast petween two such olt frients come hiter dus gal and gif your hant to mortaunt littlepage who ist a sort of son of my own  dus obeyed and i had the pleasure of holding her soft velvetlike hand in mine for one moment i felt a gratification i cannot describe in finding the hand was so soft since the fact gave me the assurance that necessity had not yet reduced her to any of the toil that is unsuited to a gentlewoman i knew that andries had slaves his only possession indeed besides his compass chains and sword unless a few arms and some rude articles of the household were excepted and these slaves old and worn out as they must be by this time were probably the means of saving the niece from the performance of offices that were menial  although i got the hand of ursula malbone i could not catch her eye she did not avert her face neither did she affect coldness but she was not at her ease i could readily perceive that she would have been better pleased had her uncle permitted the salutations to be limited to the bows and courtesies as i had never seen this girl before and could not have done anything to offend her i ascribed the whole to mauvaise honte and the embarrassment that was natural enough to one who found herself placed in a situation so different from that in which she had so lately been i bowed on the hand possibly gave it a gentle pressure in order to reassure its owner and we separated  well now dus haf you a cup of tea for the lantlortto welcome him to his own house wit demanded andries perfectly satisfied with the seemingly amicable relations he had established between us te major hast hat a long march for peaceable times and woult be glat to git a little refreshment  you call me major chainbearer while you refuse to accept the same title for yourself  ay tere ist reason enough for tat you may lif to be a general wilt probably be one before youre tirty but i am an olt man now and shall never wear any oter uniform than this i have on again i pegan te worlt in this corps morty and shall end it in the rank in which i began  i thought you had been a surveyor originally and that you fell back on the chain because you had no taste for figures i think i have heard as much from yourself  yes tat is te fact figures and i didnt agree nor do i like em any petter at seventy tan i liket em at seventeen frank malbone now duss brother tere ist a lat that takes to em natrally and he works trough a sum ast your fater would carry a battalion trough a ravine carrying chain i like it gives sufficient occupation to te mind put honesty is the great quality for the chainbearer they say figures cant lie mortaunt but tis not true wit chains sometimes they do lie desperately  where is mr francis malbone i should be pleased to make his acquaintance  frank remainet pehint to help em up with their timber he is a stout chap like yourself and can lent a hant while poor fellow he has no lantlort tignity to maintain  i heard a gentle sigh from dus and involuntarily turned my head for she was occupied directly behind my chair as if ashamed of the weakness the spirited girl colored and for the first time in my life i heard her voice the two instances of the indian songs excepted i say heard her voice for it was an event to record a pleasant voice in either sex is a most pleasant gift from nature but the sweet tones of ursula malbone were all that the most fastidious ear could have desired being full rich melodious yet on the precise key that best satisfies the taste bringing with it assurances of a feminine disposition and regulated habits i detest a shrill highkeyed female voice more than that of a bawling man while one feels a contempt for those who mumble their words in order to appear to possess a refinement that the very act itself contradicts plain direct but regulated utterance is indispensable to a man or woman of the world anything else rendering him or her mean or affected  i was in hopes said dus that evildisposed frame was up and secured and that i should see frank in a minute or two i was surprised to see you working so stoutly for the presbyterians uncle chainbearer  i might return te compliment and say i wast surpriset to see you doing the same ting miss dus pesides the tenomination is congregational and not prespyterian and one is apout as much to your taste as te oter  the little i did was for you and frank andmr littlepage with all the rest who stood under the frame  i am sure miss ursula i now put in we all ought and i trust we all do feel truly grateful for your timely aid had that timber come down many of us must have been killed and more maimed  it was not a very feminine exploit answered the girl smiling as i thought a little bitterly but one gets accustomed to being useful in the woods  do you dislike living in the forest then i ventured to ask  certainly not i like living anywhere that keeps me near uncle chainbearer and frank they are all to me now my excellent protectress and adviser is no more and their home is my home their pleasure my pleasure their happiness mine  this might have been said in a way to render it suspicious and sentimental but it was not on the contrary it was impulsive and came from the heart i saw by the gratified look of andries that he understood his niece and was fully aware how much he might rely on the truthful character of the speaker as for the girl herself the moment she had given utterance to what she felt she shrunk back like one abashed at having laid bare feelings that ought to have been kept in the privacy of her own bosom unwilling to distress her i turned the conversation in a way to leave her to herself  mr newcome seems a skilful manager of the multitude i remarked he contrived very dexterously to give to the twentysix congregationalists he had with him the air of being a majority of the whole assembly while in truth they were barely a third of those present  let jason newcome alone for tat exclaimed andries he understants mankint he says and sartainly he hast a way of marching and countermarching just where he pleases wit tese people makin em tink te whole time tey are doing just what tey want to do it ist an art majorit ist an art  i should think it must be and one worth possessing if indeed it can be exercised with credit  ay teres the rub exerciset it is but as for te credit tat i will not answer for it sometimes makes me angry and sometimes it makes me laugh when i look on and see te manner in which jason makes te people rule temselves and how he wheels em apout and faces em and trows them into line and out of line at teir own wort of commant his excellency coult hartly do more wit us afer te baron8 had given us his drill  footnote 8 this allusion is evidently to a german officer who introduced the prussian drill into the american army baron steubenor stuyben as i think he must have been called in germanysteuben as he is universally termed in this countryeditor  there must be some talent necessary in order to possess so much influence over ones fellowcreatures  it is a talent you woult be ashamed to exercise mortaunt littlepage tough you hat it in cart loats no man can use such talent witout peginning wit lying and deceifing and you must be greatly changet major if you are the het of your class in such a school  i am sorry to see chainbearer that you have no better opinion of my agent i must look into the matter a little when this is the case  you wilt fint him lawhonest enough for he swears py te law and lifs py te law no fear for your tollars poy tey pe all safe unless inteet tey haf all vanishet in te law  as andries was getting more and more dutch i knew he was growing more and more warm and i thought it might be well to defer the necessary inquiries to a cooler moment this peculiarity i have often observed in most of those who speak english imperfectly or with the accent of some other tongue they fall back as respects language to that nearest to nature at those moments when natural feeling is asserting its power over them the least equivocally  i now began to question the chainbearer concerning the condition in which he found the nesthouse and farm over which i had given him full authority when he came to the place by a special letter to the agent the people in possession were of very humble pretensions and had been content to occupy the kitchen and servants rooms ever since my grandfathers death as indeed they had done long before that event it was owing to this moderation as well as to their perfect honesty that i found nothing embezzled and most of the articles in good condition as for the farm it had flourished on the let alone principle the orchards had grown as a matter of course and if the fields had not been improved by judicious culture neither had they been exhausted by covetous croppings in these particulars there was nothing of which to complain things might have been better andries thought but he also thought it was exceedingly fortunate they were no worse while we were conversing on this theme dus moved about the room silently but with collected activity having arranged the teatable with her own hands when invited to take our seats at iteverybody drew near to a teatable in that day unless when there was too large a party to be accommodatedi was surprised to find everything so perfectly neat and some things rich the plates knives etc were of good quality but the tray was actually garnished with a set of oldfashioned silver such as was made when tea was first used of small size but very highly chased the handle of the spoons represented the stem of the teaplant and there was a crest on each of them while a full coat of arms was engraved on the different vessels of the service which were four in all i looked at the crest in a vague but surprised expectation of finding my own it was entirely new to me taking the creamjug in my hand i could recall no arms resembling those that were engraved on it  i was surprised to find this plate here i observed for though my grandfather possessed a great deal of it for one of his means i did not think he had enough to be as prodigal of it as leaving it here would infer this is family plate too but those arms are neither mordaunt nor littlepage may i ask to whom they do belong  the malpones answered the chainbearer te tings are te property of dus  and you may add uncle chainbearer that they are all her propertyadded the girl quickly  i feel much honored in being permitted to use them miss ursula i remarked for a very pretty set they make  necessity and not vanity has brought them out today i broke the only teapot of yours there was in the house this morning and was in hopes frank would have brought up one from the store to supply its place before it would be wanted but he does not come as for spoons i can find none belonging to the house and we use these constantly as the teapot was indispensable i thought i might as well display all my wealth at once but this is the first time the things have been used in many many years  there was a plaintive melody in duss voice spite of her desire and effort to speak with unconcern that i found exceedingly touching while few of us enter into the exultation of successful vulgarity as it rejoices in its too often random prosperity it is in nature to sympathize with a downward progress and with the sentiments it leaves when it is connected with the fates of the innocent the virtuous and the educated that set of silver was all that remained to ursula malbone of a physical character and which marked the former condition of her family and doubtless she cherished it with no low feeling of morbid pride but as a melancholy monument of a condition to which all her opinions tastes and early habits constantly reminded her she properly belonged in this last point of view the sentiment was as respectable and as much entitled to reverence as in the other case it would have been unworthy and meriting contempt  there is a great deal of low misconception as well as a good deal of cant beginning to prevail among us on the subject of the qualities that mark a gentleman or a lady the day has gone by and i trust forever when the mere accidents of birth are to govern such a claim though the accidents of birth are very apt to supply the qualities that may really form the caste for my own part i believe in the exaggerations of neither of the two extremes that so stubbornly maintain their theories on this subject or that a gentleman may not be formed exclusively by birth on the one hand and that the severe morality of the bible on the other is by no means indispensable to the character a man may be a very perfect gentleman though by no means a perfect man or a christian and he may be a very good christian and very little of a gentleman it is true there is a connection in manners as a result between the christian and the gentleman but it is in the result and not in the motive that christianity has little necessary connection with the character of a gentleman may be seen in the fact that the dogmas of the first teach us to turn another cheek to him who smites while the promptings of the gentleman arenot to wipe out the indignity in the blood of the offender butto show that rather than submit to it he is ready to risk his own life9  footnote 9 mr mordaunt littlepage would seem to have got hold of the only plausible palliative for a custom that originated in those times when abuses could only be corrected by the strong arm and which in our own days is degenerating into the merest system of chicanery and trick the duellist who in his practice gets to be certain death to a shingle and then misses his man instead of illustrating his chivalry merely lets the world into the secret that his nerves are not equal to his drill there was something as respectable as anything can be in connection with a custom so silly in the conduct of the englishman who called out to his adversary a nearsighted man that if he wished to shoot at him he must turn his pistol in another directioneditor  but i repeat there is no necessary connection between the christian and the gentleman though the last who is the first attains the highest condition of humanity christians under the influence of their educations and habits often do things that the code of the gentleman rejects while it is certain that gentlemen constantly commit unequivocal sins the morality of the gentleman repudiates meannesses and low vices rather than it rigidly respects the laws of god while the morality of the christian is unavoidably raised or depressed by the influence of the received opinions of his social caste i am not maintaining that the ten commandments were not given for the obedience of people of quality for their obligations are universal but simply that the qualities of a gentleman are the best qualities of man unaided by god while the graces of the christian come directly from his mercy  nevertheless there is that in the true character of a gentleman that is very much to be respected in addition to the great indispensables of tastes manners and opinions based on intelligence and cultivation and all those liberal qualities that mark his caste he cannot and does not stoop to meannesses of any sort he is truthful out of selfrespect and not in obedience to the will of god free with his money because liberality is an essential feature of his habits and not in imitation of the selfsacrifice of christ superior to scandal and the vices of the busybody inasmuch as they are low and impair his pride of character rather than because he has been commanded not to bear false witness against his neighbor it is a great mistake to confound these two characters one of which is a mere human embellishment of the ways of a wicked world while the other draws near to the great end of human existence the last is a character i revere while i am willing to confess that i never meet with the first without feeling how vacant and repulsive society would become without it unless indeed the vacuum could be filled by the great substance of which after all the gentleman is but the shadow  ursula malbone lost nothing in my respect by betraying the emotion she did while thus speaking of this relic of old family plate i was glad to find however that she could retain it for though dressed in no degree in a style unbecoming her homely position as her uncles housekeeper there were a neatness and taste in her attire that are not often seen in remote parts of the country on this subject the reader will indulge my weaknesses a little if i pause to say a word ursula had neither preserved in her dress the style of one of her sex and condition in the world nor yet entirely adopted that common to girls of the class to which she now seemingly belonged it struck me that some of those former garments that were the simplest in fashion and the most appropriate in material had been especially arranged for present use and sweetly becoming were they to one of her style of countenance and perfection of form in that day as every one knows the different classes of societyand kingdom or republic classes do and ever will exist in this country as an incident of civilization a truth every one can see as respects those below though his vision may be less perfect as respects those above himbut every one knows that great distinctions in dress existed as between classes all over the christian world at the close of the american war that are fast disappearing or have altogether disappeared now ursula had preserved just enough of the peculiar attire of her own class to let one understand that she in truth belonged to it without rendering the distinction obtrusive indeed the very character of that which she did preserve sufficiently told the story of her origin since it was a subdued rather than an exaggerated imitation of that to which she had been accustomed as would have been the case with a mere copyist i can only add that the effect was to render her sufficiently charming  taste tese cakes said old andries who without the slightest design did love to exhibit the various merits of his niecedus mate tem and ill engage matam washington herself couldnt make pleasanter  if mrs washington was ever thus employed i answered she might turn pale with envy here better cakes of the sort i never ate  of the sort is well added mr littlepage the girl quietly observed my protectress and friend made me rather skilful in this way but the ingredients are not to be had here as they were in her family  which being a boardingschool for young ladies was doubtless better supplied than common with the materials and knowledge necessary for good cakes  dus laughed and it startled me so full of a wild but subdued melody did that laugh seem to be  young ladies have many foibles imputed to them of which they are altogether innocent was her answer cakes were almost forbidden fruit in the school and we were taught to make them in pity to the palates of the men  your future huspants gal cried the chainbearer rising to quit the room  our fathers brothers and uncles returned his niece laying an emphasis on the last word  i believe miss ursula i resumed as soon as andries had left us alone that i have been let behind the curtain as respects your late school having an acquaintance of a somewhat particular nature with one of your old schoolfellows  my companion did not answer but she fastened those fascinating blue eyes of hers on me in a way that asked a hundred questions in a moment i could not but see that they were suffused with tears allusions to her school often producing that effect  i mean miss priscilla bayard who would seem to be or to have been a very good friend of yours i added observing that my companion was not disposed to say anything  pris bayard ursula now suffered to escape her in her surpriseand she an acquaintance of a somewhat particular nature  my language has been incautious not to say that of a coxcomb certainly i am not authorized to say more than that our families are very intimate and that there are some particular reasons for that intimacy i beg you to read only as i have corrected the error  i do not see that the correction changes things much and you will let me say i am grieved sadly grieved to learn so much  this was odd that dus really meant what she said was plain enough by a face that had actually lost nearly all of its color and which expressed an emotion that was most extraordinary shall i own what a miserably conceited coxcomb i was for a single moment the truth must be said and i will confess it the thought that crossed my mind was this ursula malbone was pained at the idea that the only man whom she had seen for a year and who could by possibility make any impression on one of her education and tastes was betrothed to another under ordinary circumstances this precocious preference might have caused me to revolt at its exhibition but there was far too much of nature in all of duss emotions acts and language to produce any other impression on me than that of intense interest i have always dated the powerful hold that this girl so soon obtained on my heart to the tumult of feeling awakened in me at that singular moment love at first sight may be ridiculous but it is sometimes true that a passion may be aroused by a glance or a smile or any other of those secret means of conveying sympathy with which nature has supplied us i fully believe though its duration must depend on qualities of a higher and more permanent influence it is the imagination that is first excited the heart coming in for its share by later and less perceptible degrees  my delusion however did not last long whether ursula malbone was conscious of the misconstruction to which she was liable i cannot say but i rather think not as she was much too innocent to dread evil or whether she saw some other necessity for explaining herself remains a secret with me to this hour but explain she did how judiciously this was done and with how much of that female tact that taught her to conceal the secrets of her friend will appear to those who are sufficiently interested in the subject to pursue it     chapter xii      here come the lovers full of joy and mirth     joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love     accompany your heartsmidsummer nights dream   i ought not to leave you in any doubts as to my meaning mr littlepage resumed ursula after a short pause priscilla bayard is very dear to me and is well worthy of all your love and admiration  admiration if you please and as much as you please miss ursula but there is no such feeling as love as yet certainly between miss bayard and myself  the countenance of dus brightened sensibly truth herself she gave immediate credit to what i said and i could not but see that she was greatly relieved from some unaccountable apprehension still she smiled a little archly and perhaps a little sadly as she continued  as yet certainly is very equivocal on your side when a young woman like priscilla bayard is concerned it may at any moment be converted into now certainly with that certainty the other way  i will not deny it miss bayard is a charming creatureyet i do not know how it isthere seems to be a fate in these things the peculiar relation to which i alluded and alluded so awkwardly is nothing more than the engagement of my youngest sister to her brother there is no secret in that engagement so i shall not affect to conceal it  and it is just such an engagement as might lead to one between yourself and priscilla exclaimed dus certainly not without alarm  it might or it might not as the parties happen to view such things with certain temperaments it might prove an inducement while with others it would not  my interest in the subject continued dus proceeds altogether from the knowledge i have that another has sought miss bayard and i will own with my hearty good wishes for his success you struck me as a most formidable rival nor do you seem any the less so now i know that your families are to be connected  have no fears on my account for i am as heartwhole as the day i first saw the lady  a flash of intelligencea most meaning flash it wasgleamed on the handsome face of my companion and it was followed by a mournful though i still thought not an entirely dissatisfied smile  these are matters about which one had better not say much dus added after a pause my sex has its peculiar rights and no woman should disregard them you have been fortunate in finding all your tenants collected together mr littlepage in a way to let you see them at a single glance  i was fortunate in one sense and a most delightful introduction i had to the settlementsuch an introduction as i would travel another hundred miles to have repeated  are you then so fond of raisings or do you really love excitement to such a degree as to wish to get under a trap like one of the poor rabbits my uncle sometimes takes  i am not thinking of the raising or of the frame although your courage and presence of mind might well indelibly impress both on my minddus looked down and the color mounted to her templebut i was thinking of a certain song an indian song sung to scotch music that i heard a few miles from the clearings and which was my real introduction to the pleasant things one may both hear and see in this retired part of the world  which is not so retired after all that flattery cannot penetrate it i find it is pleasant to hear ones songs extolled even though they may be indian but it is not half so pleasant as to hear tidings of priscilla bayard if you wish truly to charm my ear talk of her  the attachment seems mutual for i can assure you miss bayard manifested just the same interest in you  in me priscilla then remembers a poor creature like me in her banishment from the world perhaps she remembers me so much the more because i am banished i hope she does not cannot think i regret my conditionthat i could hardly forgive her  i rather think she does not i know she gives you credit for more than common excellencies  it is strange that priscilla bayard should speak of me to you i have been a little unguarded myself mr littlepage and have said so much that i begin to feel the necessity of saying something more there is some excuse for my not feeling in your presence as in that of a stranger since uncle chainbearer has your name in his mouth at least one hundred times each day twelve different times in one hour did he speak of you yesterday  excellent old andries it is the pride of my life that so honest a man loves me and now for the explanation i am entitled to receive as his friend by your own acknowledgment  dus smiled a little saucily i thoughtbut saucily or not that smile made her look extremely lovely she reflected a moment like one who thinks intensely even bending her head under the painful mental effort then she drew her form to its usual attitude and spoke  it is always best to be frank she said and it can do no harm while it may do good to be explicit with you you will not forget mr littlepage that i believe myself to be conversing with my uncles very best friend  i am too proud of the distinction to forget it under any circumstances and least of all in your presence  well then i will be frank priscilla bayard was for eight years my associate and closest friend our affection for each other commenced when we were mere children and increased with time and knowledge about a year before the close of the war my brother frank who is now here as my uncles surveyor found opportunities to quit his regiment and to come to visit me quite frequentlyindeed his company was sent to albany where he could see me as often as he desired to see me was to see priscilla for we were inseparable and to see priscilla was for poor frank at least to love her he made me his confidant and my alarm was nothing but natural concern lest he might have a rival as formidable as you  a flood of light was let in upon me by this brief explanation though i could not but wonder at the simplicity or strength of character that induced so strange a confidence when i got to know dus better the whole became clear enough but at the moment i was a little surprised  be at ease on my account miss malbone  why not call me dus at once you will do it in a week like everyone else here and it is better to begin our acquaintance as i am sure it will end uncle chainbearer calls me dus frank calls me dus most of your settlers call me dus to my very face and even our blacks call me miss dus you cannot wish to be singular  i will gladly venture so far as to call you ursula but dus does not please me  no i have become so accustomed to be called dus by all my friends that it sounds distant to be called by any other name do you not think dus a pretty diminutive  i did not most certainly though all these things depend on the associations dus malbone sounded sweetly enough in priscilla bayards mouth but i fear it will not be so pleasant in mine  do as you pleasebut do not call me miss ursula or miss malbone it would have displeased me once not to have been so addressed by any man but it has an air of mockery now that i know myself to be only the companion and housekeeper of a poor chainbearer  and yet the owner of that silver the lady i see seated at this table in this room is not so very inappropriately addressed as miss ursula  you know the history of the silver and the table and room are your own nomr littlepage we are poorvery very pooruncle chainbearer frank and iall alike have nothing  this was not said despairingly but with a sincerity that i found exceedingly touching  frank at least should have something i answered you tell me he was in the army  he was a captain at the last but what did he receive for that we do not complain of the country any of us neither my uncle my brother nor myself for we know it is poor like ourselves and that its poverty even is like our own that of persons reduced i was long a charge on my friends and there have been debts to pay could i have known it such a thing should not have happened now i can only repay those who have discharged these obligations by coming into the wilderness with them it is a terrible thing for a woman to be in debt  but you have remained in this house you surely have not been in the hut at mooseridge  i have gone wherever uncle chainbearer has gone and shall go with him so long as we both live nothing shall ever separate us again his years demand this and gratitude is added to my love frank might possibly do better than work for the little he receives but he will not quit us the poor love each other intensely  but i have desired your uncle to use this house and for your sake i should think he would accept the offer  how could he and carry chain twenty miles distant we have been here occasionally a few days at a time but the work was to be done and it must be done on the land itself  of course you merely gave your friends the pleasure of your company and looked a little to their comforts on their return from a hard days work  dus raised her eyes to mine smiled then she looked sad her underlip quivering slightly after which a smile that was not altogether without humor succeeded i watched these signs of varying feeling with an interest i cannot describe for the play of virtuous and ingenuous emotion on a lovely female countenance is one of the rarest sights in nature  i can carry chain said the girl at the close of this exhibition of feeling  you can carry chain ursuladus or whatever i am to call you  call me dusi love that name best  you can carry chain i suppose is true enoughbut you do not mean that you have  the face of dus flushed but she looked me full in the eye as she nodded her head to express an affirmative and she smiled as sweetly as ever woman smiled  for amusementto say you have done itin jest  to help my uncle and brother who had not the means to hire a second man  good god miss malboneursuladus  the last is the most proper name for a chainbearess rejoined the girl smiling and actually taking my hand by an involuntary movement of her sympathy in the shock i so evidently felt but why should you look upon that little toil as so shocking when it is healthful and honest you are thinking of a sister reduced to what strikes you as mans proper work  dus relinquished my hand almost as soon as she had touched it and she did it with a slight start as if shocked at her own temerity  what is mans work and mans work only  yet woman can perform it and as uncle chainbearer will tell you perform it well i had no other concern the month i was at work than the fear that my strength would not enable me to do as much as my uncle and brother and thus lessen the service they could render you each day they kept me on the dry land so there were no wet feet and your woods are as clear of underbrush as an orchard there is no use in attempting to conceal the fact for it is known to many and would have reached your ears sooner or later then concealment is always painful to me and never more so than when i hear you and see you treating your hired servant as an equal  miss malbone for gods sake let me hear no more of thisold andries judged rightly of me in wishing to conceal this for i should never have allowed it to go on for a moment  and in what manner could you have prevented it major littlepage my uncle has taken the business of you at so much the day finding surveyor and laborerspoor dear frank he at least does not rank with the laborers and as for my uncle he has long had an honest pride in being the best chainbearer in the countrywhy need his niece scruple about sharing in his wellearned reputation  but you miss malbonedearest duswho have been so educated who are born a lady who are loved by priscilla bayard the sister of frank are not in your proper sphere while thus occupied  it is not so easy to say what is the proper sphere of a woman i admit it ought to be in general in the domestic circle and under the domestic roof but circumstances must control that we hear of wives who follow their husbands to the camp and we hear of nuns who come out of their convents to attend the sick and wounded in hospitals it does not strike me then as so bad in a girl who offers to aid her parent as i have aided mine when the alternative was to suffer by want  gracious providence and andries has kept me in ignorance of all this he knew my purse would have been his and how could you have been in want in the midst of the abundance that reigns in this settlement which is only fifteen or twenty miles from your hut as i know from the chainbearers letters  food is plenty i allow but we had no money and when the question was between beggary or exertion we merely chose the last my uncle did try old killian the black for a day but you know how hard it is to make one of those people understand anything that is a little intricate and then i offered my services i am intelligent enough i trustthe girl smiled a little proudly as she said thisand you can have no notion how active and strong i am for light work like this and on my feet until you put me to the proof remember carrying chain is neither chopping wood nor piling logs nor is it absolutely unfeminine  nor raising churchesi answered smiling for it was not easy to resist the contagion of the girls spiritat which business i have been an eyewitness of your dexterity however there will now be an end of this it is fortunately in my power to offer such a situation and such emoluments to mr malbone as will at once enable him to place his sister in this house as its mistress and under a roof that is at least respectable  bless you for that cried dus making a movement toward catching my hand again but checking it in time to render the deep blush that instantly suffused her face almost unnecessary bless you for that frank is willing to do anything that is honest and capable of doing anything that a gentleman should do i am the great encumbrance on the poor fellow for could he leave me many situations must be open to him in the towns but i cannot quit my uncle and frank will not quit me he does not understand uncle chainbearer  frank must be a noble fellow and i honor him for his attachment to such a sister this makes me only the more anxious to carry out my intentions  which are such i hope that there is no impropriety in his sisters knowing them  this was said with such an expression of interest in the sweet blue eyes and with so little of the air of common curiosity that it completely charmed me  certainly there is none i answered promptly enough even for a young man who was acting under the influence of so much ingenuous and strong native feeling and i shall have great pleasure in telling you we have long been dissatisfied with our agent on this estate and i had determined to offer it to your uncle the same difficulty would have to be overcome in this case as there was in making him a safe surveyorthe want of skill in figures now this difficulty will not exist in the instance of your brother and the whole family chainbearer as well as the rest will be benefited by giving the situation to frank  you call him frank cried dus laughing and evidently delighted with what she heard that is a good omen but if you raise me to the station of an agents sister i do not know but i shall insist on being called ursula at least if not miss ursula  i scarce knew what to make of this girl there was so much of gayety and even fun blended with a mine of as deep feeling as i ever saw throwing up its signs to the human countenance her brothers prospects had made her even gay though she still looked as if anxious to hear more  you may claim which you please for frank shall have his name put into the new power of attorney within the hour mr newcome has had a hint by letter of what is to come and professes great happiness in getting rid of a vast deal of unrequited trouble  i am afraid there is little emolument if he is glad to be rid of the office  i do not say he is glad i only say he professes to be so these are different things with certain persons as for the emolument it will not be much certainly though it will be enough to prevent franks sister from carrying chain and leave her to exercise her talents and industry in their proper sphere in the first place every lease on the estate is to be renewed and there being a hundred and the tenant bearing the expense it will at once put a considerable sum at your brothers disposition i cannot say that the annual commissions will amount to a very great deal though they will exceed a hundred a year by the terms on which the lands will be relet the use of this house and farm however i did intend to offer to your uncle and for the same reason i shall offer them to frank  with this house and farm we shall be rich exclaimed dus clasping her hands in delight i can gather a school of the better class of girls and no one will be uselessno one idle if i teach your tenants daughters some of the ideas of their sex and station mr littlepage you will reap the benefit in the end that will be some slight return for all your kindness  i wish all of your sex and of the proper age who are connected with me no better instructress teach them your own warmth of heart your own devotedness of feeling your own truth and your own frankness and i will come and dwell on my own estate as the spot nearest to paradise  dus looked a little alarmed i thought as if she feared she might have uttered too much or perhaps that i was uttering too much she rose thanked me hurriedly but in a very ladylike manner and set about removing the breakfast service with as much diligence as if she had been a mere menial  such was my very first conversation with ursula malbone her with whom i have since held so many and those that have been very different when i rose to seek the chainbearer it was with a feeling of interest in my late companion that was as strong as it was sudden i shall not deny that her beauty had its influenceit would be unnatural that it should notbut it was less her exceeding beauty and ursula malbone would have passed for one of the fairest of her sexbut it was less her beauty that attracted me than her directness truth and ingenuousness so closely blended as all were with the feelings and delicacy of her sex she had certainly done things which had i merely heard of them would have struck me unpleasantly as even bold and forward and which may now so strike the reader but this would be doing dus injustice no act no word of hers not even the taking of my hand seemed to me at the time as in the least forward the whole movement being so completely qualified by that intensity of feeling which caused her to think only of her brother nature and circumstances had combined to make her precisely the character she was and i will confess i did not wish her to be in a single particular different from what i found her  talk of pris bayard in comparison with ursula malbone both had beauty it is true though the last was far the handsomest both had delicacy and sentiment and virtue and all that pertains to a welleducated young woman if you will but dus had a character of her own and principles and an energy and a decision that made her the girl of ten thousand i do not think i could be said to be actually in love when i left that room for i do not wish to appear so very easy to receive impressions as all that would come to but i will own no female had ever before interested me a tenth part as much though i had known and possibly admired her a twelvemonth  in the court i found andries measuring his chains this he did periodically and it was as conscientiously as if he were weighing gold the old man manifested no consciousness of the length of the têteàtête i had held with his niece but on the contrary the first words he uttered were to an effect that proved he fancied i had been alone  i peg your parton lat he said holding his measuring rod in his mouth while he spoke i peg your parton put this is very necessary work i do not wish to haf any of your yankee settlers crying out hereafter against the chainpearers surveys let em come a huntret or a tousant years hence if tey will and measure te lant i want olt andries survey to stant  the variation of the compass will make some difference in the two surveys my good friend unless the surveyors

chainpearer  and a chainbearer she has been and a chainbearer she ever will be until she throws her chains on some poor fellow and binds him down for life andries you have an angel with you here and not a woman  most men in the situation of the chainbearer might have been alarmed at hearing such language coming from a young man and under all the circumstances of the case but andries coejemans never had any distrust of mortal who possessed his ordinary confidence and i question if he ever entertained a doubt about myself on any point the result of his own rather than of my character instead of manifesting uneasiness or displeasure he turned to me his whole countenance illuminated with the affection he felt for his niece and said  te gal ist an excellent girl mortaunt a capital creature

worlti do indeet  how strange all this sounded to me charged for work done by ursula malbone and charged at halfprice we are the creatures of convention and the slaves of opinions that come we know not whence i had got the notions of my caste obtained in the silent insinuating manner in which all our characters are formed and nothing short of absolute want could have induced me to accept pecuniary compensation from an individual for any personal service rendered i had no profession and it did not comport with our usages for a gentleman to receive money for personal service out of the line of a profession an arbitrary rule but one to which most of us submit with implicit obedience the idea that dus had been paid by myself for positive toil therefore was extremely repugnant to me and it was only after reflection that i came to view the whole affair as i ought and to pass to the credit of the nobleminded girl and this without any drawback an act that did her so much honor i wish to represent myself as no better or no wiser or more rational than i was and i fancy few young men of my age and habits would hear with much delight at first that the girl he himself felt impelled to love had been thus employed while on the other hand few would fail to arrive at the same conclusions on reflection as those i reached myself  the discourse with andries coejemans was interrupted by the sudden entrance of frank malbone into the court this was my first meeting with my young surveyor and the chainbearer introduced us to each other in his usual hearty and frank manner in a minute we were acquainted the old man inquiring as to the success of the settlers in getting up their meetinus  i staid until they had begun to place the rafters answered young malbone cheerfully and then i left them the festivities are to end with a ball i hear but i was too anxious to learn how my sister reached homei ought to say reached the nestto remain we have little other home now mr littlepage than the hut in the woods and the roof your hospitality offers  brother soldiers sir and brother soldiers in such a cause ought to have no more scruples about accepting such hospitalities as you call them than in offering them i am glad however that you have adverted to the subject inasmuch as it opens the way to a proposition i have intended to make which if accepted will make me your guest and which may as well be made now as a week later  both andries and frank look surprised but i led them to a bench on the open side of the court and invited them to be seated while i explained myself it may be well to say a word of that seat in passing it stood on the verge of a low cliff of rocks on the side of the court which had been defended by palisades when the french held the canadas and the remains of which were still to be seen here as i was told before we left the spot dus my pretty chainbearer with a womans instinct for the graceful and the beautiful had erected an arbor principally with her own hands planted one of the swiftgrowing vines of our climate and caused a seat to be placed within the spot commanded a pleasing view of a wide expanse of meadows and of a distant hillside that still lay in the virgin forest andries told me that his niece had passed much of her leisure time in that arbor since the growth of the plant with the advance of the season had brought the seat into the shade  placing myself between the chainbearer and malbone i communicated the intention i had formed of making the latter my agent as an inducement to accept the situation i offered the use of the nest house and the nest farm reserving to myself the room or two that had been my grandfathers and that only at the times of my annual visits to the property as the farm was large and of an excellent quality of land it would abundantly supply the wants of a family of modest habits and even admit of sales to produce the means of purchasing such articles of foreign growth as might be necessary in a word i laid before the listeners the whole of my plan which was a good deal enlarged by a secret wish to render ursula comfortable without saying anything about the motive  the reader is not to suppose i was exhibiting any extraordinary liberality in doing that which i have related it must not be forgotten that land was a drug in the state of new york in the year 1784 as it is today on the miami ohio mississippi and other inland streams the proprietors thought but little of their possessions as the means of present support but rather maintained their settlements than their settlements maintained them looking forward to another age and to their posterity for the rewards of all their trouble and investments10  footnote 10 the manor of rensselaerwick virtually extends fortyeight miles east and west and twentyfour north and south it is situated in the very heart of new york with three incorporated cities within its limits built in part on small older grants albany is a town of near if not of quite 40000 souls and troy must now contain near 28000 yet the late patroon in the last conversation he ever held with the writer only a few months before he died stated that his grandfather was the first proprietor who ever reaped any material advantage from the estate and his father the first who received any income of considerable amount the home property farms and mills furnished the income of the family for more than a centuryeditor  it is scarcely necessary to say my proposals were gladly accepted old andries squeezed my hand and i understood the pressure as fully as if he had spoken with the eloquence of patrick henry frank malbone was touched and all parties were perfectly satisfied the surveyor had his fieldinkstand with him as a matter of course and i had the power of attorney in my pocket ready for the insertion of the chainbearers name would he accept the office of agent that of malbone was written in its stead i signed andries witnessed and we left the seat together frank malbone in effect temporarily master of the house in which we were and his charming sister as a necessary consequence its mistress it was a delicious moment to me when i saw dus throw herself into her brothers arms and weep on his bosom as he communicated to her the joyful intelligence     chapter xiii       a comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it where lies      your texttwelfth night or what you will   a month glided swiftly by during that interval frank malbone was fully installed and andries consented to suspend operations with his chain until this necessary work was completed work it was for every lease granted by my grandfather having run out the tenants had remained on their farms by sufferance or as occupants at will holding from year to year under parole agreements made with mr newcome who had authority to go that far but no farther  it was seldom that a landlord in that day as i have already said got any income from his lands during the first few years of their occupation the great thing was to induce settlers to come for where there was so much competition sacrifices had to be made in order to effect this preliminary object in compliance with this policy my grandfather had let his wild lands for nominal rents in nearly every instance with here and there a farm of particular advantages excepted and in most cases the settler had enjoyed the use of the farm for several years for no rent at all he paid the taxes which were merely nominal and principally to support objects that were useful to the immediate neighborhood such as the construction of roads bridges pounds with other similar works and the administration of justice at the expiration of this period of nonpayment of rents a small sum per acre was agreed to be paid rather than actually paid not a dollar of which had ever left the settlement the landlord was expected to head all subscriptions for everything that was beneficial or which professed to be beneficial to the estate and the few hundreds a year two or three at most that my rentroll actually exhibited were consumed among the farms of the nest it was matter of record that not one shilling had the owner of this property as yet been able to carry away with him for his own private purposes it is true it had been in his power to glean a little each year for such a purpose but it was not considered politic and consequently it was not the practice of the country in regard to estates so situated and before the revolution though isolated cases to the contrary in which the landlord was particularly avaricious or particularly necessitous may have existed our new york proprietors in that day were seldom of the class that needed money extravagance had been little known to the province and could not yet be known to the state consequently few lost their property from their expenditures though some did from mismanagement the trade of puss in the corner or of shoving a man out of his property in order to place ones self in it was little practised previously to the revolution and the community always looked upon the intruder into family property with a cold eye unless he came into possession by fair purchase and for a sufficient price legal speculations were then nearly unknown and he who got rich was expected to do so by manly exertions openly exercised and not by the dark machinations of a sinister practice of the law  in our case not a shilling had we as yet been benefited by the property of ravensnest all that had ever been received and more too had been expended on the spot but a time had now arrived when it was just and reasonable that the farms should make some returns for all our care and outlays  eleven thousand acres were under lease divided among somewhat less than a hundred tenants until the first day of the succeeding april these persons could hold their lands under the verbal contracts but after that day new leases became necessary it is not usual for the american landlord to be exacting it is out of his power indeed for the simple reason that land is so much more abundant than men but it is not the practice of the country a careless indulgence being usually the sin of the caste an indulgence that admits of an accumulation of arrears which when payday does arrive is apt to bring with it illblood and discontent it is an undeniable truth in morals that whatever may be the feeling at the time men are rarely grateful for a government that allows their vices to have a free exercise they invariably endeavor to throw a portion of the odium of their own misdeeds on the shoulders of those who should have controlled them it is the same with debts for however much we may beg for lenity at the time accumulations of interest wear a very hostile aspect when they present themselves in a sumtotal at a moment it is inconvenient to balance the account if those who have been thus placed would only remember that there is a last account that every man must be called on to settle arrearages and all the experience of their worldly affairs might suggest a lesson that would be infinitely useful it is fortunate for us without exception that there is a mediator to aid us in the task  the time had come when ravensnest might be expected to produce something guided by the surveys and our own local knowledge and greatly aided by the chainbearers experience frank malbone and i passed one entire fortnight in classifying the farms putting the lowest into the shilling category others into the eighteen pence and a dozen farms or so into the two shillings the result was that we placed six thousand acres at a shilling a year rent three thousand eight hundred at eighteen pence the acre and twelve hundred acres at two shillings the whole made a rental of fourteen thousand one hundred shillings or a fraction more than seventeen hundred and fortytwo dollars per annum this sounded pretty well for the year 1784 and it was exclusively of the nest farm of jason newcomes mills and timberland which he had hitherto enjoyed for nothing or for a mere nominal rent and all the wild lands  i will confess i exulted greatly in the result of our calculations previously to that day i placed no dependence on ravensnest for income finding my support in the other property i had inherited from my grandfather on paper my income was more than doubled for i received then only some eleven hundred a year i speak of dollars not pounds from my other property it is true the last included a great many townlots that were totally unproductive but which promised to be very valuable like ravensnest itself at some future day most things in america looked to the future then as now though i trust the hour of fruition is eventually to arrive my town property has long since become very valuable and tolerably productive  as soon as our scheme for reletting was matured frank summoned the occupants of the farms in bodies of ten to present themselves at the nest in order to take their new leases we had ridden round the estate and conversed with the tenantry and had let my intentions be known previously so that little remained to be discussed the farms were all relet for three lives and on my own plan no one objecting to the rent which it was admitted all round was not only reasonable but low circumstances were then too recent to admit of the pasts being forgotten and the day when the last lease was signed was one of general satisfaction i did think of giving a landlords dinner and of collecting the whole settlement in a body for the purpose of jovial and friendly communion but old andries threw cold water on the project  tat would do mortaunt he said if you hat only raal new yorkers or middle states men to teal wit but more tan half of tese people are from te eastern states where tere are no such tings as lantlorts and tenants on a large scale you unterstant and tere isnt a man among em all tat isnt looking forwart to own his farm one tay by hook or by crook teyre as jealous of teir tignities as if each man wast a full colonel and will not tank you for a tinner at which tey will seem to play secont fittle  although i knew the chainbearer had his ancient dutch prejudices against our eastern brethren i also knew that there was a good deal of truth in what he said frank malbone who was rhode island born had the same notions i found on inquiry and i was disposed to defer to his opinions frank malbone was a gentleman himself and men of that class are always superior to low jealousies but frank must know better how to appreciate the feelings of those among whom he had been bred and born than i could possibly know how to do it myself the project of the dinner was accordingly abandoned  it remained to make a new arrangement and a final settlement with mr jason newcome who was much the most thriving man at ravensnest appearing to engross in his single person all the business of the settlement he was magistrate supervisor deacon according to the congregational plan or whatever he is called miller storekeeper willdrawer tavernkeeper by deputy and advisergeneral for the entire region everything seemed to pass through his hands or it would be better to say everything entered them though little indeed came out again this man was one of those moneyed gluttons on a small scale who live solely to accumulate in my view the most odious character on earth the accumulations having none of the legitimate objects of proper industry and enterprise in view so long as there was a man near him whom he supposed to be richer than himself mr newcome would have been unhappy though he did not know what to do with the property he had already acquired one does not know whether to detest or to pity such characters the most since while they are and must be repugnant to every man of right feelings and generous mind they carry in their own bosoms the worm that never dies to devour their own vitals  mr newcome had taken his removal from the agency in seeming good part affecting a wish to give it up from the moment he had reason to think it was to be taken from him on this score therefore all was amicable not a complaint being made on his side on the contrary he met frank malbone with the most seeming cordiality and we proceeded to business with as much apparent goodwill as had been manifested in any of the previous bargains mr newcome did nothing directly a circuitous path being the one he had been accustomed to travel from childhood  you took the milllot and the use of five hundred acres of woodland from my grandfather for three lives or failing these for a full term of oneandtwenty years i find mr newcome i remarked as soon as we were seated at business and for a nominal rent the mills to be kept in repair and to revert to the landlord at the termination of the lease  yes major littlepage that was the bargain i will allow though a hard one has it proved to me the war come onthis man was what was called liberally educated but he habitually used bad grammarthe war come on and with it hard times and i didnt know but the major would be willing to consider the circumstances if we make a new bargain  the war cannot have had much effect to your prejudice as grain of all sorts bore a high price and i should think the fact that large armies were near by to consume everything you had to sell and that at high prices more than compensated for any disadvantage it might have induced you had the benefits of two wars mr newcome that of 1775 and a part of that of 1756  my tenant made no answer to this finding i had reflected on the subject and was prepared to answer him after a pause he turned to more positive things  i suppose the major goes on the principle of supposing a legal right in an old tenant to enjy a new lease im told he has admitted this much in all his dealins  then you have been misinformed sir i am not weak enough to admit a right that the lease itself which in the nature of things must and does form the tenants only title contradicts in terms your legal interest in the property ceases altogether in a few days from this time  yaasyaassir i conclude it doose said the squire leaning back in his chair until his body was at an angle of some sixty or seventy degrees with the floori conclude it doose accordin to the covenants but between man and man there ought to be suthin more bindin  i know of nothing more binding in a lease than its covenants mr newcome  waalhow that man would waaal when he wished to circumvent a fellowcreature and with what a jesuitical accent did he pronounce the word waaalthats accordin to folks idees a covenant may be hard and then in my judgment it ought to go for nothin im agin all hard covenants  harkee frient jason put in the chainbearer who was an old acquaintance of mr newcomes and appeared thoroughly to understand his characterharkee frient jason do you gift back unexpected profits ven it so happens tat more are mate on your own pargains tan were look for  its not of much use to convarse with you chainbearer on such subjects for well never think alike answered the squire leaning still farther back in his chair youre what i call a particular man in your notions and we should never agree  still there is good sense in the chainbearers question i added unless prepared to answer yes i do not see how you can apply your own principle with any justice but let this pass as it will why are covenants made if they are not to be regarded  waal now accordin to my notion a covenant in a lease is pretty much like a watercourse in a map not a thing to be particlar at all about but as watercourses look well on a map so covenants read well in a lease landlords like to have em and tenants ant particular  you can hardly be serious in either case i should hope mr newcome but are pleased to exercise your ingenuity on us for your own amusement there is nothing so particular in the covenants of your lease as to require any case of conscience to decide on its points  theres this in it major that you get the whull property back agin if you choose to claim it  claim it the whole property has been mine or my predecessors ever since it was granted to us by the crown all your rights come from your lease and when that terminates your rights terminate  not accordin to my judgment major not accordin to my judgment i built the mills at my own cost youll remember  i certainly know sir that you built the mills at what you call your own cost that is you availed yourself of a natural millseat used our timber and other materials and constructed the mills such as they are looking for your reward in their use for the term of a quarter of a century for a mere nominal renthaving sawlogs at command as you wanted them and otherwise enjoying privileges under one of the most liberal leases that was ever granted  yes sir but that was in the bargain i made with your grandther it was agreed between us at the time i took the place that i was to cut logs at will and of course use the materials on the ground for buildin you see major your grandther wanted the mills built desperately and so he gave them conditions accordinly youll find every syllable ont in the lease  no doubt mr newcome and you will also find a covenant in the same lease by which your interest in the property is to cease in a few days  waal now i dont understand leases in that way surely it was never intended a man should erect mills to lose all right in em at the end of fiveandtwenty years  that will depend on the bargain made at the time some persons erect mills and houses that have no rights in them at all they are paid for their work as they build  yes yescarpenters and millwrights you mean but im speakin of no such persons im speakin of honest hardworkin industrious folks that give their labor and time to build up a settlement and not of your mechanics who work for hire of course theyre to be paid for what they do and theres an eend ont  i am not aware that all honest persons are hardworking any more than that all hardworking persons are honest i wish to be understood that in the first place mr newcome phrases will procure no concession from me i agree with you however perfectly in saying that when a man is paid for his work there will be what you call an end of it now twentythree days from this moment you will have been paid for all you have done on my property according to your own agreement and by your own reasoning there must be an end of your connection with that property  the major doesnt mean to rob me of all my hard earnins  mr newcome rob is a hard word and one that i beg may not be again used between you and me i have no intention to rob you or to let you rob me the pretence that you are not and were not acquainted with the conditions of this lease comes rather late in the day after a possession of a quarter of a century you know very well that my grandfather would not sell and that he would do no more than lease if it were your wish to purchase why did you not go elsewhere and get land in fee there were and still are thousands of acres to be sold all around you i have lands to sell myself at mooseridge as the agent of my father and colonel follock within twenty miles of you and they tell me capital millseats in the bargain  yes major but not so much to my notion as thisi kind o wanted this  but i kind o want this too and as it is mine i think in common equity i have the best claim to enjoy it  its on equity i want to put this very matter majori know the law is agin methat is some people say it is but some think not now weve had a revolutionbut let the law go as it may theres such a thing as what i call right between man and man  certainly and law is an invention to enforce it it is right i should do exactly what my grandfather agreed to do for me fiveandtwenty years ago in relation to these mills and it is right you should do what you agreed to do for yourself  i have done so i agreed to build the mills in a sartain form and mode and i done it ill defy mortal man to say otherwise the sawmill was smashing away at the logs within two months ater i got the lease and we began to grind in four  no doubt sir you were active and industriousthough to be frank with you i will say that competent judges tell me neither mill is worth much now  thats on account of the leasecried mr newcome a little too hastily possibly for the credit of his discretionhow did i know when it would run out your granther granted it for three lives and twentyone years afterward and i did all a man could to make it last as long as i should myself but here i am in the prime of life and in danger of losing my property  i knew all the facts of the case perfectly and had intended to deal liberally with mr newcome from the first in his greediness for gain he had placed his lives on three infants although my grandfather had advised him to place at least one on himself but nomr newcome had fancied the life of an infant better than that of a man and in three or four years after the signature of the lease his twentyone years had begun to run and were now near expiring even under this certainly unlookedfor state of things the lease had been a very advantageous one for the tenant and had one of his lives lasted a century the landlord would have looked in vain for any concession on that account landlords never asking for or expecting favors of that sort indeed most landlords would be ashamed to receive them nevertheless i was disposed to consider the circumstances to overlook the fact that the mills and all the other buildings on the property were indifferently built and to relet for an additional term of twentyone years woodlands farms buildings and other privileges for about onethird of the money that mr newcome himself would have been apt to ask had he the letting instead of myself unwilling to prolong a discussion with a man who by his very nature was unequal to seeing more than one side of a subject i cut the matter short by telling him my terms without further delay  notwithstanding all his acting and false feeling the squire was so rejoiced to learn my moderation that he could not but openly express his feelings a thing he would not have done did he not possess the moral certainty i would not depart from my word i felt it necessary however to explain myself  before i give you this new lease mr newcome i added holding the instrument signed in my hand i wish to be understood it is not granted under the notion that you have any right to ask it beyond the allowance that is always made by a liberal landlord to a reasonably good tenant which is simply a preference over others on the same terms as for the early loss of your lives it was your own fault had the infants you named or had one of them passed the state of childhood it might have lived to be eighty in which case my timberland would have been stripped without any return to its true owner but your children died and the lease was brought within reasonable limits now the only inducement i have for offering the terms i do is the liberality that is usual with landlords what is conceded is conceded as no right but as an act of liberality  this was presenting to my tenant the most incomprehensible of all reasons for doing anything a close and sordid calculator himself he was not accustomed to give any man credit for generosity and from the doubting distrustful manner in which he received the paper i suspected at the moment that he was afraid there was some project for taking him in a rogue is always distrustful and as often betrays his character to honest men by that as by any other failing i was not to regulate my own conduct however by the weaknesses of jason newcome and the lease was granted  i could wish here to make one remark there ought certainly to be the same principle of good fellowship existing between the relations of landlord and tenant that exist in the other relations of life and which creates a moral tie between parties that have much connection in their ordinary interests and that to a degree to produce preferences and various privileges of a similar character this i am far from calling in question and on the whole i think of all that class of relations the one in question is to be set down as among the most binding and sacred still the mere moral rights of the tenant must depend on the rigid maintenance of all the rights of the landlord the legal and moral united and the man who calls in question either of the latter surely violates every claim to have his own pretensions allowed beyond those which the strict letter of the law will yield to him the landlord who will grant a new lease to the individual who is endeavoring to undermine his rights by either direct or indirect means commits the weakness of arming an enemy with the knife by which he is himself to be assaulted in addition to the error of granting power to a man who under the character of a spurious liberty is endeavoring to unsettle the only conditions on which civilized society can exist if landlords will exhibit the weakness they must blame themselves for the consequences  i got rid of mr newcome by the grant of the lease his whole manoeuvring having been attempted solely to lower the rent for he was much too shrewd to believe in the truth of his own doctrines on the subject of right and wrong that same day my axemen appeared at the nest having passed the intermediate time in looking at various tracts of land that were in the market and which they had not found so eligible in the way of situation quality or terms as those i offered by this time the surveyed lots of mooseridge were ready and i offered to sell them to these emigrants the price was only a dollar an acre with a credit of ten years the interest to be paid annually one would have thought that the lowness of the price would have induced men to prefer lands in fee to lands on lease but these persons to a man found it more to their interests to take farms on threelives leases being rentfree for the first five years and at nominal rents for the remainder of the term than to pay seven dollars a year of interest and a hundred dollars in money at the expiration of the credit11 this fact of itself goes to show how closely these men calculated their means and the effect their decisions might have on their interests nor were their decisions always wrong those who can remember the start the country took shortly after the peace of 83 the prices that the settlers on new lands obtained for their wheat ashes and pork three dollars a bushel often for the first three hundred dollars a ton for the second and eight or ten dollars a hundred for the last will at once understand that the occupant of new lands at that period obtained enormous wages for a laborer by means of the rich unexhausted lands he was thus permitted to occupy no doubt he would have been in a better situation had he owned his farm in fee at the end of his lease so would the merchant who builds a ship and clears her cost by her first freight have been a richer man had he cleared the cost of two ships instead of one but he has done well notwithstanding and it is not to be forgotten that the man who commences life with an axe and a little household furniture is in the situation of a mere daylaborer the addition to his means of the use of land is the very circumstance that enables him to rise above his humble position and to profit by the cultivation of the soil at the close of the last century and at the commencement of the present the country was so placed as to render every stroke of the axe directly profitable the very labor that was expended in clearing away the trees meeting with a return so liberal by the sale of the ashes manufactured as to induce even speculators to engage in the occupation it may one day be a subject of curious inquiry to ascertain how so much was done as is known to have been done at that period toward converting the wilderness into a garden and i will here record for the benefit of posterity a brief sketch of one of the processes of getting to be comfortable if not rich that was much used in that day  footnote 11 the fact here stated by mr littlepage should never be forgotten inasmuch as it colors the entire nature of the pretension now set up as to the exactions of leases no man in new york need ever have leased a farm for the want of an opportunity of purchasing there never having been a time when land for farms in fee has not been openly on sale within the bounds of the state and land every way as eligible as that leased in few cases have two adjoining estates been leased and where such has been the fact the husbandman might always have found a farm in fee at the cost of half a days travelling the benefits to the landlord have usually been so remote on the estate leased that by far the greater proportion of the proprietors have preferred selling at once to waiting for the tardy operations of timeeditor  it was a seasons work for a skilful axeman to chop log burn clear and sow ten acres of forest land the ashes he manufactured for the heavier portions of the work such as the logging he called on his neighbors for aid rendering similar assistance by way of payment one yoke of oxen frequently sufficed for two or three farms and loggingbees have given rise to a familiar expression among us that is known as legislative logrolling a process by which as is well known one set of members supports the project of another set on the principle of reciprocity  now ten acres of land cropped for the first time might very well yield a hundred and fifty bushels of merchantable wheat which would bring three hundred dollars in the albany market they would also make a ton of potashes which would sell for at least two hundred dollars this is giving five hundred dollars for a single years work allowing for all the drawbacks of buildings tools chains transportation provisions etc and onehalf of this money might very fairly be set down as clear profit very large returns to one who before he got his farm was in the situation of a mere daylaborer content to toil for eight or nine dollars the month  that such was the history in its outlines of the rise of thousands of the yeomen who now dwell in new york is undeniable and it goes to show that if the settler in a new country has to encounter toil and privations they are not always without their quick rewards in these later times men go on the open prairies and apply the plough to an ancient sward but i question if they would not rather encounter the virgin forests of 1790 with the prices of that day than run over the present parklike fields in order to raise wheat for 3712 cents per bushel have no ashes at any price and sell their pork at two dollars the hundred     chapter xiv      intent to blend her with his lot     fate formed her all that he was not     and as by mere unlikeness thought       associate we see     their hearts from very difference caught       a perfect sympathypinckney   all this time i saw ursula malbone daily and at all hours of the day inmates of the same dwelling we met constantly and many were the interviews and conversations which took place between us had dus been the most finished coquette in existence her practised ingenuity could not have devised more happy expedients to awaken interest in me than those which were really put in use by this singular girl without the slightest intention of bringing about any such result indeed it was the nature the total absence of art that formed one of the brightest attractions of her character and gave so keen a zest to her cleverness and beauty in that day females while busied in the affairs of their household appeared in short gown and petticoat as it was termed a species of livery that even ladies often assumed of a morning the toilette was of far wider range in 1784 than it is now the distinctions between morning and evening dress being much broader then than at present as soon as she was placed really at the head of her brothers house ursula malbone set about the duties of her new station quietly and without the slightest fuss but actively and with interest she seemed to me to possess in a high degree that particular merit of carrying on the details of her office in a silent unobtrusive manner while they were performed most effectually and entirely to the comfort of those for whose benefit her care was exercised i am not one of those domestic canters who fancy a woman in order to make a good wife needs be a drudge and possess the knowledge of a cook or a laundress but it is certainly of great importance that she have the faculty of presiding over her family with intelligence and an attention that is suited to her means of expenditure most of all it is important that she know how to govern without being seen or heard  the wife of an educated man should be an educated woman one fit to be his associate qualified to mingle her tastes with his own to exchange ideas and otherwise to be his companion in an intellectual sense these are the higher requisites a gentleman accepting the minor qualifications as so many extra advantages if kept within their proper limits but as positive disadvantages if they interfere with or in any manner mar the manners temper or mental improvement of the woman whom he has chosen as his wife and not as his domestic some sacrifices may be necessary in those cases in which cultivation exists without a sufficiency of means but even then it is seldom indeed that a woman of the proper qualities may not be prevented from sinking to the level of a menial as for the cant of the newspapers on such subjects it usually comes from those whose homes are mere places for board and lodging  the address with which dus discharged all the functions of her new station while she avoided those that were unseemly and out of place charmed me almost as much as her spirit character and beauty the negroes removed all necessity for her descending to absolute toil and with what pretty feminine dexterity did she perform the duties that properly belonged to her station always cheerful frequently singing not in a noisy milkmaid mood but at those moments when she might fancy herself unheard and in sweet plaintive songs that seemed to recall the scenes of other days always cheerful however is saying a little too much for occasionally dus was sad i found her in tears three or four times but did not dare inquire into their cause there was scarce time indeed for the instant i appeared she dried her eyes and received me with smiles  it is scarcely necessary to say that to me the time passed pleasantly and amazingly fast chainbearer remained at the nest by my orders for he would not yield to requests and i do not remember a more delightful month than that proved to be i made a very general acquaintance with my tenants and found many of them as straightforward honest hardworking yeomen as one could wish to meet my brother major in particular was a hearty old fellow and often came to see me living on the farm that adjoined my own he growled a little about the sect that had got possession of the meetinus but did it in a way to show there was not much gall in his own temperament  i dont rightly understand these majority matters said the old fellow one day that we were talking the matter over though i very well know newcome always manages to get one let the folks think as they will ive known the squire contrive to cut a majority out of about a fourth of all present and he does it in a way that is despret ingenous i will allow though im afeard its neither law nor gospel  he certainly managed in the affair of the denomination to make a plurality of one appear in the end to be a very handsome majority over all  ay theres twists and turns in these things thats beyond my larnin though i spose alls right it dont matter much in the long run ater all where a man worships provided he worships or who preaches so that he listens  i think this liberalityif that be the proper wordin religious matters is fast increasing among us though liberality may be but another term for indifference as for us episcopalians i wonder there are any left in the country though we are largely on the increase there we were a church that insisted on episcopal ministrationson confirmation in particularleft for a century without a bishop and unable to conform to practices that it was insisted on were essential and this solely because it did not suit the policy of the mother country to grant us prelates of our own or to send us occasionally even one of hers how miserable do human expedients often appear when they are tried by the tests of common sense a church of god insisting on certain spiritual essentials that it denies to a portion of its people in order to conciliate worldly interests it is not the church of england however nor the government of england that is justly obnoxious to such an accusation something equally bad and just as inconsistent attaching itself to the ecclesiastical influence of every other system in christendom under which the state is tied to religion by means of human provisions the mistake is in connecting the things of the world with the things that are of god  alas alas when you sever that pernicious tie is the matter much benefited how is it among ourselves are not sects and shades of sects springing up among us on every side until the struggle between parsons is getting to be not who shall aid in making most christians but who shall gather into his fold most sectarians as for the people themselves instead of regarding churches even after they have established them and that too very much on their own authority they first consider their own tastes enmities and predilections respecting the priest far more than the altar and set themselves up as a sort of religious constituencies who are to be represented directly in the government of christs followers on earth half of a parish will fly off in a passion to another denomination if they happen to fall into a minority truly a large portion of our people is beginning to act in this matter as if they had a sense of giving their support to the deity patronizing him in this temple or the other as may suit the feeling or the interest of the moment12  footnote 12 if mr littlepage wrote thus thirty or forty years since how would he have written today when we have had loud protestations flourishing around us in the public journals that this or that sectarian polity was most in unison with a republican form of government what renders this assumption as absurd as it is presuming is the wellknown fact that it comes from those who have ever been loudest in their declamations of a union between church and state  but i am not writing homilies and will return to the nest and my friends a day or two after mr newcome received his new lease chainbearer frank dus and i were in the little arbor that overlooked the meadows when we saw sureflint moving at an indians pace along a path that came out of the forest and which was known to lead toward mooseridge the onondago carried his rifle as usual and bore on his back a large bunch of something that we supposed to be game though the distance prevented our discerning its precise character in half a minute he disappeared behind a projection of the cliffs trotting toward the buildings  my friend the trackless has been absent from us now a longer time than usual ursula remarked as she turned her head from following the indians movements as long as he remained in sight but he reappears loaded with something for our benefit  he has passed most of his time of late with your uncle i believe i answered following duss fine eyes with my own the pleasantest pursuit i could discover in that remote quarter of the world i have written this to my father who will be glad to hear tidings of his old friend  he is much with my uncle as you say being greatly attached to him ah here he comes with such a load on his shoulders as an indian does not love to bear though even a chief will condescend to carry game  as dus ceased speaking sureflint threw a large bunch of pigeons some two or three dozen birds at her feet turning away quietly like one who had done his part of the work and who left the remainder to be managed by the squaws  thank you trackless said the pretty housekeeperthankee kindly those are beautiful birds and as fat as butter we shall have them cleaned and cooked in all manner of ways  all squabjust go to flytake him ebbery one in nest answered the indian  nests must be plenty then and i should like to visit them i cried remembering to have heard strange marvels of the multitudes of pigeons that were frequently found in their roosts as the encampments they made in the woods were often termed in the parlance of the country can we not go in a body and visit this roost  it might pe tone answered the chainbearer it might pe tone and it is time we wast moving in teir tirection if more lant is to pe surveyet ant tese pirts came from te hill i suppose

myself  as for the visit to the roost cried i that is settled for tomorrow but a man who has just come out of a war like the last into peaceable times has no occasion to speak of his end chainbearer

and it is high time frank and i hat gone into te woots agin  i heard this arrangement made though my eyes were following dus who had started from her seat and rushed into the house endeavoring to hide emotions that were not to be hushed a minute later i saw her at the window of her own room smiling though the cloud had not yet entirely dispersed  next morning early our whole party left the nest for the hut at mooseride and the pigeonroosts dus and the black female servant travelled on horseback there being no want of cattle at the nest where as i now learned my grandfather had left a quarter of a century before among a variety of other articles several sidesaddles the rest of us proceeded on foot though we had no less than three sumpter beasts to carry our food instruments clothes etc each man was armed almost as a matter of course in that day though i carried a doublebarrelled fowlingpiece instead of a rifle susquesus acted as our guide  we were quite an hour before we reached the limits of the settled farms on my own property after which we entered the virgin forest in consequence of the late war which had brought everything like the settlement of the country to a dead stand a new district had then little of the straggling suburblike clearings which are apt now to encircle the older portions of a region that is in the state of transition on the contrary the last wellfenced and reasonably wellcultivated farm passed we plunged into the boundless woods and took a complete leave of nearly every vestige of civilized life as one enters the fields on quitting a town in france there was a path it is true following the line of blazed trees but it was scarcely beaten and was almost as illegible as a bad hand still one accustomed to the forest had little difficulty in following it and susquesus would have had none in finding his way had there been no path at all as for the chainbearer he moved forward too with the utmost precision and confidence the habit of running straight lines amid trees having given his eye an accuracy that almost equalled the species of instinct that was manifested by the trackless himself on such subjects  this was a pleasant little journey the depths of the forest rendering the heats of the season as agreeable as was possible we were four hours in reaching the foot of the little mountain on which the birds had built their nests where we halted to take some refreshments  little time is lost at meals in the forest and we were soon ready to ascend the hill the horses were left with the blacks dus accompanying us on foot as we left the spring where we had halted i offered her an arm to aid in the ascent but she declined it apparently much amused that it should have been offered  what i a chainbearess she cried laughingi who have fairly wearied out frank and even made my uncle feel tired though he would never own iti accept an arm to help me up a hill you forget major littlepage that the first ten years of my life were passed in a forest and that a years practice has brought back all my old habits and made me a girl of the woods again  i scarce know what to make of you for you seem fitted for any situation in which you may happen to be thrown i answered profiting by the circumstance that we were out of the hearing of our companions who had all moved ahead to utter more than i otherwise might venture to sayat one time i fancy you the daughter of one of my own tenants at another the heiress of some ancient patroon  dus laughed again then she blushed and for the remainder of the short ascent she remained silent short the ascent was and we were soon on the summit of the hill so far from needing my assistance dus actually left me behind exerting herself in a way that brought her up at the side of the trackless who led our van whether this was done in order to prove how completely she was a forest girl or whether my words had aroused those feelings that are apt to render a female impulsive is more than i can say even now though i suspected at the time that the latter sensations had quite as much to do with this extraordinary activity as the former i was not far behind however and when our party came fairly upon the roost the trackless dus and myself were all close together  i scarce know how to describe that remarkable scene as we drew near to the summit of the hill pigeons began to be seen fluttering among the branches over our heads as individuals are met along the roads that lead into the suburbs of a large town we had probably seen a thousand birds glancing around among the trees before we came in view of the roost itself the numbers increased as we drew nearer and presently the forest was alive with them the fluttering was incessant and often startling as we passed ahead our march producing a movement in the living crowd that really became confounding every tree was literally covered with nests many having at least a thousand of these frail tenements on their branches and shaded by the leaves they often touched each other a wonderful degree of order prevailing among the hundreds of thousands of families that were here assembled the place had the odor of a fowlhouse and squabs just fledged sufficiently to trust themselves in short flights were fluttering around us in all directions in tens of thousands to these were to be added the parents of the young race endeavoring to protect them and guide them in a way to escape harm although the birds rose as we approached and the woods just around us seemed fairly alive with pigeons our presence produced no general commotion every one of the feathered throng appearing to be so much occupied with its own concerns as to take little heed of the visit of a party of strangers though of a race usually so formidable to their own the masses moved before us precisely as a crowd of human beings yields to a pressure or a danger on any given point the vacuum created by its passage filling in its rear as the water of the ocean flows into the track of the keel  the effect on most of us was confounding and i can only compare the sensation produced on myself by the extraordinary tumult to that a man experiences at finding himself suddenly placed in the midst of an excited throng of human beings the unnatural disregard of our persons manifested by the birds greatly heightened the effect and caused me to feel as if some unearthly influence reigned in the place it was strange indeed to be in a mob of the feathered race that scarce exhibited a consciousness of ones presence the pigeons seemed a world of themselves and too much occupied with their own concerns to take heed of matters that lay beyond them  not one of our party spoke for several minutes astonishment seemed to hold us all tonguetied and we moved slowly forward into the fluttering throng silent absorbed and full of admiration of the works of the creator it was not easy to hear each others voices when we did speak the incessant fluttering of wings filling the air nor were the birds silent in other respects the pigeon is not a noisy creature but a million crowded together on the summit of one hill occupying a space of less than a mile square did not leave the forest in its ordinary impressive stillness as we advanced i offered my arm almost unconsciously again to dus and she took it with the same abstracted manner as that in which it had been held forth for her acceptance in this relation to each other we continued to follow the gravelooking onondago as he moved still deeper and deeper into the midst of the fluttering tumult  at this instant there occurred an interruption that i am ready enough to confess caused the blood to rush toward my own heart in a flood as for dus she clung to me as woman will cling to man when he possesses her confidence and she feels that she is insufficient for her own support both hands were on my arm and i felt that unconsciously her form was pressing closer to mine in a manner she would have carefully avoided in a moment of perfect selfpossession nevertheless i cannot say that dus was afraid her color was heightened her charming eyes were filled with a wonder that was not unmixed with curiosity but her air was spirited in spite of a scene that might try the nerves of the boldest man sureflint and chainbearer were alone totally unmoved for they had been at pigeons roosts before and knew what to expect to them the wonders of the woods were no longer novel each stood leaning on his rifle and smiling at our evident astonishment i am wrong the indian did not even smile for that would have been an unusual indication of feeling for him to manifest but he did betray a sort of covert consciousness that the scene must be astounding to us but i will endeavor to explain what it was that so largely increased the first effect of our visit  while standing wondering at the extraordinary scene around us a noise was heard rising above that of the incessant fluttering which i can only liken to that of the trampling of thousands of horses on a beaten road this noise at first sounded distant but it increased rapidly in proximity and power until it came rolling in upon us among the treetops like a crash of thunder the air was suddenly darkened and the place where we stood as sombre as a dusky twilight at the same instant all the pigeons near us that had been on their nests appeared to fall out of them and the space immediately above our heads was at once filled with birds chaos itself could hardly have represented greater confusion or a greater uproar as for the birds they now seemed to disregard our presence entirely possibly they could not see us on account of their own numbers for they fluttered in between dus and myself hitting us with their wings and at times appearing as if about to bury us in avalanches of pigeons each of us caught one at least in our hands while chainbearer and the indian took them in some numbers letting one prisoner go as another was taken in a word we seemed to be in a world of pigeons this part of the scene may have lasted a minute when the space around us was suddenly cleared the birds glancing upward among the branches of the trees disappearing among the foliage all this was the effect produced by the return of the female birds which had been off at a distance some twenty miles at least to feed on beechnuts and which now assumed the places of the males on the nests the latter taking a flight to get their meal in their turn  i have since had the curiosity to make a sort of an estimate of the number of the birds that must have come in upon the roost in that to us memorable minute such a calculation as a matter of course must be very vague though one may get certain principles by estimating the size of a flock by the known rapidity of the flight and other similar means and i remember that frank malbone and myself supposed that a million of birds must have come in on that return and as many departed as the pigeon is a very voracious bird the question is apt to present itself where food is obtained for so many mouths but when we remember the vast extent of the american forests this difficulty is at once met admitting that the colony we visited contained many millions of birds and counting old and young i have no doubt it did there was probably a fruitbearing tree for each within an hours flight from that very spot  such is the scale on which nature labors in the wilderness i have seen insects fluttering in the air at particular seasons and at particular places until they formed little clouds a sight every one must have witnessed on many occasions and as those insects appear on their diminished scale so did the pigeons appear to us at the roost of mooseridge we passed an hour in the town of birds finding our tongues and our other faculties as we became accustomed to our situation in a short time even dus grew as composed as at all comported with the excitement natural to one in such a place and we studied the habits of the pretty animals with a zest that i found so much the greater for studying them in her company at the end of the hour we left the hill our departure producing no more sensation in that countless tribe of pigeons than our arrival  it is a proof that numbers can change our natures said dus as we descended the little mountain here have we been almost in contact with pigeons which would not have suffered us to come within a hundred feet of them had they been in ordinary flocks or as single birds is it that numbers give them courage  confidence rather it is just so with men who will exhibit an indifference in crowds that they rarely possess when alone the sights interruptions and even dangers that will draw all our attention when with a few often seem indifferent to us when in the tumult of a throng of fellowcreatures  what is meant by a panic in an army then  it is following the same law making man subject to the impulses of those around him if the impulse be onward onward we go if for retreat we run like sheep if occupied with ourselves as a body we disregard trifling interruptions as these pigeons have just done in our own case large bodies of animals whether human or not seem to become subject to certain general laws that increase the power of the whole over the acts and feelings of any one or any few of their number  according to that rule our new republican form of government ought to be a very strong one though i have heard many express their fears it will be no government at all  unless a miracle be wrought in our behalf it will be the strongest government in the world for certain purposes and the weakest for others it professes a principle of selfpreservation that is not enjoyed by other systems since the people must revolt against themselves to overturn it but on the other hand it will want the active living principle of steady consistent justice since there will be no independent power whose duty and whose interest it will be to see it administered the wisest man i ever knew has prophesied to me that this is the point on which our system will break down rendering the character the person and the property of the citizen insecure and consequently the institutions odious to those who once have loved them  i trust there is no danger of that said dus quickly  there is danger from everything that man controls we have those among us who preach the possible perfection of the human race maintaining the gross delusion that men are what they are known to be merely because they have been illgoverned and a more dangerous theory in my poor judgment cannot be broached  you think then that the theory is false  beyond a question governments are oftener spoiled by men than men by governments though the last certainly have a marked influence on character the best government of which we know anything is that of the universe and it is so merely because it proceeds from a single will that will being without blemish  your despotic governments are said to be the very worst in the world  they are good or bad as they happen to be administered the necessity of maintaining such governments by force renders them often oppressive but a government of numbers may become more despotic than that of an individual since the people will in some mode or other always sustain the oppressed as against the despot but rarely or never as against themselves you saw that those pigeons lost their instinct under the impulse given them by numbers god forever protect me against the tyranny of numbers  but everybody says our system is admirable and the best in the world and even a despots government is the government of a man  it is one of the effects of numbers that men shrink from speaking the truth when they find themselves opposed to large majorities as respects selfrule the colonies were ever freer than the mother country and we are as yet merely pursuing our ancient practices substituting allegiance to the confederation for allegiance to the king the difference is not sufficiently material to produce early changes we are to wait until that which there is of new principles in our present system shall have time to work radical changes when we shall begin to ascertain how much better we really are than our neighbors13  footnote 13 at the time of which mr mordaunt littlepage is here speaking it was far less the fashion to extol the institutions than it is today men then openly wrote and spoke against them while few dare at the present time point out faults that every person of intelligence knows and feels to be defects a few years since when jackson was placed in the white house it was the fashion of europe to predict that we had elevated a soldier to power and that the government of the bayonet was at hand this every intelligent american knew to be rank nonsense the approach of the government of the bayonet among us if it is ever to come may be foreseen by the magnitude of popular abuses against which force is the only remedy every wellwisher of the freedom this country has hitherto enjoyed should now look upon the popular tendencies with distrust as whenever it is taken away it will go as their direct consequence it being an inherent principle in the corrupt nature of man to misuse all his privileges even those connected with religion itself if history proves anything it proves thiseditor  dus and i continued to converse on this subject until she got again into the saddle i was delighted with her good sense and intelligence which were made apparent more in the pertinacity of her questions than by any positive knowledge she had on such subjects which usually have very few attractions for young women nevertheless dus had an activity of mind and a readiness of perception that supplied many of the deficiencies of education on these points and i do not remember to have ever been engaged in a political discussion from which i derived so much satisfaction i must own however it is possible that the golden hair flying about a face that was just as ruddy as comported with the delicacy of the sex the rich mouth the brilliant teeth and the spirited and yet tender blue eyes may have increased a wisdom that i found so remarkable     chapter xv      fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear       as one with treasure laden hemmed with thieves     trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear       thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves                                          venus and adonis   the hut or huts of chainbearer had far more comfort in and around them than i was prepared to find they were three in number one having been erected as a kitchen and a place to contain the male slaves another for the special accommodation of ursula and the female black and the third to receive men the eatingroom was attached to the kitchen and all these buildings which had now stood the entire year were constructed of logs and were covered with bark they were roughly made as usual but that appropriated to dus was so much superior to the others in its arrangements internal and external as at once to denote the presence and the influence of woman it may have some interest with the reader briefly to describe the place  quite as a matter of course a spring had been found as the first consideration in locating as it is called by that portion of our people who get upon their conversational stilts the spring burst out of the side of a declivity the land stretching away for more than a mile from its foot in an inclined plane that was densely covered with some of the noblest elms beeches maples and black birches i have ever seen this spot the chainbearer early assured me was the most valuable of all the lands of mooseridge he had selected it because it was central and particularly clear from underbrush besides having no stagnant water near it in other respects it was like any other point in that vast forest being dark shaded and surrounded by the magnificence of a bountiful vegetation  here chainbearer had erected his hut a low solid structure of pine logs that were picturesque in appearance and not without their rude comforts in their several ways these buildings were irregularly placed though the spring was in their control the kitchen and eatingroom were nearest the water at no great distance from these was the habitation of the men while the smaller structure which frank malbone laughingly termed the harem stood a little apart on a slight spur of land but within fifty yards of andriess own lodgings boards had been cut by hand for the floors and doors of these huts though no building but the harem had any window that was glazed this last had two such windows and frank had even taken care to provide for his sisters dwelling rude but strong window shutters  as for defences against an enemy they were no longer thought of within the limits of new york blockhouses and otherwise fortified dwellings had been necessary so long as the french possessed canada but after the capture of that colony few had deemed any such precautions called for until the war of the revolution brought a savage foe once more among the frontier settlements frontier as to civilization if not as to territory with the termination of that war had ceased this the latest demand for provisions of that nature and the chainbearer had not thought of using any care to meet the emergencies of violence in making his pitch  nevertheless each hut would have been a reasonably strong post on an emergency the logs being bulletproof and still remaining undecayed and compact palisades were not thought of now nor was there any covered means of communicating between one hut and another in a word whatever there might be in the way of security in these structures was the result of the solidity of their material and of the fashion of building that was then and is still customary everywhere in the forest as against wild beasts there was entire protection and other enemies were no longer dreaded around the huts there were no enclosures of any sort nor any other cleared land than a spot of about half an acre in extent off of which had been cut the small pines that furnished the logs of which they were built a few vegetables had been put into the ground at the most open point but a fence being unnecessary none had been built as for the huts they stood completely shaded by the forest the pines having been cut on an eminence a hundred yards distant this spot however small as it was brought enough of the commoner sort of plants to furnish a frugal table  such was the spot that was then known in all that region by the name of the chainbearers huts this name has been retained and the huts are still standing circumstances having rendered them memorable in my personal history and caused me to direct their preservation at least as long as i shall live as the place had been inhabited a considerable time that spring and summer it bore some of the other signs of the presence of man but on the whole its character as a residence was that of deep forest seclusion in point of fact it stood buried in the woods distant fully fifteen miles from the nearest known habitation and in so much removed from the comfort succor and outward communications of civilized life these isolated abodes however are by no means uncommon in the state even at the present hour and it is probable that some of them will be found during the whole of this century it is true that the western middle southern southwestern northwestern and northeastern counties of new york all of which were wild or nearly so at the time of which i am writing are already well settled or are fast filling up but there is a high mountainous region in middlenorthern new york which will remain virtually a wilderness i should think for quite a century if not longer i have travelled through this district of wilderness very lately and have found it picturesque and well suited for the sportsman abounding in deer fish and forest birds but not so much suited to the commoner wants of man as to bring it very soon into demand for the ordinary purposes of the husbandman if this quarter of the country do not fall into the hands of lawless squatters and plunderers of one sort and another of which there is always some danger in a country of so great extent it will become a very pleasant resort of the sportsman who is likely soon to lose his haunts in the other quarters of the state  jaap had brought over some horses of mine from the nest as sumpterbeasts and these being sent back for want of provender the negro himself remained at the huts as a general assistant and as a sort of hunter a westchester negro is pretty certain to be a shot especially if he happen to belong to the proprietor of a neck for there is no jealousy of trusting arms in the hands of our new york slaves but jaap having served in a manner was entitled to burn as much gunpowder as he pleased by means of one of his warlike exploits the old fellow had become possessed of a very capital fowlingpiece plunder obtained from some slain english officer i always supposed and this arm he invariably kept near his person as a trophy of his own success the shooting of westchester however and that of the forest were very different branches of the same art jaap belonged to the school of the former in which the pointer and the setter were used the game was put up and marked down and the bird was invariably shot on the wing my attention was early called to this distinction by overhearing a conversation between the negro and the indian that took place within a few minutes after our arrival and a portion of which i shall now proceed to relate  jaap and sureflint were in point of fact very old acquaintances and fast friends they had been actors in certain memorable scenes on those very lands of mooseridge some time before my birth and had often met and served as comrades during the last war the known antipathy between the races of the red and black man did not exist as between them though the negro regarded the indian with some of that selfsufficiency which the domestic servant would be apt to entertain for a savage roamer of the forest while the onondago could not but look on my fellow as one of the freest of the free would naturally feel disposed to look on one who was content to live in bondage these feelings were rather mitigated than extinguished by their friendship and often made themselves manifest in the course of their daily communion with each other  a bag filled with squabs had been brought from the roost and jaap had emptied it of its contents on the ground near the kitchen to commence the necessary operations of picking and cleaning preparatory to handing the birds over to the cook as for the onondago he took his seat near by on a log very coolly a spectator of his companions labors but disdaining to enter in person on such womans work now that he was neither on a message nor on a warpath necessity alone could induce him to submit to any menial labor nor do i believe he would have offered to assist had he seen the fair hand of dus herself plucking these pigeons to him it would have been perfectly suitable that a squaw should do the work of a squaw while a warrior maintained his dignified idleness systematic and intelligent industry are the attendants of civilization the wants created by which can only be supplied by the unremitted care of those who live by their existence  dere old sus exclaimed the negro shaking the last of the dead birds from the bagdere now injin i spose you tinks em eres game  what you call him eh demanded the

cause me to hesitate about recording that which the partiality of so good a friend as susquesus might induce him to say but it is my wish to be particular and to relate all that passed on this occasion jaap could not object to the indians proposition for he had too much love and attachment for his two masters not to admit at once that they knew more than colonel follock no very extravagant assumption by the way  yes he good nough answered the black but he dont know half as much as masser corny or masser mordaunt he say worl isnt round now i tink he look round  what chainbearer say asked the indian suddenly as if he had determined that his own opinion should be governed by that of a man whom he so well loved chainbearer nebber lie  nor do masser corny nor masser mordaunt exclaimed jaap a little indignantly you tink trackless eder of my massers lie  that was an accusation that susquesus never intended to make though his greater intimacy with and greater reliance on old andries had naturally enough induced him to ask the question he had put  no say eeder lie answered the onondago but many forked tongue about and maybe hear so and tink so chainbearer stop ear nebber listen to crooked tongue  well here come chainbearer he self sus so jist for graterfercashun you shall hear what e ole man say it berry true chainbearer honest man and i like to know he opinion myself sin it

mortalitymiss anneke mortalityebberybody mortality but ebberybody not e same sort of mortalityunderstan now sus  the indian shook his head and looked perplexed but the chainbearer coming up at that moment that branch of the matter in discussion was pursued no farther after exchanging a few remarks about the pigeons jaap did not scruple to redeem the pledge he had given his red friend by plunging at once into the main subject with the chainbearer  you know how it be wid injin masser chainbearer said jaapey is always poor missedercated creaturs and knows nuttin but what come by chancenow here be sureflint he can no way tink dis worl round and dat it turn round too and so he want me to ask what you got to say about dat matter  chainbearer was no scholar whatever may be said of leyden and of the many very many learned dutchmen it had sent forth into the world few of them ever reached america our brethren of the eastern colonies now states had long been remarkable as a whole for that dangerous thing a little learning but i cannot say that the dutch of new york also viewed as a whole incurred any of those risks to own the truth it was not a very easy matter to be more profoundly ignorant on all things connected with science than were the mass of the uneducated dutch of new york in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eightyfour it made little difference as to condition in life unless one rose as high as the old colonial aristocracy of that stock and an occasional exception in favor of a family that intended to rear or had reared in its bosom a minister of the gospel such was the strength of the prejudice among these people that they distrusted the english schools and few permitted their children to enter them while those they possessed of their own were ordinarily of a very low character these feelings were giving way before the influence of time it is true but it was very slowly and it was pretty safe to infer that every man of low dutch extraction in the colony was virtually uneducated with the exception of here and there an individual of the higher social castes or one that had been especially favored by association and circumstances as for that flippant knowledge of which our eastern neighbors possessed so large an amount the new york dutch appeared to view it with peculiar dislike disdaining to know anything if it were not of the very best quality still there were a few to whom this quality was by no means a stranger in these isolated cases the unwearied application painstaking industry cautious appreciation of facts and solid judgment of the parties had produced a few men who only required a theatre for its exhibition in order to cause their information to command the profound respect of the learned let them live where they might what they did acquire was thoroughly got though seldom paraded for the purposes of mere show  old andries however was not of the class just named he belonged to the rule and not to its exception beyond a question he had heard all the more familiar truths of science alluded to in discourse or had seen them in the pages of books but they entered into no part of his real opinions for he was not sufficiently familiar with the different subjects to feel their truths in a way to incorporate them with his mind  you know tis sait jaap chainbearer answered tat bot are true eferypoty wilt tell you so and all te folks i haf seen holt te same opinions  tink him true chainbearer the onondago somewhat abruptly demanded  i spose i must sureflint since all say it te palefaces you know reat a great many pooks and get to pe much wiser tan ret men  how you make man stand on head eh  chainbearer now looked over one shoulder then over the other and fancying no one was near but the two in his front he was probably a little more communicative than might otherwise have been the case drawing a little nearer like one who is about to deal with a secret the honest old man made his reply  to pe frank wit you sureflint he answered tat ist a question not easily answered eferypoty says tis so ant terefore i spose it must pe so put i have often asked myself if tis worlt pe truly turned upsite town at night how is it old chainpearer tat you tont roll out of pet teres tings in natur tat are incomprehensiple trackless quite incomprehensiple  the indian listened gravely and it seemed to satisfy his longings on the subject to know that there were things in nature that are incomprehensible as for the chainbearer i thought that he changed the discourse a little suddenly on account of these very incomprehensible things in nature for it is certain he broke off on another theme in a way to alter all the ideas of his companions let them be on their heads or their heels  is it not true jaap tat you ant te onondago here wast pot present at te injin massacre tat took place in tese parts pefore te revolution in te olt french war i mean te time when one traverse a surveyor ant a fery goot surveyor he was was kilt witall his chainpearers ant axemen  true as gospel masser andries returned the negro looking up seriously and shaking his headi was here and so was sus dat was de fuss time we smell gunpowder togedder de french injins was out in droves and dey cut off masser traverse and all his party no leaving half a scalp on a single head yes sah i remembers dat as if twas last night  ant what was tone wit te poties you puriet te poties surely  sartainpete masser ten eycks man was put into a hole near masser cornys hut which must be out here four or five miles off while masser surveyor and his men were buried by a spring somewhere off yonder am i right injin  the onondago shook his head then he pointed to the true direction to each spot that had been mentioned showing that jaap was very much out of the way i had heard of certain adventures in which my father had been concerned when a young man and in which indeed my mother had been in a degree an actor but i did not know enough of the events fully to comprehend the discourse which succeeded it seemed that the chainbearer knew the occurrences by report only not having been present at the scenes connected with them but he felt a strong desire to visit the graves of the sufferers as yet he had not even visited the hut of mr traverse the surveyor who had been killed for the work on which he had been employed being one of detail or that of subdividing the great lots laid down before the revolution into smaller lots for present sale it had not taken him as yet from the central point where it had commenced his new assistant chainbearer was not expected to join us for a day or two and after talking the matter over with his two companions for a few minutes he announced a determination to go in quest of all the graves the succeeding morning with the intention of having suitable memorials of their existence placed over them  the evening of that day was calm and delightful as the sun was setting i paid dus a visit and found her alone in what she playfully called the drawingroom of her harem luckily there were no mutes to prevent my entrance the usual black guardian of whom there was one being still in her kitchen at work i was received without embarrassment and taking a seat on the threshold of the door i sat conversing while the mistress of the place plied her needle on a low chair within for a time we talked of the pigeons and of our little journey in the woods after which the conversation insensibly took a direction toward our present situation the past and the future i had adverted to the chainbearers resolution to search for the graves and at this point i shall begin to record what was said as it was said  i have heard allusions to those melancholy events rather than their history i added for some cause neither of my parents like to speak of them though i know not the reason  their history is well known at ravensnest answered dus and it is often related there at least as marvels are usually related in country settlements i suppose there is a grain of truth mixed up with a pound of error  i see no reason for misrepresenting in an affair of that sort  there is no other than the universal love of the marvellous which causes most people to insist on having it introduced into a story if it do not happen to come in legitimately your true country gossip is never satisfied with fact he or she would be the better word insists on exercising a dull imagination at invention in this case however from all that i can learn more fact and less invention has been used than common  we then spoke of the outlines of the story each had heard and we found that in the main our tales agreed in making the comparison however i found that i was disposed to dwell most on the horrible features of the incidents while dus gently and almost insensibly yet infallibly inclined to those that were gentler and which had more connection with the affections  your account is much as mine and both must be true in the main as you got yours from the principal actors she said but our gossips relate certain points connected with love and marriage about which you have been silent  let me hear them then i cried for i never was in a better mood to converse of love and marriage laying a strong emphasis on the last word than at this moment  the girl started blushed compressed her lips and continued silent for half a minute i could see that her hand trembled but she was too much accustomed to extraordinary situations easily to lose her selfcommand it was nearly dusk too and the obscurity in which she sat within the hut which was itself beneath the shade of tall trees most probably aided her efforts to seem unconscious yet i had spoken warmly and as i soon saw in a manner that demanded explanation though at the moment quite without plan and scarcely with the consciousness of what i was doing i decided not to retreat but to go on in doing which i should merely obey an impulse that was getting to be too strong for much further restraint that was not the precise moment nevertheless in which i was resolved to speak but i waited rather for the natural course of things in the mean time after the short silence mentioned the discourse continued  all i meant resumed dus was the tradition which is related among your tenants that your parents were united in consequence of the manner in which your father defended herman mordaunts dwelling his daughter includedthough herman mordaunt himself preferred some english lord for his soninlaw andbut i ought to repeat no more of this silly tale  let me hear it all though it be the loves of my own parents  i dare say it is not true for what vulgar report of private feelings and private acts ever is so my tradition added that miss mordaunt was at first captivated by the brilliant qualities of the young lord though she much preferred general littlepage in the end and that her marriage has been most happy  your tradition then has not done my mother justice but is faulty in many things your young lord was merely a baronets heir and i know from my dear grandmother that my mothers attachment to my father commenced when she was a mere child and was the consequence of his resenting an insult she received at the time from some other boy  i am glad of that exclaimed dus with an emphasis so marked that i was surprised at the earnestness of her manner second attachments in woman to me always seem misplaced there was another vein to my tradition which tells of a lady who lost her betrothed the night the nest was assailed and who has ever since lived unmarried true to his memory that is a part of the story i have ever loved  was her name wallace i asked eagerly  it was mary wallaceand i have honored the name ever since i heard the circumstances in my eyes mr littlepage there can be no picture more respectable than that of a female remaining true to her first attachments under all circumstances in death as well as in life  or in mine beloved ursula i criedbut i will not make a fool of myself by attempting to record what i said next the fact was that dus had been winding herself round my heart for the last few weeks in a way that would have defied any attempts of mine to extricate it from the net into which it had fallen had i the wish to do so but i had considered the matter and saw no reason to desire freedom from the dominion of ursula malbone to me she appeared all that man could wish and i saw no impediment to a union in the circumstance of her poverty her family and education were quite equal to my own and these very important considerations admitted i had fortune enough for both it was material that we should have the habits opinions prejudices if you will of the same social caste but beyond this worldly considerations in my view of the matter ought to have no influence  under such notions therefore and guided by the strong impulse of a generous and manly passion i poured out my whole soul to dus i dare say i spoke a quarter of an hour without once being interrupted i did not wish to hear my companions voice for i had the humility which is said to be the inseparable attendant of a true love and was fearful that the answer might not be such as i could wish to hear i could perceive spite of the increasing obscurity that dus was strongly agitated and will confess a lively hope was created within me by this circumstance thus encouraged it was natural to lose my fears in the wish to be more assured and i now pressed for a reply after a brief pause i obtained it in the following words which were uttered with a tremor and sensibility that gave them tenfold weight  for this unexpected and i believe sincere declaration mr littlepage i thank you from the bottom of my heart the precious creature commenced there are a frankness an honorable sincerity and a noble generosity in such a declaration coming from you to me that can never be forgotten but i am not my own mistressmy faith is plighted to anothermy affections are with my faith and i cannot accept offers which so truly generous so truly noble demand the most explicit reply  i heard no more for springing from the floor and an attitude that was very nearly that of being on my knees i rushed from the hut and plunged into the forest     chapter xvi      dans ye boys who pluck the flowers and spoil the spring                     beware the secret snake that shoots a sting                                                drydens eclogues   for the first half hour after i left ursula malbones hut i was literally unconscious of whither i was going or of what i was about i can recollect nothing but having passed quite near to the onondago who appeared desirous of speaking to me but whom i avoided by a species of instinct rather than with any design in fact fatigue first brought me fairly to my senses i had wandered miles and miles plunging deeper and deeper into the wilds of the forest and this without any aim or any knowledge of even the direction in which i was going night soon came to cast its shadows on the earth and my uncertain course was held amid the gloom of the hour united to those of the woods i had wearied myself by rapid walking over the uneven surface of the forest and finally threw myself on the trunk of a fallen tree willing to take some repose  at first i thought of nothing felt for nothing but the unwelcome circumstance that the faith of dus was plighted to another had i fallen in love with priscilla bayard such an announcement could not have occasioned the same surprise for she lived in the world met with men of suitable educations conditions and opinions and might be supposed to have been brought within the influence of the attentions and sympathies that are wont to awaken tenderness in the female breast with dus it had been very different she had gone from the forest to the school and returned from the school to the forest it was true that her brother while a soldier might have had some friend who admired ursula and whose admiration awakened her youthful sympathies but this was only a remote probability and i was left burdened with a load of doubt as respected even the character and position of my rival  at any rate he must be poor i said to myself the moment i was capable of reflecting coolly on the subject or he would never have left dus in that hut to pass her youth amid chainbearers and the other rude beings of a frontier if i cannot obtain her love i may at least contribute to her happiness by using those means which a kind providence has bestowed and enabling her to marry at once for a little while i fancied my own misery would be lessened could i only see dus married and happy this feeling did not last long however though i trust the desire to see her happy remained after i became keenly conscious it would require much time to enable me to look on such a spectacle with composure nevertheless the first tranquil moment the first relieving sensation i experienced was from the conviction i felt that providence had placed it in my power to cause ursula and the man of her choice to be united this recollection gave me even a positive pleasure for a little while and i ruminated on the means of effecting it literally for hours i was still thinking of it indeed when i threw myself on the fallen tree where weariness caused me to fall into a troubled sleep that lasted with more or less of forgetfulness several hours the place i had chosen on the tree was among its branches on which the leaves were still hanging and it was not without its conveniences  when i awoke it was daylight or such a daylight as penetrates the forest ere the sun has risen at first i felt stiff and sore from the hardness of my bed but on changing my attitude and sitting up these sensations soon wore off leaving me refreshed and calm to my great surprise however i found that a small light blanket such as woodmen use in summer had been thrown over me to the genial warmth of which i was probably indebted more than i then knew myself this circumstance alarmed me at first since it was obvious the blanket could not have come there without hands though a moments reflection satisfied me that the throwing it over me under the circumstances must have been the act of a friend i arose however to my feet walked along the trunk of the tree until clear of its branches and looked about me with a lively desire to ascertain who this secret friend might be  the place was like any other in the solitude of the forest there was the usual array of the trunks of stately trees the leafy canopy the dark shadows the long vistas the brown and broken surface of the earth and the damp coolness of the boundless woods a fine spring broke out of a hillside quite near me and looking further with the intention to approach and use its water the mystery of the blanket was at once explained i saw the form of the onondago motionless as one of the trees which grew around him leaning on his rifle and seemingly gazing at some object that lay at his feet in a minute i was at his side when i discovered that he was standing over a human skeleton this was a strange and startling object to meet in the depth of the woods man was of so little account was so seldom seen in the virgin wilds of america that one naturally felt more shocked at finding such a memorial of his presence in a place like that than would have been the case had he stumbled on it amid peopled districts as for the indian he gazed at the bones so intently that he either did not hear or he totally disregarded my approach i touched him with a finger before he even looked up glad of any excuse to avoid explanation of my own conduct i eagerly seized the occasion offered by a sight so unusual to speak of other things  this has been a violent death sureflint i said else the body would not have been left unburied the man has been killed in some quarrel of the red warriors  was bury answered the indian without manifesting the least surprise at my touch or at the sound of my voice dere see grave arth wash away and bones come out nuttin else know he bury for help bury myself  do you then know anything of this unhappy man and of the cause of his death  sartain know all bout him kill in ole french war fader here and colonel follock jaap too huron kill em all afterward we flog huron yes dat ole story now  i have heard something of this this must have been the spot then where one traverse a surveyor was set upon by the enemy and was slain with his chainbearers and axemen my father and his friends did find the bodies and bury them after a fashion  sartain just so poor bury dough else he nebber come out of groun dese bones of surveyor know em well hab one leg broke once dere you see mark  shall we dig a new grave susquesus and bury the remains again  best not now chainbearer mean do dat be here bymbye got someting else tink of now you own all land bout here so no need be in hurry  i suppose that my father and colonel follock do these men were slain on the estate while running out its great lots i think i have heard they had not near finished their work in this quarter of the patent which was abandoned on account of the troubles of that day  just so who own mill here den  there is no mill near us susquesus can be no mill as not an acre of the ridge property has ever been sold or leased  may be somill doughnot far off needer know mill when hear him saw talk loud  you surely do not hear the saw of a mill now my friend i can hear nothing like one  no hear now dat true but hear him in night ear good in nighthear great way off  you are right enough there susquesus and you fancied you heard the stroke of a saw from this place during the quiet and heavy air of the past night  sartainknow well hear him plain enough isnt mile off out here find him dere  this was still more startling than the discovery of the skeleton i had a rough general map of the patent in my pocket and on examination i found a millstream was laid down on it quite near the spot where we stood the appearance of the woods and the formation of the land moreover favored the idea of the proximity of a mill pine was plenty and the hills were beginning to swell into something resembling mountains  fasting and the exercise i had taken had given me a keen appetite and in one sense at least i was not sorry to believe that human habitations were near did any persons dwell in that forest they were squatters but i did not feel much personal apprehension in encountering such men especially when my only present object was to ask for food the erecting of a mill denoted a decided demonstration it is true and a little reflection might have told me that its occupants would not be delighted by a sudden visit from the representative of the owners of the soil on the other hand however the huts were long miles away and neither sureflint nor i had the smallest article of food about us both were hungry though the onondago professed indifference to the feeling an unconcern i could not share with him owing to habits of greater selfindulgence then i had a strong wish to solve this mystery of the mill in addition to a feverish desire to awaken within me some new excitement as a counterpoise to that i still keenly felt in behalf of my disappointed love  did i not so well understand the character of my companion and the great accuracy of indian senses i might have hesitated about going on what seemed to be a fools errand but circumstances that were then of recent origin existed to give some countenance to the conjecture of sureflint if conjecture his precise knowledge could be called originally new york claimed the connecticut for a part of its eastern boundary but large bodies of settlers had crossed that stream coming mainly from the adjacent colony of new hampshire and these persons had become formidable by their positions and numbers some time anterior to the revolution during that struggle these hardy mountaineers had manifested a spirit favorable to the colonies in the main though every indication of an intention to settle their claims was met by a disposition to declare themselves neutral in a word they were sufficiently patriotic if left to do as they pleased in the matter of their possessions but not sufficiently so to submit to the regular administration of the law about the close of the war the leaders of this selfcreated colony were more than suspected of coquetting with the english authorities not that they preferred the government of the crown or any other control to their own but because the times were favorable to playing off their neutrality in this manner as a means of securing themselves in the possession of lands to which their titles in the ordinary way admitted of a good deal of dispute to say the least the difficulty was by no means disposed of by the peace of 83 but the counties that were then equally known by the name of vermont and that of the hampshire grants were existing in one sense as a people apart not yet acknowledging the power of the confederacy nor did they come into the union under the constitution of 1789 until all around them had done so and the last spark of opposition to the new system had been extinguished  it is a principle of moral as well as of physical nature that like should produce like the right ever vindicates itself in the process of events and the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children even to the third and fourth generations in their melancholy consequences it was impossible that an example of such a wrong could be successfully exhibited on a large scale without producing its deluded imitators on another that was better suited to the rapacity of individual longings it is probable vermont has sent out among us two squatters and otherwise lawless intruders on our vacant lands to one of any other of the adjoining states counting all in proportion to their whole numbers i knew that the county of charlotte as washington was then called was peculiarly exposed to inroads of this nature and did not feel much surprise at this prospect of meeting with some of the fruits of the seed that had been so profusely scattered along the sides of the green mountains come what would however i was determined to ascertain the facts as soon as possible with the double purpose of satisfying both hunger and curiosity as for the indian he was passive yielding to my decision altogether as a matter of course  since you think there is a mill out here west of us sureflint i observed after turning the matter over in my mind i will go and search for it if you will bear me company you think you can find it i trust knowing the direction in which it stands  sartainfind him easy nough find stream firstden find mill got eargot eyeno hard to find him hear saw fore great while  i acquiesced and made a sign for my companion to proceed susquesus was a man of action and not of words and in a minute he was leading the way toward a spot in the woods that looked as if it might contain the bed of the stream that was known to exist somewhere near by since it was laid down on the map  the sort of instinct possessed by the trackless enabled him soon to find this little river it was full of water and had a gentle current a fact that the indian immediately interpreted into a sign that the mill must be above us since the dam would have checked the course of the water had we been above that turning up stream then my companion moved on with the same silent industry as he would have trotted along the path that led to his own wigwam had he been near it  we had not been on the banks of the stream five minutes before the trackless came to a dead halt like one who had met an unexpected obstacle i was soon at his side curious to know the motive of this delay  soon see mill now susquesus said in answer to an inquiry of mine board plentycome down stream fast as want him  sure enough boards were coming down in the current of the river much faster than one who was interested in the property would be apt to wish unless indeed he felt certain of obtaining his share of the amount of sales these boards were neither in rafts nor in cribs but they came singly or two or three laid together as if some arrangement had been made to arrest them below before they should reach any shoals falls or rapids all this looked surprisingly like a regular manufacturer of lumber with a view to sales in the markets of the towns on the hudson the little stream we were on was a tributary of that noble river and once in the latter there would be no very material physical obstacle to conveying the product of our hills over the habitable globe  this really looks like trade sureflint i said as soon as certain that my eyes did not deceive me where there are boards made men cannot be far off lumber cut to order does not grow in the wilderness though the material of which it is made may  mill make him knowd mill when hear him talk plain nough paleface make mill but red man got ear to hear wit  this was all true enough and it remained to ascertain what was to come of it i will acknowledge that when i saw those telltale boards come floating down the winding little river i felt a thrilling of the nerves as if assured the sight would be succeeded by some occurrence of importance to myself i knew that these lawless lumbermen bore a bad name in the land and that they were generally regarded as a set of plunderers who did not hesitate to defend themselves and their habits by such acts of violence and fraud as they fancied their circumstances justified it is one evil of crime where it penetrates masses that numbers are enabled to give it a gloss and a seeming merit that unsettle principles rendering the false true in the eyes of the ignorant and generally placing evil before good this is one of the modes in which justice vindicates itself under the providence of god the wrongs committed by communities reacting on themselves in the shape of a demoralization that soon brings its own merited punishment  there was little time for speculation or conjecture however for resuming our march the next bend in the river brought into view a reach of the stream in which half a dozen men and lads were at work in the water placing the boards in piles of two or three and setting them in the current at points favorable to their floating downward booms connected with chains kept the confused pile in a sort of basin beneath some low cliffs on the margin of which stood the expected sawmill itself here then was ocular proof that squatters were systematically at work plundering the forests of which i was in charge of their most valuable trees and setting everything like law and right at defiance the circumstances called for great decision united with the utmost circumspection i had gone so far that pride would not suffer me to retreat had not a sense of duty to my father and colonel follock come to increase the determination to go on  the reader may feel some desire to know how far dus mingled with my thoughts all this time she was never absolutely out of them though the repulse i had met in my affections gave an impetus to my feelings that rendered me more than usually disposed to enter on an adventure of hazard and wildness if i were naught to ursula malbone it mattered little what else became of me this was the sentiment that was uppermost and i have thought ever since that susquesus had some insight into the condition of my feelings and understood the cause of the sort of desperation with which i was about to rush on danger we were as yet quite concealed ourselves and the indian profited by the circumstance to hold a council before we trusted our persons in the hands of those who might feel it to be their interest to make away with us in preference to permitting us ever to see our friends again in doing this however sureflint was in no degree influenced by concern for himself but solely by a desire to act as became an experienced warrior on a very difficult warpath  spose you know said sureflint em no good menvarmount squatteryou tink own landdey tink own land carry rifle and do as please best watch him

he no got right well as you  because our laws give him no right while they give to the owner in fee a perfect right it is one of the conditions of the society in which we live that men shall respect each others property and this is not his property but mineor rather it is the property of my father and colonel follock  best not say so den no need tell ebberyting no your land say no your land if he tink you spy praps he shoot you eh paleface shoot spy red man tink spy good feller  spies can be shot only in time of war but war or peace you do not think these men will push matters to extremities they will be afraid of the law  law what law to him nebber see lawdont go near law dont know him  well i shall run the risk for hunger is quite as active just now as curiosity and interest there is no necessity however for your exposing yourself sureflint do you stay behind and wait for the result if i am detained you can carry the news to chainbearer who will know where to seek me stay you here and let me go on aloneadieu  sureflint was not to be dropped in this manner he said nothing but the moment i began to move he stepped quietly into his accustomed place in advance and led the way toward the party of squatters there were four of these men at work in the river in addition to two stout lads and the old leader who as i afterward ascertained was very generally known by the sobriquet of thousandacres the last remained on dry land doubtless imagining that his years and his long services in the cause of lawlessness and social disorganization entitled him to this small advantage the evil one has his privileges as well as the public  the first intimation our hosts received of this unexpected visit came from the cracking of a dried stick on which i had trodden the indian was not quicker to interpret and observe that wellknown sound than the old squatter who turned his head like thought and at once saw the onondago within a rod of the spot where he himself was standing i was close on the indians heels at first neither surprise nor uneasiness was apparent in the countenance of thousandacres he knew the trackless as he called susquesus and though this was the first visit of the indian at that particular location they had often met in a similar manner before and invariably with as little preliminary notice so far from anything unpleasant appearing in the countenance of the squatter therefore susquesus was greeted with a smile in which a certain leering expression of cunning was blended with that of welcome  so its only you trackless exclaimed thousand acres or thousandacres as i shall in future spell the namei didnt know but it might be a sheriff sitch critturs do get out into the woods sometimes you know though they dont always get back agin how come you to find us out in this cunning spot onondago  hear mill in night saw got loud tongue hungry so come get someting to eat  waal youve done wisely in that particlar for we never have been better off for vitals pigeons is as plenty as land and the law hasnt got to that pass yet as to forbid a body from taking pigeons even though it be in another mans stubble i must keep that saw better greased nights though i spose ater all t was the cut of the teeth you heard and not the rubbing of the plate  hear him allsaw got loud voice tell you  yes theres natur in that come well take this path up to the house and see what miss thousandacres can do for you breakfast must be ready by this time and you and your frind behind you there is wilcome to what we have sitch as it is now as we go along continued the squatter leading the way up the path he had mentionednow as we go along you can tell me the news trackless this is a desprate quiet spot and all the tidings we get is brought back by the bys when they come up stream from floating boards down into the river a desprate sight have we got on hand and i hope to hear that matters be going on so well in albany that boards will bring suthin soon its high time honest labor met with its reward  dont knownebber sell board answered the indiannebber buy him dont care for board powder cheap now e warpath shut up dat good spose you tink  waal trackless i kear more for boards than for powder i must own though powders useful too yes yes a useful thing is powder in its way venison and bears meat are both healthy cheap food and i have eaten catamount powder can be used in many ways who is your frind trackless  ole young frienknow his fader live in wood now like us this summer shoot deer like hunter  hes wilcomehes heartily wilcome alls wilcome to these parts but the landlord you know me tracklessyoure well acquainted with old thousandacres and few words is best among frinds of long standing but tell me onondago have you seen anything of the chainbearer and his party of lawless surveyors in the woods this summer the bys brought up an account of his being at work somewhere near by this season and that hes at his old tricks agin  sartain see him ole frien too chainbearer live wit him afore old french warlike to live with him when can good man chainbearer tell you thousandacres what trick he do eh  the indian spoke a little sternly for he loved andries too well to hear him disrespectfully named without feeling some sort of resentment these men however were too much accustomed to plain dealing in their ordinary discourse to take serious offence at trifles and the amicable sunshine of the dialogue received no serious interruption from this passing cloud  what trick does chainbearer do trackless answered the squattera mortal sight of tricks with them plaguy chains of hisn if there warnt no chains and chainbearers there could be no surveyors and if there warnt no surveyors there could be no boundaries to farms but the rifle which is the best lawmaker too that man ever invented the indians want no surveyors trackless  spose he dont it be bad to measure land will own answered the conscientious susquesus who would not deny his own principles even while he despised and condemned the man who now asserted them nebber see anyting good in measurin land  ay i knowd you was of the true injin kidney exclaimed thousandacres exultingly and thats it which makes sich frinds of us squatters and you redskins but chainbearer is at work hard by is he trackless  sartain he measure general littlepage farm out who your landlord eh  waal i do spose its this same littlepage and a desprate rogue all agree in callin him  i started at hearing my honored and honorable father thus alluded to and felt a strong disposition to resent the injury though a glance from the indians eye cautioned me on the subject i was then young and had yet to learn that men were seldom wronged without being calumniated i now know that this practice of circulating false reports of landlords most especially in relation to their titles is very general taking its rise in the hostile positions that adventurers are constantly assuming on their estates in a country as unsettled and migratory as our own aided by the common and vulgar passion of envy let a man travel through new york even at this day and lend his ear to the language of the discontented tavernbrawlers and he would hardly believe there was such a thing as a good title to an estate of any magnitude within its borders or a bad one to the farm of any occupant in possession there is among us a set of declaimers who come from a state of society in which little distinction exists in either fortunes or social conditions and who are incapable of even seeing much less of appreciating the vast differences that are created by habits opinions and education but who reduce all moral discrepancies to dollars and cents these men invariably quarrel with all above them and with them to quarrel is to caluminate leaguing with the disaffected of whom there always must be some especially when men are compelled to pay their debts one of their first acts is to assail the title of the landlord when there happens to be one in their neighborhood by lying and slandering there seems to be no exception to the rule the practice being resorted to against the oldest as well as against the most recently granted estates among us the lie only varies in particulars it is equally used against the titles of the old families of van rensselaer livingston beekman van cortlandt de lancey schuyler and others as against the hundred new names that have sprung up in what is called the western counties since the revolution it is the lie of the father of lies who varies it to suit circumstances and believers a desprate rogue all agree in calling the man who owns land that they desire to possess themselves without being put to the unpleasant trouble of purchasing and paying for it  i so far commanded myself however as to make no retort for the injustice done my upright beloved and nobleminded father but left his defence to the friendly feelings and sterling honesty of sureflint  not so answered the indian sternly big lieforked tongue tell datknow genralsarve wid himknow him good warriorhonest mandat lie tell him so to face  waalwaali dont know drawled out mr thousandacres how those rascals will waal and i dont know when they are cornered in one of their traducing tales and are met face to face as the indian now met the squatter waal waal i dont know and only repeat what i have heern say but here we be at the cabin trackless and i see by the smoke that old prudence and her gals has been actyve this morning and we shall get suthin comfortable for the stomach  hereupon mr thousandacres stopped at a convenient place by the side of the stream and commenced washing his face and hands an operation that was now performed for the first time that day     chapter xvii      he stepped before the monarchs chair     and stood with rustic plainness there       and little reverence made     nor head nor body bowed nor bent     but on the desk his arm he leant       and words like these he saidmarmion   while the squatter was thus occupied in arranging his toilet previously to taking his morning meal i had a moment of leisure to look about in we had ascended to the level of the mill where was an open halfcleared space of some sixty acres in extent that was under a rude cultivation stubs and stumps abounded and the fences were of logs showing that the occupancy was still of recent date in fact as i afterward ascertained thousandacres with his family of hopeful sons and daughters numbering in all more than twenty souls had squatted at that spot just four years before the millseat was admirable nature having done for it nearly all that was required though the mill itself was as unartificial and makeshift as such a construction very well could be agriculture evidently occupied very little of the time of the family which tilled just enough land to make a live ont while everything in the shape of lumber was improved to the utmost a vast number of noble pines had been felled and boards and shingles were to be seen in profusion on every side a few of the first were being sent to market in order to meet the demands of the moment in the way of groceries but the intention was to wait for the rise of the little stream after the fall rains in order to send the bulk of the property into the common artery of the hudson and to reap the great reward of the toil of the summer and spring  i saw also that there must be additions to this family in the way of marriage as they occupied no less than five cabins all of which were of logs freshly erected and had an air of comfort and stability about them that one would not have expected to meet where the title was so flimsy all this as i fancied indicated a design not to remove very soon it was probable that some of the oldest of the sons and daughters were married and that the patriarch was already beholding a new generation of squatters springing up about him a few of the young men were visible lounging about the different cabins and the mill was sending forth that peculiar cutting grating sound that had so distinctly attracted the attention of susquesus even in the depth of the forest  walk in trackless cried thousandacres in a hearty free manner which proved that what came easily went as freely walk in frind i dont know your name but thats no great matter where theres enough for all and a wilcome in the bargain heres the old woman ready and willing to sarve you and looking as smiling as a gal of fifteen  the last part of the statement however was not precisely accurate miss thousandacres as the squatter sometimes magnificently called his consort or the dam of his young brood was far from receiving us with either smiles or welcomes a sharpfeatured keen grayeyed old woman her thoughts were chiefly bent on the cares of her brood and her charities extended little beyond them she had been the mother of fourteen children herself twelve of which survived all had been born amid the difficulties privations and solitudes of stolen abodes in the wilderness that woman had endured enough to break down the constitutions and to destroy the tempers of half a dozen of the ordinary beings of her sex yet she survived the same enduring hardworking selfdenying suffering creature she had been from the day of her bloom and beauty these two last words might be supposed to be used in mockery could one have seen old prudence sallow attenuated with sunken cheeks hollow lacklustre eyes and brokenmouthed as i now saw her but there were the remains of great beauty notwithstanding about the woman and i afterward learned that she had once been among the fairest of the fair in her native mountains in all the intercourse i subsequently had with her family the manner of this woman was anxious distrustful watchful and bore a strong resemblance to that of the dam that is overseeing the welfare of her cubs as to her welcome at the board it was neither hearty nor otherwise it being so much a matter of course for the american to share his meal with the stranger that little is said or thought of the boon  notwithstanding the size of the family of thousandacres the cabin in which he dwelt was not crowded the younger children of the settlement ranging between the ages of four and twelve appeared to be distributed among all the habitations indifferently putting into the dishes wherever there was an opening much as pigs thrust themselves in at any opening at a trough the business of eating commenced simultaneously throughout the whole settlement prudence having blown a blast upon a conchshell as the signal i was too hungry to lose any time in discourse and set to with the most hearty goodwill upon the coarse fare the moment there was an opportunity my example was imitated by all around our own particular board it being the refined and intellectual only who habitually converse at their meals the animal had too great a preponderance among the squatters to leave them an exception to the rule  at length the common hunger was appeased and i could see that those who sat around began to examine me with a little more curiosity than they had previously manifested there was nothing in the fashion of my attire to excite suspicion perhaps though i did feel some little concern on account of its quality in that day the social classes were broadly distinguished by dress no man even affecting to assume the wardrobe of a gentleman without having certain pretensions to the character in the woods however it was the custom to throw aside everything like finery and i wore the huntingshirt already mentioned as my outer garment the articles most likely to betray my station in life were beneath this fortunate covering and might escape observation then our party was small consisting besides the parents and the two guests of only one young man and one young woman of about the ages of twoandtwenty and sixteen whom the mother addressed as zephaniah and lowiny the latter being one of the very common american corruptions of some fine name taken from a booklavinia quite likely14 these two young persons deported themselves with great modesty at the table old thousandacres and his wife spite of their lawless lives having maintained a good deal of the ancient puritan discipline among their descendants in relation to things of this nature indeed i was struck with the singular contrast between the habitual attention that was paid by all in the settlement to certain appearances of the sort and that certainty which every one must have possessed that they were living daily in the commission of offences opposed not only to the laws of the land but to the common inherent convictions of right in this particular they exhibited what is often found in life the remains of ancient habits and principles existing in the shape of habits long after the substance that had produced them had disappeared  footnote 14 the commoner dialect of new england is as distinct from the language of the rest of the republic cases of new england descent excepted as those of many of the english counties are from that of london one of the peculiarities of the former is to pronounce the final of a word like y calling america ameriky utica utiky ithaca ithaky thus lavinia would be very apt to be pronounced lavinny lavyny or lowiny as there is a marked ambition for fine names the effect of these corruptions on a practised ear is somewhat ludicrous the rest of the nation is quite free from the peculiarity foreigners often mistake new englandisms for americanisms the energy importance and prominency of the people of the former portion of the country giving them an influence that is disproportioned to their numbers  have you asked these folks about chainbearer said prudence abruptly as soon as the knives and forks were laid down and while we still continued in our seats at the table i feel a consarn of mind about that man that i never feel about any other  near fear chainbearer woman answered the husband hes got his summers work afore him without coming near us by the last accounts this young littlepage that the old rogue of a father has sent into the country has got him out in his own settlement where hell be apt to keep him i calcerlate till cold weather sets in let me once get off all the lumber weve cut and sell it and i kear very little about chainbearer or his master  this is bold talk aaron but jist remember how often weve squatted and how often weve been driven to move i spose im talking afore frinds in sayin what i do  no fear of any here wife trackless is an old acquaintance and has as little relish for lawtitles as any on us and his frind is our frind i confess that i felt a little uncomfortable at this remark but the squatter going on with his conversation there was no opportunity for saying anything had i been so disposed as for moving continued the husband i never movd but twice without getting pay for my betterments now i call that a good business for a man who has squatted no less than seventeen times if the worst comes to the worst were young enough to make an eighteenth pitch so that i save the lumber i keer but little for your littlepages or greatpages the mill is no great matter without the gear and that has travelled all the way from varmount as it is and is used to moving it can go farther  yes but the lumber aaron the waters low now and you can never get it to market until the rivers rise which maynt be these three months think how many days labor that lumber has cost you and all on us and what a sight of it there would be to lose  yes but we wunt lose it woman answered thousandacres compressing his lips and clenching his hands in a way to show how intensely he felt on the subject of property himself however dishonestly acquired my sweat and labor be in them boards and its as good as sap anyday what a man sweats for he has a right to  this was somewhat loose morality it is true since a man might sweat in bearing away his neighbors goods but a portion of the human race is a good deal disposed to feel and reason on principles but little more sound than this of old thousandacres  waall answered the woman im sure i dont want to see you and the bys lose the fruits of your labors not i youve honestly toiled and wrought at em logs in a way i never seed human beings outdo and twould be hard looking particularly at me now that theyve cut the trees hauled em to mill and sawed the boards to see another man step in and claim all the property that could never be right but is agin all justice whether varmount or york i spose theres no great harm in jist askin what your name may be young man  none in the world i answered with a selfcommand that i could see delighted the onondago my name is mordaunt  mordaunt repeated the woman quickly dont we know suthin of that nameis that a frindly name to us varmountershow is it aaron you ought to know  no i hadnt ought to for i never heerd tell of any sich name afore so long as tisnt littlepage i kear nothin about it  i felt relieved at this reply for i will own that the idea of falling into the power of these lawless men was far from pleasant to me from thousandacres down to the lad of seventeen they all stood six feet in their stockings and a stouter more broadshouldered sinewy race was not often seen the idea of resisting them by force was out of the question i was entirely without arms though the indian was better provided but no less than four rifles were laid on brackets in this one cabin and i made no doubt that every male of the family had his own particular weapon the rifle was the first necessary of men of this stamp being as serviceable in procuring food as in protecting them from their enemies  it was at this moment that prudence drew a long sigh and rose from table in order to renew her domestic labors lowiny followed her motions in submissive silence and we men sauntered to the door of the cabin where i could get a new view of the nature of those betterments that thousandacres so highly prized and of the extent of the depredations that had been committed on colonel follock and my father the last were by no means insignificant and at a later day they were estimated by competent judges to amount to fully a thousand dollars in value of course these were a thousand dollars totally lost inasmuch as redress in a pecuniary sense was entirely out of the question with men of the stamp of thousandacres and his sons this class of persons are fond of saying ill guarantee and ill bind myself to do this or that but the guarantee and obligation are equally without value in fact those who are the least responsible are usually the freest with such pledges  this is a handsome spot said thousandacres whose real name was aaron timberman this is a handsome spot mr mordaunt and one it would go kind o hard to give it up at the biddin of a man who never laid eye ont be you any way acquainted with law  a very little no more than we all get to be as we move along through life  youve not travelled far on that journey young man as any one can see by your face but youve had opportunities as a body can tell by your speech which isnt exactly like ourn out here in the woods from which i had kind o thought your schoolin might be more than common a body can tell though his own larnin amounts to no great matter  this notion of aarons that my modes of speech pronunciation accent and utterance had come from the schools was natural enough perhaps though few persons ever acquire accuracy in either except in the familiar intercourse of their childhood as for the common schools of new york they are perpetuating errors in these respects rather than correcting them and one of the largest steps in their improvement would be to have a care that he who teaches teaches accurately as to sounds as well as to significations under the present system vicious habits are confirmed by deliberate instruction and example rather than corrected  my schooling i answered modestly enough i trust has been a little better than common though it has not been good enough as you see to keep me out of the woods  all that may be inclination some folks have a natral turn for the wilderness and its workin agin the grain and nearly useless to try to make settlementbodies of em dye happen to know what lumber is likely to bring this fall  everything is looking up since the peace and it is fair to expect lumber will begin to command a price as well as other property  waal its time it should during the whull war a board has been of little more account than a strip of bark unless it happened to be in the neighborhood of an army we lumbermen have had an awful time on it these last eight years and more than once ive felt tempted to gin in and go and settle down in some clearin like quieter folks but i thought as the arth is to come to an eend the war must certainly come to an eend afore it  the calculation was a pretty safe one the war must have truly made a dull time to you nor do i see how you well got along during the period it lasted  bad enough though wartimes has their windfalls as well as peacetimes once the inimy seized a sight of continental stores sich as pork and flour and new england rum and they pressed all the teams far and near to carry off their plunder and my sleigh and horses had to go along with the rest on em waal go we did and i got as handsome a load as ever you seed laid in a lumbersleigh what i call an assortment and one too that was mightily to my own likin seein i loaded it up with my own hands twas in a woody country as you may spose or i wouldnt have been there and as i knowd all the byroads i watched my chance and got out of the line without being seen and druv as straight to my own hum as if id just come from tradin in the nearest settlement that was the most profitablest journey i ever tuck and what is more it was a short one  here old thousandacres stopped to laugh which he did in as hearty frank a manner as if his conscience had never known care this story i fancy was a favorite one with him for i heard no less than three other allusions to the exploit on which it was based during the short time our communication with each other lasted i observed the first smile i had seen on the face of zephaniah appear at the recital of this anecdote though i had not failed to notice that the young man as fine a specimen of rustic rude manly proportions as one could wish to see had kept his eyes on me at every occasion in a manner that excited some uneasiness  that was a fortunate service for you i remarked as soon as aaron had had his laugh unless indeed you felt the necessity of giving back the property to the continental officers  not a bit of it congress was poor enough im willin to own but it was richer than i was or ever will be when property has changed hands once title goes with it and some say that these very lands coming from the king ought now to go to the people jist as folks happen to want em theres reason and right im sartain in the idee and i shouldnt wonder if it held good in law one day  alas alas for poor human nature again seldom does man commit a wrong but he sets his ingenuity to work to frame excuses for it when his mind thus gets to be perverted by the influence of his passions and more especially by that of rapacity he never fails to fancy new principles to exist to favor his schemes and manifests a readiness in inventing them which enlisted on the side of goodness might render him a blessing instead of a curse to his race but roguery is so active while virtue is so apt to be passive that in the eternal conflict that is waged between them that which is gained by the truth and inherent power of the last is half the time more than neutralized by the unwearied exertions of the first this i fear may be found to contain the weak spot of our institutions so long as law represents the authority of an individual individual pride and jealousy may stimulate it to constant watchfulness whereas law representing the community carries with it a divided responsibility that needs the excitement of intolerable abuses ere it will arouse itself in its own vindication the result is merely another proof that in the management of the ordinary affairs of life men are usually found to be stronger than principles  have you ever had occasion to try one of your titles of possession in a court of law against that of a landholder who got his right from a grant i asked after reflecting a moment on the truth i have just narrated  thousandacres shook his head looked down a moment and pondered a little in his turn ere he gave me the following answer  sartain he said we all like to be on the right side if we can and some of our folks kind o persuaded me i might make out once agin a reglar landlord so i stood trial with him but he beat me mr mordaunt just the same as if i had been a chicken and he the hawk that had me in his talons youll never catch me trusting myself in the claws of the law agin though that happened as long ago as afore the old french war i shall never trust to law any more it may do for them thats rich and dont kear whether they win or lose but law is a desprate bad business for them that hasnt got money to go into it right eend foremost  and should mr littlepage discover your being here and feel disposed to come to some arrangement with you what conditions would you be apt to accept  oh im never agin trade trades the spirit of life and seein that ginral littlepage has some right as i do spose is the case i shouldnt want to be hard on him if he would keep things quiet and not make a fuss about it but would leave the matter out to men and they men of the right sort i shouldnt be difficult for im one of that kind that hates lawsuits and am always ready to do the right thing and so hed find me as ready to settle as any man he ever had on his lands  but on what terms you have not told me the terms  as to tarms id not be hard by any means no man can say old thousandacres ever druv hard tarms when he had the best ont thats not in my natur which runs altogether toward reason and whats right now you see mordaunt how matters stand atween this littlepage and myself hes got a paper title they tell me and ive got possession which is always a squatters claim and a good one tis where theres plenty of pine and a millseat with a handy market  here thousandacres stopped to laugh again for he generally indulged in this way in so hearty and deep a tone as to render it difficult to laugh and talk in the same breath as soon as through however he did not forget to pursue the discourse  no no man that understands the woods will gainsay them advantages added the squatter and of all on em am i now in the enjyment waal ginral littlepage as they call him about here has a paper title and ive got possession he has the courts on his side ill allow but here are my bettermentssixtythree as large acres chopped over and hauled to mill as can be found in all charlotte or washington as they tell me the county is now called  but general littlepage may not fancy it an improvement to have his land stripped of its pine you know thousandacres as well as i do that pine is usually thought to greatly add to the value of lands hereabouts the hudson making it so easy to get it to market  lord youngster do you think i hadnt all that in my mind when i made my pitch here you cant teach old bones where its best to strike the first blow with an axe now ive got in the creek this word is used in the parlance of the state for a small river nine times in ten now ive got in the creek on the way to the hudson in the booms below the mill and in the millyard yonder a hundred and twenty thousand feet of as handsome stuff as ever was cribbed or rafted and theres logs enough cut and hauled to make more than as much more i some sort o think you know this littlepage by your talk and as i like fair dealins and whats right atween man and man ill just tell you what ill do so that you can tell him if you ever meet and the matter should come up atween you as sich things sometimes do in all talk like though a body has no real consarn in the affair and so you can tell this ginral that old thousandacres is a reasonable man and is willing to settle on these tarms but he wont gin a grain more if the ginral will let me get all the lumber to market peaceably and take off the crops the bys have put in with their own hands and carry off all the millgear and take down the doors and windows of the houses and all the ironwork a body can find about im willing to agree to quit arly enough in the spring to let any man he chooses come into possession in good season to get in spring grain and make garden there thems my tarms and ill not abate on one on em on no account at all but that much ill do for peace for i do love peace and quiet my woman says most despately  i was about to answer this characteristic communicationperfectly characteristic as to feelings onesided sense of right principles and languagewhen zephaniah the tall son of the squatter suddenly laid a hand on his fathers arm and led him aside this young man had been examining my person during the whole of the dialogue at the door of the cabin in a way that was a little marked i was disposed at first to attribute these attentions to the curiosity natural to youth at its first meeting with one who might be supposed to enjoy opportunities of ascertaining the newest modes of dress and deportment rustics in america ever manifest this feeling and it was not unreasonable to suppose that this young squatter might have felt its influence but as it soon appeared i had altogether mistaken my man although both he and his sister lowiny had never turned their eyes from my person i soon discovered that they had been governed by totally opposing feelings  the first intimation i got of the nature of the mistake into which i had fallen was from the manner of thousandacres as soon as his son had spoken to him apart for a single minute i observed that the old squatter turned suddenly and began to scrutinize my appearance with a scowling but sharp eye then he would give all his attention to his son after which i came in for a new turn of examination of course such a scene could not last a great while and i soon felt the relief of being again face to face with the man whom i now set down for an enemy  harkee young man resumed thousandacres as soon as he had returned and placed himself directly before me my by zeph there has got a suspicion consarning you that must be cleared up fairly atween us afore we part i like fair dealins as ive told you more than once already and despise underhandedness from the bottom of my heart zeph tells me that he has a kind o suspicion that youre the son of this very littlepage and have been sent among us to spy us out and to larn how things stood afore you let on your evil intentions is it so or not  what reason has zeph for such a suspicion i answered with such coolness as i could assume he is a perfect stranger to me and i fancy this is the first time we have ever met  he agrees to that himself but mankind can sometimes see things that isnt put directly afore their eyes my son goes and comes frequently between the ravensnest settlement and our own though i dont suppose he lets on any great deal about his proper hum he has worked as much as two months at a time in that part of the country and i find him useful in carrying on a little trade once and awhile with squire newcome  you are acquainted then with mr jason newcome or squire newcome as you call him  i call him whats right i hope answered the old man sharply he is a squire and should be called a squire give the devil his due thats my principle but zephaniah has been out a considerable spell this summer to work at ravensnest i tell him he has a gal in his eye by his hankering so much after the nest folks but he wont own it but out he has been and he tells me this littlepages son was expected to come into the settlement about the time he last left there  and you are acquainted with squire newcome i said pursuing the subject as its points presented themselves to my own mind rather than following the thread of the squatters discursive manner of thinking so well acquainted as to trade with him  sartain well acquainted i may say the squire tuck took all the lumber i cut arly in the spring rafting and selling it on his own account paying us in groceries womens cloth and rum he made a good job of it i hear tell and is hankerin round ater what is now in the creek but i rather think ill send the bys off with that but whats that to the purpose didnt you tell me young man that your name is mordaunt  i did and in so saying i told no more than the truth  and what may you call your given name ater all old woman turning to the anxious wife and mother who had drawn near to listen having most probably been made acquainted with the nature of her sons suspicionsater all the by may be mistaken and this young man as innocent as any one of your own flesh and blood  mordaunt is what you call my given name i answered disdaining deception and littlepage the hand of the indian was suddenly placed on my mouth stopping further utterance  it was too late however for the friendly design of the onondago the squatters readily comprehending all i had intended to say as for prudence she walked away and i soon heard her calling all her younger children by name to collect them near her person as the hen gathers its chickens beneath the wing thousandacres took the matter very differently his countenance grew dark and he whispered a word to lowiny who departed on some errand with reluctant steps as i thought and eyes that did not always look in the direction she was walking  i see how it is i see how it is exclaimed the squatter with as much of suppressed indignation in his voice and mien as if his cause were that of offended innocence weve got a spy among us and wartimes too fresh not to let us know how to deal with sich folks young man whats your arrnd down here in my betterments and beneath my ruff  my errand as you call it thousandacres is to look after the property that is intrusted to my care i am the son of general littlepage one of the owners of this spot and the attorney of both  oh an attorney be you cried the squatter mistaking the attorney in fact for an attorney at lawa sort of being for whom he necessarily entertained a professional antipathy ill attorney ye if you or your ginral father thinks that aaron thousandacres is a man to have his territories invaded by the inimy and keep his hands in his pockets the whull time hes mistaken send em along lowiny send along the bys and lets see if we cant find lodgins for this young attorney ginral as well as board  there was no mistaking the aspect of things now hostilities had commenced in a certain sense and it became incumbent on me for the sake of safety to be on the alert i knew that the indian was armed and determined to defend my person if possible i was resolved to avail myself of the use of his weapon should it become necessary stretching out an arm and turning to the spot where susquesus had just stood to lay hold of his rifle i discovered that he had disappeared     chapter xviii      the lawless herd with fury blind       have done him cruel wrong     the flowers are gone but still we find       the honey on his tonguecowper   there i stood alone and unarmed in the centre of six athletic menfor lowiny had been sent to assemble her brothers a business in which she was aided by prudences blowing a peculiar sort of blast on her conchand as unable to resist as a child would have been in the hands of its parent as a fruitless scuffle would have been degrading as well as useless i at once determined to submit temporarily at least or so long as submission did not infer disgrace and was better than resistance there did not seem to be any immediate disposition to lay violent hands on me however and there i stood a minute or two after i had missed sureflint surrounded by the whole brood of the squatter young and old male and female some looking defiance others troubled and all anxious as for myself i will frankly own my sensations were far from pleasant for i knew i was in the hands of the philistines in the depths of a forest fully twenty miles from any settlement and with no friends nearer than the party of the chainbearer who was at least two leagues distant and altogether ignorant of my position as well as of my necessities a ray of hope however gleamed in upon me through the probable agency of the onondago  not for an instant did i imagine that longknown and welltried friend of my father and the chainbearer false his character was too well established for that and it soon occurred to me that foreseeing his own probable detention should he remain he had vanished with a design to let the strait in which i was placed be known and to lead a party to my rescue a similar idea probably struck thousandacres almost at the same instant for glancing his eye around him he suddenly demanded  what has become of the redskin the varmint has dodged away as im an honest man nathaniel moses and daniel to your rifles and on the trail bring the fellow in if you can with a whull skin but if you cant an injin more or less will never be heeded in the woods  i soon had occasion to note that the patriarchal government of thousandacres was of a somewhat decided and prompt character a few words went a great way in it as was now apparent for in less than two minutes after aaron had issued his decree those namesakes of the prophets and lawgivers of old nathaniel and moses and daniel were quitting the clearing on diverging lines each carrying a formidable long american huntingrifle in his hand this weapon so different in the degree of its power from the short military piece that has become known to modern warfare was certainly in dangerous hands for each of those young men had been familiar with his rifle from boyhood gunpowder and liquor with a little lead composing nearly all the articles on which they lavished money for their amusement i trembled for susquesus though i knew he must anticipate a pursuit and was so well skilled in throwing off a chase as to have obtained the name of the trackless still the odds were against him and experience has shown that the white man usually surpasses the indian even in his own peculiar practices when there have been opportunities to be taught i could do no more however than utter a mental prayer for the escape of my friend  bring that chap in here added old thousandacres sternly the moment he saw that his three sons were off enough remaining to enforce that or any other order he might choose to issue bring him into this room and let us hold a court on him sin he is sich a lover of the law if law he likes law let him have an attorney is he i warnt to know what has an attorney to do with me and mine out here in the woods  while this was in the course of being said the squatter and father of squatters led the way into his own cabin where he seated himself with an air of authority causing the females and younger males of his brood to range themselves in a circle behind his chair seeing the folly of resistance at a hint from zephaniah i followed the three young men occupying the place near the door as a species of guard in this manner we formed a sort of court in which the old fellow figured as the investigating magistrate and i figured as the criminal  an attorney be you muttered thousandacres whose ire against me in my supposed would seem to be more excited than it was against me in my real character bys silence in the court well give this chap as much law as he can stagger under sin hes of a law natur everything shall be done accordin to rule tobit addressing his oldest son a colossal figure of about sixandtwenty youve been in the law more than any on us and can give us the word what wast they did with you first when they had you up in hampshire colony the time when you and that other young man went across from the varmount settlements to look for sheep a raft of the critturs you did get atween you though you was waylaid and robbed of all your hard arnins afore you got back agin in the mountains they dealt with you accordin to law twas said now what was the first thing done  i was tuck taken afore the squire answered tobit thousandacres as he was often called who heerd the case asked me what i had to say for myself and then permitted me as it was tarmed so i went to jail until the trial came on and i spose you know what come next as well as i do  i took it for granted that what come next was anything but pleasant in remembrance the reason tobit did not relish it even in description inasmuch as sheepstealers were very apt to get forty save one at the whippingpost in that day a species of punishment that was admirably adapted to the particular offence we are getting among us a set of soidisant philanthropists who in their great desire to coddle and reform rogues are fast placing the punishment of offences on the honest portion of the community for the especial benefit of their élèves some of these persons have already succeeded in cutting down all our whippingposts thereby destroying the cheapest and best mode of punishing a particular class of crimes that was ever intended or practised a generation hence our children will feel the consequences of this mistaken philanthropy in that day let those who own fowlhouses pigpens orchards smokehouses and other similar temptations to small depredations look to it for i am greatly mistaken if the insecurity of their movables does not give the most unanswerable of all commentaries on this capital misstep one whippingpost discreetly used will do more toward reforming a neighborhood than a hundred jails with their twenty and thirty days imprisonment15 i have as much disposition to care for the reformation of criminals as is healthful if i know myself but the great object of all the punishments of society viz its own security ought never to be sacrificed to this which is but a secondary consideration render character person and property as secure as possible in the first place after which try as many experiments in philanthropy as you please  footnote 15 mr mordaunt littlepage writes here with prophetic accuracy small depredations of this nature have got to be so very common that few now think of resorting to the law for redress instead of furnishing the prompt and useful punishment that was administered by our fathers the law is as much adorned with its cavillings and delays in the minor as in the more important cases and it often takes years to bring a small depredator even to trial if he can find money to fee a sagacious lawyereditor  i am sorry to see how far the disposition to economize is extending itself in the administration of american justice generally under a government like that of this country it is worse than idle for it is perfectly futile to attempt to gratify the imagination by a display of its power through the agency of pomp and representation such things doubtless have their uses and are not to be senselessly condemned until one has had an opportunity of taking near views of their effects though useful or the reverse they can never succeed here but these communities of ours have it in their power to furnish to the world a far more illustrious example of human prescience and benevolent care by their prompt exact and wellconsidered administration of justiceincluding the cases both in the civil and the criminal courts with what pride might not the american retort when derided for the simplicity of his executive and the smallness of the national expenditure in matters of mere representation could he only saytrue we waste nothing on mere parade but turn to the courts and to the justice of the country which after all are the great aim of every good government look at the liberality of our expenditures for the command of the highest talent in the first place see with what generous care we furnish judges in abundance to prevent them from being overworked and to avoid ruinous delays to suitors then turn to the criminal courts and into first the entire justice of the laws next the care had in the selection of jurors the thorough impartiality of all the proceedings and finally when the right demands it the prompt unerring and almost terrific majesty of punishment but to return to something that is a good deal more like truth  yes yes rejoined thousandacres there is no use in riling the feelins by talking of that meaning tobits sufferings not at the stake but at the posta hints as good as a description you was taken afore a magistrate was youand he permitted you to prisonbut he asked what you had to say for yourself first that was only fair and i mean to act it all out here accordin to law come young attorney what have you got to say for yourself  it struck me that alone as i was in the hands of men who were a species of outlaws it might be well to clear myself from every imputation that at least was not merited  in the first place i answered i will explain a mistake into which you have fallen thousandacres for let us live as friends or foes it is always best to understand facts i am not an attorney in the sense you imaginei am not a lawyer  i could see that the whole brood of squatters prudence included was a good deal mollified by this declaration as for lowiny her handsome ruddy face actually expressed exultation and delight i thought i heard that girl half suppress some such exclamation asi knowd he wasnt no lawyer as for tobit the scowling look replete with catoninetails actually departed temporarily at least in short this announcement produced a manifest change for the better  no lawyer ater all exclaimed thousandacresdidnt you say you was an attorney  that much is true i told you that i was the son of general littlepage and that i was his attorney and that of colonel follock the other tenant in common of this estate meaning that i held their power of attorney to convey lands and to transact certain other business in their names  this caused me to lose almost as much ground as i had just gained though being the literal truth i was resolved neither to conceal nor to attempt to evade it  good land murmured lowiny why couldnt the man say nothin about all that  a reproving look from prudence rebuked the girl and she remained silent afterward for sometime  a power of attorney is it rejoined the squatter waal thats not much better than being a downright lawyer its having the power of an attorney i spose and without their accursed power its little i should kear for any of the breed then youre the son of that ginral littlepage which is next thing to being the man himself i should expect if tobit my oldest by was to fall into the hands of some that might be named it would go hard with him all the same as if twas myself i know that some make a difference atween parents and children but other some doesnt whats that you said about this ginrals only being a common tenant of this land how dares he to call himself its owner if hes only a common tenant  the reader is not to be surprised at thousandacres trifling blunders of this sort for those whose rule of right is present interest frequently in the eagerness of rapacity fall into this very kind of error holding that cheap at one moment which they affect to deem sacred at the next i dare say if the old squatter had held a lease of the spot he occupied he would at once have viewed the character and rights of a common tenant as connected with two of the most important interests of the country it happened now however that it was his bull that was goring our ox  how dares he to call himself the owner of the sile when hes only a common tenant i say repeated thousandacres with increasing energy when he found i did not answer immediately  you have misunderstood my meaning i did not say that my father was only a common tenant of this property but that he and colonel follock own it absolutely in common each having his right in every acre and not one owning one half while the other owns the other which is what the law terms being tenants in common though strictly owners in fee  i shouldnt wonder tobit if he turns out to be an attorney in our meaning ater all  it looks desprately like it father answered the eldest born who might have been well termed the heir at law of all his progenitors squatting and fierce propensities if he isnt a downright lawyer he looks more like one than any man i ever seed out of court in my whull life  hell find his match law and i have been at loggerheads ever sin the day i first went into varmount or them plaguy hampshire grants when law gets me in its clutches its no wonder if it gets the best ont but when i get law in mine or one of its sarvants it shall be my fault if law doesnt come out second best waal weve heerd the young mans story tobit ive asked him what he had to say for himself and he has gin us his telltelld us how hes his own fathers son and that the ginral is some sort of a big tenant instead of being a landlord and isnt much better than we are ourselves and its high time i permitted him to custody you had writins for what they did to you i dares to say tobit  sartain the magistrate give the sheriffs deputy a permittimus and on the strength of that they permitted me to jail  yeeesi know all about their niceties and appearances i have had dealins afore many a magistrate in my day and have onsuited many a chap that thought to get the best ont afore we begun onsuiting the man that brings the suit is the cleanest way of getting out of the law as i knows on but it takes a desprate long head sometimes to do it afore i permit this young man ill show writins too prudence just onlock the drawer  i wish to correct one mistake before you proceed further interrupted i for the second time i tell you i am no lawyer in any sense of the word i am a soldierhave commanded a company in general littlepages own regiment and served with the army when only a boy in years i saw both burgoyne and cornwallis surrender and their troops lay down their arms  good now whod ha thought it exclaimed the compassionate lowiny and he so young that youd hardly think the wind had ever blown on him  my announcement of this new character was not without a marked effect fighting was a thing to the whole familys taste and what they could appreciate better perhaps than any other act or deed there was something warlike in thousandacres very countenance and air and i was not mistaken in supposing he might feel some little sympathy for a soldier he eyed me keenly and whether or not he discovered signs of the truth of my assertion in my mien i saw that he once more relented in purpose  you out agin burgyne the old fellow exclaimed can i believe what you say why i was out agin burgyne myself with tobit and moses and nathaniel and jedediahwith every male crittur of the family in short that was big enough to load and fire i count them days as among my very best though they did come late and ater old age had made some head agin me how can you prove you was out agin burgyne and cornwallis  i knew that there was often a strange medley of soidisant patriotic feeling mixed up with the most confirmed knavery in ordinary matters and saw i had touched a chord that might thrill on the sympathies of even these rude and supremely selfish beings the patriotism of such men indeed is nothing but an enlargement of selfishness since they prize things because they belong to themselves or they in one sense belong to the things they take sides with themselves but never with principles that patriotism alone is pure which would keep the country in the paths of truth honor and justice and no man is empowered in his zeal for his particular nation any more than in his zeal for himself to forget the law of right  i cannot prove i was out against burgoyne standing here where i am certainly i answered but give me an opportunity and i will show it to your entire satisfaction  which rijiment was on the right hazens or brookess in storming the jarmans tell me that and i will soon let you know whether i believe you or not  i cannot tell you that fact for i was with my own battalion and the smoke would not permit such a thing to be seen i do not know that either of the corps you mention was in that particular part of the field that day though i believe both to have been warmly engaged  he warnt there drawled out tobit in his most dissatisfied manner almost showing his teeth like a dog under the impulse of the hatred he felt  he was there cried lowiny positively i know he was there  a slap from prudence taught the girl the merit of silence but the men were too much interested to heed an interruption as characteristic and as bootless as this  i see how it is added thousandacres i must permit the chap ater all seein however that there is a chance of his having been out agin burgyne ill permit him without writins and he shant be bound tobit take your prisoner away and shut him up in the storeus when your brothers get back from their hunt ater the injin well detarmine among us what is to be done with him  thousandacres delivered his orders with dignity and they were obeyed to the letter i made no resistance since it would only have led to a scuffle in which i should have sustained the indignity of defeat to say nothing of personal injuries tobit however did not offer personal violence contenting himself with making a sign for me to follow him which i did followed in turn by his two doublejointed brothers i will acknowledge that as we proceeded toward my prison the thought of flight crossed my mind and i might have attempted it but for the perfect certainty that with so many on my heels i must have been overtaken when severe punishment would probably have been my lot on the whole i thought it best to submit for a time and trust the future to providence as to remonstrance or deprecation pride forbade my having recourse to either i was not yet reduced so low as to solicit favors from a squatter  the jail to which i was permitted by thousandacres was a storehouse or as he pronounced the word a storeus of logs which had been made of sufficient strength to resist depredations let them come from whom they might and they were quite as likely to come from some within as from any without in consequence of its destination the building was not illsuited to become a jail the logs of course gave a sufficient security against the attempts of a prisoner without tools or implements of any sort the roof being made of the same materials as the sides there was no window abundance of air and light entering through the fissures of the rough logs which had open intervals between them and the only artificial aperture was the door this last was made of stout planks and was well secured by heavy hinges and strong bolts and locks the building was of some size tootwenty feet in length at leastone end of it though then quite empty having been intended and used as a crib for the grain that we americans call par excellence corn into this building i entered after having the large knife that most woodsmen carry taken from my pocket and a search was made on my person for any similar implement that might aid me in an attempt to escape  in that day america had no paper money from the bay of hudson to cape horn gold and silver formed the currency and my pockets had a liberal supply of both in the shape of joes and halfjoes dollars halves and quarters not a piece of coin of any sort was molested however these squatters not being robbers in the ordinary signification of the term but merely deluded citizens who appropriated the property of others to their own use agreeably to certain great principles of morals that had grown up under their own peculiar relations to the rest of mankind their immediate necessities and their convenience i make no doubt that every member of the family of thousandacres would spurn the idea of his or her being a vulgar thief drawing some such distinctions in the premises as the drakes morgans woodes rogers and others of that school drew between themselves and the vulgar every day searobbers of the seventeenth century though with far less reason but robbers these squatters were not except in one mode and that mode they almost raised to the dignity of respectable hostilities by the scale on which they transacted business  i was no sooner lockedup than i began a survey of my prison and the surrounding objects there was no difficulty in doing either the opening between the logs allowing of a clear reconnoissance on every side with a view to keeping its contents in open sight i fancy the storeus was placed in the very centre of the settlement having the mills cabins barns sheds and other houses encircling it in a sort of hamlet this circumstance which would render escape doubly difficult was notwithstanding greatly in favor of reconnoitring i will now describe the results of my observations as a matter of course my appearance the announcement of my character and my subsequent arrest were circumstances likely to produce a sensation in the family of the squatter all the women had gathered around prudence near the door of her cabin and the younger girls were attracted to that spot as the particles of matter are known to obey the laws of affinity the males one boy of eight or ten years excepted were collected near the mill where thousandacres apparently was holding a consultation with tobit and the rest of the brotherhood among whom i fancy was no one entitled to be termed an angel everybody seemed to be intently listening to the different speakers the females often turning their eyes toward their male protectors anxiously and with long protracted gazes indeed many of them looked in that direction even while they gave ear to the wisdom of prudence herself  the excepted boy had laid himself in a lounging american sort of an attitude on a sawlog near my prison and in a position that enabled him to see both sides of it without changing his ground by the manner in which his eyes were fastened on the storeus i was soon satisfied that he was acting in the character of a sentinel thus my jail was certainly sufficiently secure as the force of no man unaided and without implements could have broken a passage through the logs  having thus taken a look at the general aspect of things i had leisure to reflect on my situation and the probable consequences of my arrest for my life i had no great apprehensions not as much as i ought to have had under the circumstances but it did not strike me that i was in any great danger on that score the american character in general is not bloodthirsty and that of new england less so perhaps than that of the rest of the country nevertheless in a case of property the tenacity of the men of that quarter of the country was proverbial and i came to the conclusion that i should be detained if possible until all the lumber could be got to market and disposed of as the only means of reaping the fruit of past labor the possibility depended on the escape or the arrest of sureflint should that indian be taken thousandacres and his family would be as secure as ever in their wilderness but on the other hand should he escape i might expect to hear from my friends in the course of the day by resorting to a requisition on squire newcome who was a magistrate my tenants might be expected to make an effort in my behalf when the only grounds of apprehension would be the consequences of the struggle the squatters were sometimes dangerous under excitement and when sustaining each other with arms in their hands in what they fancy to be their hardearned privileges there is no end to the delusions of men on such subjects selfinterest seeming completely to blind their sense of right and i have often met with cases in which parties who were trespassers and in a moral view robbers ab origine have got really to fancy that their subsequent labors every new blow of the axe being an additional wrong gave a sort of sanctity to possessions in the defence of which they were willing to die it is scarcely necessary to say that such persons look only at themselves entirely disregarding the rights of others but one wonders where the fruits of all the religious instruction of the country are to be found when opinions so loose and acts so flagrant are constantly occurring among us the fact is land is so abundant and such vast bodies lie neglected and seemingly forgotten by their owners that the needy are apt to think indifference authorizes invasions on such unoccupied property and their own labor once applied they are quick to imagine that it gives them a moral and legal interest in the soil though in the eye of the law and of unbiased reason each new step taken in what is called the improvement of a betterment is but a farther advance in the direction of wrongdoing  i was reflecting on things of this sort when looking through the cracks of my prison to ascertain the state of matters without i was surprised by the appearance of a man on horseback who was entering the clearing on its eastern side seemingly quite at home in his course though he was travelling without a footpath to aid him as this man had a pair of the common saddlebags of the day on his horse i at first took him for one of those practitioners of the healing art who are constantly met with in the new settlements winding their way through stumps logs morasses and forests the ministers of good or evil i shall not pretend to say which ordinarily families like that of thousandacres do their own doctoring but a case might occur that demanded the wisdom of the licensed leech and i had just decided in my own mind that this must be one when as the stranger drew nearer to my surprise i saw that it was no other than my late agent mr jason newcome and the moral and physical factotum of ravensnest  as the distance between the mill that squire newcome leased of me and that which thousandacres had set up on the property of mooseridge could not be less than fiveandtwenty miles the arrival of this visitor at an hour so early was a certain proof that he had left his own house long before the dawn it was probably convenient to pass through the farms and dwellings of ravensnest on the errand on which he was now bent at an hour of the night or morning when darkness would conceal the movement by timing his departure with the same judgment it was obvious he could reach home under the concealment of the other end of the same mantle in a word this visit was evidently one in the objects and incidents of which it was intended that the world at large should have no share  the dialogues between the members of the family of thousandacres ceased the moment squire newcome came in view though as was apparent by the unmoved manner in which his approach was witnessed the sudden appearance of this particular visitor produced neither surprise nor uneasiness although it must have been a thing to be desired by the squatters to keep their location a secret more especially since the peace left landlords at leisure to look after their lands no one manifested any concern at discovering this arrival in their clearing of the nearest magistrate any one might see by the manner of men women and children that squire newcome was no stranger and that his presence gave them no alarm even the early hour of his visit was most probably that to which they were accustomed the quickwitted intellects of the young fry causing them to understand the reason quite as readily as was the case with their seniors in a word the guest was regarded as a friend rather than as an enemy  newcome was some little time after he came into view in reaching the hamlet if the cluster of buildings can be so termed and when he did alight it was before the door of a stable toward which one of the boys now scampered to be in readiness to receive his horse the beast disposed of the squire advanced to the spot where thousandacres and his elder sons still remained to receive him or that near the mill the manner in which all parties shook hands and the cordiality of the salutations generally in which prudence and her daughters soon shared betokened something more than amity i fancied for it looked very much like intimacy  jason newcome remained in the family group some eight or ten minutes and i could almost fancy the prescribed inquiries about the folks anglice folk the general state of health and the character of the times ere the magistrate and the squatter separated themselves from the rest of the party walking aside like men who had matters of moment to discuss and that under circumstances which could dispense with the presence of any listeners     chapter xix      peculiar both       our soils strong growth     and our bold natives hardy mind       sure heaven bespoke       our hearts and oak     to give a master to mankindyoung   thousandacres and the magistrate held their way directly toward the storehouse and the log of the sentinel offering a comfortable seat that functionary was dismissed when the two worthies took his place with their backs turned toward my prison whether this disposition of their persons was owing to a deeplaid plan of the squatters or not i never knew but let the cause have been what it might the effect was to render me an auditor of nearly all that passed in the dialogue which succeeded it will greatly aid the reader in understanding the incidents about to be recorded if i spread on the record the language that passed between my late agent and one who was obviously his confidant in certain matters if not in all that touched my interests in that quarter of the world as for listening i have no hesitation in avowing it inasmuch as the circumstances would have justified me in taking far greater liberties with the customary obligations of society in its everyday aspect had i seen fit so to do i was dealing with rogues who had me in their power and there was no obligation to be particularly scrupulous on the score of mere conventional propriety at least  as i was tellin ye thousandacres newcome continued the discourse by saying and that with the familiarity of one who well knew his companion the young man is in this part of the country and somewhere quite near you at this momenti was much nearer than the squire himself had any notion of at that instantyes hes out in the woods of this very property with chainbearer and his gang and for tinow for aught i know measuring out farms within a mile or two of this very spot  how many men be there asked the squatter with interest if no more than the usual set twill be an onlucky day for them should they stumble on my clearin  perhaps they will perhaps they wunt a body never knows surveyin s a sort o work that leads a man here or it leads him there one never knows where a line will carry him in the woods thats the reason ive kept the critturs out of my own timberland for to speak to you thousandacres as one neighbor can speak to another without risk theres desprate large pinetrees on the unleased hills both north and east of my lot sometimes its handy to have lines about a mill you know sometimes t isnt  a curse on all lines in a free country say i squire answered thousandacres who looked as he bestowed this characteristic benediction as if he might better be named tenthousandacres theyre an invention of the devil i lived seven whull years in varmount state as its now called the old hampshire grants you know nextdoor neighbor to two families one north and one south on me and we chopped away the whull time just as freely as we pleased and not a cross word or an angry look passed atween us  i rather conclude friend aaron you had all sat down under the same title put in the magistrate with a sly look at his companion when that is the case it would exceed all reason to quarrel  why ill own that our titles were pretty much the samepossession and free axes then it was agin york colony landholders that our time was running whats your candid opinion about law on this pint squire newcomei know youre a man of edication college larnt some say though i spose thats no better larnin than any other when a body has once got itbut whats your opinion about possessionwill it hold good for twentyone years without writins or not some say it will and some say it wunt  it wunt the law is settled there must be a shadow of title or possessions good for nothin no better than the scrapins of a flourbarrel  ive heern say the opposyte of that and theres reason why possession should count agin everything by possession however i dont mean hangin up a pair of saddlebags on a tree as is sometimes done but goin honestly and fairly in upon land and cuttin down trees and buildin mills and housen and barns and cuttin and slashin and sawin right and left like all creation thats what i always doos myself and thats what i call sich a possession as ought to stand in laway and in gospel too for im not one of them that flies in the face of religion  in that youre quite right keep the gospel on your side whatever you do neighbor thousandacres our puritan fathers didnt cross the ocean and encounter the horrors of the wilderness and step on the rock of plymouth and undergo more than man could possibly bear and that all for nothin  waal to my notion the horrors of the wilderness as you call em is no great matter though as for crossin the ocean i can easily imagine that must be suthin to try a mans patience and endurance i never could take to the water they tell me there isnt a single tree growin the whull distance atween ameriky and england floatin sawlogs be sometimes met with ive heern say but not a standin crittur of a tree from massachusetts bay to london town  its all water and of course trees be scarce thousandacres but lets come a little clusser to the pint as i was tellin you the whelp is in and hell growl as loud as the old bear himself should he hear of all them boards youve got in the creekto say nothin of the piles up here that you havent begun to put into the water  let him growl returned the old squatter glancing surlily toward my prison like a good many other critturs that ive met with twill turn out that his bark is worse than his bite  i dont know that neighbor thousandacres i dont by any means know that major littlepage is a gentleman of spirit and decision as is to be seen by his having taken his agency from me who have held it so long and gin it to a young chap who has no other claim than bein a tolerable surveyor but who hasnt been in the settlement more than a twelvemonth  gin it to a surveyer is he one of chainbearers measurin devils  just so tis the very young fellow chainbearer has had with him this year or so runnin lines an measurin land on this very property  that old fellow chainbearer had best look to himself hes thwarted me now three times in the course of his life and hes gettin to be desprate old im afeard he wont live long  i could now see that squire newcome felt uneasy although a colleague of the squatters in what is only too apt to be considered a venal roguery in a new country or in the stealing of timber it did not at all comport with the scale of his rascality to menace a mans life he would connive at stealing timber by purchasing the lumber at sufficiently low prices so long as the danger of being detected was kept within reasonable limits but he did not like to be connected with any transaction that did not in the case of necessity admit of a tolerably safe retreat from all pains and penalties men become very much whatnot their lawsbut what the administration of their laws makes them in countries in which it is prompt sure and sufficiently severe crimes are mainly the fruits of temptation and necessity but a state of society may exist in which justice falls into contempt by her own impotency and men are led to offend merely to brave her thus we have long labored under the great disadvantage of living under laws that in a great degree were framed for another set of circumstances by the common law it was only trespass to cut down a tree in england for trees were seldom or never stolen and the law did not wish to annex the penalties of felony to the simple offence of cutting a twig in a wood with us however entire new classes of offences have sprung up under our own novel circumstances and we probably owe a portion of the vast amount of timberstealing that has now long existed among us quite as much to the mistaken lenity of the laws as to the fact that this particular description of property is so much exposed many a man would commit a trespass of the gravest sort who would shrink from the commission of a felony of the lowest such was the case with newcome he had a certain sort of lawhonesty about him that enabled him in a degree to preserve appearances it is true he connived at the unlawful cutting of timber by purchasing the sawed lumber but he took good care at the same time not to have any such direct connection with the strictly illegal part of the transaction as to involve him in the penalties of the law had timberstealing been felony he would have often been an accessory before the act but in a case of misdemeanor the law knows no such offence purchasing the sawed lumber too if done with proper precaution owing to the glorious subterfuges permitted by the perfection of reason was an affair of no personal hazard in a criminal point of view and even admitted of so many expedients as to leave the question of property a very open one after the boards were fully in his own possession the object of his present visit to the clearing of thousandacres as the reader will most probably have anticipated was to profit by my supposed proximity and to frighten the squatter into a sale on such terms as should leave larger profits than common in the hands of the purchaser unfortunately for the success of this upright project my proximity was so much greater than even squire newcome supposed as to put it in danger by the very excess of the thing that was to produce the result desired little did the honest magistrate suppose that i was the whole time within twenty feet of him and that i heard all that passed  chainbearer is about seventy returned newcome after musing a moment on the character of his companions last remark yes about seventy i should judge from what ive heerd and what i know of the man its a good old age but folks often live years and years beyond it you must be suthin like that yourself thousandacres  seventythree every day and hour ont squire and days and hours well drawn out too if you count by old style i blieve im a month or so older but im not chainbearer no man can say of me that i ever made myself troublesome to a neighborhood no man can pint to the time when i ever disturbed his lines no man can tell of the day when i ever went into court to be a witness on such a small matter as the length or breadth of lots to breed quarrels atween neighbors no squire newcome i set store by my character which will bear comparison with that of any other inhabitant of the woods i ever met with and what i say of myself i can say of my sons and daghters toofrom tobit down to sampson from nab to jeruthy were what i call a reasonable and reconcilable breed minding our own business and having a respect for that of other people now here am i in my seventyfourth year and the father of twelve living children and ive made in my time many and many a pitch ont but never was i known to pitch on land that another man had in possessionand i carry my idees of possession farther than most folks too for i call it possession to have said openly and afore witnesses that a man intends to pitch on any particlar spot afore next ploughin or droppin time as the case may be no i respect possession which ought to be the only lawful title to property in a free country when a man wants a clearin or wants to make one my doctrine is let him look about him and make his pitch on calcerlation and when hes tired of the spot and wants a change let him sell his betterments if he lights of a chap and if he doosnt let him leave em open and clear off all incumbrances for the next comer  it is probable that jason newcome esqmagistrates in america are extremely tenacious of this title though they have no more right to it than any one elsebut jason newcome esq16 did not carry his notions of the rights of squatters and of the sacred character of possession quite as far as did his friend thousandacres newcome was an exceedingly selfish but withal an exceedingly shrewd man i do not know that the term clever in its broadest signification would fitly apply to him for in that sense i conceive it means quickness and intelligence enough to do what is right but he was fully entitled to receive it under that qualification by which we say a man is a clever rogue in a word mr newcome understood himself and his relations to the community in which he lived too well to fall into very serious mistakes by a direct dereliction from his duties though he lived in a neverceasing condition of small divergencies that might at any time lead him into serious difficulties nevertheless it was easy enough to see he had no relish for thousandacres allusions to the termination of the days of my excellent old friend chainbearer nor can i say that they gave me any particular concern for while i knew how desperate the squatters sometimes became i had a notion that this old fellows bark would prove worse than his bite as he had just observed of myself  footnote 16 in order to understand mr littlepage in what he says of esquires a word of explanation may be necessary the term esquire is as every wellinformed person knows a title of honor standing next in degree below that of knight on the continent of europe the écuyer properly infers nobility i believe as nobility is there considered which is little if any more than the condition of the old english gentry or of the families having coatarmor by the english law certain persons are born esquires and others have the rank ex officio among the last is a justice of the peace who is legally an esquire during his official term now this rule prevailed in the colonies and american magistrates were perhaps legally esquires as well as the english but titles of honor were abolished at the revolution and it is a singular contradiction in substance to hold that the principle is destroyed while the incident remains the rank of esquire can no more legally exist in america than that of knight in one sense neither is noble it is true but in that broad signification by which all constitutions are or ought to be interpreted both would come within the proscribed category as set forth in art 7th sect 9th and art 1st sect 10th const u s nevertheless so much stronger is custom than positive law that not only every magistrate but every lawyer in the country fancies himself peculiarly an esquire it is scarcely necessary to add that by usage the appellation is given by courtesy wherever the english language is spoken to all who are supposed to belong to the class of gentlemen this after all is the only true american use of the wordeditor  it would hardly repay the trouble were i to attempt recording all that passed next between our two colloquists although it was a sufficiently amusing exhibition of wily management to frighten the squatter to part with his lumber at a low price on one side and of sullen security on the other the security proceeded from the fact that thousandacres had me at that very moment a prisoner in his storehouse  a bargain conducted on such terms was not likely soon to come to a happy termination after a great deal of chaffering and discussing the conference broke up nothing having been decided by the magistrates saying  well thousandacres i hope youll have no reason to repent but i kind o fear you will  the loss will be mine and the bys if i do was the squatters answer i know i can get all the boards into the creek and for that matter into the river afore young littlepage can do me any harm though there is one circumstance that may yet turn my mind  here the squatter came to a pause and newcome who had risen turned short round eagerly to press the doubt that he saw was working in the others mind  i thought you would think better of it he said for its out of doubt should major littlepage larn your pitch that hed uproot you as the winds uproot the fallin tree  no squire my minds made up thousandacres coolly rejoined ill sell and gladly but not on the tarms you have named two pounds eight the thousand foot board measure and taking it all round clear stuff and refuse without any storepay will carry off the lumber  too much thousandacres altogether too much when you consider the risks i run im not sartain that i could hold the lumber even after i got it into the river for a replevy is a formidable thing in law i can tell you one pound sixteen onethird storepay is the utmost farthin i can offer  in that day all our calculations were in pounds shillings and pence  then the bargains offi spose squire youve the old avarsion to being seen in my settlement  sartainsartain answered newcome in haste theres no danger of that i hope you cannot well have strangers among you  i wunt answer for that i see some of the bys coming out of the woods yonder and it seems to me there is a fourth man with them there is of a certainty and it is no other than susquesus the onondago the fellow is clussmouthed like most redskins but you can say best whether youd like to be seen by him or not i hear hes a great frind of chainbearers  it was very evident that the magistrate decided at once in the negative with a good deal of decent haste he dodged round a pile of logs and i saw no more of him until i caught a distant view of his person in the skirts of the woods at the point whence he had issued into the clearing two hours before and where he now received his horse from the hands of the youngest of thousandacres sons who led the animal to the spot for his especial accommodation mr newcome was no sooner in possession of his beast again than he mounted and rode away into the depths of the forest so adroitly was this retreat conducted that no person of ordinary observation could possibly have detected it unless indeed his attention had been previously drawn to the movement  what passed at parting between thousandacres and his visitor i never knew but they must have been altogether alone for a few minutes when the former reappeared he came out from behind the logs his whole attention seemingly fastened on the approaching party composed of his sons and susquesus those resolute and practised men had indeed overtaken and captured the onondago and were now bringing him a prisoner unarmed in their midst to receive the commands of their father notwithstanding all that i knew of this man and of his character there was something imposing in the manner in which he now waited for the arrival of his sons and their prisoner accustomed to exercise an almost absolute sway in his own family the old man had acquired some of the dignity of authority and as for his posterity old and young male and female not excepting prudence they had gained very little in the way of freedom by throwing aside the trammels of regular and recognized law to live under the rule of their patriarch in this respect they might be likened to the masses who in a blind pursuit of liberty impatiently cast away the legal and healthful restraints of society to submit to the arbitrary selfish and ever unjust dictation of demagogues whatever difference there might be between the two governments was in favor of that of the squatter who possessed the feelings of nature in behalf of his own flesh and blood and was consequently often indulgent  it is so difficult to read an indians mind in his manner that i did not expect to ascertain the state of the onondagos feelings by the countenance he wore on drawing near in exterior this man was as calm and unmoved as if just arrived on a friendly visit his captors had bound him fearful he might elude them in some of the thickets they had been compelled to pass but the thongs seemed to give him neither mental nor bodily concern old thousandacres was stern in aspect but he had too much experience in indian characterknew too well the unforgiving nature of the indians dispositions or the enduring memories that forgot neither favors nor injuries to wantonly increase the feeling that must naturally have been awakened between him and his prisoner  trackless he said considerately youre an old warrior and must know that in troubled times every man must look out for himself im glad the bys warnt driven to do you any harm but it would never have done to let you carry the tidings of what has happened here this morning to chainbearer and his gang how long i may have to keep you is more than i know myself but your treatment shall be good and your wilcome warm so long as you give no trouble i know what a redskins word is and maybe ater thinkin on it a little i may let you out to wander about the clearin provided youd give your parole not to go off ill think ont and let you know tomorrow but today i must put you in the storeus along with the young chap that you travelled here with  thousandacres then demanded of his sons an account of the manner in which they had taken their captive which it is unnecessary to relate here as i shall have occasion to give it directly in the language of the indian himself as soon as satisfied on this head the door of my prison was opened and the onondago entered it unbound without manifesting the smallest shade of regret or any resistance everything was done in a very lockup sort of manner the new prisoner being no sooner permitted than the door was secured and i was left alone with sureflint one of the younger girls now remaining near the building as a sentinel i waited a moment to make certain we were alone when i opened the communications with my friend  i am very sorry for this sureflint i commenced for i had hopes your knowledge of the woods and practice on trails would have enabled you to throw off your pursuers that you might have carried the news of my imprisonment to our friends this is a sore disappointment to me having made sure you would let chainbearer know where i am  wy tink different now eh spose cause injin prisoner cant help himself  you surely do not mean that you are here with your own consent  sartain spose no want to come am no come you tink thousandacres bys catch susquesus in woods and he dont want to be sure winter come and summer come be sure gray hair come a little be sure trackless get ole bymbye but he moccason leave no trail yet  as i cannot understand why you should first escape and then wish to come back i must beg you to explain yourself let me know all that has passed sureflinthow it has passed and why it has passed tell it in your own way but tell it fully  sartainwhy no tell no harm all goodsometing capital nebber hab better luck  you excite my curiosity sureflint tell the whole story at once beginning at the time when you slipped off and carrying it down to the moment of your arrival here  hereupon susquesus turned on me a significant look drew his pipe from his belt filled and lighted it and began to smoke with a composure that was not easily disturbed as soon as assured that his pipe was in a proper state however the indian quietly began his story  now listen you hear he said run away cause no good to stay here and be prisonerdat why  but you are a prisoner as it is as well as myself and by your statement a prisoner with your own consent  sartainnebber hab been prisoner wont be prisoner if dont want to spose shot den cant help him but in woods injin nebber prisoner less lazy or drunk rum make great many prisoner  i can believe all thisbut tell me the story why did you go off at first  spose dont want chainbearer know where he be eh tink tousandacre ebber let you go while board in stream when board go he go not afore stay all summer want to live in storeus all summer eh  certainly notwell you left me in order to let our friends know where i was that they might cast about for the means of getting me free all this i understand what next  next go off in wood easy nough to slip off when tousandacre no look well went about two mile leave no trailbird make as much in air what spose meet eh  i wait for you to tell me  meet jaapyesmeet nigger look for young masterebberybody in trouble and woner where young chief be some look heresome look out yonderall look somewherejaap look just dere  and you told jaap the whole story and sent him back to the huts with it  sartainjust so make good guess dat time den tink what do next want to come back and help young paleface frien so tought get take prisoner one time like to know how he feel to be prisoner one time no feel so bad as spose squatter no hard master for prisoner  but how did all this happen and in what manner have you misled the young men  no hard to do at all all he want is know how ater jaap get his arnd and go off made trail plain nough for squaw to find travel to a springsit down and put rifle away off so no need shoot and let him squatters boys catch me by what you call sprise yes e palefaces sprise red man dat time warrant he brag ont well  here then was the simple explanation of it all susquesus had stolen away in order to apprise my friends of my situation he had fallen in with jaap or jaaf in search of his lost master and communicating all the circumstances to the negro had artfully allowed himself to be recaptured carefully avoiding a struggle and had been brought back and placed by my side no explanations were necessary to point out the advantages by communicating with the negro who had been familiar for years with the clipped manner of the indians mode of speaking english everything would be made known to chainbearer by suffering himself to be taken the squatters were led by sureflint to suppose our capture and their pitch remained secrets while by rejoining me i should have the presence counsel and assistance of a most tried friend of my fathers and chainbearers in the event of necessity  this brief summary of his reasoning shows the admirable sagacity of the onondago who had kept in view every requisite of his situation and failed in nothing  i was delighted with the address of sureflint as well as touched by his fidelity in the course of our conversation he gave me to understand that my disappearance and absence for an entire night had produced great consternation in the huts and that everybody was out in quest of me and himself at the time when he so opportunely fell in with jaap  gal out tooadded the onondago significantly spose good reason for dat  this startled me a little for i had a vague suspicion that susquesus must have been an unseen observer of my interview with ursula malbone and noticing my manner on rushing from her cabin had been induced to follow me as has been related the reader is not to suppose that my late adventures had driven dus from my mind so far from this i thought of her incessantly and the knowledge that she took so much interest in me as to roam the woods in the search had no tendency to lessen the steadiness or intensity of my reflections nevertheless common humanity might induce one of her energy and activity to do as much as this and had i not her own declaration that she was plighted to another  after getting his whole story i consulted the indian on the subject of our future proceedings he was of opinion that we had better wait the movements of our friends from whom we must hear in some mode or other in the course of the approaching night or of the succeeding day what course chainbearer might see fit to pursue neither of us could conjecture though both felt assured he never would remain quiet with two as fast friends as ourselves in durance my great concern was that he might resort at once to force for old andries had a fiery spirit though one that was eminently just and he had been accustomed to see gunpowder burned from his youth upward should he on the other hand resort to legal means and apply to mr newcome for warrants to arrest my captors as men guilty of illegal personal violence a course it struck me frank malbone would be very apt to advise what might i not expect from the collusion of the magistrate in the way of frauds delays and private machinations in such a case there would be time to send me to some other place of concealment and the forest must have a hundred such that were accessible to my new masters while their friend newcome would scarcely fail to let them have timely notice of the necessity of some such step men acting in conformity with the rules of right fulfilling the requirements of the law and practising virtue might be so remiss as not to send information of such an impending danger for such persons are only too apt to rely on the integrity of their own characters and to put their trust on the laws of providence but rogues certain that they can have no such succor depend mainly on themselves recognizing the wellknown principle of frederick the great who thought it a safe rule to suppose that providence was usually on the side of strong battalions i felt certain therefore that squire newcome would let his friends at the clearing know all that was plotting against them as soon as he knew it himself  the squatters were not unkind to us prisoners in the way of general treatment certainly i had every right to complain of the particular wrong they did me but otherwise they were sufficiently considerate and liberal throughout that day our fare was their own we had water brought in fresh by lowiny no fewer than five several times and so attentive to my supposed wants was this girl that she actually brought me every book that was to be found in all the libraries of the family these were but threea fragment of a bible pilgrims progress and an almanac that was four years old     chapter xx            i markd his desultory pace           his gestures strange and varying face           with many a muttered sound           and ah too late aghast i viewd           the reeking blade the hand imbrud     he fell and groaning graspd in agony the ground                                                   warton   in this manner passed that long and weary day i could and did take exercise by walking to and fro in my prison but the indian seldom stirred from the moment he entered as for the squatter himself he came no more near the storehouse though i saw him two or three times in the course of the day in private conference with his elder sons most probably consulting on my case at such moments their manner was serious and there were instants when i fancied it menacing  provision was made for our comfort by throwing a sufficient number of bundles of straw into the prison and my fellowcaptive and myself had each a sufficiently comfortable bed a soldier was not to be frightened at sleeping on straw moreover and as for susquesus he asked for no more than room to stretch himself though it were even on a rock an indian loves his ease and takes it when it comes in his way but it is really amazing to what an extent his powers of endurance go when it becomes necessary for him to exert them  in the early part of the night i slept profoundly as i believe did the indian i must acknowledge that an uncomfortable distrust existed in my mind that had some slight effect in keeping me from slumbering though fatigue soon overcame the apprehensions such a feeling would be likely to awaken i did not know but thousandacres and his sons might take it into their heads to make away with the indian and myself under cover of the darkness as the most effectual means of protecting themselves against the consequences of their past depredations and of securing the possession of those that they had projected for the future we were completely in their power and so far as the squatter knew the secret of our visit would die with us the knowledge of those of his own flesh and blood possessed on the subject excepted notwithstanding these thoughts crossed my mind and did give me some little uneasiness they were not sufficiently active or sufficiently prominent to prevent me from slumbering after i had fairly fallen asleep without awaking once until it was three oclock or within an hour of the approach of day  i am not certain that any external cause aroused me from my slumbers but i well remember that i lay there on my straw meditating for some time half asleep and half awake until i fancied i heard the musical voice of dus murmuring in my ear my own name this illusion lasted some little time when as my faculties gradually resumed their powers i became slowly convinced that some one was actually calling me and by name too within a foot or two of my ears i could not be mistaken the fact was so and the call was in a womans tones springing up i demanded  who is here in the name of heaven can this really be miss malbonedus  my name is lowiny answered my visitor and im thousandacres daghter but dont speak so loud for there is one of the bys on the watch at the other end of the storeus and youll wake him up unless youre careful  lowiny is it you my good girl not content to care for us throughout the day you still have a thought for us during the night  i thought the girl felt embarrassed for she must have been conscious of having a little trespassed on the usages and reserve of her sex it is rare indeed that any mother and especially an american mother ever falls so low as completely to become unsexed in feelings and character and rarer still that she forgets to impart many of the decencies of woman to her daughter old prudence notwithstanding the life she led and the many causes of corruption and backslidings that existed around her was true to her native instincts and had taught to her girls many of those little proprieties that become so great charms in woman  lowiny was far from disagreeable in person and had the advantage of being youthful in appearance as well as in fact in addition to these marks of her sex she had manifested an interest in my fate from the first that had not escaped me and here she was now doubtless on some errand of which the object was our good my remark embarrassed her however and a few moments passed before she got entirely over the feeling as soon as she did she again spoke  i dont think anything of bringing you and the injin a little water she saidlaying an emphasis on the words i have put in italicsnor should i had we any beer or sapcider instead but all our spruce is out and father said he wouldnt have any more of the cider made seein that we want all the sap for sugar i hope you had a plentiful supply mr littlepage and for fear you hadnt ive brought you and the redskin a pitcher of milk and a bowl of hastypuddinghe can eat ater youve done you know  i thanked my kindhearted friend and received her gift through a hole that she pointed out to me the food in the end proved very acceptable as subsequent circumstances caused our regular breakfast to be forgotten for a time i was desirous of ascertaining from this girl what was said or contemplated among her relatives on the subject of my future fate but felt a nearly unconquerable dislike to be prying into what was a species of family secrets by putting direct questions to her fortunately the communicative and friendly disposition of lowiny herself soon removed all necessity for any such step for after executing her main purpose she lingered with an evident wish to gossip  i wish father wouldnt be a squatter any longer the girl said with an earnestness that proved she was uttering her real sentiment its awful to be forever fighting agin law  it would be far better if he would apply to some landowner and get a farm on lease or by purchase land is so plenty in this country no man need go without a legal interest in his hundred acres provided he be only sober and industrious  father never drinks unless its on the fourth of july and the bys be all pretty sober too as young men go nowadays i believe mr littlepage if mother has told father once she has told him a thousand times that she doos wish hed leave off squatting and take writins for some piece of land or other but father says nohe warnt made for writins nor writins for him hes despately troubled to know what to do with you now hes got you  did mr newcome give no opinion on the subject while he was with you  squire newcome father never let on to him a syllable about ever having seen you he knows too much to put himself in squire newcomes power sin his lumber would go all the cheaper for it whats your opinion mr littlepage about our right to the boards when weve cut and hauled and sawed the logs with our own hands don that make some difference  what is your opinion of your right to a gown that another girl has made out of calico she had taken from your drawer when your back was turned and carried away and cut and stitched and sewed with her own hands  she never would have any right to my calico let her cut it as much as she might but lumber is made out of trees  and trees have owners just as much as calico hauling and cutting and sawing can of themselves give no man a right to another mans logs  i was afeard it was so answered lowiny sighing so loud as to be heard theres suthin in that old bible i lent you that i read pretty much in that way though tobit and most of the bys say that it dont mean any sich thing they say theres nothin about lumber in the bible at all  and what does your mother tell you on this head  why mother dont talk about it she wants father to lease or buy but you know how it is with women mr littlepage when their frnds act its all the same as a law to them to try to think that they act right mother never says anything to us about the lawfulness of fathers doins though she often wishes he would live under writins mother wants father to try and get writins of you now youre here and in his hands wouldnt you give us writins mr littlepage if wed promise to give you suthin for rent  if i did they would be good for nothing unless i were free and among friends deeds and leases got from men who are in the hands as you call it of those who take them are of no value  im sorry for that rejoined lowiny with another sighnot that i wanted you to be driven into anything but i thought if you would only consent to let father have writins for this clearin its so good a time to do it now twould be a pity to lose it if it cant be done however it cant and theres no use in complaining father thinks he can hold you till the water rises in the fall and the bys have run all the lumber down to albany ater which hell not be so particlar about keepin you any longer and maybe hell let you go  hold me until the water rises why that will not take place these three months  well mr littlepage three months dont seem to me sich a desprate long time when a body is among frinds we should treat you as well as we know how that you may depend onill answer for it you shall want for nothin that weve got to give  i dare say my excellent girl but i should be extremely sorry to trouble your family with so long a visit as for the boards i have no power to waive the rights of the owners of the land to that property my power being merely to sell lots to actual settlers  im sorry to hear that answered lowiny in a gentle tone that fully confirmed her words for father and the bys be really awful about anything that touches their profits for work done they say their flesh and bloods in them boards and flesh and blood shall go afore the boards shall go it makes my blood run cold to hear the way they do talk im not a bit skeary and last winter when i shot the bear that was ater the storehogs mother said i acted as well as she could have done herself and she has killed four bears and near upon twenty wolves in her time yes mother said i behaved like her own daghter and that she set twice the store by me that she did before  you are a brave girl lowiny and an excellent one in the main i make no question whatever become of me i shall not forget your kindness as long as i live it will be a very serious matter however to your friends to attempt keeping me here three or four months as mine will certainly have a search for me when this clearing would be found i need not tell you what would be the consequence  what canwhat will father and the bys do i cant bear to think ontoh theyll not have the hearts to try to put you out of the way  i should hope not for their own sakes and for the credit of the american name we are not a nation addicted to such practices and i should really regret to learn that we have made so long a step toward the crimes of older countries but there is little danger of anything of the sort after all my good lowiny  i hope so too the girl answered in a low tremulous voice though tobit is a starn bein sometimes he makes father worse than he would be if let alone i know but i must go now its near daylight and i hear em stirring in tobits house it would cost me dear did any on em know i had been out of my bed talking to you  as this was said the girl vanished before i could find an aperture to watch her movements she had disappeared susquesus arose a few minutes later but he never made any allusion to the secret visit of the girl in this respect he observed the most scrupulous delicacy never letting me know by hint look or smile that he had been in the least conscious of her presence  day came as usual but it did not find these squatters in their beds they appeared with the dawn and most of them were at work ere the broad light of the sun was shed on the forest most of the men went down into the river and busied themselves as we supposed for we could not see them in the water with the apples of their eyes their boards old thousandacres however chose to remain near his habitation keeping two or three wellgrown lads about him probably adverting in his mind to the vast importance it was to all of his race to make sure of his prisoners i could see by the thoughtful manner of the old squatter as he lounged around his mill among his swine and walked through his potatoes that his mind wavered greatly as to the course he ought to pursue and that he was sorely troubled how long this perplexity of feeling would have continued and to what it might have led it is hard to say had it not been cut short by an incident of a very unexpected nature and one that called for more immediate decision and action i shall relate the occurrence a little in detail  the day was considerably advanced and thousandacres and the girl who then watched the storehouse excepted everybody was occupied even susquesus had picked up a piece of birch and with a melancholy countenance that i fancied was shadowing forth the future life of a halfcivilized red man was attempting to make a broom with a part of a knife that he had found in the building while i was sketching on a leaf of my pocketbook the mill and a bit of mountain land that served it for a background thousandacres for the first time that morning drew near our prison and spoke to me his countenance was severe yet i could see he was much troubled as i afterward ascertained tobit had been urging on him the necessity of putting both myself and the indian to death as the only probable means that offered to save the lumber  young man said thousandacres you have stolen on me and mine like a thief at night and you ought to expect the fate of one how in natur can you expect men will give up their hard arnins without a struggle and a fight for em you tempt me more than i can bear  i felt the fearful import of these words but human nature revolted at the thought of being cowed into any submission or terms unworthy of my character or late profession i was on the point of making an answer in entire consonance with this feeling when in looking through the chinks of my prison to fasten an eye on my old tyrant i saw chainbearer advancing directly toward the storehouse and already within a hundred yards of us the manner in which i gazed at this apparition attracted the attention of the squatter who turned and first saw the unexpected visitor who approached at the next minute andries was at his side  so tousandacres i fint you here exclaimed chainbearer its a goot many years since you and i met and im sorry we meet now on such pisiness as tis  the meetins of your own seekin chainbearer ive neither invited nor wished for your company  i plieve you wit all my heart no no you wish for no chains and no chainpearers no surfeyors and no compasses no lots and no owners too put a squatter you and i haf not to make an acquaintance for te first time tousandacres after knowin each other for fifty years

wrong  i saw the cloud gathering in the countenance of the squatter and anticipated the outbreaking of the tempest that followed two fiery tempers had met and divided as they were in opinions and practice by the vast chasm that separates principles from expediency right from wrong honesty from dishonesty and a generous sacrifice of self to support the integrity of a noble spirit from a homage to self that confounded and overshadowed all sense of right it was not possible that they should separate without a collision unable to answer chainbearers reasoning the squatter resorted to the argument of force he seized my old friend by the throat and made a violent effort to hurl him to the earth i must do this man of violence and evil the justice to say that i do not think it was his wish at that moment to have any assistance but the instant the struggle commenced the conch blew and it was easy to predict that many minutes would not elapse before the sons of thousandacres would be pouring in to the rescue i would have given a world to be able to throw down the walls of my prison and rush to the aid of my sterling old friend as for susquesus he must have felt a lively interest in what was going on but he remained as immovable and seemingly as unmoved as a rock  andries coejemans old as he was and it will be remembered he too had seen his threescore years and ten was not a man to be taken by the throat with impunity thousandacres met with a similar assault and a struggle followed that was surprisingly fierce and well contested considering that both the combatants had completed the ordinary limits of the time of man the squatter gained a slight advantage in the suddenness and vigor of his assault but chainbearer was still a man of formidable physical power in his prime few had been his equals and thousandacres soon had reason to know that he had met more than his match for a single instant chainbearer gave ground then he rallied made a desperate effort and his adversary was hurled to the earth with a violence that rendered him for a short time insensible old andries himself continuing erect as one of the neighboring pines red in the face frowning and more severe in aspect than i remembered ever to have seen him before even in battle  instead of pushing his advantage chainbearer did not stir a foot after he had thrown off his assailant there he remained lofty in bearing proud and stern he had reason to believe no one was a witness of his prowess but i could see that the old man had a soldiers feelings at his victory at this instant i first let him know my close proximity by speaking  flyfor your life take to the woods chainbearer i called to him through the clinks that conch will bring all the tribe of the squatters upon you in two or three minutes the young men are close at hand in the stream below the mill at work on the logs and have only the banks to climb  got be praiset mortaunt my tear poy you are not injuret ten i will open te toor of your prison and we will retreat togeter  my remonstrances were vain andries came round to the door of the storehouse and made an effort to force it open that was not easy however for opening outward it was barred with iron and secured by a stout lock chainbearer would not listen to my remonstrances but he looked around him for some instrument by means of which he could either break the lock or draw the staple as the mill was at no great distance away he went in that direction in quest of what he wanted leaving me in despair at his persevering friendship remonstrance was useless however and i was compelled to await the result in silence  chainbearer was still a very active man nature early training sobriety of life in the main and a good constitution had done this much for him it was but a moment before i saw him in the mill looking for the crowbar this he soon found and he was on his way to the storehouse in order to apply this powerful lever when tobit came in sight followed by all the brethren rushing up the bank like a pack of hounds in close pursuit i shouted to my friend again to fly but he came on steadily toward my prison bent on the single object of setting me free all this time thousandacres was senseless his head having fallen against a corner of the building chainbearer was so intent on his purpose that though he must have seen the crowd of young men no less than six in number including wellgrown lads that was swiftly advancing toward him he did not bestow the least attention on them he was actually busied with endeavoring to force the bar in between the hasp and the post when his arms were seized behind and he was made a prisoner  chainbearer was no sooner apprised of the uselessness of resistance than he ceased to make any as i afterward learned from himself he had determined to become a captive with me if he could not succeed in setting me free tobit was the first to lay hands on the chainbearer and so rapidly were things conducted for this man had the key that the door was unbarred opened and old andries was thrust into the cage almost in the twinkling of an eye the rapidity of the movement was doubtless aided by the acquiescent feeling that happened to be uppermost in the mind of chainbearer at that precise moment  no sooner was this new prisoner secured than the sons of thousandacres raised their fathers body and bore it to his own residence which was but a few yards distant old and young both sexes and all ages collected in that building and there was an hour during which we appeared to be forgotten the sentinel who was a son of tobits deserted his post and even lowiny who had been hovering in sight of the storehouse the whole morning seemed to have lost her interest in us i was too much engaged with my old friend and had too many questions to ask and to answer however to care much for this desertion which moreover was natural enough for the circumstances  i rejoice you are not in the hands of that pack of wolves my good friend i exclaimed after the first salutations had passed between andries and myself and squeezing his hand again and again they are very capable of any act of violence and i feared the sight of their father lying there insensible might have inflamed them to some deed of immediate violence there will now be time for reflection and fortunately i am a witness of all that passed  no fear for olt thousandacres said chainbearer heartily he is tough and he is only a little stunnet pecause he tought himself a petter man tan he ist half an hour will pring him rount and make him as good a man ast he ever wast but mortaunt lat how came you here and why wast you wantering apout te woods at night wit trackless here who ist a sensiple retskin and ought to haf set you a petter example  i was hot and feverish and could not sleep and so i took a stroll in the forest and got lost luckily susquesus had an eye on me and kept himself at hand the whole time i was obliged to catch a nap in the top of a fallen tree and when i woke in the morning the onondago led me here in quest of something to eat for i was hungry as a famished wolf  tid susquesus ten know of squatters having mate teir pitch on tis property asked andries in some surprise and as i thought a little sternly  not he he heard the saw of the mill in the stillness of night and we followed the direction of that sound and came unexpectedly out on this settlement as soon as thousandacres ascertained who i was he shut me up here and as for susquesus jaap has doubtless told you the story he was commissioned to relate  all fery true lat all fery true tough i dont half understant yet why you shoult haf left us in te manner you tit and tat too after hafin a long talk wit dus te gal is heartheafy mortaunt as tis plain to pe seen put i cant get a syllaple from her tat hast te look of a rational explanation i shall haf to ask you to tell te story lat i was tryin to get te trut out of dus half of te way comin here put a gal is as close as  dus i interruptedhalf the way coming here you do not cannot mean that dus is with you  hist histpe careful you speak too lout i coult wish not to let tese scountrels of squatters know tat te gal is so exposet put here she ist or what is much te same she is in te woots out yonter a lookeron and i fear must pe in consarn at seein tat i too am a prisoner  chainbearer how could you thus expose your niecethus bring her into the very grasp of lawless ruffians  no mortaunt notere is no fear of her peing insultet or anyting of tat sort one can reat of such tings in pooks put woman is respectet and not insultet in america not one of tousantacres rascals woult wount te ear of te gal wit an improper wort hat he a chance which not one of em hast seein nopody knows te gal is wit me put ourselves come she woult and tere wast no use in saying her nay dus is a goot creature mortaunt and a tutiful gal put its as easy to turn a rifer up stream as to try to holt her pack when she loves  is that her character i thought then is there little chance indeed of her ever becoming mine since her affections must have gone with her troth nevertheless my interest in the noblehearted girl was just as strong as if i held her faith and she was to become mine in a few weeks the idea that she was at that moment waiting the return of her uncle in the woods was agony to me but i had sufficient selfcommand to question the chainbearer until i got out of him all of the following facts  jaap had carried the message of susquesus with great fidelity to those to whom the indian had sent it on hearing the news and the manner of my arrest andries called a council consisting of himself dus and frank malbone this occurred in the afternoon of the previous day and that same night malbone proceeded to ravensnest with a view of obtaining warrants for the arrest of thousandacres and his gang as well as of procuring assistance to bring them all in in expectation of having the whole party transferred to the gaol at sandy hill as the warrant could be granted only by mr newcome i could easily see that the messenger would be detained a considerable time since the magistrate would require a large portion of the present day to enable him to reach his house this fact however i thought it well enough to conceal from my friend at the moment  early that morning chainbearer dus and jaap had left the huts taking the nearest route to the supposed position of the clearing of thousandacres as it had been described by the indian aided by a compass as well as by their long familiarity with the woods this party had little difficulty in reaching the spot where the onondago and the negro had met after which the remainder of the journey was through a terra incognita as respects the adventurers with some search however a glimpse was got of the light of the clearing much as one finds an island in the ocean when the skirts of the wood were approached a favorable spot one that possessed a good cover was selected whence chainbearer reconnoitred for near an hour before he left it after a time he determined on the course he adopted and carried out leaving his niece to watch his movements with instructions to rejoin her brother should he himself be detained by the squatter i was a little relieved by the knowledge of the presence of jaap for i knew the fidelity of the fellow too well to suppose he would ever desert dus but my prison became twice as irksome to me after i had heard this account of the chainbearers as it had been before     chapter xxi      was she not all my fondest wish could frame     did ever mind so much of heaven partake     did she not love me with the purest flame     and give up friends and fortune for my sake         though mild as evening skies         with downcast streaming eyes     stood the stern frown of supercilious brows     deaf to their brutal threats and faithful to her vows                                                           shaw   dus was then near mein sight of the storehouse perhaps but affection for her uncle and no interest in me had brought her there i could respect her attachment to her old guardian however and admire the decision and spirit she had manifested in his behalf at the very moment the consciousness that i had no influence on her movements was the most profound  te gal woult come mortaunt the chainbearer continued after having gone through his narrative ant if you know dus you know when she loves she wilt not be deniet got pless me what a wife she woult make for a man who wast desarfin of her oh heres a pit of a note te dear creature has written to one of tousandacres poys who hast peen out among us often tough i never so much as dreamet tat te squatting olt rascal of a fater was on our lant here well zepaniah as te lat is callet hast passet much time at te nest working apout in te fielts and sometimes for us and to own the trut to you mortaunt i do pelieve te young chap hast a hankerin ater dus and woult pe glat enough to get te gal for a wife  he zephaniah thousandacresor whatever his infernal name may behe a hankering or an attachment for ursula malbonehe think of her for a wifehe presume to love such a perfect being  hoity toity cried old andries looking round at me in surprise why shouldnt te poy haf his feelins ast well ast anoter if he pe a squatter squatters haf feelins tough tey hafnt much honesty to poast of ant ast for honesty you see mortaunt it is tifferent petween tousantacres and his poys te lats haf peen prought up to fancy tere ist no great harm in lifing on anoter mans lants whereast tis olt rascal teir fater wast prought up or tinks he wast prought up in te very sanctum sanctorum of gotliness among te puritans and tat te art hast not teir equals in religion ill warrant you ask olt aaron apout his soul and hell tell you tat its a petter soul tan a dutch soul and tat it wont purn at all its so free from eart yes yestat ist te itee wit em all in his part of te worlt teir gotliness ist so pure even sin wilt do it no great harm  i knew the provincial prejudices of chainbearer too well to permit myself to fall into a discussion on theology with him just at that moment though i must do the old man the justice to allow that his opinion of the selfrighteousness of the children of the puritans was not absolutely without some apology i never had any means of ascertaining the fact but it would have occasioned me no surprise had i discovered that thousandacres and all his brood looked down on us new yorkers as an especially fallen and sinful race which was on the high road to perdition though encouraged and invited to enter on a different road by the spectacle of a chosen people so near them following the straight and narrow path that leads to heaven this mingling of god and mammon is by no means an uncommon thing among us though the squatters would probably have admitted themselves that they had fallen a little away and were by no means as good as their forefathers had once been there is nothing that sticks so close to an individual or to a community as the sense of its own worth as coming events cast their shadows before this sentiment leaves its shadows behind long after the substance which may have produced them has moved onward or been resolved into the gases but i must return to zephaniah and the note  and you tell me chainbearer that ursula has actually written a note a letter to this young man i asked as soon as i could muster resolution enough to put so revolting a question  sartain here it ist ant a very pretty lookin letter it is mortaunt dus does everyting so hantily ant so like a nice young woman tat it ist a pleasure to carry one of her letters aytere te lat ist now and ill just call him and gif him his own  chainbearer was as good as his word and zephaniah soon stood at the door of the storehouse  well you wilt own zeph continued the old man we didnt cage you like a wilt peast or a rogue tat hast been mettlin wit what tidnt pelong to him when you wast out among us tere is tat difference in te treatmentput no matter here ist a letter for you and much goot may it do you it comes from one who vilt gif goot atvice and youll be none the worse if you follow it i dont know a wort tats in it put youll fint it a goot letter ill answer for it dus writes peautiful letters and in a hand almost as plain and hantsome as his excellencys tough not quite so large put her own hant isnt as large as his excellencys tough his excellencys hant wasnt particularly pig neiter  i could scarcely believe my senses here was ursula malbone confessedly writing a letter to a son of thousandacres the squatter and that son admitted to be her admirer devoured by jealousy and a thousand feelings to which i had hitherto been a stranger i gazed at the fortunate being who was so strangely honored by this communication from dus with the bitterest envy although to own the truth the young squatter was a wellgrown goodlooking fellow to me he seemed to be the very personification of coarseness and vulgarity it will readily be supposed that zephaniah was not entirely free from some very just imputations of the latter character but on the whole most girls of his own class in life would be quite content with him in these respects but ursula malbone was not at all of his own class in life however reduced in fortune she was a lady by education as well as by birth and what feelings could there possibly be in common between her and her strange admirer i had heard it said that women were as often taken by externals as men but in this instance the externals were coarse and nothing extraordinary some females too could not exist without admiration and i had known dus but a few weeks after all and it was possible i had not penetrated the secret of her true character then her original education had been in the forest and we often return to our first loves in these particulars with a zest and devotion for which there is no accounting it was possible this strange girl might have portrayed to her imagination in the vista of the future more of happiness and wild enjoyment among the woods and ravines of stolen clearings than by dwelling amid the haunts of men in short there was scarce a conceit that did not crowd on my brain in that moment of intense jealousy and profound unhappiness i was as miserable as a dog  as for zephaniah the favored youth of ursula malbone he received his letter as i fancied with an awkward surprise and lounged round the corner of the building to have the pleasure as it might be of reading it to himself this brought him nearer to my position for i had withdrawn in a disgust i could not conquer from being near the scene that had just been enacted  opening a letter though it had been folded by the delicate hands of ursula malbone and reading it were two very different operations as zephaniah now discovered the education of the young man was very limited and after an effort or two he found it impossible to get on with the letter open in his hand he found it as much a sealed book to him as ever zephaniah could read writing by dint of a considerable deal of spelling but it must not be a good hand as some persons cannot comprehend pure english so he found far more difficulty in spelling out the pretty even characters before him than would have been the case had he been set at work on the pothooks and trammels of one of his own sisters glancing his eyes around in quest of aid they happened to fall on mine which were watching his movements with the vigilance of a feline animal through the chinks of the logs and at the distance of only three feet from his own face as for the indian he seemingly took no more note of what was passing than lovers take of time in a stolen interview though i had subsequently reason to believe that nothing had escaped his observation andries was in a distant part of the prison reconnoitring the clearing and mills with an interest that absorbed all his attention for the moment of these facts zephaniah assured himself by taking a look through the openings of the logs then sidling along nearer to me he said in a low voice  i dont know how it is but to tell you the truth major littlepage york larnin and varmount larnin be so different that i dont find it quite as easy to read this letter as i could wish  on this hint i seized the epistle and began to read it in a low tone for zephaniah asked this much of me with a delicacy of feeling that in so far was to his credit as the reader may have some of the curiosity i felt myself to know what ursula malbone could possibly have to say in this form to zephaniah thousandacres i shall give the contents of this strange epistle in full it was duly directed to mr zephaniah timberman mooseridge and in that respect would have passed for any common communication within it read as follows       sir       as you have often professed a strong regard for me i now put      you to the proof of the sincerity of your protestations my      dear uncle goes to your father whom i only know by report to      demand the release of major littlepage who we hear is a      prisoner in the hands of your family against all law and      right as it is possible the business of uncle chainbearer will      be disagreeable to thousandacres and that warm words may pass      between them i ask of your friendship some efforts to keep the      peace and particularly should anything happen to prevent my      uncle from returning that you would come to me in the      woodsfor i shall accompany the chainbearer to the edge of      your clearingand let me know it you will find me there      attended by one of the blacks and we can easily meet if you      cross the fields in an eastern direction as i will send the      negro to find you and to bring you to me       in addition to what i have said above zephaniah let me also      earnestly ask your care in behalf of major littlepage should      any evil befall that gentleman it would prove the undoing of      your whole family the law has a long arm and it will reach      into the wilderness as well as into a settlement the person      of a human being is a very different thing from a few acres of      timber and general littlepage will think far more of his noble      son than he will think of all the logs that have been cut and      floated away again and again therefore i earnestly entreat      of you to befriend this gentleman not only as you hope for my      respect but as you hope for your own peace of mind i have had      some connection with the circumstances that threw mr      littlepage into your hands and shall never know a happy moment      again should anything serious befall him remember this      zephaniah and let it influence your own conduct i owe it to      myself and to you to add that the answer i gave you at      ravensnest the evening of the raising must remain my answer      now and forever but if you have really the regard for me that      you then professed you will do all you can to serve major      littlepage who is an old friend of my uncles and whose      safety owing to circumstances that you would fully understand      were they told to you is absolutely necessary to my future      peace of mind       your friend       ursula malbone  what a strange girl was this dus i suppose it as unnecessary to say that i felt profoundly ashamed of my late jealousy which now seemed just as absurd and unreasonable as a moment before it seemed justified and plausible god protect the wretch who is the victim of that evileyed passion he who is jealous of circumstances in the ordinary transactions of life usually makes a fool of himself by seeing a thousand facts that exist in his own brain only but he whose jealousy is goaded on by love must be something more than human not to let the devils get a firm grasp of his soul i can give no better illustration of the weakness that this last passion induces however than the admission i have just made that i believed it possible ursula malbone could love zephaniah thousandacres or whatever might be his real name i have since pulled at my own hair in rage at my own folly as that moment of weakness has recurred to my mind  she writes a desprate letter exclaimed the young squatter stretching his large frame like one who had lost command of his movements through excitement i dont believe major the like of that gal is to be found in york taken as state or colony ive a dreadful likin for her  it was impossible not to smile at this outpouring of attachment nor on the whole would i have been surprised at the ambition it inferred had the youth been but a very little higher in the social scale out of the large towns and with here and there an exception in favor of an isolated family there is not even to this day much distinction in classes among our eastern brethren the great equality of condition and education that prevails as a rule throughout all the rural population of new england while it has done so much for the great body of their people has had its inevitable consequences in lowering the standard of cultivation among the few both as it is applied to acquirements and to the peculiar notions of castes and nothing is more common in that part of the world than to hear of marriages that elsewhere would have been thought incongruous for the simple reason of the difference in ordinary habits and sentiments between the parties thus it was that zephaniah without doing as much violence to his own as would be done to our notions of the fitness of things might aspire to the hand of ursula malbone unattended as she certainly was by any of the outward and more vulgar signs of her real character i could not but feel some respect for the young mans taste therefore and this so much the more readily because i no longer was haunted by the very silly phantom of his possible success  having this regard for dus i said i hope i may count on your following her directions  what way can i sarve you major i do vow ive every wish to do as ursula asks of me if i only knowd how  you can undo the fastenings of our prison here and let us go at once into the woods where we shall be safe enough against a recapture depend on it do us that favor and i will give you fifty acres of land on which you can settle down and become an honest man remember it will be something honorable to own fifty acres of good land in fee  zephaniah pondered on my tempting offer and i could see that he wavered in opinion but the decision was adverse to my wishes he shook his head looked round wistfully at the woods where he supposed dus then to be possibly watching his very movements but he would not yield  if a father cant trust his own son who can he trust in natur demanded the young squatter  no one should be aided in doing wrong and your father has no just right to shut up us three in this building as he has done the deed is against the law and to the law sooner or later will he be made to give an account of it  oh as for the law he cares little for that weve been agin law all over lives and the law is agin us when a body comes to take the chance of jurors and witnesses and lawyers and poor attorneyginrals and careless prosecutors laws no great matter to stand out agin in this country i spose there is countries in which law counts for suthin but hereabouts and all through varmount we dont kear much for the law unless its a matter between man and man and tother side holds out for his rights bulldog fashion then i allow its suthin to have the law on your side but its no great matter in a trespass case  this may not end in a trespass case however your fatherby the way is thousandacres much hurt  not much to speak on coolly answered the son still gazing in the direction of the woods a little stunned but hes gettin over it fast and hes used to sich rubs fathers desprate solid about the head and can stand as much sledgehammering there as any man i ever seed tobits tough too in that part and hes need of it for hes forever getting licks around the forehead and eyes  and as your father comes to what seems to be his disposition toward us  nothin to speak on in the way of friendship i can tell you the old mans considerable riled and when thats the case hell have his own way for all the governors and judges in the land  do you suppose he meditates any serious harm to his prisoners  a man doesnt meditate a great deal i guess with such a rap on the skull he feels a plaguy sight more than he thinks and when the feelins is up it doesnt matter much whos right and whos wrong the great difficulty in your matter is how to settle about the lumber thats in the creek the waters low and the most that can be done with it afore november will to be float it down to the next rift over which it can never go with any safety without more water its risky to keep one like you and to keep chainbearer too three or four months in jail like and it wunt do to let you go neither sin youd soon have the law ater us if we keep you too therell be a sarch made and a reward offered now a good many of your tenants know of this clearin and human natur cant hold out agin a reward the old man knows that well and its what hes most afeared on we can stand up agin almost anything better than agin a good smart reward  i was amused as well as edified with zephaniahs simplicity and frankness and would willingly have pursued the discourse had not lowiny come tripping toward us summoning her brother away to attend a meeting of the family the old squatter having so far recovered as to call a council of his sons the brother left me on the instant but the girl lingered at my corner of the storehouse like one who was reluctant to depart  i hope the hastypuddin was sweet and good said lowiny casting a timid glance in at the chink  it was excellent my good girl and i thank you for it with all my heart are you very busy nowcan you remain a moment while i make a request  oh theres nothin for me to do just now in the house seem that father has called the bys around him whenever he does that even mother is apt to quit  i am glad of it as i think you are so kindhearted and good that i may trust you in a matter of some importance may i not my good lowiny  squatters daghters may be good then ater all in the eyes of grand landholders  certainlyexcellent even and i am much disposed to believe that you are one of that class lowiny looked delighted and i felt less reluctance at administering this flattery than might otherwise have been the case from the circumstance that so much of what i said was really merited  indeed i know you are and quite unfitted for this sort of life but i must tell you my wishes at once for our time may be very short  do said the girl looking up anxiously a slight blush suffusing her face the truthtelling sign of ingenuous feelings and the gage of virtue do for im dying to hear it as i know beforehand i shall do just what you ask me to do i dont know how it is but when father or mother ask me to do a thing i sometimes feel as if i couldnt but i dont feel so now at all  my requests do not come often enough to tire you promise me in the first place to keep my secret  that i will answered lowiny promptly and with emphasis not a mortal soul shall know anything ont and i wont so much as talk of it in my sleep as i sometimes do if i can any way help it  chainbearer has a niece who is very dear to him and who returns all his affection her name is  dus malbone interrupted the girl with a faint laugh zeph has told me all about her for zeph and i be great friendshe tells me everything and i tell him everything its sich a comfort you cant think to have somebody to tell secrets towell what of dus  she is here  here i dont see anything on herlooking round hurriedly and as i fancied in a little alarmzeph says shes dreadful hansome  she is thought so i believe though in that respect she is far from being alone there is no want of pretty girls in america by saying she was here i did not mean here in the storehouse but here in the woods she accompanied her uncle as far as the edge of the clearinglook round more toward the east do you see the black stub in the cornfield behind your fathers dwelling  sartainthats plain enough to be seeni wish i could see albany as plain  now look a little to the left of that stub and you will see a large chestnut in the edge of the woods behind itthe chestnut i mean that thrusts its top out of the forest into the clearing as it might be  well i see the chestnut too and i know it well theres a spring of water cluss to its roots  at the foot of that chestnut chainbearer left his niece and doubtless she is somewhere near it now could you venture to stroll as far without going directly to the spot and deliver a message or a letter  to be sure i could why we gals stroll about the lots as much as we please and its berryin time now ill run and get a basket and you can write your letter while im gone la nobody will think anything of my goin a berryini have a desprate wish to see this dus do you think shell have zeph  young womens minds are so uncertain that i should not like to venture an opinion if it were one of my own sex now and had declared his wishes i think i could tell you with some accuracy  the girl laughed then she seemed a little bewildered and again she colored how the acquirednay native feeling of the sex will rise up in telltale ingenuousness to betray a woman  well she cried as she ran away in quest of the basket to my notion a gals mind is as true and as much to be depended on as that of any mortal crittur living  it was now my business to write a note to dus the materials for writing my pocketbook furnished i tore out a leaf and approached chainbearer telling him what i was about to do and desiring to know if he had any particular message to send  gif te tear gal my plessin mortaunt tell her olt chainpearer prays got to pless hertat ist all i leaf you to say te rest  i did say the rest in the first place i sent the blessing of the uncle to the niece then i explained in as few words as possible our situation giving it as promising an aspect as my conscience would permit these explanations made i entreated ursula to return to her brother and not again expose herself so far from his protection of the close of this note i shall not say much it was brief but it let dus understand that my feelings toward her were as lively as ever and i believe it was expressed with the power that passion lends my note was ended just as lowiny appeared to receive it she brought us a pitcher of milk as a sort of excuse for returning to the storehouse received the note in exchange and hurried away toward the fields as she passed one of the cabins i heard her calling out to a sister that she was going for blackberries to give the prisoners  i watched the movements of that active girl with intense interest chainbearer who had slept little since my disappearance was making up for lost time and as for the indian eating and sleeping are very customary occupations of his race when not engaged in some hunt or on the warpath or as a runner  lowiny proceeded toward a lot of which the bushes had taken full possession here she soon disappeared picking berries as she proceeded with nimble fingers as if she felt the necessity of having some of the fruit to show on her return i kept my eye fastened on the openings of the forest near the chestnut as soon as the girl was concealed in the bushes anxiously waiting for the moment when i might see her form reappearing at that spot my attention was renewed by getting a glimpse of dus it was but a glimpse the fluttering of a female dress gliding among the trees but as it was too soon for the arrival of lowiny i knew it must be dus this was cheering as it left little reason to doubt that my messenger would find the object of her visit in the course of half an hour after lowiny entered the bushes i saw her distinctly near the foot of the chestnut pausing a moment as if to reconnoitre the girl suddenly moved into the forest when i made no doubt she and dus had a meeting an entire hour passed and i saw no more of lowiny  in the meanwhile zephaniah made his appearance again at the side of the storehouse this time he came accompanied by two of his brethren holding the key in his hand at first i supposed the intention was to arraign me before the high court of thousandacres but in this i was in error no sooner did the young men reach the door of our prison than zephaniah called out to the onondago to approach it as he had something to say to him  it must be dull work to a redskin to be shut up like a hog afore its wrung said the youth drawing his images from familiar objects and i spose youd be right glad to come out here and walk about something like a free and rational crittur what do you say injinis sich your desire  sartain quietly answered sureflint great deal radder be out dan be in here  so i natrally sposed well the old man says you can come out on promises if youre disposed to make em so youre master of your own movements you see  what he want me do what he want me to say eh  no great matter ater all if a body has only a mind to try to do it in the first place youre to give your parole not to go off but to stay about the clearin and to come in and give yourself up when the conch blows three short blasts will you agree to that sus  sartainno go way come back when he calldat mean stay where he can hear conch  well thats agreed on and its a bargain next youre to agree not to go pryin round the mill and barn to see what you can find but keep away from all the buildins but the storeus and the dwellings and not to quit the clearin do you agree  good no hard to do dat  well youre to bring no weepons into the settlement and to pass nothing but words and food in to the other prisoners will you stand to that  sartain willin nough to do dat too  then youre in no manner or way to make war on any on us till your parole is up and youre your own man agin what do you say to that trackless  all good gree to do him all  waal thats pretty much all the old man stands out for but mother has a condition or two that she insists ont i shall ask should the worst come to the worst and the folks of this settlement get to blows with the folks out of it youre to bargain to take no scalps of women or children and none from any man that you dont overcome in open battle the old woman will grant you the scalps of men killed in battle but thinks it agin reason to take em from sich as be not so overcome  good dont want to take scalp at all answered the indian with an emotion he could not altogether suppress got no tribegot no young men what good scalp do nobody care how many scalp susquesus take awayhow many he leave behind all dat forgot long time  waal thats your affair not mine but as all the articles is agreed to you can come out and go about your business mind three short sharp blasts on the conch is the signal to come in and give yourself up  on this singular cartel susquesus was set at liberty i heard the whole arrangement with astonishment though by the manner of the high contracting parties it was easy to see there was nothing novel in the arrangement so far as they were concerned i had heard that the faith of an indian of any character in all such cases was considered sacred and could not but ask myself as susquesus walked quietly out of prison how many potentates and powers there were in christendom who under circumstances similarly involving their most important interests could be found to place a similar confidence in their fellows curious to know how my present masters felt on this subject the opportunity was improved to question them  you give the indian his liberty on parole i said to zephaniahwill you refuse the same privilege to us white men  an injin is an injin he has his natur and weve ourn suthin was said about lettin you out too major but the old man wouldnt hear to it he knowd mankind he said and he knowd twould never do if you let a white man loose he sets his wits at work to find a hole to creep out on the bargaingoin back to the creation of the arth but hell find one the major will say i was put in agin law and now im out ill stay out agin promises or some sich reasonin and now we have him safe twill be best to keep him safe thats the substance of the old mans idees and you can see major just as well as any on us how likely hell be to change em  there was no contending with this logic which in secret i well knew to be founded in fact and i made no further application for my own release it appeared however that thousandacres himself was halfdisposed to make a concession in favor of chainbearer similar to that he had granted to the indian this struck me as singular after the rude collision that had already occurred between the two menbut there are points of honor that are peculiar to each condition of life and which the men of each feel a pride not only in causing to be respected but in respecting themselves  father had some thoughts of taking your parole too chainbearer added zephaniah and he concluded he would hadnt it been that youd been living out in the settlements so much of late years that hes not quite easy in trusting you a man that passes so much of his time in running boundaries may think himself privileged to step over them  your fater is welcome to his opinion answered andries coolly hell get no parole of me nor do i want any favors of him we are at swords pints young man and let him look out for himself and his lumper as pest he can  nay answered zephaniah stretching himself and answering with spirit though he well knew he was speaking to the uncle of dus and thereby endangering his interests with his mistressnay chainbearer if it comes to that twill be hardes fend off we are a strong party of stout men and arnt to be frightened by the crier of a court or to be druv off the land by sheepskin catamounts must come agin us in droves afore well give an inch  go away go awayfoolish young fellowyoure your faters son and tats as much as neet pe said of you i want no favors from squatters which ist a preed i tetest and tespise  i was a little surprised at hearing this answer and at witnessing this manifestation of feeling in chainbearer who ordinarily was a cool and uniformly a courteous man on reflection however i saw he was not so wrong an exchange of anything like civilities between us and our captors might seem to give them some claim on us whereas by standing on the naked right we had every advantage of them in a moral sense at least zephaniah and his brethren left us on receiving this repulse of andries but susquesus kept loitering around the storehouse apparently little better off now he was on its outside than he had been when in it he had nothing to do and his idleness was that of an indianone of a race of such terrible energies when energy is required and so frequently listless when not pressed upon by necessity pleasure war or interest  things were in this state when some time after the interview just related we had another visit from a party headed by tobit this man came to escort chainbearer and myself to the cabin of thousandacres where all the men of the family were assembled and where as it now appeared we were to have something like a hearing that might seriously affect our fates for good or for evil i consulted chainbearer on the propriety of our lending ourselves to such a measure but i found andries disposed to meet the brood of squatters face to face and to tell them his mind let it be when and where it might finding my friend in this temper i made no further objections myself but left the storehouse in his company well guarded by four of the young men all of whom were armed holding our way to the seat of justice in that wild and patriarchal government     chapter xxii      when adam delvd and eve span     where was then the gentlemanold saw   thousandacres had not altogether neglected forms though so much set against the spirit of the law we found a sort of court collected before the door of his dwelling with himself in the centre while the principal room contained no one but prudence and one or two of her daughters among the latter was lowiny to my surprise for i had not seen the girl return from the woods though my eyes had not been long turned from the direction in which i had hopes of catching a glimpse of dus  tobit led us prisoners into the house placing us near the door and facing his father an arrangement that superseded the necessity of much watchfulness as our only means of escape would necessarily be by rushing through the throng withouta thing virtually impracticable but chainbearer appeared to have no thought of flight he entered that circle of athletic young men with perfect indifference and i remember that it struck me his air resembled that which i had often seen him assume when our regiment was on the eve of serious service at such moments old andries could and often did appear granddignity authority and coldness being blended with sterling courage  when in the room chainbearer and i seated ourselves near the door while thousandacres had a chair on the turf without surrounded by his sons all of whom were standing as this arrangement was made amid a grave silence the effect was not altogether without impressiveness and partook of some of the ordinary aspects of justice i was struck with the anxious curiosity betrayed in the countenances of the females in particular for the decision to which thousandacres was about to come would with them have the authority of a judgment of solomon accustomed to reason altogether in their own interests i make no doubt that in the main all of that semibarbarous breed fancied themselves invested in their lawless occupation by some sort of secret natural right ignorant of the fact that the moment they reduced their claim to this standard they put it on the level with that of all the rest of mankind nature gives nothing exclusively to an individual beyond his individuality and that which appertains to his person and personal qualities all beyond he is compelled to share under the law of nature with the rest of his race a title dependent on original possession forms no exception to this rule for it is merely human convention that gives it force and authority without which it would form no title at all but into mysteries like these none of the family of thousandacres ever entered though the still small voice of conscience the glimmerings of right were to be traced occasionally even amid the confused jumble of social maxims in which their selfishness had taken refuge  we live in an age of what is called progress and fancy that man is steadily advancing on the great path of his destiny to something that we are apt to imagine is to form perfection certainly i shall not presume to say what is or what is not the divine intention as to the future destination of our species on earth but years and experience must have taught me or i should have lived in vain how little there is among our boasted improvements that is really new and if we do possess anything in the way of principles that bear on them the impress of inviolability they are those that have become the most venerable by having stood the severest tests of time  i know not whether the long silent pause that succeeded our arrival was the result of an intention to heighten the effect of that scene or whether thousandacres really wished time to collect his thoughts and to mature his plans one thing struck me notwithstanding the violence that had so recently occurred between chainbearer and himself there were no traces of resentment in the hardened and wrinkled countenance of that old tenant of the forest for he was too much accustomed to those sudden outbreakings of anger to suffer them long to linger in his recollection in all that was said and in all that passed in the course of that to me memorable day i could trace no manifestation of any feeling in the squatter in consequence of the rude personal rencontre that he had so lately had with my friend they had clenched and he had been overthrown and that ended the matter  the silence which occurred after we took our seats must have lasted several minutes for myself i saw i was only a secondary person in this interview old andries having completely supplanted me in importance not only in acts but in the estimation of the squatters to him they were accustomed and accustomed moreover to regard as a sort of hostile power his very pursuit being opposed to the great moving principle of their everyday lives the man who measured land and he who took it to himself without measurement were exactly antagonist forces in morals as well as in physics and might be supposed not to regard each other with the most friendly eyes thus it was that the chainbearer actually became an object of greater interest to these squatters than the son of one of the owners of the soil and the attorney in fact of both as for the old man himself i could see that he looked very dutch which implied a stubborn resolution bordering on obstinacy unmoved adherence to what he conceived to be right and a strong dislike to his present neighbors in addition to other reasons on account of their having come from the eastward a race that he both distrusted and respected disliked yet covertly honored for many a quality that was both useful and good  to the next generation the feeling that was once so active between the descendants of holland among ourselves and the people of english birth who came from the eastern states will be almost purely a matter of history i perceive that my father in the manuscript he has transmitted to me as well as i myself have made various allusions to the subject it is my wish to be understood in this matter i have introduced it solely as a fact that is beyond controversy but i trust without any undue bigotry of opinion it is possible that both mr cornelius littlepage and his son unconsciously to ourselves may have been influenced by the ancient prejudices of the colonies though i have endeavored scrupulously to avoid them at any rate if either of us has appeared to be a little too severe i trust the reader will remember how much has been uttered to the world in reference to this dislike by the yankee and how little by the dutchman during the last century and a half and grant to one who is proud of the little blood from holland that he happens to possess the privilege of showing at least one of the phases of his own side of the story but it is time to return to our scene in the hut  chainbearer commenced thousandacres after the pause already mentioned had lasted several minutes and speaking with a dignity that could only have proceeded from the intensity of his feelings chainbearer youve been an inimy to me and mine sin the day we first met youre an inimy by your cruel callin yet youve the boldness to thrust yourself into my very hands  im an enemy to all knaves tousantacres and i tont care who knows it answered old andries sternly tat ist my trate ast well ast carryin chain ant i wish it to pe known far and near ast for pein your enemy by callin i may say as much of yourself since there coult pe no surveyin or carryin of chain tit all te people help temselves to lant as you haf tone your whole life witout as much as sayin to te owners py your leaf  things have now got to a head atween us chainbearer returned the squatter but seein that youre in my hands im ready and willin to reason the pint with you in hopes that we may yet part frinds and that this may be the last of all our troubles you and i be getting to be oldish men chainbearer and its fittin that them that be gettin near their eends should sometimes think on em i come from no dutch colony but from a part of the world where mankind fears god and has some thoughts of a futur state  tats neiter here nor tere tousantacres cried andries impatiently not put what religion is a goot ting and a ting to be venerated ant honoret ant worshippet put tat its out of place in a squatter country and most of all in a squatters mout can you telt me one ting tousantacres and tat ist why you yankees pray so much ant call on got to pless you every oter wort ant turn up your eyes ant look so temure of suntays ant ten

tat yankee religion ant tutch religion cannot come out of te same piple  i should think not i should think not chainbearer and i hope not in the bargain i do not wish to be justified by ways like yourn or a religion like yourn that which is foreordained will come to pass let what will happen and thats my trust but leaving religion out of this matter atween us altogether  ay youll do well to do tat growled chainbearer for religion hast inteet very little to do wit it  i say answered thousandacres on a higher key as if resolute to make himself heard leaving religion for sabba days and proper occasions im ready to talk this matter over on the footin of reason and not only to tell you my say but to hear yourn as is right atween man and man  i confess a strong desire to listen to what thousandacres has to say in defence of his conduct chainbearer i now thought it best to put in and i hope you will so far oblige me as to be a patient listener i am very willing that you should answer for i know of no person to whom i would sooner trust a religious cause than yourself proceed thousandacres my old friend will comply  andries did conform to my wishes thus distinctly expressed but it was not without sundry signs of disquiet as expressed in his honest countenance and a good deal of subdued muttering about yankee cunnin and holy gotliness tat is dresset up in wolfs clotin chainbearer meaning to express the native garment of the sheep by the latter expression but falling into a confusion of images that is by no means rare among the men of his caste and people after a pause the squatter proceeded  in talkin this matter over young man i propose to begin at the beginnin of things he said for i allow if you grant any value to titles and kings grants and sich sort of things that my rights here be no great matter but beginnin at the beginnin the case is very different youll admit i spose that the lord created the heavens and the arth and that he created man to be master over the last  what of tat eagerly cried chainbearer what of tat olt tousantacres so te lort createt yonter eagle tat is flyin so far apove your heat put its no sign you are to kill him or he ist to kill you  hear to reason chainbearer and let me have my say ater which im willing to hear you i begin at the beginnin when man was first put in possession of the arth to till and to dig and to cut sawlogs and to make lumber jist as it suited his wants and inclinations now adam was the father of all and to him and his posterity was the possession of the arth given by him whose titles worth that of all the kings and governors and assemblies in the known world adam lived his time and left all things to his posterity and so has it been from father to son down to our own day and giniration accordin to the law of god though not accordin to the laws of man  well admittin all you say squatter how does tat make your right here petter tan tat of any oter man demanded andries disdainfully  why reason tells us where a mans rights begin youll see chainbearer here is the arth as i told you given to man to be used for his wants when you and i are born some parts of the world is in use and some parts isnt we want land when we are old enough to turn our hands to labor and i make my pitch out here in the woods say where no man has pitched afore me now in my judgment that makes the best of title the lords title17  footnote 17 lest the reader should suppose mr mordaunt littlepage is here recording uselessly the silly sayings of a selfish ignorant and vulgar robber it may be well to add that doctrines of a calibre considered in respect of morals and logic similar to this though varying according to circumstances and the points it is desired to establish are constantly published in journals devoted to antirentism in the state of new york and men have acted on these principles even to the shedding of blood we purpose when we come to our third manuscript which relates to movements of our immediate time to distinctly lay before the reader some of these strange doctrines entertaining little doubt that those who originally promulgated them will scarcely admire their own theories when they see them introduced into a work that will contain the oldfashioned notions of honesty and righteditor  well ten youve got your title from te lord answered chainbearer and youve got your lant i spose youll not take all te art tat is not yet peoplet and i shoult like to know how you wilt run your lines petween you ant your next neighpor atmittin youre here in te woots how much of te lant

the best chap he can light on  oh yout sell you petterments woult you what sell te lorts title olt tousantacres part wit heavens gift for te value of poor miseraple silver and golt  you dont comprehend aaron put in prudence who saw that chainbearer was likely to get the best of the argument and who was always ready to come to the rescue of any of her tribe whether it might be necessary with words or tooth and nail or the rifle you dont by no manner of means comprehend aaron chainbearer his idee is that the lord has made the arth for his critturs that any one that wants land has a right to take as much as he wants and to use it as long as he likes and when he has done to part with his betterments for sich price as may be agreed on  i stick to that joined in the squatter with a loud hem like a man who was sensible of relief thats my idee and im determined to live and die by it  youve lifed py it i know very well tousantacres ant now youre olt its quite likely youll tie py it as for comprehentin you dont comprehent yourself ill just ask you in the first place how much lant do you holt on tis very spot youre here squattet so completely ant finally as to haf puilt a mill now

life at the same time and both want farms waal theres the wilderness or maybe it isnt all wilderness though it once was one chooses to buy out betterments and he does so tother plunges in out o sight of humanity and makes his pitch both them mens in the right and can hold on to their possessions i say to the eend of time that is on the supposition that right is stronger than might  well well answered chainbearer a little dryly ant spose one of your men tont want to puy petterments put follows toter and makes his pitch in te wilterness also  let him dot i say tis his right and the law of the lord  put spose bot your young men want te same pit of wilt lant  first come first sarvd thats my maxim let the spryest chap have the land possessions everything in settling land titles  well ten to please you tousandacres well let one get aheat of tother and haf his possession first how much shalt he occupy  as much as he wants ive told you already  ay put when his slower frient comes along ant hast his wants too and wishes to make his pitch alongsite of his olt neighpor where is te pountary petween em to be fount  let em agree ont they must be dreadful poor neighbors if they cant agree on so small a matter as that said tobit who was getting weary of the argument  tobit is right added the father let em agree on their line and run it by the eye curse on all chains and compasses say i theyre an invention of the devil to make ill blood in a neighborhood and to keep strife awake when our bibles tell us to live in peace with all mankind  yes yes i understand all tat returned

mention tousantacres for your consiteration you take possession of timperlant by lookin at it you say  even lookin at isnt necessary returned the squatter eager to widen the grasp of his rights its enough that a man wants the land and he comes or sends to secure it possession is everything and i call it possession to crave a spot and to make some sort of calkerlation or works reasonably near it that gives a right to cut and clear and when a clearins begun its betterments and everybody allows that betterments may be both bought and sold  well now we understant each oter put here ist te small

wantet it very much te whole of tat quarter of a century ant if te truit was sait want it still  a long pause followed this statement during which the different members of the family looked at each other as if in quest of support the idea of there being any other side to the question than that they had been long accustomed to consider so intently was novel to them and they were a little bewildered by the extraordinary circumstance this is one of the great difficulties under which the inhabitant of a narrow district labors in all that pertains to his personal notions and tastes and a good deal in what relates to his principles this it is that makes the true provincial with his narrow views set notions conceit and unhesitating likes and dislikes when one looks around him and sees how very few are qualified by experience and knowledge of the world to utter opinions at all he is apt to be astonished at finding how many there are that do it i make no doubt that the family of thousandacres were just as well satisfied with their landethics as paley ever could have been with his moral philosophy or newton with his mathematical demonstrations  i dont wonter youre callet tousantacres aaron timperman continued chainbearer pushing his advantage for wit such a title to your estate you might as well pe tarmet ten tousantacres at once ant more too nay i wonter while your eyes was trawin up title teets tat you shoult haf peen so moterate for it was just as easy to possess a patent on tat sort of right as to possess a single farm  but thousandacres had made up his mind to pursue the subject no further and while it was easy to see what fiery passions were burning within him he seemed now bent on bringing a conference from which he doubtless expected different results to a sudden close it was with difficulty that he suppressed the volcano that was raging within but he so far succeeded as to command tobit to shut up his prisoner again  take him away bys take him back to the storeus said the old squatter rising and moving a little on one side to permit andries to pass as if afraid to trust himself too near he was born the sarvent of the rich and will die their sarvent chains be good enough for him and i wish him no greater harm than to carry chains the rest of his days  oh youre a true son of liperty called out the chainbearer as he quietly returned to his prison a true son of liperty accordin to your own conceit you want eferyting in your own way and eferyting in your own pocket te lorts law is a law for tousantacres put not a law to care for cornelius littlepage or tirck follock  although my old friend was escorted to his prison no attempt was made to remove me on the contrary prudence joined her husband without followed by all her young fry and for a moment i fancied myself forgotten and deserted a movement in one corner of the room however drew my attention there and i saw lowiny standing on tiptoe with a finger on her lips the sign of silence while she made eager gestures with the other hand for me to enter a small passage that communicated by means of a ladder with the loft of the hut my moccasons were now of great advantage to me without pausing to reflect on consequences or to look around i did as directed drawingto the door after me there was a small window in the sort of passage in which i now found myself alone with the girl and my first impulse was to force my body through it for it had neither glass nor sash but lowiny caught my arms  lord ha massy on us whispered the girlyoud be seen and taken or shot for your life dont go out there now heres a hole for a cellar and theres the trapgo down there and wait till you hear news from me  there was no time for deliberation and the sight of chainbearers escort as they proceeded toward the storehouse satisfied me that the girl was right she held up the trap and i descended into the hole that answered the purposes of a cellar i heard lowiny draw a chest over the trap and then i fancied i could distinguish the creaking of the rounds of the ladder as she went up into the loft which was the place where she usually slept  all this occurred literally in about one minute of time another minute may have passed when i heard the heavy tread of thousandacres foot on the floor above me and the clamor of many voices all speaking at once it was evident that i was missed and a search had already been commenced for half a minute nothing was very intelligible to me then i heard the shrill voice of prudence calling for lowiny  lowinyyou lowiny she criedwhere has the gal got to  im here motheranswered my friend from her loftyou told me to come up and look for your new bible  i presume this was true for prudence had really despatched the girl on that errand and it must have sufficed to lull any suspicions of her daughters being connected with my disappearance if any such had been awakened the movement of footsteps was now quick over my head those of several men being among them and in the confusion of voices i heard that of lowiny who must have descended the ladder and joined in the search  he mustnt be allowed to get off on no account said thousandacres aloud or were all ondone everything we have will fall into their hands and mill logs and all will be utterly lost we shant even have time to get off the gear and the household stuff  hes upstairscried onehe must be down cellar said another steps went up the ladder and i heard the chest drawn from the trap and a stream of light entering the place notified me that the trap was raised the place i was in was a hole twenty feet square roughly walled with stones and nearly empty though it did contain a meatbarrel or two and a few old tubs in the winter it would have been filled with vegetables there was no place to hide in and an attempt at concealment would have led to a discovery i withdrew to a corner in a part of the cellar that was quite dark but thought myself lost when i saw a pair of legs descending the ladder almost at the same moment three of the men and two of the women came into the hole a fourth female whom i afterward ascertained to be lowiny herself standing in the trap in such a way as to double the darkness below the first man who got down began to tumble the tubs about and to look into the corners and the lucky thought occurred to me to do the same thing by keeping as busy as the rest of them i actually escaped detection in the dark and tobit soon rushed to the ladder calling out the windowthe windowhes not herethe window in half a minute the cellar was empty again or no one remained but myself  at first i had great difficulty in believing in my good luck but the trap fell and the profound stillness of the place satisfied me that i had avoided that danger at least this escape was so singular and unexpected that i could hardly believe in its reality though real it was to all intents and purposes the absurd often strikes the imagination in an absurd way and so it proved with me on this occasion i sat down on a tub and laughed heartily when i felt absolutely certain all was right holding my sides lest the sound of my voice might yet betray me lowiny was similarly infected for i heard peals of girlish laughter from her as her brothers tumbled about barrels and tubs and bedsteads in the upper part of the building in their fruitless and hurried search this merriment did not pass unrebuked however prudence lending her daughter a box on the side of the head that in one sense reached even my ears though it probably aided in saving the girl from the suspicion of being in my secret by the very natural character of her girlish indulgence two or three minutes after the trap closed on me for the second time the sounds of footsteps and voices overhead ceased and the hut seemed deserted  my situation now was far from comfortable confined in a dark cellar with no means of escaping but by the trap and the almost certainty of falling into the hands of my captors should i attempt such a thing i now began to regret having entered so readily into lowinys scheme there would be a certain loss of dignity in a recapture that was not pleasant in itself and i will own i began to have some doubts of my eventual safety should i again come under the control of such spirits as those of thousandacres and his eldest son buried in that cellar i was in a manner placed immediately beneath those whose aim it was to secure me rendering escape impossible and detection nearly unavoidable  such were my meditations when light again streamed into the cellar the trap was raised and presently i heard my name uttered in a whisper advancing to the ladder i saw lowiny holding the door and beckoning for me to ascend i followed her directions blindly and was soon at her side the girl was nearly convulsed between dread of detection and a desire to laugh my emerging from the cellar recalling to her imagination all the ludicrous circumstances of the late search  warnt it queer that none on em knowd you she whispered then commanding silence by a hasty gesture dont speak for theyre sarchin still cluss by and some on em may follow me here i wanted to get you out of the cellar as some of the younguns will be rummagin there soon for pork for supper and their eyes are as sharp as needles dont you think you could crawl into the mill its stopped now and wunt be goin agin till this stirs over  i should be seen my good girl if any of your people are looking for me near at hand  i dont know that come to the door and youll see there is a way everybodys lookin on the right side of this house and by creepin as far as them logs youd be pretty safe if you reach the mill safely climb up into the loft  i took a moment to survey the chances at the distance of a hundred feet from the house there commenced a large bed of sawlogs which were lying alongside of each other and the timber being from two to four feet in diameter it would be very possible to creep among it up to the mill itself into which even several of the logs had been rolled the great difficulty would be in reaching the logs through a perfectly open space the house would be a cover as against most of the family who were busy examining everything like a cover on its opposite side no one supposing for a moment i could be near the mill inasmuch as it stood directly in front of the spot where the crowd was collected at the moment of my sudden disappearance but the boys and girls were flying around in all directions rendering it uncertain how long they would remain in a place or how long their eyes would be turned away from my path  it was necessary to do something and i determined to make an effort throwing myself on the ground i crawled rather slowly than fast across that terrible space and got safely among the logs as there was no outcry i knew i had not been seen it was now comparatively easy to reach the mill another dangerous experiment however was to expose my person by climbing up to the loft i could not do this without running the risk of being seen and i felt the necessity of using great caution i first raised my head high enough to survey the state of things without luckily the house was still between me and most of my enemies though the small fry constantly came into view and vanished i looked around for a spot to ascend and took a final survey of the scene there stood lowiny in the door of the hut her hands clasped and her whole air expressive of concern she saw my head i knew and i made a gesture of encouragement which caused her to start at the next instant my foot was on a brace and my body was rising to the beams above i do not think my person was uncovered ten seconds and no clamor succeeded i now felt there were really some chances of my finally effecting an escape and glad enough was i to think so     chapter xxiii                  alone amid the shades     still in harmonious intercourse they livd     the rural day and talked the flowing heart     or sighd and looked unutterable things                                       thomson   that was a somewhat breathless moment the intensity with which i had listened for any sound that might announce my discovery was really painful i almost fancied i heard a shout but none came then i gave myself up actually believing that footsteps were rushing toward the mill with a view to seize me it was imagination the rushing of the waters below being the only real sound that disturbed the silence of the place i had time to breathe and to look about me  as might be supposed the mill was very rudely constructed i have spoken of a loft but there was nothing that really deserved the term some refuse boards were laid about here and there on the beams making fragments of rough flooring and my first care was to draw several of these boards close together placing them two or three in thickness so as to make a place where by lying down i could not be seen by any one who should happen to enter the mill there lay what the millers call a bunch of cherrywood boards at no great distance from the spot where the roof joined the plate of the building and within this bunch i arranged my hidingplace no ostensible change was necessary to complete it else the experiment might have been hazardous among those who were so much accustomed to note circumstances of that nature the manner in which the lumber was arranged when i reached the spot was so little different from what it was when i had done with it as scarcely to attract attention  no sooner was my hidingplace completed to my mind than i looked round to see if there were any means of making observations without the building was not shingled but the rain was kept out by placing slabs up and down as is often seen in the ruder rustic frontier architecture of america with the aid of my knife i soon had a small hole between two of these slabs at a place favorable to such an object and though it was no larger than the eye itself it answered every purpose eagerly enough did i now commence my survey  the search was still going on actively those experienced bordermen well knew it was not possible for me to cross the open ground and to reach the woods in the short interval of time between my disappearance and their discovery of the fact and they consequently felt certain that i was secreted somewhere near the building every house had been searched though no one thought of entering the mill because my movement as all supposed was necessarily in an opposite direction the fences were examined and everything like a cover on the proper side of the house was looked into with care and activity it would seem that just as i took my first look through the hole my pursuers were at fault the search had been made and of course without effect nothing likely to conceal me remained to be examined it was necessary to come to a stand and to concert measures for a further search  the family of squatters were too much accustomed to their situation and its hazards not to be familiar with all the expedients necessary to their circumstances they placed the younger children on the lookout at the points most favorable to my retreat should i be in a situation to attempt going off in that quarter of the clearing and then the father collected his older sons around him and the whole cluster of them seven in number came slowly walking toward the mill the excitement of the first pursuit had sensibly abated and these practised woodsmen were in serious consultation on the measures next to be taken in this condition the whole party entered the mill taking their seats or standing directly beneath my post and within six feet of me as a matter of course i heard all that was said though completely hid from view  here we shall be safe from the long ears of little folks said the father as he placed his own large frame on the log that was next to be sawed this has been a most onaccountable thing tobit and id no idee at all them ere citybred gentry was so expart with their legs i sometimes think he cant be a littlepage but that hes one of our hill folks tossed out and mannered ater the towns folks to take a body in it seems an onpossibility that the man should get off out of the midst on us and we not see or hear anything on him  we may as well give up the lumber and the betterments at once growled tobit as let him get clear should he reach ravensnest the first thing hed do would be to swear out warrants agn us all and newcome is not the man to stand by squatters in trouble hed no more dare deny his landlord than deny his meetin  this expression of tobits is worthy of notice in the estimation of a certain class of religionists among us the meetin as the young squatter called his church had the highest place in his estimate of potentates and powers it is to be feared often even higher than the dread being for whose worship that meetin existed  i dont think as hard of the squire as all that answered thousandacres hell never send out a warrant agin us without sendin out a messenger to let us hear of it and that in time to get us all out of the way  and whos to get the boards in the creek out of the way afore the water rises and whos to hide or carry off all them logs theres more than a ton weight of my blood and bones in them very logs in the shape of hard labor and ill fight like a shebear for her cubs afore ill be driven from them without pay  it is very surprising that one who set this desperate value on the property he deemed his should have so little regard for that which belonged to other persons in this respect however tobits feeling was no more than submission to the general law of our nature which reverses the images before our moral vision precisely as we change our own relations to them  it would go hard with me afore i should give up the lumber or the clearin returned thousandacres with emphasis weve fit king george for liberty and why shouldnt we fight for our property of what use is liberty at all if it wont bear a man harmless out of a job of this sort i despise sich liberty bys and want none on it  all the young men muttered their approbation of such a sentiment and it was easy enough to understand that the elevated notion of personal rights entertained by thousandacres found an answering echo in the bosom of each of his heroic sons i dare say the same sympathy would have existed between them had they been a gang of pickpockets collected in council in a room of the black horse st catharines lane wapping london  but what can we do with the young chap father should we take him agin asked zephaniah a question as all will see of some interest to myself he cant be kept a great while without having a stir made ater him and that would break us up sooner or later we may have a clear right to the work of our hand but on the whull i rather conclude the country is agin squatters  who cares for the country answered thousandacres fiercely if it wants young littlepage let it come and sarch for him as weve been doin if that chap falls into my hands once more he never quits em alive unless he gives me a good and sufficient deed to two hundred acres includin the mill and a receipt in full on his fathers behalf for all back claims on them two principles my mind is set and not to be altered  a long pause succeeded this bold announcement and i began to be afraid that my suppressed breathing might be overheard in the profound stillness that followed but zephaniah spoke in time to relieve me from this apprehension and in a way to satisfy me that the party below all of whom were concealed from my sight had been pondering on what had been said by their leader and not listening to detect any telltale sounds from me  ive heern say zephaniah remarked that deeds gin in that way wont stand good in law squire newcome was talkin of sich transactions the very last time i was out at the nest  i wish a body could find out what would stand good in law growled thousandacres they make their laws and lay great account in havin em obsarved and then when a man comes into court with everything done accordin to their own rules five or six attorneys start up and bawl out this is agin law if a deed is to set forth so and so and is to have what they call hand and seal and date beside and sich bein the law i want to know why an instrument so made wont hold good by their confounded laws law is law all over the world i spose and though its an accursed thing if men agree to have it they ought to stand by their own rules ive thought a good deal of squeezin writins out of this young littlepage and just as my minds made up to dot if i can lay hands on him agin you come out and tell me sich writins be good for nothin zeph zephyou go too often out into them settlements and get your mind perverted by their wickedness and talk  i hope not father though i own i do like to go there ive come to a time of life when a man thinks of marryin and there bein no gal here unless it be one of my own sisters its natral to look into the next settlement ill own sich has been my object in going to the nest  and youve found the gal you set store by out with the whull truth like a man you know ive always been set agin lyin and have ever endeavored to make the whull of you speak truth how is it zephaniah have you found a gal to your mind and who ist ourn is a family into which anybody can come by askin you will remember  lord father dus malbone would no more think of askin me to have her than shed think of marryin you ive offered three times and shes told me as plain as a woman could speak that she couldnt nohow consent and that i hadnt ought to think of her any longer  who is the gal in this part of the country that holds her head so much higher than one of thousandacres sons demanded the old squatter with some such surprise real or affected as a bourbon might be supposed to feel at having his alliance spurned on the score of blood id like to see her and to convarse with this young woman what did you call her name zeph  dus malbone father and the young woman that lives with chainbearer shes his niece i blieve or something of that sort  ha chainbearers niece dye say his taken daghter isnt there some mistake  dus malbone calls old andries uncle chainbearer and i spose from that shes his niece  and youve offered to marry the gal three times dye tell me zephaniah  three times father and every time she has given no for her answer  the fourth time maybe shell change her mind i wonder if we couldnt lay hands on this gal and bring her into our settlement does she live with chainbearer in his hut out here in the woods  she doos father  and doos she set store by her uncle or is she one of the flaunty sort that thinks more of herself and gownd than she does of her own flesh and blood can you tell me that zeph  in my judgment father dus malbone loves chainbearer as much as she would was he her own father  ay some gals havent half the riverence and love for their own fathers that they should have whats to prevint your goin zephaniah to chainbearers pitch and tell the gal that her uncles in distress and that you dont know what may happen to him and that she had better come over and see ater him when we get her here and she understands the natur of the case and you put on your sabbaday clothes and we send for squire newcome you may find yourself a married man sooner than you thought for my son and settle down in life ater that therell not be much danger of chainbearers tellin on us or of his great frind here this major littlepages troublin the lumber afore the water rises  a murmur of applause followed this notable proposal and i fancied i could hear a snigger from the young man as if he found the project to his mind and thought it might be feasible  father said zephaniah i wish youd call lowiny here and talk to her a little about dus malbone there she is with tobits wife and mother looking round among the cabbages as if a man could be hid in such a place  thousandacres called to his daughter in an authoritative way and i soon heard the girls step as she came a little hesitatingly as i fancied into the mill as it would be very natural to one in lowinys situation to suppose that her connection with my escape occasioned this summons i could not but feel for what i presumed was the poor girls distress at receiving it  come here lowiny commenced thousandacres in the stern manner with which it was his wont to speak to his children come nearer gal do you know anything of one dus malbone chainbearers niece  lord ha massy father how you did frighten me i thought you might have found the gentleman and sposed id a hand in helpin to hide him  singular as it may seem this burst of conscience awakened no suspicion in any of the listeners when the girl thus betrayed herself i very naturally expected that such an examination would follow as would extort the whole details from her not at all however neither the father nor any of the sons understood the indiscreet remarks of the girl but imputed them to the excitement that had just existed and the circumstance that her mind had naturally enough been dwelling on its cause it is probable that the very accidental manner of my evasion which precluded the attaching of suspicious facts to what had really occurred favored lowiny on this occasion it being impossible that she should be suspected of anything of that character  whos talkin or thinkin now of young littlepage at all returned thousandacres a little angrily i ask if you know anything of chainbearers nieceone dus malbone or malcome  i do know suthin of her father answered lowiny willing enough to betray onethe lesserof her secrets in order to conceal the other which on all accounts was much the most important though i never laid eyes on her till today zeph has often talked to me of the gal that carried chain with her uncle for a whull month and he has a notion to marry her if he can get her  never laid eyes on her till today whereabouts have you laid eyes on her today gal is all creation comin in upon my clearin at once whereabouts have you seen this gal today  she come to the edge of the clearin with her uncle and  well what next why dont you go on lowiny  i could have told thousandacres why his daughter hesitated but the girl got out of the scrape by her own presence of mind and ingenuity a little aided perhaps by some practice in sins of the sort  why i went a berryin this forenoon and up agin the berry lot just in the edge of the woods i saw a young woman and that was the malbone gal so we talked together and she told me all about it shes waitin for her uncle to come back  so so this is news indeed bys do you know where the gal is now lowiny  not just now for she told me she should go deeper into the woods lest she should be seen but an hour afore sundown shes to come to the foot of the great chestnut just agin the berry lot and i promised to meet her or to carry her out suthin for supper and to make a bed on  this was said frankly and with the feeling and sympathy that females are apt to manifest in behalf of each other it was evident lowinys audience believed every word she had said and the old man in particular determined at once to act i heard him move from his seat and his voice sounded like one who was retiring as he said  tobitbyscome with me and well have one more look for this young chap through the lumber and the housen it may be that hes stolen in there while our eyes have been turned another way lowiny you neednt come with us for the flutterin way of you gals dont do no good in sich a sarch  i waited until the last heavy footstep was inaudible and then ventured to move far enough on my hands to find a crack that i had purposely left with a view to take through it an occasional look below on the log which her father had just left lowiny had seated herself her eye was roaming over the upper part of the mill as if in quest of me at length she said in a suppressed voice  be you here still father and the bys cant hear us now if you speak low  i am here good lowiny thanks to your friendly kindness and have overheard all that passed you saw ursula malbone and gave her my note  as true as you are there i did and she read it over so often i guess she must know it by heart  but what did she say had she no message for her uncleno answer to what i had written  oh shed enough to saygals love to talk you know when they get with one another and dus and i talked together half an hour or longer shed plenty to say though it wunt do for me to sit here and tell it to you lest somebody wonder i stay so long in the mill  you can tell me if she sent any message or answer to my note  she never breathed a syllable about what youd writ i warrant you shes closemouthed enough when she gets a line from a young man do you think her so desprate handsome as zeph says she is  this boded ill but it was a question that it was politic to answer and to answer with some little discretion if i lost the services of lowiny my main stay was gone  she is well enough to look at but ive seen quite as handsome young women lately but handsome or not she is one of your own sex and is not to be deserted in her trouble  yes indeed answered lowiny with an expression of countenance that told me at once the better feelings of her sex had all returned again and ill not desart her though father drive me out of the settlement i am tired of all this squatting and think folks ought to live as much in one spot as they can whats best to be done about dus malboneperhaps shed like well enough to marry zeph  did you see or hear anything while with her to make you think so i am anxious to know what she said  la she said sights of things but most of her talk was about old chainbearer she never named your name so much as once  did she name zephaniahs i make no doubt that anxiety on account of her uncle was her chief care what are her intentions and will she remain near that tree until you come  she stays under a rock not a great way from the tree and there shell stay till i go to meet her at the chestnut we had our talk under that rock and its easy enough to find her there  how do things look around us might i descend slip down into the bed of the river and go round to dus malbone so as to give her notice of the danger she is in  lowiny did not answer me for near a minute and i began to fear that i had put another indiscreet question the girl seemed thoughtful but when she raised her face so high as to allow me to see it all the expression of the more generous feminine sympathy was visible  twould be hard to make dus have zeph if she dont like him wouldnt it she said with emphasis i dont know but twould be better to let her know whats coming so that she can choose for herself  she told me i answered with perfect truth that she is engaged to another and it would be worse than cruelit would be wicked to make her marry one man while she loves another  she shant dot cried the girl with an animation that i thought dangerous but she gave me no opportunity for remonstrance as all her energies being roused she went to work in earnest to put me in the way of doing what i most desired to achieve  dye see the lower corner of the mill she continued hurriedly that post goes down to the rock over which the water falls you can walk to that corner without any danger of being seen as the ruff hides you and when you get there you can wait till i tell you to get on the post t will be easy to slide down that post to the rock and therell be not much of a chance of being seen as the post will nearly hide you when youre on the rock youll find a path that leads along the creek till you come to a footbridge if you cross that log and take the lefthand path twill bring you out near the edge of the clearin up on the hill again and then youll have only to follow the edge of the woods a little way afore you come to the chestnut the rock is right off agin the chestnut only about fifty rods  i took in these directions eagerly and was at the post almost as soon as the girl ceased speaking in order to do this i had only to walk on the boards that lay scattered about on the girts of the mill the roof completely concealing the movement from any on its outside i made my arrangements and only waited for a signal or the direction from lowiny to proceed  not yet said the girl looking down and affecting to be occupied with something near her feet father and tobit are walkin this way and lookin right at the mill nowget readytheyve turned their heads and seem as if theyd turn round themselves next theyve turned agin wait one momentnows a good timedont go away altogether without my seein you once more  i heard these last words but it was while sliding down the post just as my head came so low as to be in a line with the objects scattered about the floor of the mill i clung to the post to catch one glimpse of what was going on without thousandacres and tobit were about a hundred yards distant walking apart from the group of young men and apparently in deep consultation together it was quite evident no alarm was taken and down i slid to the rock at the next moment i was in the path descending to the footbridge a tree that had been felled across the stream until that tree was crossed and a slight distance of the ascent on the other side of the stream along the lefthand path was overcome i was completely exposed to the observation of any one who might be in a situation to look down into the glen of the river at almost any other moment at that particular season my discovery would have been nearly certain as some of the men or boys were always at work in the water but the events of that morning called them elsewhere and i made the critical passage a distance of two hundred yards or more in safety as soon as i entered behind a cover my speed abated and having risen again to the level of the dwellings or even a little above them i profited by openings among the small pinebushes that fringed the path to take a survey of the state of things among the squatters  there the cluster of heavy lounging young men was thousandacres and tobit walking apart as when last seen prudence was at the door of a distant cabin surrounded as usual by a collection of the young fry and conversing herself eagerly with the wives of two or three of her married sons lowiny had left the mill and was strolling along the opposite side of the glen so near the verge of the rocks as to have enabled her to see the whole of my passage across the open space perceiving that she was quite alone i ventured to hem just loud enough to reach her ear a hurried frightened gesture assured me that i had been heard and first making a gesture for me to go forward the girl turned away and went skipping off toward the cluster of females who surrounded her mother  as for myself i now thought only of dus what cared i if she did love another a girl of her education manners sentiments birth and character was not to be sacrificed to one like zephaniah let what might happen and could i reach her place of concealment in time she might still be saved these thoughts fairly winged my flight and i soon came in sight of the chestnut three minutes later i laid a hand on the trunk of the tree itself as i had been a quarter of an hour at least in making the circuit of that side of the clearing some material change might have occurred among the squatters and i determined to advance to the edge of the bushes in lowinys berry lot which completely screened the spot and ascertain the facts before i sought dus at her rock  the result showed that some measures had been decided on between thousandacres and tobit not one of the males a lad that stood sentinel at the storehouse and a few of the smaller boys excepted was to be seen i examined all the visible points with care but no one was visible even susquesus who had been lounging about the whole day or since his liberation had vanished prudence and her daughters too were in a great commotion hurrying from cabin to cabin and manifesting all that restlessness which usually denotes excitement among females i stopped but a moment to ascertain these leading circumstances and turned to seek the rock while retiring from among the bushes i heard the fallen branch of a tree snap under a heavy footstep and looking cautiously around saw jaaf or jaap as we commonly called him advancing toward me carrying a rifle on each shoulder  heavens blessings on you my faithful jaap i cried holding out an arm to receive one of the weapons you come at a most happy moment and can lead me to miss malbone  yes sah and glad to do it too miss dus up here a bit in e wood and can werry soon see her she keep me down here to look out and i carry bot rifle masser chainbearers and my own cause miss dus no great hand wid gunpowder but where you come from masser mordauntand why you run away so in nighttime  never mind just now jaapin proper time you shall know all about it now we must take care of miss ursula is she uneasy has she shown any fear on her uncles account  she cry half e time sahden she look up bold and resolute just like ole massar sah when he tell he rijjement charge baggonet and seem as if she want to go right into tousandacres huts lor bless me sah masser mordauntif she ask me one question about you today she ask me a hundred  about me jaap but i arrested the impulsive feeling in good time so as not to be guilty of pumping my own servant concerning what others had said of me a meanness i could not easily have pardoned in myself but i increased my speed and having jaap for my guide was soon at the side of dus the negro had no sooner pointed out to me the object of my search than he had the discretion to return to the edge of the clearing carrying with him both rifles for i returned to him the one i had taken in my eagerness to hurry forward the instant i beheld dus  i can never forget the look with which that frank noblehearted girl received me it almost led me to hope that my ears had deceived me and that after all i was an object of the highest interest with her a few tears halfsuppressed but suppressed with difficulty accompanied that look and i had the happiness of holding for some time and of pressing to my heart that little hand that was freelynay warmly extended to me  let us quit this spot at once dearest ursula i cried the moment i could speak it is not safe to remain near that family of wretches who live by depredation and violence  and leave uncle chainbearer in their hands answered dus reproachfully you surely would not advise me to do that  if your own safety demands it yesa thousand times yes we must fly and there is not a moment to lose a design exists among those wretches to seize you and to make use of your fears to secure the aid of your uncle in extricating them from the consequences of this discovery of their robberies it is not safe i repeat for you to remain a minute longer here  the smile that dus now bestowed on me was very sweet though i found it inexplicable for it had as much of pain and suffering in it as it had of that which was winning  mordaunt littlepage have you forgotten the words spoken by me when we last parted she asked seriously  forgotten i can never forget them they drove me nearly to despair and were the cause of bringing us all into this difficulty  i told you that my faith was already plightedthat i could not accept your noble frank generous manly offer because another had my troth  you didyou did why renew my misery  it is with a different object that i am now more explicit that man to whom i am pledged is in those huts and i cannot desert him  can i believe my senses do youcan youis it possible that one like ursula malbone can love zephaniah thousandacresa squatter himself and the son of a squatter  the look with which dus regarded me said at once that her astonishment was quite as great as my own i could have bitten off my hasty and indiscreet tongue the instant it had spoken and i am sure the rush of telltale blood in my face must have proclaimed to my companion that i felt most thoroughly ashamed of myself this feeling was deepened nearly to despair when i saw the expression of abased mortification that came over the sweet and usually happy countenance of dus and the difficulty she had in suppressing her tears  neither spoke for a minute when my companion broke silence by saying steadilyi might almost add solemnly  this indeed shows how low my fortune has become but i pardon you mordaunt for humble as that fortune is you have spoken nobly and frankly in my behalf and i exonerate you from any feeling that is not perfectly natural for the circumstances perhapsand a bright blush suffused the countenance of dus as she said itperhaps i may attribute the great mistake into which you have fallen to a passion that is most apt to accompany strong love and insomuch prize it instead of throwing it away with contempt but between you and me whatever comes of it there must be no more mistakes the man to whom my faith is plighted and to whom my time and services are devoted so long as one or both of us live is uncle chainbearer and no other had you not rushed from me in the manner you did i might have told you this mordaunt the evening you were showing so much noble frankness yourself  dusursulabeloved miss malbone have i then no preferred rival  no man has ever spoken to me of love but this uncouth and rude young squatter and yourself  is your heart then untouched are you still mistress of your own affections  the look i now received from dus was a little saucy but that expression soon changed to one that had more of the deep feeling and generous sympathy of her precious sex in it  were i to answer yes many women would think i was being no more than true to the rights of a girl who has been so unceremoniously treated but  but what charming most beloved ursula but what  i prefer truth to coquetry and shall not attempt to deny what it would almost be treason against nature to suppose how could a girl educated as i have been without any preference to tie her to another be shut up in this forest with a man who has treated her with so much kindness and devotion and manly tenderness and insensible to his merits were we in the world mordaunt i think i should prefer you to all others being as we are in this forest i know i do  the reader shall not be let into the sacred confidence that followed any further at least than to know the main result a quarter of an hour passed so swiftly and so sweetly indeed that i could hardly take it on myself to record onehalf that was said dus made no longer any hesitation in declaring her attachment for me and though she urged her own poverty as a just obstacle to my wishes it was faintly as most americans of either sex would do in this particular at least we may fairly boast of a just superiority over all the countries of the old world while it is scarcely possible that either man or woman should not see how grave a barrier to wedded happiness is interposed by the opinions and habits of social castes it is seldom that any one in his or her own proper sphere feels that the want of money is an insurmountable obstacle to a unionmore especially when one of the parties is provided with the means of maintaining the household gods the seniors may and do often have scruples on this score but the young people rarely dus and myself were in the complete enjoyment of this happy simplicity with my arms around her waist and her head leaning on my shoulder when i was aroused from a state that i fancied elysium by the hoarse raventhroated cry of  here she is here she is father here they are both  on springing forward to face the intruders i saw tobit and zephaniah directly before me with lowiny standing at no great distance behind them the first looked ferocious the second jealous and angry the third abashed and mortified in another minute we were surrounded by thousandacres and all the males of his brood     chapter xxiv      my love is youngbut other loves are young       and other loves are fair and so is mine     an air divine discloses whence he sprung       he is my love that boasts that air divineshenstone   a more rude and violent interruption of a scene in which the more gentle qualities love to show themselves never occurred i who knew the whole of the past saw at once that we had very serious prospects before us but dus at first felt only the consciousness and embarrassment of a woman who has betrayed her most sacred secret to vulgar eyes that very passion which a month later and after the exchange of the marriage vows it would have been her glory to exhibit in face of the whole community on the occurrence of any event of moment to myself she now shrunk from revealing and i do believe that maiden bashfulness gave her more pain when thus arrested than any other cause as for the squatters she probably had no very clear conceptions of their true characters and it was one of her liveliest wishes to be able to join her uncle but thousandacres soon gave us both cause to comprehend how much he was now in earnest  so my young major youre catched in the same nest be you youve your chise to walk peaceably back where you belong or to be tied and carried there like a buck that has been killed a little out in the woods you never knowd thousandacres and his race if you really thought to slip away from him and that with twenty miles of woods around you  i intimated a wish not to be tied and professed a perfect willingness to accompany my captors back to their dwellings for nothing would have tempted me to desert dus under the circumstances the squatters might have declared the road open to me but the needle does not point more unerringly to the pole than i should have followed my magnet though at liberty  little more was said until we had quitted the woods and had reached the open fields of the clearing i was permitted to assist my companion through the bushes and in climbing a fence or two the squatters who were armed to a man forming a circle around us at a distance that enabled me to whisper a few words to dus in the way of encouragement she had great natural intrepidity for a woman and i believe i ought to escape the imputation of vanity if i add that we both felt so happy at the explanations which had so lately been had that this new calamity could not entirely depress us so long as we were not separated  be not downhearted dearest dus i whispered as we approached the storehouse after all these wretches will not dare to transgress against the law very far  i have few fears with you and uncle chainbearer so near me mordaunt was her smiling answer it cannot be long before we hear from frank who is gone as you must have been told to ravensnest for authority and assistance he left our huts at the same time we left them to come here and must be on his return long before this  i squeezed the hand of the dear girl receiving a gentle pressure in return and prepared myself to be separated from her as i took it for granted that prudence and her daughters would hold watch and ward over the female prisoner i had hesitated ever since quitting the woods about giving her notice of the trial that probably awaited her but as no attempt to coerce a marriage could be made until the magistrate arrived i thought it would be rendering her unnecessarily unhappy the trial if it did come at all would come soon enough of itself and i had no apprehension that one of duss spirit and character and who had so recently and frankly admitted that her whole heart was mine could be frightened into a concession that would give zephaniah any claim to her to own the truth a mountain had been removed from my own breast and i was too happy on this particular account to be rendered very miserable on any other just at that time i do believe dus was a little sustained by some similar sentiment  dus and i parted at the door of the first house she being transferred to the keeping of tobits wife a woman who was well bestowed on her brutal and selfish husband no violence was used however toward the prisoner who was permitted to go at large though i observed that one or two of the females attached themselves to her person immediately no doubt as her keepers  in consequence of our having approached the dwelling of the squatters by a new path chainbearer knew nothing of the arrest of his niece until the fact was communicated by me he was not even aware of my being retaken until he saw me about to enter the prison again though he probably anticipated that such might be my fate as for susquesus he seldom manifested surprise or emotion of any sort let what would occur  well mortaunt my lat i knowet you had vanishet py hook or py crook ant nopoty knowet how put i tought you would find it hart to trow tese rascally squatters off your trail cried andries giving me a hearty shake of the hand as i entered the prison here we are all tree of us agin and its lucky were such goot frients as our quarters are none of te largest or pest the injin fount i was alone so he took pack his parole and ist a close prisoner like te rest of us put in one sense a free man you can tig up te hatchet agin tese squatters whenever you please now is it not so sureflint  sartintruce donesusquesus prisoner like everybody give tousandacres prole back agininjin free man now  i understood the onondagos meaning well enough though his freedom was of a somewhat questionable character he merely wished to say that having given himself up to the squatters he was released from the conditions of his parole and was at liberty to make his escape or to wage war on his captors in any manner he saw fit luckily jaap had escaped for i could see no signs of even his presence being known to thousandacres or to his sons it was something to have so practised a woodsman and so true a friend still at large and near us and the information he could impart should he fall in with frank malbone with the constable and the posse might be of the utmost service to us all these points chainbearer and i discussed at large the indian sitting by an attentive but a silent listener it was our joint opinion that malbone could not now be very far distant with succor what would be the effect of an attack on the squatters it was not easy to predict since the last might make battle and small as was their force it would be likely to prove very available in a struggle of that nature the females of such a family were little less efficient than the males when posted behind logs and there were a hundred things in which their habits experience and boldness might be made to tell should matters be pushed to extremities  got knowsgot only knows mortaunt what will come of it all rejoined

promised all parties that are interested consenting to become at some early day my wife  old andries heard my energetic exclamation with astonishment and even the indian turned his head to look on me with a gratified attention perceiving that i had gone so far under an impulse i had found irresistible i felt the necessity of being still more explicit and of communicating all i had to say on the subject  yes i added grasping old andries by the handyes chainbearer i shall comply with your oftenexpressed wishes again and again have you recommended your lovely niece to me as a wife and i come now to take you at your word and to say that nothing will make me so happy as to be able to call you uncle  to my surprise chainbearer expressed no delight at this announcement i remarked that he had said nothing to me on his favorite old subject of my marrying his niece since my arrival at the nest and now when i was not only so ready but so anxious to meet his wishes i could plainly see that he drew back from my proposals and wished they had not been made amazed i waited for him to speak with a disappointment and uneasiness i cannot express  mortaunt mortaunt at length broke out of the old

defer our matter then you remembering that i agree to none of your opinions or decisions dus is to be mine if indeed we can protect her against the grasp of these wretches i have something to say on that subject too but this is not the moment to utter it  chainbearer seized my hand and gave it a friendly pressure which terminated the discourse on the subject of the intentions of thousandacres toward dus i was now not altogether free from uneasiness though the tumult of rapturous feeling through which i had just passed drove it temporarily from my mind i had no apprehensions that ursula malbone would ever be induced by ordinary means to become the wife of zephaniah but i trembled as to what might be the influence of menaces against her uncle and myself nor was i altogether easy on the score of the carrying out of those menaces it often happens with crime as in the commission of ordinary sins that men are impelled by circumstances which drive them to deeds from which they would have recoiled in horror had the consummation been directly presented to their minds without the intervention of any mediate causes but the crisis was evidently approaching and i waited with as much calmness as i could assume for its development as for chainbearer being still ignorant of the conversation i had overheard in the mill he had no apprehensions of evil from the source of my greatest dread  the day had advanced all this time and the sun had set and night was close upon us as tobit and his brethren came to the door of our prison and called upon chainbearer and myself to come forth leaving susquesus behind we obeyed with alacrity for there was a species of liberty in being outside of those logs with my limbs unfettered though a vigilant watch was kept over us both on each side of me walked an armed man and chainbearer was honored with a similar guard for all this old andries cared but little he knew and i knew that the time could not be very distant when we might expect to hear from frank malbone and every minute that went by added to our confidence in this respect  we were about halfway between the storehouse and the dwelling of thousandacres toward which our steps were directed when andries suddenly stopped and asked leave to say a word to me in private tobit was at a loss how to take this request but there being an evident desire to keep on reasonably good terms with chainbearer after a short pause he consented to form an extended ring with his brothers leaving me and my old friend in its centre  ill tell you what i tink atvisaple in tis matter commenced andries in a sort of whisper it cannot pe long afore malpone will be pack wit te posse ant constaples ant so fort now if we tell tese rapscallions tat we want taylight to meet our inimies in ant tat we haf no stomach for nightwork perhaps teyll carry us pack to jail ant so gif more time to frank to get here  it will be much better chainbearer to prolong our interview with these squatters so that you and i may be at large or at least not shut up in the storehouse when malbone makes his appearance in the confusion we may even escape and join our friends which will be a thousand times better than to be found within four walls  andries nodded his head in sign of acquiescence and thenceforth he seemed to aim at drawing things out in order to gain time instead of bringing them to a speedy conclusion as soon as our discourse was ended the young men closed round us again and we moved on in a body  darkness being so close upon us thousandacres had determined to hold his court this time within the house having a care to a sufficient watchfulness about the door there is little variation in the internal distribution of the room of what may be called an american cottage about twothirds of the space is given to the principal apartment which contains the fireplace18 and is used for all the purposes of kitchen and sittingroom while the rest of the building is partitioned into three several subdivisions one of these subdivisions is commonly a small bedroom another is the buttery and the third holds the stairs or ladders by which to ascend to the loft or to descend to the cellar such was the arrangement of the dwelling of thousandacres and such is the arrangement in thousands of other similar buildings throughout the land the thriving husbandman is seldom long contented however with such narrow and humble accommodations but the framed house of two stories in height and with five windows in front usually soon succeeds this cottage in his case it is rare indeed that any american private edifice has more than five windows in front the few exceptions which do exist to the rule being residences of mark and the supernumerary windows are generally to be found in wings some of our old solid substantial stone country houses occasionally stretch themselves out to eight or nine apertures of this sort but they are rare i cannot gossip here however about country houses and windows when i have matters so grave before me to relate  footnote 18 at the present day the cookingstove has nearly superseded the open fireplace  in the forest and especially in the newer portions of new york the evenings are apt to be cool even in the warm months that memorable night i well remember had a sharpness about it that threatened even a frost and prudence had lighted a fire on the yawning hearth of her rude chimney by the cheerful blaze of that fire which was renewed from time to time by dried brush the american frontier substitute for the fagot were the scenes i am about to mention enacted  we found all the males and several of the females assembled in the large apartment of the building i have described when chainbearer and myself entered the wife of tobit with one or two of the sisterhood however were absent doubtless in attendance on dus lowiny i remarked stood quite near the fire and the countenance of the girl seemed to me to be saddened and thoughtful i trust i shall not be accused of being a coxcomb if i add that the idea crossed my mind that the appearance and manners of a youth so much superior to those with whom she was accustomed to associate had made a slight impression on this girlsi will not say heart for imagination would be the better wordand had awakened sympathies that manifested themselves in her previous conduct while the shade that was now cast across her brow came quite as much from the scene she had witnessed between myself and dus near the rock as from seeing me again a prisoner the friendship of this girl might still be of importance to me and still more so to ursula and i will acknowledge that the apprehension of losing it was far from pleasant i could only wait for the developments of time however in order to reach any certainty on this as well as on other most interesting topics  thousandacres had the civility to order us chairs and we took our seats accordingly on looking round the grave and attentive circle i could trace no new signs of hostility but on the contrary the countenances of all seemed more pacific than they were when we parted i considered this as an omen that i and my friend should receive some propositions that tended toward peace in this i was not mistaken the first words that were uttered having that character  its time this matter atween us chainbearer commenced thousandacres himself should be brought to suthin like an eend it keeps the bys from their lumberin and upsets my whull family i call myself a reasonable man and be as ready to settle a difficulty on as accommodatin tarms as any parson youll find by lookin up and down the land many is the difficulty that ive settled in my day and im not too old to settle em now sometimes ive fit out when ive fell in with an obstinate fellow sometimes ive left it out to men and sometimes ive settled matters myself no man can say he ever knowd me refuse to hearken to reason or knowd me to gin up a just cause so long as there was a morsel of a chance to defend it when overpowered by numbers and lookd down by your accursed law as you call it ill own that once or twice in my time when young and inexperenced i did get the worst of it and so was obliged to sort o run away but use makes parfect ive seen so much by seventy odd as to have larnt to take time by the forelock and dont practyse delays in business i look upon you chainbearer as a man much like myself reasonable experenced and willin to accommodate i see no great difficulty therefore in settlin this matter on the spot so as to have no more hard feelins or hot words atween us sich be my notions and i should like to hear yourn  since you speak to me tousantacres in so polite and civil a manner im reaty to hear you ant to answer in te same temper returned old andries his countenance losing much of the determined and angry expression with which he had taken his seat in the circle tere ist nuttin tat more pecomes a man

think alike about the young woman chainbearer and trust and believe shell be the means of reconciling all parties and of making us good frinds ive sent for the gal and shell soon be coming along with tobits wife who sets by her wonderfully already  well talkin of wonterful tings wonters wilt never cease i do pelieve chainbearer exclaimed for he really believed that the family of the squatter was taken suddenly with a religious turn and that something like a conversion was about to occur yes yes it ist so we meet wit wonters when we least expect em and tat it is tat makes wonters so wonterful     chapter xxv      yes hastings these are they       who challenge to themselves thy countrys love     the true the constant who alone can weigh       what glory should demand or liberty approve      akenside   a pause succeeded this little opening during which the assembly was waiting for the arrival of ursula malbone and the semisavage guardian that set so much by her as not to leave her out of sight for a moment all that time thousandacres was ruminating on his own plans while old andries was probably reflecting on the singular circumstances that wonters shoult pe so wonterful at length a little bustle and movement occurred near the door the crowd collected in it opened and dus walked into the centre of the room her color heightened by excitement but her step firm and her air full of spirit at first the blazing light affected her sight and she passed a hand over her eyes then looking around i met her gaze and was rewarded for all my anxiety by one of those glances into which affection knows how to infuse so much that is meaning and eloquent i was thus favored for a moment only those eyes still turning until they met the fond answering look of chainbearer the old man had arisen and he now received his niece in his arms as a parent would embrace a beloved child  that outpouring of feeling lasted but a little while it had been unpremeditated and impulsive and was almost as suddenly suppressed it gave me however the happiness of witnessing one of the most pleasant sights that man can behold that of youth and beauty and delicacy and female tenderness pouring out their feelings on the bosom of ageon the ruder qualities of one hardened in person by the exposures of a life passed in the forest to me the contrast between the fair golden hair of dus and the few straggling bleached locks of her uncle the downy peachlike cheek of the girl and the red wrinkled and sundried countenance of chainbearer was perfectly delightful it said how deep must lie those sympathies of our nature which could bring together so closely two so differently constituted in all things and set at defiance the apparent tendencies of taste and habit  dus suffered herself to be thus carried away by her feelings for only a moment accustomed in a degree as she certainly was to the rough associations of the woods this was the first time she had ever been confronted with such an assembly and i could see that she drew back into herself with womanly reserve as she now gazed around her and saw in what a wild and unwonted presence she stood still i had never seen her look so supremely lovely as she did that evening for she threw pris bayard and kate with all their advantages of dress and freedom from exposure far into the shade perhaps the life of ursula malbone had given to her beauty the very completeness and fullness that are most apt to be wanting to the young american girl who has been educated in the overtender and delicate manner of our ordinary parental indulgence of air and exercise she had already enjoyed enough and they had imparted to her bloom and person the richness and development that are oftener found in the subordinate than in the superior classes of the country  as for thousandacres though he watched every movement of ursula malbone with jealous interest he said nothing to interrupt the current of her feelings as soon as she left her uncles arms however dus drew back and took the rude seat that i had placed for her close to chainbearers side i was paid for this little act of attention by a sweet smile from its subject and a lowering look from the old squatter that admonished me of the necessity of being cautious of manifesting too much of the interest i felt in the beloved object before me as is usual in assemblages composed of the rude and unpractised a long awkward pause succeeded this introduction of dus to our presence after a time however aaron resumed the subject in hand  weve met to settle all our difficulties as i was sayin observed thousandacres in a manner as deliberative and considerate as if he were engaged in one of the most blameless pursuits of life the outward appearances of virtue and vice possessing a surprising resemblance to each other when men get together on sich a purpose and in a right spirit it must be that theres a fault somewhere if whats right cant be come at atween em whats right atwixt man and man is my creed chainbearer  whats right petween man ant man is a goot creet tousantacres ant its a goot religion too answered andries coldly  that it is that it is and i now see that youre in a reasonable temper chainbearer and that theres a prospect of business in you i despise a man thats so set in his notions that theres no gettin him to give in an inch in a transactiondont you hold to that too captain andries  tat depents on what te notions pe some notions do nopoty any goot ant te sooner were rit of em te petter while some notions pe so fery excellent tat a man hat pest lay town his life as lay tem town  this answer puzzled thousandacres who had no idea of a mans ever dying for opinions sake and who was probably anxious just at that moment to find his companion sufficiently indifferent to principle to make some sacrifices to expediency it was quite evident this man was disposed to practise a ruse on this occasion that is often resorted to by individuals and sometimes by states when disposed to gain a great advantage out of a very small right that of demanding much more than they expect to receive and of making a great merit of yielding points that they never had the smallest claim to maintain but this disposition of the squatters will make itself sufficiently apparent as we proceed  i dont see any use in talkin about layin down lives thousandacres returned to chainbearers remark seein this is not a life and death transaction at all the most that can be made of squattin give the law its full swing is trespass and damages and them ant matters to frighten a man that has stood out agin em all his days were pretty much sich critturs as sarcumstances make us there be men i dont question that a body can skear half out of their wits with a writ while a whull flock of sheep skins and wool united wunt intimidate them thats used to sich things i go on the principle of doin whats right let the law say what it will of the matter and this is the principle on which i wish to settle our present difficulty  name your tarmsname your tarms cried chainbearer a little impatiently talkin ist talkin all te worlt ofer ant actin ist actin if you haf anyting to propose here we are reaty ant willin to hear it  thats hearty and just my way of thinkin and feelin and ill act up to it though it was the gospel of st paul himself and i was set on followin it here then is the case and any man can understand it theres two rights to all the land on arth and the whull world over one of these rights is what i call a kings right or that which depends on writins and laws and sichlike contrivances and the other depends on possession it stands to reason that fact is better than any writin about it can be but im willin to put em on a footin for the time bein and for the sake of accommodatin i go all for accommodatin matters and not for stirrin up ill blood and that i tell chainbearer bys is the right spirit to presarve harmony and frindship  this appeal was rewarded by a murmur of general approbation in all that part of the audience which might be supposed to be in the squatter interest while the part that might be called adverse remained silent though strictly attentive old andries included  yes thats my principles resumed thousandacres taking a hearty draught of cider a liquor of which he had provided an ample allowance passing the mug civilly to chainbearer as soon as he had his swallow yes thats my principles and good principles they be for them that likes peace and harmony as all must allow now in this matter afore us general littlepage and his partner ripresents writins and i and mine ripresent fact i dont say which is the best for i dont want to be hard on any mans rights and specially when the accommodatin spirit is up and doin but im fact and the ginrals pretty much writins but difficulties has sprung up atwixt us and its high time to put em down i look upon you chainbearer as the frind of the tother owners of this sile and im now ready to make proposals or to hear them just as it may prove convenient  i haf no proposals to make nor any autority to offer tem im nutin here put a chainpearer wit a contract to survey te patent into small lots ant ten my tuty ist tone put here ist general littlepages only son ant he ist empoweret i unterstant to do all tat is necessary on tis tract as te attorney  he is and he isnt an attorney interrupted thousandacres a little fiercely for one in whom the accommodatin spirit is up at one moment he says hes an attorney and at the next he isnt i cant stand this onsartainty any very great while  pooh pooh tousantacres returned chainbearer coolly youre frightenet at your own shadow ant tat comes let me telt you from not lifing in peace and harmony as you call it yourself wit te law a man hast a conscience wheter he pe a skinner or a cowboy or efen a squatter and he hast it pecause got has gifen it to him and not on account of any sarfices of his own tat conscience it is tat makes my young frient mortaunt here an attorney in your eyes when he ist no more of a lawyer tan you pe yourself  why has he called himself an attorney then and why do you call him one an attorney is an attorney in my eyes and little difference is there atween em rattlesnakes would fare better in a clearin of thousandacres than the smartest attorney in the land  well well haf your own feelins for i spose satan has put em into you ant talkin wont pring tem out tis young gentleman however ist no attorney of te sort you mean old squatter put he hast been a soltier like myself ant in my own regiment which wast his faters ant a prave young man he ist ant wast ant one tat has fout gallantly for liperty  if hes a frind of liberty he should be a frind of libertys people should give liberty and take liberty now i call it liberty to let every man have as much land as he has need on and no more keepin the rest for them thats in the same situation if he and his father be true frinds of liberty let em prove it like men by giving up all claims to any more land than they want thats what i call liberty let every man have as much land as hes need on thats my religion and its liberty too19  footnote 19 i am a little apprehensive that the profound political philosophers who have sprung up among us within a few years including some in high places and who virtually maintain that the american is so ineffably free that it is opposed to the spirit of the institutions of the country to suffer him to be either landlord or tenant however much he may desire it himself and no one pretends that either law or facts compel him to be either contrary to his own wishes will feel mortified at discovering that they have not the merit of first proposing their own exquisite theory aaron thousandacres having certainly preceded them by sixty years there is no great secret on the subject of the principle which lies at the bottom of this favorite doctrine the deity himself having delivered to man as far back as the days of moses the tenth commandment with the obvious design of controlling it an attempt to prove that the institutions of this country are unsuited to the relations of landlord and tenant is an attempt to prove that they are unsuited to meet the various contingencies of human affairs and is an abandonment of their defence as that defence can only be made on broad manly and justifiable grounds as a political principle it is just as true that the relations of debtor and creditor are unsuited to the institutions and ought to be abolishededitor  why are you so moterate tousantacres why are you so unreasonaply moterate why not say tat efery man hast a right to efery thing he hast need of and so make him comfortaple at once tere is no wistom in toin tings by hafs ant it ist always petter to surfey all te lant you want while te compass is set ant te chains pe going its just as much liperty to haf a right to share in a mans tollars as to share in his lants  i dont go as far as that chainbearer put in thousandacres with a degree of moderation that ought to put the enemies of his principles to the blush money is what a man arns himself and he has a right to it and so i say let him keep it but land is necessary and every man has a right to as much as he has need oni wouldnt give him an acre more on no account at all  put money wilt puy lant ant in sharin te tollars you share te means of puyin as much lant as a man hast neet of ten tere ist a great teal more lant ast money in tis country ant in gifin a man

some people lofe teir own hills ant rocks ant treeswhen tey haf peen long in a family most especially  there was a dark scowl gathering on the brow of thousandacres partly because he felt himself puzzled by the upright and straightforward common sense of chainbearer and partly for a reason that he himself made manifest in the answer that he quite promptly gave to my old friends remarks  no man need say anything agin squattin that wants to keep frinds with me thousandacres put in with certain twitchings about the muscles of the mouth that were so many signs of his being in earnest i hold to liberty and a mans rights and that is no reason i should be deflected on my notions be other mens notions i know though they be called squatters notions congressmen have held em and will hold em agin if they expect much support in some parts of the country at election time i dare say the day will come when governors will be found to hold em governors be but men ater all and must hold doctrines that satisfy mens wants or they wont be governors long20 but all this is nuthin but talk and i want to come to suthin like business chainbearer heres this clearin and heres the lumber now im willin to settle on some sich tarms as these ill keep the lumber carryin it off as soon as the water gets to be high enough agreein to pay for the privilege by not fellin another tree though i must have the right to saw up sich logs as be cut and hauled already and then as to the land and clearin if the writin owners want em they can have em by payin for the betterments leavin the price out to men in this neighborhood sin citybred folks cant know nothin of the toil and labor of choppin and loggin and ashin and gettin in and croppin new lands  footnote 20 thousandacres speaks here like a veritable propheteditor  mortaunt tat proposal ist for you i haf nutin to do wit te clearin put to surfey it and tat much will i perform when i get as far ast te place come tere goot or come tere efil of it  survey this clearin put in tobit with his raven throat and certainly in a somewhat menacing tone no no chainbearerthe man is not out in the woods that could ever get his chain across this clearin  tat man i tell you is andries coejemans commonly called chainpearer answered my old friend calmly no clearin ant no squatter ever stoppet him yet nor do i tink he will pe stoppet here from performin his tuty put praggin is a pat quality ant well leaf time to show te trut  thousandacres gave a loud hem and looked very dark though he said nothing until time had been given to his blood to resume its customary current then he pursued the discourse as followsevidently bent on keeping on good terms with chainbearer as long as possible  on the whull he said i rather think tobit twill be best if you leave this matter altogether to me years cool the blood and allow time to reason to spread years be as necessary to judgment as a top to a fruittree i kind o blieve that chainbearer and i being both elderly and considerate men will be apt to get along best together i dare say chainbearer that if the surveyin of this clearin be put to you on the footin of defiance that your back would get up like anybody elses and youd bring on the chain let who might stand in your way but thats neither here nor there youre welcome to chain out just as much of this part of the patent as you see fit and twill help us along so much the better when we come to the trade reasons reason and im of an accommodatin spirit  so much te better tousantacres yes so much te better answered old andries somewhat mollified by the conciliatory temper in which the squatter now delivered himself when work ist to pe performet it must pe performet ant as im hiret to surfey and chain te whole estate te whole estate must be chainet ant surfeyet well what else haf you to say  i am not answered as to my first offer ill take the lumber agreein not to cut another tree and the valie of the betterments can be left out to men  i am the proper person to answer this proposal i thought it now right to say lest andries and thousandacres should get to loggerheads again on some minor and immaterial point and thus endanger every hope of keeping the peace until malbone could arrive at the same time i consider it no more than right to tell you at once that i have no power that goes so far as to authorize me to agree to your terms both colonel follock and my father have a stern sense of justice and neither in my opinion will feel much of a disposition to yield to any conditions that in the least may have the appearance of compromising any of their rights as landlords i have heard them both say that in these particulars yielding an inch would be giving an ell and i confess that from all i have seen lately of settlers and settlements im very much of the same way of thinking my principals may concede something but theyll never treat on a subject of which all the right is on their own side  am i to understand you young man that youre onaccommodatin and that my offers isnt to be listened to in the spirit in which theyre made demanded thousandacres somewhat dryly  you are to understand me as meaning exactly what i say sir in the first place i have no authority to accept your offers and shall not assume any let the consequences to myself be what they may indeed any promises made in duresse are good for nothing  anan cried the squatter this is mooseridge patent and washington late charlotte countyand this is the place we are to sign and seal in if writins pass atween us  by promises made in duresse i mean promises made while the party making them is in confinement or not absolutely free to make them or not such promises are good for nothing in law even though all the writings that could be drawn passed between the parties  this is strange doctrine and says but little for your boasted law then at one time it asks for writins and nothin but writins will answer and then all the writins on arth be of no account yet some folks complain and have hard feelins if a man wunt live altogether up to law  i rather think thousandacres you overlook the objects of the law in its naked regulations law is to enforce the right and were it to follow naked rules without regard to principles it might become the instrument of effecting the very mischiefs it is designed to counteract  i might have spared myself the trouble of uttering this fine speech which caused the old squatter to stare at me in wonder and produced a smile among the young men and a titter among the females i observed however that the anxious face of lowiny expressed admiration rather than the feeling that was so prevalent among the sisterhood  theres no use in talkin to this young spark chainbearer thousandacres said a little impatiently in the way of manner too hes passed his days in the open country and has got opencountry ways and notions and talk and thems things i dont pretend to understand youre woods mainly hes open country and im clearin theres a difference atween each but woods and clearin come clussest and so ill say my say to you be you now rally disposed to accommodate or not old andries  any ting tat ist right ant just ant reasonaple tousantacres ant nutin tat ist not  thats just my way of thinkin if the law now would do as much as that for a man the attorneys would soon starve waal well try now to come to tarms as soon as possible youre a single man i know chainbearer but ive always supposed twas on account of no dislike to the married state but because you didnt chance to light on the right gal or maybe on account of the surveyin principle which keeps a man pretty much movin about from tract to tract though not much more than squattin doos neither if the matter was inquired into  i understood the object of this sudden change from feesimples and possessions and the accommodatin spirit to matrimony but chainbearer did not he only looked his surprise while as to myself if i looked at all as i felt i must have been the picture of uneasiness the beloved unconscious dus sat there in her maiden beauty interested and anxious in her mind beyond all question but totally ignorant of the terrible blow that was meditated against herself as andries looked his desire to hear more instead of answering the strange remark he had just heard thousandacres proceeded its quite natral to think of matrimony afore so many young folks isnt it chainbearer added the squatter chuckling at his own conceits heres lots of bys and gals about me and im just as accommodatin in findin husbands or wives for my frinds and neighbors as i am in settlin all other difficulties anything for peace and a good neighborhood is my religion  old andries passed a hand over his eyes in the way one is apt to do when he wishes to aid a mental effort by external application it was evident he was puzzled to find out what the squatter would be at though he soon put a question that brought about something like an explanation  i tont unterstant you tousantacresno i tont unterstant you is it your tesire to gif me one of your puxom ant finelookin gals here for a wife  the squatter laughed heartily at this notion the young men joining in the mirth while the constant titter that the females had kept up ever since the subject of matrimony was introduced was greatly augmented in zest an indifferent spectator would have supposed that the utmost good feeling prevailed among us  with all my heart chainbearer if you can persuade any of the gals to have you cried thousandacres with the most apparent acquiescence with such a soninlaw i dont know but i should take to the chain ater all and measure out my clearins as well as the grandee farmers who take pride in knowin where their lines be theres lowiny shes got no spark and might suit you well enough if shed only think so  lowiny dont think any sich thing and isnt likely to think any sich thing answered the girl in a quick irritated manner  waal i do spose ater all chainbearer thousandacres resumed well get no weddin out of you threescoreandten is somewhat late for takin a first wife though ive known widowers marry agin when hard on upon ninety when a man has taken one wife in arly life he has a kind o right to another in old age  yesyesor a hundred either put in prudence with spirit give em a chance only and theyll find wives as long as they can find breath to ask women to have em gals you may make up your minds to thatno man will mourn long for any on you ater youre once dead and buried  i should think this little sally must have been somewhat common as neither the bys nor the gals appeared to give it much attention these matrimonial insinuations occur frequently in the world and prudence was not the first woman by a million who had ventured to make them  i will own i was not so much thinkin of providin a wife for you chainbearer as i was thinkin of providin one for a son of mine continued thousandacres heres zephaniah now is as active and hardworkin upright honest and obedient a young man as can be found in this country hes of a suitable age and begins to think of a wife i tell him to marry by all means for its the blessedest condition of life is the married state that man ever entered into you wouldnt think it perhaps on lookin at old prudence there and beholdin what she now is but i speak from experence in recommendin matrimony and i wouldnt on no account say what i didnt really think in the matter a little matrimony might settle all our difficulties chainbearer  you surely do not expect me to marry your son zephaniah i must spose tousantacres answered andries innocently  the laugh this time was neither as loud or as general as before intense expectation rendering the auditors grave  no no ill excuse you from that of a sartainty old andries though you may have lowiny if you can only prevail on the gal but speakin of zephaniah i can rally ricommend the young man a thing id never do if he didnt desarve it though he is my son no one can say that im in the habit of ever ricommendin my own things even to the boards the lumber of thousandacres is as well known in all the markets below they tell me as the flour of any miller in the highest credit its just so with the bys better lads is not to be met with and i can ricommend zephaniah with just as much confidence as i could ricommend any lot of boards i ever rafted  and what haf i to do wit all tis asked chainbearer gravely  why the matter is here chainbearer if youll only look a little into it theres difficulty atween us and pretty serious difficulty too in me the accommodatin spirit is up as ive said afore and am willin to say agin now ive my son zeph here as ive said and hes lookin about for a wife and youve a niece heredus malbone i spose is her nameand theyd just suit each other it seems theyre acquainted somewhat and have kept company some time already and thatll make things smooth now what i offer is just this and no more not a bit of it i offer to send off for a magistrate and ill dot at my own expense it shant cost you a farthin and as soon as the magistrate comes well have the young folks married on the spot and that will make etarnal peace forever as you must suppose atween you and me waal peace made atween us twill leave but little to accommodate with the writin owners of the sile seein that you are on tarms with em all that a body may set you down all as one as bein of the same family like if ginral littlepage makes a pint of anything of the sort ill engage no one of my family in all futur time shall ever squat on any lands he may lay claim to whether he owns em or not  i saw quite plainly that at first chainbearer did not fully comprehend the nature of the squatters proposal neither did dus herself though somewhat prepared for such a thing by her knowledge of zephaniahs extravagant wishes on the subject but when thousandacres spoke plainly of sending for a magistrate and of having the young folks married on the spot it was not easy to mistake his meaning and astonishment was soon succeeded by offended pride in the breast of old andries and that to a degree and in a manner i had never before witnessed in him perhaps i ought in justice to my excellent friend to add that his high principles and keen sense of right were quite as much wounded by the strange proposal as his personal feelings it was some time before he could or would speak when he did it was with a dignity and severity of manner which i really had no idea he could assume the thought of ursula malbones being sacrificed to such a being as zephaniah and such a family as the squatters shocked all his sensibilities and appeared for a moment to overcome him on the other hand nothing was plainer than that the breed of thousandacres saw no such violation of the proprieties in their scheme the vulgar almost invariably in this country reduce the standard of distinction to mere money and in this respect they saw or fancied they saw that dus was not much better off than they were themselves all those points which depended on taste refinement education habits and principles were hebrew to them and quite as a matter of course they took no account of qualities they could neither see nor comprehend it is not surprising therefore that they could imagine the young squatter might make a suitable husband to one who was known to have carried chain in the forest  i pelieve i do begin to unterstant you tousantacres said the chainbearer rising from his chair and moving to the side of his niece as if instinctively to protect her tough it ist not a fery easy ting to comprehent such a proposal you wish ursula malpone to pecome te wife of zephaniah tousantacres ant tereupon you wish to patch up a peace wit general littlepage and colonel follock ant optain an intemnity for all te wrong ant roppery you have done em  harkee old chainbearer youd best be kearful of your language  hear what tat language ist to pe pefore you interrupt me tousantacres a wise man listens pefore he answers altough i haf nefer peen marriet myself i know what ist tecent in pehavior ant terefore i wilt tank you for te wish of pein connectet wit te coejemans ant te malpones tat tuty tone i wish to say tat my niece wilt not haf your poy  you havent given the gal a chance to speak for herself cried thousandacres at the top of his voice for he began to be agitated now with a fury that found a little vent in that manner you havent given the gal a chance to answer for herself old andries zeph is a lad that she may go farther and fare worse afore shell meet his equal i can tell you though perhaps bein the bys own father i shouldnt say itbut in the way of accommodatin im willin to overlook a great deal  zephaniahs an excellent son put in prudence in the pride and feeling of a mother nature having its triumph in her breast as well as in that of the most cultivated woman of the land of all my sons zephaniah is the best and i account him fit to marry with any who dont live in the open country and with many that do  praise your goots ant extol your poy if you see fit answered chainbearer with a calmness that i knew bespoke some desperate resolution praise your goots ant extol your poy ill not teny your right to do as much of tat as you wish put tis gal was left me py an only sister on her tyin pet ant may god forget me when i forget the tuty i owe to her she shalt nefer marry a son of tousantacresshe shalt nefer marry a squattershe shalt nefer marry any man tat ist not of a class ant feelins ant hapits and opinions fit to pe te huspant of a laty  a shout of derision in which was blended the fierce resentment of mortified pride arose among that rude crew but the thundering voice of thousandacres made itself audible even amid the hellish din  beware chainbearer beware how you aggravate us natur cant and wont bear everything  i want nutin of you or yours tousantacres calmly returned the old man passing his arm around the waist of dus who clung to him with a cheek that was flushed to fire but an eye that was not accustomed to quail and who seemed at that fearful moment every way ready and able to second her uncles efforts youre nutin to me ant ill leaf you here in your misteets ant wicket toughts stant asite i orter you do not tare to stop te broder who is apout to safe his sisters daghter from pecoming a squatters wife stant asite for ill stay wit you no longer an hour or two hence miseraple aaron youll see te folly of all tis ant wish you hat livet an honest man  by this time the clamor of voices became so loud and confused as to render it impossible to distinguish what was said thousandacres actually roared like a maddened bull and he was soon hoarse with uttering his menaces and maledictions tobit said less but was probably more dangerous all the young men seemed violently agitated and bent on closing the door on the exit of the chainbearer who with his arm around dus still slowly advanced waving the crowd aside and commanding them to make way for him with a steadiness and dignity that i began to think would really prevail in the midst of this scene of confusion a rifle suddenly flashed the report was simultaneous and old andries coejemans fell     chapter xxvi      ye midnight shades oer nature spread       dumb silence of the dreary hour     in honor of th approaching dead       around your awful terrors pour           yes pour around           on this pale ground     through all this deep surrounding gloom           the sober thought           the tear untaught     those meetest mourners at the tombmallet   it is a law of human nature that the excesses of passion bring their own rebukes the violence of man feeds itself until some enormity committed under its influence suddenly rises before the transgressor as the evidence of his blindness and the restorer of his senses guilt performs the office of reason staying the hand stilling the pulses and arousing the conscience  thus it seemed to be with the squatters of mooseridge a stillness so profound succeeded the crack of that rifle that i heard the stifled breathing of dus as she stood over the body of her uncle astounded and almost converted into a statue by the suddenness of the blow no one spoke no one attempted to quit the place in fact no one moved it was never known who fired that shot at first i ascribed it to the hand of tobit but it was owing more to what i knew of his temper and character than to what i knew of his acts at that particular time afterward i inclined to the opinion that my friend had fallen by the hand of thousandacres himself though there were no means of bringing it home to him by legal proof if any knew who was the criminal besides the wretch who executed the deed the fact was never revealed that family was faithful to itself and seemed determined to stand or fall together in the eye of the law all who were present aiding and abetting in the unlawful detention of dus and her uncle were equally guilty but the hand on which the stain of blood rested in particular was never dragged to light  my first impulse as soon as i could recollect myself was to pass an arm around the waist of dus and force her through the crowd with a view to escape had this attempt been persevered in i think it would have succeeded so profound was the sensation made even upon those rude and lawless men by the deed of violence that had just been done but dus was not one to think of self at such a moment for a single instant her head fell on my shoulders and i held her to my bosom while i whispered my wish for her to fly then raising her head she gently extricated her person from my arms and knelt by the side of her uncle  he breathes she said huskily but hastily god be praised mordaunt he still breathes the blow may not be as heavy as we at first supposed let us do what we can to aid him  here were the characteristic decision and thoughtfulness of ursula malbone rising quickly she turned to the group of silent but observant squatters and appealed to any remains of humanity that might still be found in their bosoms to lend their assistance thousandacres stood foremost in the dark cluster at the door looking grimly at the motionless body over which dus stood pale and heartstricken but still calm and collected  the hardesthearted man among you will not deny a daughters right to administer to a parents wants she said with a pathos in her voice and a dignity in her manner that filled me with love and admiration and which had a visible effect on all who heard hear help me to raise my uncle and to place him on a bed while major littlepage examines his hurt youll not deny me this little comfort thousandacres for you cannot know how soon you may want succor yourself  zephaniah who certainly had no hand in the murder of chainbearer now advanced and he myself lowiny and dus raised the still motionless body and placed it on the bed of prudence which stood in the principal room there was a consultation among the squatters while we were thus employed and one by one the family dropped off until no one was left in the house but thousandacres and his wife and lowiny the latter remaining with dus as a useful and even an affectionate assistant the father sat in moody silence on one side of the fire while prudence placed herself on the other i did not like the aspect of the squatters countenance but he said and did nothing it struck me he was brooding over the facts nursing his resentments by calling up fancied wrongs to his mind and plotting for the future if such was the case he manifested great nerve inasmuch as neither alarm nor hurry was in the slightest degree apparent in his mien prudence was dreadfully agitated  she said nothing but her body worked to and fro with nervous excitement and occasionally a heavy but suppressed groan struggled through her efforts to resist it otherwise she was as if not present  i had been accustomed to seeing gunshot wounds and possessed such a general knowledge of their effects as to be a tolerable judge of what would and what would not be likely to prove fatal the first look i took at the hurt of chainbearer convinced me there could be no hope for his life the ball had passed between two of the ribs and seemed to me to take a direction downward but it was impossible to miss the vitals with a wound commencing at that point on the human body the first shock of the injury had produced insensibility but we had hardly got the sufferer on the bed and applied a little water to his lips ere he revived soon regaining his consciousness as well as the power to speak death was on him however and it was very obvious to me that his hours were numbered he might live days but it was not possible for him to survive  got pless you mortaunt my old friend murmured after my efforts had thus partially succeeded got forever

not tie for some hours yet  it sounded fearful to me to hear one i loved so well speak so calmly and with so much certainty of his approaching end i could see that ursula almost writhed under the agony these words produced in her yet that nobleminded creature wore an air of calmness that might have deceived one who knew her less well than she was known to me she signed for me to quit the side of the bed in the vain hope that her uncle might fall asleep and placed herself silently on a chair at hand in readiness to attend to his wants as for me i took the occasion to examine the state of things without and to reflect on what course i ought to take in the novel and desperate circumstances in which we were so unexpectedly placed the time for something decisive having certainly arrived  it was now near an hour after the deed had been doneand there sat thousandacres and his wife one on each side of the fire in silent thought as i turned to look at the squatters and the father of squatters i saw that his countenance was set in that species of sullen moodiness which might well be taken as ominous in a man of his looseness of principle and fierceness of temperament nor had the nervous twitchings of prudence ceased in a word both of these strange beings appeared at the end of that hour just as they had appeared at its commencement it struck me as i passed them in moving toward the door that there was even a sublimity in their steadiness in guilt i ought however in some slight degree to exempt the woman whose agitation was some proof that she repented of what had been done at the door itself i found no one but two or three of the young men were talking in a low tone to each other at no great distance apparently they had an eye to what was going on within the building still no one of them spoke to me and i began to think that the crime already committed had produced such a shock that no further wrong to any of us was contemplated and that i might consider myself at liberty to do and act as i saw fit a twitch at my sleeve however drew my look aside and i saw lowiny cowering within the shadows of the house seemingly eager to attract my attention she had been absent some little time and had probably been listening to the discourse of those without  dont think of venturing far from the house the girl whispered the evil spirit has got possession of tobit and he has just sworn the same grave shall hold you and chainbearer and dus graves dont turn states evidence he says i never knowd him to be so awful as he is tonight though hes dreadful in temper when anything goes amiss  the girl glided past me as she ceased her hurried communication and the next instant she was standing quietly at the side of dus in readiness to offer her assistance in any necessary office for the sick i saw that she had escaped notice and then reconnoitred my own position with some little care  by this time the night had got to be quite dark and it was impossible to recognize persons at the distance of twenty feet it is true one could tell a man from a stump at twice that number of yards or even further but the objects of the rude clearing began to be confounded together in a way to deprive the vision of much of its customary power that group of young men as i suppose contained the formidable tobit but i could be by no means certain of the fact without approaching quite near to it this i did not like to do as there was nothing that i desired particularly to say to any of the family at the moment could they have known my heart the squatters would have felt no uneasiness on the subject of my escaping for were dus quite out of the question as she neither was nor could be it would be morally impossible for me to desert the chainbearer in his dying moments nevertheless tobit and his brethren did not know this and it might be dangerous for me to presume too far on the contrary supposition  the darkness was intensest near the house as a matter of course and i glided along close to the walls of logs until i reached an angle of the building thinking the movement might be unseen but i got an assurance that i was watched that would admit of no question by a call from one of the young men directing me not to turn the corner to go out of sight in any direction at the peril of my life this was plain speaking and it induced a short dialogue between us in which i avowed my determination not to desert my friendsfor the chainbearer would probably not outlive the nightand that i felt no apprehension for myself i was heated and excited and had merely left the house for air if they offered no impediment i would walk to and fro near them for a few minutes solely with a view to refresh my feverish pulses pledging my word to make no attempt at escape this explanation with the accompanying assurance seemed to satisfy my guard and i was quietly permitted to do as i had proposed  the walk i selected was between the group of squatters and the house and at each turn it necessarily brought me close to the young men at such moments i profited by my position to look in through the door of the dwelling at the motionless form of dus who sat at the bedside of her uncle in the patient silent tender and attentive manner of woman and whom i could plainly see in thus passing notwithstanding the fidelity of my homage to my mistress at these instants i could perceive that the young men uniformly suspended the low dialogue they were holding together as i approached them and as uniformly renewed it as i moved away this induced me gradually to extend my walk lengthening it a little on each end until i may have gone as far as a hundred feet on each side of the group which i took for the centre to have gone farther would have been imprudent as it might seem preparatory to an attempt at escape and to a consequent violation of my word  in this manner then i may have made eight or ten turns in as many minutes when i heard a low hissing sound near me while at the extremity of one of my short promenades a stump stood there and the sound came from the root of the stump at first i fancied i had encroached on the domain of some serpent though animals of that species which would be likely to give forth such a menace were even then very rare among us but my uncertainty was soon relieved  why you no stop at stump said susquesus in a voice so low as not to be heard at the distance of ten feet while it was perfectly distinct and not in a whisper got sutin tellglad to hear  wait until i can make one or two more turns i will come back in a moment was my guarded answer  then i continued my march placing myself against a stump that stood at the other end of my walk remaining leaning there for an entire minute or two when i returned passing the young men as before this i did three several times stopping at each turn as if to rest or to reflect and making each succeeding halt longer than the one that had preceded it at length i took my stand against the very stump that concealed the indian  how came you here susquesus i asked and are you armed  yes got good rifle chainbearers gun he no want him any longer eh  you know then what has happened chainbearer is mortally wounded  dat badmust take scalp to pay for dat ole frindgood frind always kill murderer  i beg nothing of the sort will be attempted but how came you hereand how came you armed  jaap do himcome and break open door nigger strongdo what he like to bring riflesay take him wish he come soonerden chainbearer no get kill we see  i thought it prudent to move on by the time this was said and i made a turn or two ere i was disposed to come to another halt the truth however was now apparent to me jaap had come in from the forest forced the fastenings of the onondagos prison given him arms and they were both out in the darkness prowling round the building watching for the moment to strike a blow or an opportunity to communicate with me how they had ascertained the fact of chainbearers being shot i was left to conjecture though susquesus must have heard the report of the rifle and an indian on such a night as that left to pursue his own course would soon ascertain all the leading points of any circumstance in which he felt an interest  my brain was in a whirl as all these details presented themselves to my mind and i was greatly at a loss to decide on my course in order to gain time for reflection i stopped a moment at the stump and whispered to the onondago a request that he would remain where he was until i could give him his orders an expressive good was the answer i received and i observed that the indian crouched lower in his lair like some fierce animal of the woods that restrained his impatience in order to make his leap when it did come more certain and fatal  i had now a little leisure for reflection there lay poor chainbearer stretched on his deathpallet as motionless as if the breath had already left his body dus maintained her post nearly as immovable as her uncle while lowiny stood at hand manifesting the sympathy of her sex in the mourning scene before her i caught glimpses too in passing of thousandacres and prudence it appeared to me as if the first had not stirred from the moment when he had taken his seat on the hearth his countenance was as set his air as moody and his attitude as stubborn as each had been in the first five minutes after the chainbearer fell prudence too was as unchanged as her husband her body continued to rock in nervous excitement but not once had i seen her raise her eyes from the stone of the rude hearth that covered nearly onehalf of the room the fire had nearly burned down and no one replenishing the brush which fed it a flickering flame alone remained to cast its wavering light over the forms of these two consciencestricken creatures rendering them still more mysterious and forbidding lowiny had indeed lighted a thin miserable candle of tallow such as one usually sees in the lowest habitations but it was placed aside in order to be removed from before the sight of the supposed slumberer and added but little to the light of the room notwithstanding i could and did see all i have described stopping for some little time at a point that commanded a view of the interior of the house  of dus i could ascertain but little she was nearly immovable at the bedside of her uncle but her countenance was veiled from view suddenly and it was at one of those moments when i had stopped in front of the building she dropped on her knees buried her face in the coverlet and became lost in prayer prudence started as she saw this act then she arose after the fashion of those who imagine they have contributed to the simplicity and consequently to the beauty of worship by avoiding the ceremony of kneeling to almighty god and stood erect moving to and fro as before her tall gaunt figure resembling some halfdecayed hemlock of the adjacent forest that has lost the greater portion of its verdure rocked by a tempest i was touched notwithstanding at this silent evidence that the woman retained some of the respect and feeling for the services of the deity which though strangely blended with fanaticism and a pertinacious selfrighteousness no doubt had a large influence in bringing those who belonged to her race across the atlantic some five or six generations previously to her own  it was just at this instant that i recognized the voice of tobit as he advanced toward the group composed of his brethren and speaking to his wife who accompanied him as far as his fathers habitation and there left him apparently to return to her own i did not distinguish what was said but the squatter spoke sullenly and in the tone of one whose humor was menacing believing that i might meet with some rudeness of a provoking character from this man should he see me walking about in the manner i had now been doing for near a quarter of an hour ere he had the matter explained i thought it wisest to enter the building and effect an object i had in view by holding a brief conversation with thousandacres  this determination was no sooner formed than i put it in execution trusting that the patience of the indian and jaaps habits of obedience would prevent anything like an outbreak from them without orders as i reentered the room dus was still on her knees and prudence continued erect oscillating as before with her eyes riveted on the hearth lowiny stood near the bed and i thought like her mother she was in some measure mingling in spirit with the prayer  thousandacres i commenced in a low voice drawing quite near the squatter and succeeding in causing him to look at me by my addressthousandacres this has been a most melancholy business but everything should be done that can be done to repair the evil will you not send a messenger through to the nest to obtain the aid of the physician  doctors can do but little good to a wound made by a rifle that was fired so cluss young man i want no doctors here to betray me and mine to the law  nay your messenger can keep your secret and i will give him gold to induce the physician to come and come at once he can be told that i am accidentally hurt and might still reach us to be of service in alleviating pain i confess there is no hope for anything else  men must take their chances coldly returned that obdurate being them that live in the woods take woodsmens luck and them that live in the open country the open country luck my family and lumber must be presarved at all risks and no doctor shall come here  what was to be donewhat could be done with such a being all principle all sense of right was concentrated in selfin his moral system it was as impossible to make him see the side of any question that was opposed to his interests fancied or real as it was to give sight to the physically blind i had hoped contrition was at work upon him and that some advantage might be obtained through the agency of so powerful a mediator but no sooner was his dull nature aroused into anything like action than it took the direction of selfishness as the needle points to the pole  disgusted at this exhibition of the most confirmed trait of the squatters character i was in the act of moving from him when a loud shout arose around the building and the flashes and reports of three or four rifles were heard rushing to the door i was in time to hear the tramp of men who seemed to me to be pushing forward in all directions and the crack of the rifle was occasionally heard apparently retiring toward the woods men called to each other in the excitement of a chase and conflict but i could gain no information the body of darkness which had settled on the place having completely hidden everything from view at any distance  in this state of most painful doubt i continued for five or six minutes the noise of the chase receding the whole time when a man came rushing up to the door of the hut where i stood and seizing my hand i found it was frank malbone the succor then had arrived and i was no longer a captive  god be praised you at least are safe cried malbone but my dear sister  is there unharmed watching by the side of her uncles dying bed is any one hurt without  that is more than i can tell you your black acted as guide and brought us down on the place so skilfully that it was not my intention to resort to arms at all since we might have captured all the squatters without firing a shot had my orders been observed but a rifle was discharged from behind a stump and this drew a volley from the enemy some of our side returned the discharge and the squatters then took to flight the firing you have just heard is scattered discharges that have come from both sides and can be only sound as any aim is impossible in this obscurity my own piece has not even been cocked and i regret a rifle has been fired  perhaps all is then well and we have driven off our enemies without doing them any harm are you strong enough to keep them at a distance  perfectly so we are a posse of near thirty men led by an undersheriff and a magistrate all we wanted was a direction to this spot to have arrived some hours earlier  i groaned in spirit at hearing this since those few hours might have saved the life of poor chainbearer as it was however this rescue was the subject of grateful rejoicing and one of the happiest moments of my life was that in which i saw dus fall on her brothers bosom and burst into tears i was at their side in the doorway of the hut when this meeting took place and dus held out a hand affectionately to me as she withdrew herself from her brothers arms frank malbone looked a little surprised at this act but anxious to see and speak to chainbearer he passed into the building and approached the bed dus and i followed for the shouts and firing had reached the ears of the wounded man and andries was anxious to learn their meaning the sight of malbone let him into a general knowledge of the state of the facts but a strong anxiety was depicted in his falling countenance as he looked toward me for information  what is it mortaunt he asked with considerable strength of voice his interest in the answer probably stimulating his physical powers what is it poy i hope tere hast peen no useless

no no we must tink of te honor of te coejemans ant te malpones ant not let our peloved gal go into a family tat may not want her  i could see that frank malbone smiled though sadly as he listened to this warning for on him it made little or no impression since he was generous enough to judge me by himself and did not believe any such mercenary considerations would influence my course i felt differently however obstinacy in opinion was one of the weak points in chainbearers character and i saw the danger of his leaving these sentiments as a legacy to dus she indeed had been the first to entertain them and to communicate them to her uncle and they might revive in her when she came to reflect on the true condition of things and become confirmed by the dying requests of her uncle it is true that in our own interview when i obtained from the dear girl the precious confession of her love no such obstacle seemed to exist but both of us appeared to look forward with confidence to our future union as to a thing certain but at that moment dus was excited by my declarations of the most ardent and unutterable attachment and led away by the strength of her own feelings we were in the delirium of delight produced by mutual confidence and the full assurance of mutual love when thousandacres came upon us to carry us to the scenes of woe by which we had been and were still in a degree surrounded under such circumstances one might well fall under the influence of feelings and emotions that would prove to be more controllable in cooler moments it was allimportant then for me to set chainbearer right in the matter and to have a care he did not quit us leaving the two persons he most loved on earth very unnecessarily miserable and that solely on account of the strength of his own prejudices nevertheless the moment was not favorable to pursue such a purpose and i was reflecting bitterly on the future when we were all startled by a heavy groan that seemed to come out of the very depths of the chest of the squatter  frank and i turned instinctively toward the chimney on hearing this unlookedfor interruption the chair of prudence was vacant the woman having rushed from the hut at the first sound of the recent alarm most probably in quest of her younger children but thousandacres remained in the very seat he had now occupied nearly if not quite two hours i observed however that his form was not as erect as when previously seen it had sunk lower in the chair while his chin hung down upon his breast advancing nearer a small pool of blood was seen on the stones beneath him and a short examination told malbone and myself that a riflebullet had passed directly through his body in a straight line and that only three inches above the hips     chapter xxvii      with woful measures wan despair       low sullen sounds his grief beguild     a solemn strange and mingled air       twas sad by fits by starts twas wildcollins   thousandacres had been shot in his chair by one of the rifles first discharged that night as it turned out he was the only one that we could ascertain was hurt though there was a report to which many persons gave credence that tobit had a leg broken also and that he remained a cripple for life i am inclined to believe this report may have been true for jaap told me after all was over that he let fly on a man who had just fired on himself and who certainly fell and was borne off limping by two of his companions it is quite probable that this hurt of tobits and the fate of his father was the reason we received no more annoyance that night from the squatters who had all vanished from the clearing so effectually including most of the females and all the children that no traces of their place of retreat were to be found next morning lowiny however did not accompany the family but remained near dus rendering herself highly useful as an attendant in the melancholy scene that followed i may as well add here that no evidence was ever obtained concerning the manner in which thousandacres received his deathwound he was shot through the open door beyond all question as he sat in his chair and necessarily in the early part of the fray for then only was a rifle discharged very near the house or from a point that admitted of the balls hitting its victim for myself i believed from the first that susquesus sacrificed the squatter to the manes of his friend chainbearer dealing out indian justice without hesitation or compunction still i could not be certain of the fact and the onondago had either sufficient prudence or sufficient philosophy to keep his own secret it is true that a remark or two did escape him soon after the affair occurred that tended to sustain my suspicions but on the whole he was remarkably reserved on the subjectless from any apprehension of consequences than from selfrespect and pride of character there was little to be apprehended indeed the previous murder of chainbearer and the unlawful nature of all the proceedings of the squatters justifying a direct and sudden attack on the part of the posse  just as malbone and myself discovered the condition of thousandacres this posse with squire newcome at its head began to collect around the house which might now be termed our hospital as the party was large and necessarily a little tumultuous i desired frank to lead them off to some of the other buildings as soon as a bed had been prepared for the squatter who was placed in the same room with chainbearer to die no one in the least acquainted with injuries of that nature could entertain any hope for either though a messenger was sent to the settlements for the individual who was called doctor and who was really fast acquiring many useful notions about his profession by practising on the human system they say that an ounce of experience is worth a pound of theory and this disciple of esculapius seemed to have set up in his art on this principle having little or none of the last while he was really obtaining a very respectable amount of the first as he practised right and left as the pugilist is most apt to hit in his rallies occasionally however he gave a knockdown blow  as soon as the necessary arrangements were made in our hospital i told dus that we would leave her and lowiny in attendance on the wounded both of whom manifested weariness and a disposition to doze while all the rest of the party would draw off and take up their quarters for the night in the adjacent buildings malbone was to remain as a sentinel a little distance from the door and i promised to join him in the course of an hour  lowiny can attend to the wants of her father while you will have the tenderest care of your uncle i well know a little drink occasionally is all that can alleviate their sufferings  let me come in interrupted a hoarse female voice at the door as a woman forced her way through the opposing arms of several of the posse i am aarons wife and they tell me he is hurt god himself has ordered that a woman should cleave unto her husband and thousandacres is mine and he is the father of my children if he has murdered and been murdered in his turn  there was something so commanding in the natural emotions of this woman that the guard at the door gave way immediately when prudence entered the room the first glance of the squatters wife was at the bed of chainbearer but nothing there held her gaze riveted that gaze only became fixed as her eyes fell on the large form of thousandacres as he lay extended on his deathbed it is probable that this experienced matron who had seen so many accidents in the course of a long life and had sat by so many a bedside understood the desperate nature of her husbands situation as soon as her eyes fell on the fallen countenance for turning to those near her the first impulse was to revenge the wrong which she conceived had been done to her and hers i will acknowledge that i felt awed and that a thrill passed through my frame as this rude and unnurtured female roused by her impulses demanded authoritatively  who has done this who has taken the breath from my man before the time set by the lord who has dared to make my children fatherless and me a widow agin law and right i left my man seated on that hearth heartstricken and troubled at what had happened to another and they tell me he has been murdered in his chair the lord will be on our side at last and then well see whom the law will favor and whom the law will condemn  a movement and a groan on the part of thousandacres would seem first to have apprised prudence that her husband was not actually dead starting at this discovery this tigers mate and tigers dam if not tigress herself ceased everything like appeal and complaint and set herself about those duties which naturally suggested themselves to one of her experience with the energy of a frontier womana woodmans wife and the mother of a large brood of woodmans sons and daughters she wiped the face of thousandacres wet his lips shifted his pillow such as it was placed his limbs in postures she thought the easiest and otherwise manifested a sort of desperate energy in her care the whole time she was doing this her tongue was muttering prayers and menaces strangely blended together and quite as strangely mixed up with epithets of endearment that were thrown away on her still insensible and least unconscious husband she called him aaron and that too in a tone that sounded as if thousandacres had a strong hold on her affections and might at least have been kind and true to her  i felt convinced that dus had nothing to fear from prudence and i left the place as soon as the two nurses had everything arranged for their respective patients and the house was quite free from the danger of intrusion on quitting her who now occupied most of my thoughts i ventured to whisper a request she would not forget the pledges given me in the forest and asked her to summon me to the bedside of chainbearer should he rouse himself from the slumber that had come over him and manifest a desire to converse i feared he might renew the subject to which his mind had already once averted since receiving his wound and imbue his niece with some of his own set notions on that subject ursula was kindness itself her affliction had even softened her feelings toward me more than ever and so far as she was concerned i certainly had no ground for uneasiness in passing frank who stood on post some twenty yards from the door of the house he said god bless you littlepagefear nothing i am too much in your own situation not to be warmly your friend i returned his good wishes and went my way in one sense rejoicing  the posse as has been stated were in possession of the different deserted habitations of the family of thousandacres the night being cool fires were blazing on all the hearths and the place wore an air of cheerfulness that it had probably never before known most of the men had crowded into two of the dwellings leaving a third for the convenience of the magistrate frank malbone and myself whenever we might choose to repair to it by the time i appeared the posse had supped using the milk and bread and other eatables of the squatters ad libitum and were disposing of themselves on the beds and on the floors to take a little rest after their long and rapid march but in my own quarters i found squire newcome alone unless the silent and motionless onondago who occupied a chair in a corner of the fireplace could be called a companion jaap too in expectation of my arrival was lounging near the door and when i entered the house he followed me in for orders  it was easy for me who knew of newcomes relations with the squatters to discover the signs of confusion in his countenance as his eye first met mine one who was not acquainted with the circumstances most probably would have detected nothing out of the common way it will be remembered that the squire had no positive knowledge that i was acquainted with his previous visit to the mill and it will be easy to see that he must have felt an itching and uneasy desire to ascertain that fact a great deal depended on that circumstance nor was it long before i had a specimen of his art in sounding round the truth with a view to relieve his mind  whod a thought of findin major littlepage in the hands of the philistines in sich an out o the way place as this exclaimed mr newcome as soon as our salutations had been exchanged ive heern say there was squatters down hereabouts but such things are so common that i never bethought me of givin him a hint on the matter when i last saw the major  nothing could surpass the deferential manner of this person when he had an object to gain it being quite common with him to use the third person in this way when addressing a superior a practice that has almost become obsolete in the english language and which is seldom if ever used in america except by this particular class of men who defer before your face and endeavor to undermine when the back is turned my humor was not to trifle with this fellow though i did not know that it was exactly prudent just then to let him know that i had both seen and heard him in his former visit and was fully aware of all his practices it was not easy however to resist the opportunity given by his own remarks to put him a little way on the tenterhooks of consciencethat quality of the human mind being one of the keenest allies an assailant can possess in cases of this sort  i had supposed mr newcome that you were generally charged with the care of the mooseridge lands as one of the conditions annexed to the ravensnest agency i somewhat dryly remarked  sartain sir the colonelor ginral as he ought to be called now i do sposegave me the superintendence of both at the same time but the major knows i presume that mooseridge was not on sale  no sir it would seem to have been only on plunder one would think that an agent intrusted with the care of an estate and who heard of squatters being in possession and stripping the land of its trees would feel it to be his duty at least to apprise the owners of the circumstance that they might look to the case if he did not  the major hasnt rightly understood me put in the squire in a manner that was particularly deprecatory i dont mean to say that i knowd with anything like positiveness that there was squatters hereabouts but that rumors was stirrin of some sich things but squatters is sich common objects in new countries that a body scarce turns aside to look at them  so it would seem in your case at least mr newcome this thousandacres however they tell me is a wellknown character and has done little since his youth but lumber on the property of other people i should suppose you must have met him in the course of fiveandtwenty years residence in this part of the world  lord bless the major met thousandacres why ive met him a hundred times we all know the old man well enough and many and many is the time ive met him at raisins and trainins and town meetins and political meetins too ive even seen him in court though thousandacres dont set much store by law not half as much as he and every other man ought to do for law is excellent and society would be no better than a collection of wild beasts as i often tell miss newcome if it hadnt law to straighten it out and to teach the misguided and evildisposed whats right i spose the major will coincide with that idee  i have no particular objection to the sentiment sir but wish it was more general as you have seen this person thousandacres so often perhaps you can tell me something of his character my opportunities of knowing the man have been none of the best for most of the time i was his prisoner he had me shut up in an outbuilding in which i believe he has usually kept his salt and grain and spare provisions  not the old storeus exclaimed the magistrate looking a little aghast for the reader will doubtless recollect that the confidential dialogue between him and the squatter on the subject of the lumber had occurred so near that building as to be overheard by me how long has the major been in this clearin i wonder  not a very great while in fact though long enough to make it appear a week i was put into the storehouse soon after my seizure and have passed at least half my time there since  i want to know perhaps the major got in that hole as arly as yesterday morn  perhaps i did sir but mr newcome on looking round at the quantity of lumber these men have made and recollecting the distance they are from albany i am at a loss to imagine how they could hope to get their illgotten gains to market without discovery it would seem to me that their movements must be known and that the active and honest agents of this part of the country would seize their rafts in the watercourses thus making the very objects of the squatters roguery the means of their punishment is it not extraordinary that theft in a moral sense at least can be systematically carried on and that on so large a scale with such entire impunity  waali spose the major knows how things turn in this world nobody likes to meddle  how sirnot meddle this is contrary to all my experience of the habits of the country and all i have heard of it meddling i have been given to understand is the great vice of our immigrant population in particular who never think they have their just rights unless they are privileged to talk about and sit in judgment on the affairs of all within twenty miles of them making twothirds of their facts as they do so in order to reconcile their theories with the wishedfor results  ah i dont mean meddlin in that sense of which there is enough as all must allow but folks dont like to meddle with things that dont belong to them in such serious matters as this  i understand youthe man who will pass days in discussing his neighbors private affairs about which he absolutely knows nothing but what has been obtained from the least responsible and most vulgar sources will stand by and see that neighbor robbed and say nothing under the influence of a sentiment so delicate that it forbids his meddling with what dont belong to him  lest the reader should think i was unduly severe upon squire newcome let me appeal to his own experience and inquire if he never knew not only individuals but whole neighborhoods which were sorely addicted to prying into every mans affairs and to inventing when facts did not exactly sustain theories in a word convulsing themselves with that with which they have no real concern draw themselves up in dignified reserve as the witnesses of wrongs of all sorts that every honest man is bound to oppose i will go further and ask if a man does happen to step forth to vindicate the right to assert truth to defend the weak and to punish the wrongdoer if that man be not usually the one who meddles least in the more ordinary and minor transactions of lifethe man who troubles his neighbors least and has the least to say about their private affairs does it not happen that the very individual who will stand by and see his neighbor wronged on account of his indisposition to meddle with that which does not belong to him will occupy a large portion of his own time in discussing throwing out hints and otherwise commenting on the private affairs of that very neighbor  mr newcome was shrewd and he understood me well enough though he probably found it a relief to his apprehensions to see the conversation inclining toward these generalities instead of sticking to the storehouse nevertheless boards must have been uppermost in his conscience and after a pause he made an invasion into the career of thousandacres by way of diverting me from pushing matters too directly  this old squatter was a desperate man major littlepage he answered and it may be fortinate for the country that he is done with i hear the old fellow is killed and that all the rest of the family has absconded  it is not quite so bad as that thousandacres is hurtmortally perhapsand all his sons have disappeared but his wife and one of his daughters are still here in attendance on the husband and father  prudence is here then exclaimed mr newcome a little indiscreetly as i thought  she isbut you seem to know the family well for a magistrate squire seeing their ordinary occupationso well as to call the woman by her name  prudence i think thousandacres used to call his woman yes the major is very right we magistrates do get to know the neighborhood pretty ginrally what between summonses and warrants and bailingsout but the major hasnt yet said when he first fell into the hands of these folks  i first entered this clearing yesterday morning not a long time after the sun rose since which time sir i have been detained here either by force or by circumstances  a long pause succeeded this announcement the squire fidgeted and seemed uncertain how to act for while my announcement must have given rise in his mind to the strong probability of my knowing of his connection with the squatters it did not absolutely say as much i could see that he was debating with himself on the expediency of coming out with some tale invented for the occasion and i turned toward the indian and the negro both of whom i knew to be thoroughly honestafter the indian and the negro fashionsin order to say a friendly word to each in turn  susquesus was in one of his quiescent moods and had lighted a pipe which he was calmly smoking no one to look at him would suppose that he had so lately been engaged in a scene like that through which he had actually gone but rather that he was some thoughtful philosopher who habitually passed his time in reflection and study  as this was one of the occasions on which the onondago came nearest to admitting his own agency in procuring the death of the squatter i shall relate the little that passed between us  good evening sureflint i commenced extending a hand which the other courteously took in compliance with our customs i am glad to see you at large and no longer a prisoner in that storehouse  storeus poor gaol jaap snap off bolt like pipestem woner tousandacres didnt tink of dat  thousandacres has had too much to think of this evening to remember such a trifle he has now to think of his end  the onondago was clearing the bowl of his pipe of its superfluous ashes as i said this and he deliberately effected his purpose ere he answered  sartainspose he kill dis time  i fear his hurt is mortal and greatly regret that it has happened the blood of our tried friend chainbearer was enough to be shed in so miserable an affair as this  yes fair pretty misrable tink so too if squatter shoot surveyor must tink surveyors frind will shoot squatter  that may be indian law sureflint but it is not the law of the paleface in the time of peace and quiet  susquesus continued to smoke making no answer  it was a very wicked thing to murder chainbearer and thousandacres should have been handed over to the magistrates for punishment if he had a hand in it not shot like a dog  the onondago drew his pipe from his mouth looked round toward the squire who had gone to the door in order to breathe the fresh airthen turning his eyes most significantly on me he answered  who magistrate go to eh what use good law wit poor magistrate better have redskin law and warrior be his own magistrateown gallows too  the pipe was replaced and sureflint appeared to be satisfied with what had passed for he turned away and seemed to be lost again in his own reflections  after all the strong native intellect of this barbarian had let him into one of the greatest secrets connected with our social ills good laws badly administered are no better than an absence of all law since they only encourage evildoers by the protection they afford through the power conferred on improper agents those who have studied the defects of the american system with a view to ascertain truth say that the want of a great moving power to set justice in motion lies at the root of its feebleness according to theory the public virtue is to constitute this power but public virtue is never onehalf as active as private vice crime is only to be put down by the strong hand and that hand must belong to the public in truth not in name only whereas the individual wronged is fast getting to be the only moving power and in very many cases local parties are formed and the rogue goes to the bar sustained by an authority that has quite as much practical control as the law itself juries and grand juries are no longer to be relied on and the bench is slowly but steadily losing its influence when the day shall comeas come it must if present tendencies continuethat verdicts are rendered directly in the teeth of law and evidence and jurors fancy themselves legislators then may the just man fancy himself approaching truly evil times and the patriot begin to despair it will be the commencement of the roughs paradise nothing is easier i am willing to admit than to overgovern men but it ought not to be forgotten that the political vice that comes next in the scale of facility is to govern them too little  jaap or jaaf had been humbly waiting for his turn to be noticed there existed perfect confidence as between him and myself but there were also bounds in the way of respect that the slave never presumed to pass without direct encouragement from the master had i not seen fit to speak to the black that night he would not have commenced a conversation which begun by me he entered into with the utmost frankness and freedom from restraint  you seem to have managed your part of this affair jaap i said with discretion and spirit i have every reason to be satisfied with you more especially for liberating the indian and for the manner in which you guided the posse down into the clearing from the woods  yes sah spose you would tink dat was pretty well as for sus tought it best to let him out for he be wonerful sartain wid he rifle we should do much better masser mordy but e squire so werry backward about lettin e men shoot em ere squatter gosh massar mordy if he only say fire when i want him i dont tink so much as half a one get off  it is best as it is jaap we are at peace and in the bosom of our country and bloodshed is to be avoided  yes sah but chainbearer if ey dont like bloodshed why ey shoot him sah  there is a feeling of justice in what you say jaap but the community cannot get on in anything like safety unless we let the law rule our business was to take those squatters and to hand them over to the law  werry true sah nobody cant deny dat masser mordy but he nodder seize nor shot now sartain it best to do one or todder with sich rascal well i tink dat tobit as dey calls him will remember jaap satanstoe long as he live dat a good ting anyway  good exclaimed the onondago with energy  i saw it was useless then to discuss abstract principles with men so purely practical as my two companions and i left the house to reconnoitre ere i returned to our hospital for the night the negro followed me and i questioned him as to the manner of the attack and the direction of the retreat of the squatters in order to ascertain what danger there might be during the hours of darkness jaap gave me to understand that the men of thousandacres family had retired by the way of the stream profiting by the declivity to place themselves under cover as soon as possible as respects the women and children they must have got into the woods at some other point and it was probable the whole had sought some place of retreat that would naturally have been previously appointed by those who knew that they lived in the constant danger of requiring one jaap was very certain we should see no more of the men and in that he was perfectly right no more was ever seen of any one of them all in that part of the country though rumors reached us in the course of time from some of the more western counties that tobit had been seen there a cripple as i have already stated but maintaining his old character for lawlessness and disregard of the rights of others  i next returned to frank malbone who still stood on post at no great distance from the door through which we could both see the form and features of his beautiful and beloved sister dus sat by her uncles bedside while prudence had stationed herself by that of her husband frank and i advanced near the door and looked in upon the solemn and singular sight that room afforded it was indeed a strange and sad spectacle to see those two aged men each with his thin locks whitened by seventy years drawing near their ends the victims of lawless violence for while the death of thousandacres was enveloped in a certain mystery and might by some eyes be viewed as merited and legal there could be no doubt that it was a direct consequence of the previous murder of chainbearer it is in this way that wrong extends and sometimes perpetuates its influence proving the necessity of taking time by the forelock and resorting to prevention in the earliest stages of the evil instead of cure  there lay the two victims of the false principles that the physical condition of the country connected with its passive endurance of encroachments on the right had gradually permitted to grow up among us squatting was a consequence of the thinness of the population and of the abundance of land the two very circumstances that rendered it the less justifiable in a moral point of view but which by rendering the one side careless of its rights and the other proportionably encroaching had gradually led not only to this violation of law but to the adoption of notions that are adverse to the supremacy of law in any case it is this gradual undermining of just opinions that forms the imminent danger of our social system a spurious philanthropy on the subject of punishments false notions on that of personal rights and the substitution of numbers for principles bidding fair to produce much the most important revolution that has ever yet taken place on the american continent the lover of real liberty under such circumstances should never forget that the road to despotism lies along the borders of the slough of licentiousness even when it escapes wallowing in its depths  when malbone and myself drew back from gazing on the scene within the house he related to me in detail all that was connected with his own proceedings the reader knows that it was by means of a meeting in the forest between the indian and the negro that my friends first became acquainted with my arrest and the probable danger in which i was placed chainbearer dus and jaap instantly repaired to the clearing of thousandacres while malbone hastened on to ravensnest in pursuit of legal aid and of a force to render my rescue certain meditating on all the facts of the case and entertaining most probably an exaggerated notion of the malignant character of thousandacres by the time he reached the nest my new friend was in a most feverish state of excitement his first act was to write a brief statement of the facts to my father and to dispatch his letter by a special messenger with orders to him to push on to fishkill all the family being there at the time on a visit to the kettletases proceeding by land or by water as the wind might favor i was startled at this information foreseeing at once that it would bring not only the general himself but my dear mother and kate with tom bayard quite likely in her train posthaste to ravensnest it might even cause my excellent old grandmother to venture so far from home for my last letters had apprised me that they were all on the point of visiting my sister anneke which was the way frank had learned where the family was to be found  as malbones messenger had left the nest early the preceding night and the wind had been all day fresh at north it came quite within the bounds of possibility that he might be at fishkill at the very moment i was listening to the history of his message the distance was about a hundred and forty miles and nearly one hundred of it could be made by water such a messenger would care but little for the accommodations of his craft and on the supposition that he reached albany that morning and found a sloop ready to profit by the breeze as would be likely to occur it would be quite in rule to reach the landing at fishkill in the course of the evening aided by the little gale that had been blowing i knew general littlepage too well to doubt either his affection or his promptitude albany could be reached in a day by land and ravensnest in another i made my account therefore to see a part if not all of the family at the nest as soon as i should reach it myself an event not likely to occur however for some little time on account of the condition of chainbearer  i shall not deny that this new state of things with the expectations connected with it gave me sufficient food for reflection i could not and did not blame frank malbone for what he had done since it was natural and proper notwithstanding it would precipitate matters as regarded my relation to dus a little faster than i could have wished i desired time to sound my family on the important subject of my marriageto let the three or four letters i had already written and in which she had been mentioned in a marked manner produce their effect and i counted largely on the support i was to receive through the friendship and representations of miss bayard i felt certain that deep disappointment on the subject of pris would be felt by the whole family and it was my wish not to introduce ursula to their acquaintance until time had a little lessened its feeling but things must now take their course and my determination was settled to deal as sincerely and simply as possible with my parents on the subject i knew their deep affection for me and relied strongly on that natural support  i had half an hours conversation with dus while walking in front of the hospital that night frank taking his sisters place by the side of chainbearers bed then it was that i again spoke of my hopes and explained the probabilities of our seeing all of my immediate family so shortly at ravensnest my arm was round the waist of the dear girl as i communicated these facts and i felt her tremble as if she dreaded the trial she was to undergo  this is very sudden and unexpected mordaunt dus remarked after she had had a little time to recover her recollection and i have so much reason to fear the judgment of your respectable parentsof your charming sister of whom i have heard so often through priscilla bayardand indeed of all who have lived as they have done amid the elegancies of a refined state of society i dus malbonea chainbearers niece and a chainbearer myself  you have never borne any chain love that is as lasting or as strong as that which you have entwined around my heart and which will forever bind me to you let the rest of the world regard us both as it may but you can have nothing to fear from any and least of all from my friends my father is not worldlyminded and as for my dear dear mother anneke mordaunt as the general even now often affectionately calls her as if the name itself reminded him of the days of her maiden loveliness and prideas for that beloved mother ursula i do firmly believe that when she comes to know you she will even prefer you to her son  that is a picture of your blinded partiality mordaunt answered the gratified girl for gratified i could see she was and must not be too fondly relied on but this is no time to talk of our own future happiness when the eternal happiness or misery of those two aged men is suspended as it might be by a thread i have read prayers once already with my dear uncle and that strange woman in whom there is so much of her sex mingled with a species of ferocity like that of a shebear has muttered a hope that her own dying man as she calls him is not to be forgotten i have promised he should not be and it is time to attend to that duty next  what a scene followed dus placed the light on a chest near the bed of thousandacres and with the prayerbook in her hand she knelt beside it prudence stationed herself in such a posture that her head was buried in one of her own garments that was suspended from a peg and there she stood while the melodious voice of ursula malbone poured out the petitions contained in the offices for the dying in humble but fervent piety i say stood for neither prudence nor lowiny knelt the captious temper of selfrighteousness which had led their ancestors to reject kneeling at prayers as the act of formalists had descended to them and there they stood praying doubtless in their hearts but ungracious formalists themselves in their zeal against forms frank and i knelt in the doorway and i can truly affirm that never did prayers sound so sweetly in my ears as those which then issued from the lips of ursula malbone     chapter xxviii       thence cum we to the horrour and the hel the large great      kyngdomes and the dreadful raygne of pluto in his trone where      he dyd dwell the wyde waste places and the hugye playne the      waylings shrykes and sundry sortes of payne       the syghes and sobbes and diep and deadly groane earth      ayer and all resounding playnt and moane sackville   in this manner did that memorable night wear away the two wounded men slumbered much of the time nor did their wants extend beyond occasional draughts of water to cool their feverish mouths or the wetting of lips i prevailed on dus to lie down on the bed of lowiny and try to get a little rest and i had the pleasure to hear her say that she had slept sweetly for two or three hours after the turn of the night frank and i caught naps also after the fashion of soldiers and lowiny slept in her chair or leaning on her fathers bed as for prudence i do not think her watchfulness was lessened for a single instant there she sat the livelong night silent tearless moody and heartstricken by the great and sudden calamity that had befallen her race but vigilant and attentive to the least movement in the huge frame of her wounded partner no complaint escaped her scarcely once did she turn to look at what was going on around her nor in any manner did she heed aught but her husband to him she seemed to be unerringly true and whatever she may and must have thought of his natural sternness and occasional fits of severity toward herself all now seemed to be forgotten  at length light returned after hours of darkness that seemed to me to be protracted to an unusual length then it was when jaap and the indian were ready to take our places on the watch that frank and i went to one of the huts and lay down for two or three hours and that was the time when dus got her sweetest and most refreshing sleep lowiny prepared our mornings meal for us which we three that is dus frank and myself took together in the best way we could in the dwelling of tobit as for squire newcome he left the clearing in the course of the night or very early in the morning doubtless exceedingly uneasy in his conscience but still uncertain whether his connection with the squatters was or was not known to me the excuse for this movement being the probable necessity of summoning a jury mr jason newcome filling in his own person or by deputy the several offices and functions of justice of the peace one of the coroners of the county supervisor of the township of ravensnest merchant shopkeeper miller lumberdealer husbandman and innkeeper to say nothing of the fact that he wrote all the wills of the neighborhood was a standing arbitrator when disputes were left out to men was a leading politician a patriot by trade and a remarkable and steady advocate of the rights of the people even to minutiæ those who know mankind will not be surprised after this enumeration of his pursuits and professions to hear it added that he was a remarkable rogue in the bargain  there are two things i have lived long enough to receive as truths established by my own experience and they are these i never knew a man who made large professions of a love for the people and of his wish to serve them on all occasions whose aim was not to deceive them to his own advantage and the other is that i never knew a man who was compelled to come much in contact with the people and who at the same time was personally popular who had anything in him at the bottom but it is time to quit jason newcome and his defects of character in order to attend to the interesting scene that awaited us in the dwelling of thousandacres and to which we were now summoned by jaap  as the day advanced both the chainbearer and the squatter became aroused from the languor that had succeeded the receiving of their respective hurts and more or less alive to what was passing around them life was ebbing fast in both yet each seemed just at that moment to turn his thoughts backward on the world in order as it might be to take a last look at those scenes in which he had now been an actor for the long period of threescoreandten years  uncle chainbearer is much revived just now said dus meeting frank and myself at the door and he has asked for you both more especially for mordaunt whose name he has mentioned three several times within the last five minutes send for mordaunt my child he has said to me for i wish to speak with him before i quit you i am fearful he has inward admonitions of his approaching end  that is possible dearest ursula for men can hardly lose their hold of life without being aware of the approaches of death i will go at once to his bedside that he may know i am here it is best to let his own feelings decide whether he is able or not to converse  the sound of chainbearers voice speaking in a low but distinct tone caught our ears as we approached him and we all stopped to listen  i say tousantacres repeated andries on a key a little louder than before if you hear me olt man ant can answer i wish you to let me know it you ant i pe about to start on a fery long journey ant it ist unreasonaple as well as wicket to set out wit pad feelins at te heart if you hat hat a niece now like dus tere to tell you tese matters olt aaron it might pe

pehavior ist far petter as te last hour approaches  answer him aaron the wife rejoinedanswer him my man in order that we may all of us know the frame of mind in which you take your departure chainbearer is a kindhearted man at the bottom and has never wilfully done us any harm  for the first time since andries received his wound i now heard the voice of thousandacres previously to that moment the squatter whether hurt or not had sat in moody silence and i had supposed after he was wounded that he was unable to use his tongue to my surprise however he now spoke with a depth and strength of voice that at first misled me by inducing me to think that the injury he had received could not be fatal  if there wasnt no chainbearers growled thousandacres there wouldnt be no lines or metes and bounds as they call em and where theres no metes and bounds there can be no right of possession if twasnt for your writin titles i shouldnt be lyin here breathin my last  forgive it all my man forgive it all as behooves a good christian prudence returned to this characteristic glance at the past in which the squatter had so clearly overlooked all his own delinquencies and was anxious to impute consequences altogether to others it is the law of god to forgive your enemies aaron and i want you to forgive chainbearer and not go to the world of spirits with gall in your heart  twoult pe

and wilt accept it wit pleasure if he wilt offer it and take mine in exchange  a deep groan struggled out of the broad cavernlike chest of the squatter i took it as an admission that he was the murderer of andries  yes resumed chainbearerdus hast mate me see  uncle exclaimed ursula who was intently listening and who now spoke because unable to restrain the impulse  yes yes gal it hast peen

arth does not suit tem for practice in heafen  if youd always held them rational notions chainbearer no harm might have come to you and my life and yourn been spared but this is a state of being in which shortsightedness prevails agin the best calkerlations i never felt more sure of gettin lumber to market than i felt three days ago of gettin this thats in the creek safe to albany and now you see how it is the bys are disparsed and may never see this spot again the gals are in the woods runnin with the deer of the forest the lumber has fallen into the hands of the law and that too by the aid of a man that was bound in honesty to protect me and im dyin here  think no more of the lumber my man think no more of the lumber said prudence earnestly time is desprate short at the best and yours is shorter than common even for a man of seventy while etarnity has no eend forgit the boards and forgit the bys and forgit the gals forgit arth and all it holds  you wouldnt have me forgit you prudence interrupted thousandacres thats been my wife now forty long years and whom i tuck when she was young and comely and thats borne me so many children and has always been a faithful and hardworking womanyou wouldnt have me forget you  this singular appeal coming as it did from such a being and almost in his agony sounded strangely and solemnly amid the wild and semisavage appliances of a scene i can never forget the effect on ursula was still more apparent she left the bedside of her uncle and with strong womanly sympathy manifested in her countenance approached that of this aged couple now about to be separated for a short time at least where she stood gazing wistfully at the very man who was probably that uncles murderer as if she could gladly administer to his moral ailings even chainbearer attempted to raise his head and looked with interest toward the other group no one spoke however for all felt that the solemn recollections and forebodings of a pair so situated were too sacred for interruption the discourse went on without any hiatus between them  not i not i aaron my man answered prudence with strong emotions struggling in her voice there can be no law or call for that we are one flesh and what god has jined god will not keep asunder long i cannot tarry long behind you my man and when we meet together agin i hope twill be where no boards or trees or acres can ever make more trouble for us  ive been hardly treated about that lumber ater all muttered the squatter who was now apparently more aroused to consciousness than he had been and who could not but keep harping on what had been the one great business of his life even as that life was crumbling beneath his feethardly dealt by do i consider myself about that lumber prudence make the most of the littlepage rights it was only trees that they could any way claim in reason while the bys and i as you well know have convarted them trees into as pretty and noble a lot of hansome boards and planks as man ever rafted to market  its convarsion of another natur that you want now aaron my man another sort of convarsion is the thing needful we must all be convarted once in our lives at least all such as be the children of puritan parents and a godly ancestry and it must be owned takin into account our years and the importance of example in such a family as ourn that you and i have put it off

ant tough you wilt touptless continue to grow worse in poty you wilt grow petter in spirit  thousandacres turned his grim visage round and gazed intently and wistfully toward ursula i saw the struggle that was going on within through the clear mirror of the sweet ingenuous face of my beloved and i saw the propriety of retiring frank malbone understood my look and we left the house together closing the door behind us  two to me long and anxious hours succeeded during most of which time my companion and myself walked about the clearing questioning the men who composed the posse and hearing their reports these men were in earnest in what they were doing for a respect for law is a distinguishing trait in the american character and perhaps more so in new england whence most of these people came than in any other part of the country the rascality of squire newcome to the contrary notwithstanding some observers pretend that this respect for law is gradually decreasing among us and that in its place is sensibly growing up a disposition to substitute the opinions wishes and interests of local majorities making the country subject to men instead of principles the last are eternal and immutable and coming of god men however unanimous in sentiment have no more right to attempt to change them than to blaspheme his holy name all that the most exalted and largest political liberty can ever beneficially effect is to apply these principles to the good of the human race in the management of their daily affairs but when they attempt to substitute for these pure and just rules of right laws conceived in selfishness and executed by the power of numbers they merely exhibit tyranny in its popular form instead of in its old aspect of kingly or aristocratic abuses it is a fatal mistake to fancy that freedom is gained by the mere achievement of a right in the people to govern unless the manner in which that right is to be both understood and practised is closely incorporated with all the popular notions of what has been obtained that right to govern means no more than the right of the people to avail themselves of the power thus acquired to apply the great principles of justice to their own benefit and from the possession of which they had hitherto been excluded it confers no power to do that which is inherently wrong under any pretence whatever or would anything have been gained had america as soon as she relieved herself from a sway that diverted so many of her energies to the increase of the wealth and influence of a distant people gone to work to frame a new polity which should inflict similar wrongs within her own bosom  my old acquaintance the hearty rhode islander was one of the posse and i had a short conversation with him while thus kept out of the house which may serve to let the reader somewhat into the secret of the state of things at the clearing we met near the mill when my acquaintance whose name was hosmer commenced as follows  a good day to you major and a hearty welcome to the open air cried the sturdy yeoman frankly but respectfully offering his hand you fell into a pit here or into a den among thieves and its downright providential you eer saw and breathed the clear air agin waal ive been trailin a little this mornin along with the injin and no hound has a more sartain scent than he has we went into the hollow along the creek and a desprate sight of boards them varmints have got into the water i can tell you if the lots worth forty pounds york it must be worth every shilling of five hundred theyd a made their fortins every blackguard among em i dont know but id fit myself to save so many boards and sich beautiful boards whether wrongfully or rightfully lumbered  here the hearty old fellow stopped to laugh which he did exactly in the fullmouthed contented way in which he spoke and did everything else i profited by the occasion to put in a word in reply  you are too honest a man major to think of ever making your boards out of another mans trees i answered these people have lived by dishonest practices all their lives and any one can see what it has come to  yes i hope i am squire littlepagei do hope i am hard work and i ant nohow afeard of each other and so long as a man can work and will work satan dont get a full grip on him but as i was sayin the trackless struck the trail down the creek though it was along a somewhat beaten path but the injin would make no more of findin it in a highway than you and i would of findin our places in the bible on sabbaday where we had left off the sabbaday that was gone i always mark mine with a string the old woman braided for me on purpose and a rightdown good method it is for while youre sarchin for your specs with one hand nothin is easier than to open the bible with tother thems handy things to have major and when you marry some great lady down at york sich a one as your own mother was for i knowd her and honored her as we all did hereawaybut when you get married ask your wife to braid a string for you to find the place in the bible with and all will go right take an old mans word for it  i thank you friend and will remember the advice even though i might happen to marry a lady in this part of the world and not down in york  this part of the world no weve got nobody our way thats good enough for you let me see newcome has a daghter thats old enough but shes desprate humbly anglice homelythe people of new england reserve ugly for moral qualities and wouldnt suit no how i dont think the littlepages would overmuch like being warp and fillin with the newcomes  no my father was an old friendor an old acquaintance at least of mr newcomes and must know and appreciate his merits  yesyesill warrant ye the ginral knows him waal human natur is human natur and i do spose if truth must be spoken none on us be half as good as we ought to be we read about faithful stewards in the good book and about onfaithful ones too squirehere the old yeoman stopped to indulge in one of his hearty laughs rendering it manifest he felt the full application of his words waal all must allow the bibles a good book i never open it without larnin suthin and what i larn i strive not to forgit but theres a messenger for you major from thousandacres hut and i fancy it will turn out that he or chainbearer is drawing near his eend  lowiny was coming to summon us to the house sure enough and i took my leave of my brother major for the moment it was plain to me that this honestminded yeoman a good specimen of his class saw through newcome and his tricks and was not unwilling to advert to them nevertheless this man had a fault and one very characteristic of his order he could not speak directly but would hint round a subject instead of coming out at once and telling what he had to say beating the bush to start his game when he might have put it up at once by going in at it directly before we parted he gave me to understand that susquesus and my fellow jaap had gone on in pursuit of the retreating squatters intending to follow their trail several miles in order to make sure that tobit and his gang were not hanging around the clearing to watch their property ready to strike a blow when it might be least expected  dus met me at the door of the cabin tearful and sad but with such a holy calm reigning in her generally brilliant countenance as denoted the nature of the solemn business in which she had just been engaged she extended both hands to meet mine and whispered uncle chainbearer is anxious to speak to uson the subject of our engagement i think it is a tremor passed through the frame of ursula but she made an effort smiled sadly and continued hear him patiently dear mordaunt and remember that he is my father in one sense and as fully entitled to my obedience and respect as if i were really his daughter  as i entered the room i could see that dus had been at prayer prudence looked comforted but thousandacres himself had a wild and uncertain expression of countenance as if doubts had begun to beset him at the very moment when they must have been the most tormenting i observed that his anxious eye followed the form of dus and that he gazed on her as one would be apt to regard the being who had just been the instrument of awakening within him the consciousness of his critical state but my attention was soon drawn

pained delight shot into and out of the countenance of ursula like the passage of the electric spark chainbearer gazed on me intently and it was easy to trace in the expression of his face the deep interest he felt in my words and the importance he attached to them as for frank malbone he fairly turned away to conceal the tears that forced themselves from his eyes  if i coult tink ast muchif i

bed as her truthful and ingenuous nature poured out her answer  uncle chainbearer she said when we first talked on this subject i had never seen mordaunt  i knelt at the side of ursula folded her to my bosom and endeavored to express the profound sentiment of gratitude that i felt at hearing this ingenuous explanation by such caresses as nature and feeling dictated dus however gently extricated herself from my arms and rising we both stood waiting the effect of what had just been seen and heard on chainbearer  i see tat natur is stronger tan reason ant opinion ant custom the old man resumed

i then nothing in your eyes  it would also be misery to live without you mordauntbut in one case i should be supported by a sense of having discharged my duty while in the other all that went wrong would appear a punishment for my own errors  i would not promise for to own the truth while i never distrusted my father or mother for a single instant i did distrust my dear and venerable grandmother i knew that she had not only set her heart on my marrying priscilla bayard but that she had a passion for making matches in her own family and i feared that she might have some of the tenacity of old age in maintaining her opinions dus endeavored to prevail on me to promise but i evaded the pledge and all solicitations were abandoned in consequence of a remark that was soon after made by chainbearer  nefer mintnefer mint darlint your promise is enough so long as you pe true what matters it weter mortaunt is heatstrong or not ant now children ast i wish to talk no more of te matters of

tat which ist to come lif in sich a way my tear chiltren as to pe aple to meet tis awful moment in which you see me placed wit hope ant joy so tat we may all meet hereafter in te courts of heafen amen  a short solemn pause succeeded this benediction when it was interrupted by a fearful groan that struggled out of the broad chest of thousandacres all eyes were turned on the other bed which presented a most impressive contrast to the calm scene that surrounded the parting soul of him about whom we had been gathered i alone advanced to the assistance of prudence who womanlike clung to her husband to the last bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh i must own however that horror paralyzed my limbs and that when i got as far as the foot of the squatters bed i stood riveted to the place like a rooted tree  thousandacres had been raised by means of quilts until half his body lay almost in a sitting position a change he had ordered during the previous scene his eyes were open ghastly wandering hopeless as the lips contracted with the convulsive twitchings of death they gave to his grim visage a species of sardonic grin that rendered it doubly terrific at this moment a sullen calm came over the countenance and all was still i knew that the last breath remained to be drawn and waited for it as the charmed bird gazes at the basiliskeye of the snake it came drawing aside the lips so as to show every tooth and not one was missing in that iron frame when finding the sight too frightful for even my nerves i veiled my eyes when my hand was removed i caught one glimpse of that dark tenement in which the spirit of the murderer and squatter had so long dwelt prudence being in the act of closing the glary but still fiery eyes i never before had looked upon so revolting a corpse and never wish to see its equal again     chapter xxix      mild as a babe reclines himself to rest     and smiling sleeps upon the mothers breast     tranquil and with a patriarchs hope he gave     his soul to heaven his body to the graveharte   i saw that neither chainbearer nor dus looked at the revolting object presented in the corpse of thousandacres after that selfish and selfwilled being ceased to live i had another hut prepared immediately for its reception and the body was removed to it without delay thither prudence accompanied the senseless body and there she passed the remainder of the day and the whole of the succeeding night attended by lowinywith occasional offers of food and assistance from the men of the posse two or three of the latter carpenters by trade made a coffin of pine and the body was placed in it in the customary manner others dug a grave in the centre of one of those rough fields that the squatter had appropriated to his own uses thus making everything ready for the interment as soon as the coroner who had been sent for should have had his sitting over the body  the removal of the remains of thousandacres left a sort of holy calm in the cabin of chainbearer my old friend was fast sinking and he said but little his consciousness continued to the last and dus was often at prayer with him in the course of that day frank and i aided in doing the duty of nurses and we prevailed on ursula to retire to the loft and catch some rest after her unwearying watchfulness it was near sunset that old andries again addressed himself particularly to me who was sitting at his side dus being then asleep  i shalt lif till mornin i now fint mortaunt he said put let deat come when it wilt it ist sent py my lort and maker ant it ist welcome deat hast no fears

till she pegins to converse wit you unreservetly apout got ant retemption  i can believe anything in favor of ursula malbone my dear chainbearer and no music could be sweeter to my ears than thus to hear you pronouncing her praise  the death of chainbearer occurred as he had himself prognosticated about the time of the return of light on the succeeding morning a more tranquil end i never witnessed he ceased to suffer pain hours before he drew his last breath but he had whispered to me in the course of that day that he endured agony at moments he wished me to conceal the fact from dus however lest it should increase her grief so long ast te tear gal ist in ignorance of my sufferins the excellent old man added in his whisper she cannot feel so much for me since she must have confitence in te value of her own goot work ant spose me to pe only trawin nearer to happiness put you ant i know mortaunt tat men are not often shot trough te poty witout feelin much pain ant i haf hat my shareyes i haf hat my share nevertheless it would have been difficult for one who was not in the secret to detect the smallest sign that the sufferer endured a tithe of the agony he actually underwent ursula was deceived and to this hour she is ignorant how much her uncle endured but as i have said this pain ceased altogether about nine oclock and andries even slumbered for many minutes at a time not long before the light returned however he became aroused and never slumbered again until he fell into the long last sleep of death his niece prayed with him about five after which he seemed to consider himself as ready for the final march  it might have been owing to the age of the patient but in this instance death announced his near approach by a rapid loss of the senses at first came a difficulty of hearing and then the quick decay of the sense of sight the first was made known to us by a repetition of questions that had already been more than once answered while the painful fact that sight if not absolutely gone was going was brought home to us by the circumstance that while dus was actually hovering over him like a guardian angel he inquired anxiously where she was  i am here uncle chainbearer answered the dear girl in tremulous toneshere before you and am about to wet your lips  i want te galtat isti wish her to pe near when te spirit mounts to heafen haf

a great deal do not think i can ever desert you until i know that your spirit has gone to the mercyseat of god  i knowet it said chainbearer endeavoring to raise his arms to feel for his niece who met

difficulty and were whispered rather than uttered aloud they came at intervals too especially toward the last in the way to announce the near approach of the state of which they were the more immediate percursors the last syllable i have recorded was no sooner uttered than the breath temporarily ceased i removed dus by gentle force placing her in the arms of her brother and turned to note the final respiration that final breath in which the spirit appears to be exhaled was calm placid and as easy as comports with the separation of soul and body leaving the hard aged wrinkled but benevolent countenance of the deceased with an expression of happy repose on it such as the friends of the dead love to look upon of all the deaths i had then witnessed this was the most tranquil and the best calculated to renew the hopes of a christian as for myself it added a profound respect for the character and moral qualities of ursula malbone to the love and admiration i bore her already the fruits of her beauty wit heart and other attractions  the two expected deaths had now taken place and it only remained to dispose of the legal questions connected with the events which had caused them inter the bodies and return to the nest i saw that one of the cabins was prepared for the reception of ursula and lowiny the latter still clinging to us while the body of chainbearer was laid out in a coffin that had been made by the same hands and at the same time as that of thousandacres about noon the coroner arrived not squire newcome but another for whom he had himself sent and a jury was immediately collected from among the members of the posse the proceedings were of no great length i told my story or as much of it as was necessary from beginning to end and others gave their testimony as to the proceedings at different periods in the events the finding was in the case of chainbearer murder by the hand of some person unknown and in that of thousandacres accidental death the first was right unquestionably as to the last i conceive there was as little of accident as ever occurred when a man was shot through the body by a steady hand and an unerring eye but such was the verdict and i had nothing but conjectures for my opinion as to the agency of the indian in killing the squatter  that evening and a cool autumnal night it was we buried thousandacres in the centre of the field i have mentioned of all his numerous family prudence and lowiny alone were present the service was short and the man of violence descended to mingle with the clods of the earth without a common prayer a verse from holy writ or any religious rite whatever the men who had borne the body and the few spectators present filled the grave rounded it handsomely and covered it with sods and were turning away in silence to retrace their steps to the dwellings when the profound stillness which had reigned throughout the whole of the brief ceremony was suddenly broken by the clear full voice of prudence who spoke in a tone and manner that arrested every step  men and brethren said this extraordinary woman who had so many of the vices of her condition relieved by so many of the virtues of her sex and origin men and brethren she said for i cannot call ye neighbors and will not call you foes i thank ye for this act of decent regard to the wants of both the departed and the living and that ye have thus come to assist in burying my dead out of my sight  some such address even a portion of these very words were customary but as no one had expected anything of the sort at that moment they startled as much as they surprised us as the rest of the party recovered from its wonder however it proceeded toward the huts leaving me alone with prudence who stood swinging her body as usual by the side of the grave  the night threatens to be cool i said and you had better return with me to the dwelling  whats the houses to me now aaron is gone the bys be fled and their wives and children and my children be fled leaving none in this clearin but lowiny who belongs more to yourn in feelin than to me and mine and the body that lies beneath the clods theres property in the housen that i do spose even the law would give us and maybe some one may want it give me that major littlepage to help to clothe and feed my young and ill never trouble this place agin theyll not call aaron a squatter for takin up that small piece of arth and one day perhaps youll not grudge to me as much more by its side its little more squattin that i can do and the next pitch i make will be the last  there is no wish on my part good woman to injure you your effects can be taken away from this place whenever you please and i will even help you to do it i answered in such a way as to put it in the power of your sons to receive the goods without risk to themselves i remember to have seen a batteau of some size in the stream below the mill can you tell me whether it remains there or not  why shouldnt it the bys built it two years ago to transport things in and its not likely to go off of itself  well then i will use that boat to get your effects off with safety to yourself tomorrow everything of any value that can be found about this place and to which you can have any right shall be put in that batteau and i will send the boat when loaded down the stream by means of my own black and the indian who shall abandon it a mile or two below where those you may send to look for it can take possession and carry the effects to any place you may choose  the woman seemed surprised and even affected by this proposal though she a little distrusted my motives  can i depend on this major littlepage she asked doubtingly tobit and his brethren would be desprate if any scheme to take em should be set on foot under sich a disguise  tobit and his brethren have nothing to fear from treachery of mine has the word of a gentleman no value in your eyes  i know that gentlemen ginrally do as they promise and so ive often told aaron as a reason for not bein hard on their property but he never would hear to it waal major littlepage ill put faith in you and will look for the batteau at the place youve mentioned god bless you for this and may he prosper you in that which is nearest your heart we shall never see each other aginfarewell  you surely will return to the house and pass the night comfortably under a roof  no ill quit you here the housen have little in em now that i love and i shall be happier in the woods  but the night is cool and ere it be morning it will become even chilling and cold  its colder in that grave answered the woman pointing mournfully with her long skinny finger to the mound which covered the remains of her husband im used to the forest and go to look for my children the mother that looks for her children is not to be kept back by winds and frost farewell agin major littlepage may god remember what you have done and will do for me and mine  but you forget your daughter what is to become of your daughter  lowiny has taken desprately to dus malbone and wishes to stay with her while dus wishes to have her stay if they get tired of each other my daghter can easily find us no gal of mine will be long put out in sich a sarch  as all this sounded probable and well enough i had no further objections to urge prudence waved her hand in adieu and away she went across the drearylooking fields with the strides of a man burying her tall gaunt figure in the shadow of the wood with as little hesitation as another would have entered the wellknown avenues of some town i never saw her afterward though one or two messages from her did reach me through lowiny  as i was returning from the grave jaap and the trackless came in from their scout the report they made was perfectly satisfactory by the trail which they followed for miles the squatters had actually absconded pushing for some distant point and nothing more was to be feared from them in that part of the country i now gave my orders as respected the goods and chattels of the family which were neither very numerous nor very valuable and it may as well be said here as later that everything was done next day strictly according to promise the first of the messages that i received from prudence came within a month acknowledging the receipt of her effects even to the gear of the mill and expressing her deep gratitude for the favor i have reason to think too that nearly half the lumber fell into the hands of these squatters quite that portion of it being in the stream at the time we removed from the spot and floating off with the rains that soon set in what was found at a later day was sold and the proceeds were appropriated to meet the expenses of and to make presents to the posse as an encouragement to such persons to see the majesty of the laws maintained  early next morning we made our preparations to quit the deserted mill ten of the posse arranged themselves into a party to see the body of chainbearer transported to the nest this was done by making a rude bier that was carried by two horses one preceding the other and having the corpse suspended between them i remained with the body but dus attended by lowiny and protected by her brother preceded us halting at chainbearers huts for our arrival at this point we passed the first night of our journey dus and frank again preceding us always on foot to the nest at this place the final halt of poor andries the brother and sister arrived at an hour before dinner while we did not get in with the body until the sun was just setting  as our little procession drew near the house i saw a number of wagons and horses in the orchard that spread around it which at first i mistook for a collection of the tenants met to do honor to the manes of chainbearer a second look however let me into the true secret of the case as we drew slowly near the whole procession on foot i discovered the persons of my own dear parents that of colonel follock those of kate pris bayard tom bayard and even of my sister kettletas in the group last of all i saw pressing forward to meet me yet a little repelled by the appearance of the coffin my dear and venerable old grandmother herself  here then were assembled nearly all of the house of littlepage with two or three near friends who did not belong to it frank malbone was among them and doubtless had told his story so that our visitors could not be surprised at our appearance on the other hand i was at no loss to understand how all this had been brought about franks express had found the party at fishkill had communicated his intelligence set everybody in motion on the wings of anxiety and love and here they were the journey had not been particularly rapid either plenty of time having elapsed between the time when my seizure by the squatters was first made known to my friends and the present moment to have got a message to lilacsbush and to have received its answer  kate afterward told me we made an imposing and solemn appearance as we came up to the gate of ravensnest bearing the body of chainbearer in advance marched susquesus and jaap each armed and the latter carrying an axe acting as occasion required in the character of a pioneer the bearers and attendants came next two and two armed as a part of the posse and carrying packs next succeeded the horses with the bier each led by a keeper i was the principal mourner though armed like the rest while chainbearers poor slaves now the property of dus brought up the rear carrying his compass chains and other emblems of his calling  we made no halt but passing the crowd collected on the lawn we went through the gateway and only came to a stand when we had reached the centre of the court as all the arrangements had been previously made the next step was to inter the body i knew that general littlepage had often officiated on such occasions and a request to that effect was made to him through tom bayard as for myself i said not a word to any of my own family begging them to excuse me until i had seen the last offices performed to the remains of my friend in half an hour all was ready and again the solemn procession was resumed as before susquesus and jaap led the way the latter now carrying a shovel and acting in the capacity of a sexton the indian bore a flaming torch of pine the darkness having so far advanced as to render artificial light necessary others of the party had these natural flambeaux also which added greatly to the solemnity and impressiveness of the scene general littlepage preceded the corpse carrying a prayerbook then followed the bearers with the coffin the horses being now dismissed dus veiled in black from head to foot and leaning on frank appeared as chief mourner though this was not strictly in conformity with real new york habits yet no one thought the occasion one on which to manifest the customary reserve of the sex everybody in or near the nest females as well as males appeared to do honor to the memory of chainbearer and dus came forth as the chief mourner priscilla bayard leaning on the arm of her brother tom edged herself in next to her friend though they had not as yet exchanged a syllable together and after all was over pris told me it was the first funeral she had ever attended or the first time she had ever been at a grave the same was true of my grandmother my mother and both my sisters i mention this lest some antiquarian a thousand years hence might light on this manuscript and mistake our customs of late years the new englanders are introducing an innovation on the old usage of the colony but among the upper real new york families women do not even now attend funerals in this respect i apprehend we follow the habits of england where females of the humbler classes as i have heard do while their superiors do not appear on such occasions the reason of the difference between the two is very easily appreciated though i limit my statements to what i conceive to be the facts without affecting to philosophize on them  but all our ladies attended the funeral of chainbearer i came next to tom and priscilla kate pressing up to my side and placing my arm in mine without speaking as she did this however the dear girl laid her little hand on mine and gave the latter a warm pressure as much as to say how greatly she was rejoiced at finding me safe and out of the hands of the philistines the rest of the party fell in behind and as soon as the indian saw that everybody was placed he moved slowly forward holding his flaming torch so high as to light the footsteps of those near him  directions had been sent to the nest to dig a grave for andries in the orchard and at no great distance from the verge of the rocks as i afterward ascertained it was at the very spot where one of the most remarkable events in the life of the general had occurred an event in which both susquesus and jaap had been conspicuous actors thither then we proceeded in funeral order and with funeral tread the torches throwing their wild and appropriate light over the nearer accessories of the scene never did the service sound more solemnly to me there being a pathos and richness in my fathers voice that were admirably adapted to the occasion then he felt what he was reading which does not always happen even when a clergyman officiates for not only was general littlepage a close friend of the deceased but he was a devout christian i felt a throb at the heart as i heard the fall of the first clods on the coffin of chainbearer but reflection brought its calm and from the moment dus became as it might be doubly dear to me it appeared to me as if all her uncles love and care had been transferred to myself and that henceforth i was to be his representative with his muchbeloved niece i did not hear a sob from ursula during the whole ceremony i knew that she wept and wept bitterly but her selfcommand was so great as to prevent any undue obtrusion of her griefs on others we all remained at the grave until jaap had rounded it with his utmost skill and had replaced the last sod then the procession formed anew and we accompanied frank and dus to the door of the house when she entered and left us without priscilla bayard however glided in after her friend and i saw them locked in each others arms through the window of the parlor by the light of the fire within at the next moment they retired together to the little room that dus had appropriated to her own particular use  now it was that i embraced and was embraced by my friends my mother held me long in her arms called me her dear dear boy and left tears on my face kate did pretty much the same though she said nothing as for anneke my dear sister kettletas her embrace was like herself gentle sincere and warmhearted nor must my dear old grandmother be forgotten for though she came last of the females she held me longest in her arms and after thanking god devoutly for my late escape she protested that i grew every hour more and more like the littlepages aunt mary kissed me with her customary affection  a portion of the embraces however occurred after we had entered the parlor which frank imitating dus had delicately as well as considerately left to ourselves colonel follock nevertheless gave me his salutations and congratulations before we left the court and they were as cordial and hearty as if he had been a second father  how atmiraply the general reats mortaunt our old friend added becoming very dutch as he got to be excited i haf always sayet tat corny littlepage woult make as goot a tominie as any rector tey ever hat in olt trinity put he mate as goot a soltier too corny ist an extraordinary man mortaunt ant one tay he wilt pe gofernor  this was a favorite theory of colonel van valkenburghs for himself he was totally without ambition whereas he thought nothing good enough for his friend corny littlepage scarce a year passed that he did not allude to the propriety of elevating te general to some high office or other nor am i certain that his allusions of this nature may not have had their effect since my father was elected to congress as soon as the new constitution was formed and continued to sit as long as his health and comfort would permit  supper was prepared for both parties of travellers of course and in due time we all took our seats at table i say all but that was not literally exact inasmuch as neither frank dus nor priscilla bayard appeared among us again that evening i presume each had something to eat though all took the meal apart from the rest of the family  after supper i was requested to relate seriatim all the recent events connected with my visit to the nest my arrest and liberation this i did of course seated at my grandmothers side the old lady holding one of my hands the whole time i was speaking the most profound attention was lent by all the party and a thoughtful silence succeeded my narration which ended only with the history of our departure from the mills  ay exclaimed colonel follock who was the first to speak after i had terminated my own account so much for yankee religion ill warrant you now corny tat te fellow tousantacres coult preach ant pray just like all te rest of our pilgrim faters  there are rogues of new york birth and extraction colonel follock as well as of new england answered my father dryly and the practice of squatting is incidental to the condition of the country as men are certain to make free with the property that is least protected and watched squatters are made by circumstances and not by any peculiar disposition of a particular portion of the population to appropriate the land of others to their own uses it would be the same with our hogs and our horses were they equally exposed to the depredations of lawless men let the latter come from connecticut or long island  let me catch one of tese gentry among my horses answered the colonel with a menacing shake of his head for dutchmanlike he had a wonderful love for the speciesi woult crop him wit my own hands witout chudge or chury  that might lead to evils almost as great as those produced by squatting dirck returned my father  by the way sir i put in knowing that colonel follock sometimes uttered extravagances on such subjects though as honest and wellmeaning a man as ever breathedi have forgotten to mention a circumstance that may have some interest as squire newcome is an old acquaintance of yours i then recounted all the facts connected with the first visit of mr jason newcome to the clearing of thousandacres and the substance of the conversation i had overheard between the squatter and that upright magistrate general littlepage listened with profound attention and as for colonel follock he raised his eyebrows grunted laughed as well as a man could with his lips compressing a pipe and uttered in the best way he was able under the circumstances and with sufficient sententiousness the single word danpury  nonodirck answered my father we must not put all the crimes and vices on our neighbors for many of them grow from the seedling to the tree bearing fruit in our own soil i know this man jason newcome reasonably well and while i have confided in him more than i ought perhaps i have never supposed he was the person in the least influenced by our conventional notions of honor and integrity what is called law honest i have believed him to be but it would seem in that i have been mistaken still i am not prepared to admit that the place of his birth or his education is the sole cause of his backslidings  own te trut corny like a man ast you pe ant confess it ist all our pilgrim faters ant tanpury itees what use ist tere in misleetin your own son who wilt come sooner or later to see te whole trut  i should be sorry dirck to teach my son any narrow prejudices the last war has thrown me much among officers from new england and the intercourse has taught me to esteem that portion of our fellowcitizens more than was our custom previously to the revolution  tush for intercourse ant esteem ant teachin corny te whole ting of squattin hast crosset te byram rifer ant unless we look to it te yankees wilt get all our lants away from us  jason newcome when i knew him best and i may say first continued my father without appearing to pay much attention to the observations of his friend the colonel was an exceedingly unfledged narrowminded provincial with a most overweening notion certainly of the high excellences of the particular state of society from which he had not long before emerged he had just as great a contempt for new york and new york wit and new york usages and especially for new york religion and morals as dirck here seems to have for all those excellences as they are exhibited in new england in a word the yankee despised the dutchman and the dutchman abominated the yankee in all this there is nothing new and i fancy the supercilious feeling of the new englandman can very easily be traced to his origin in the mother country but differences do exist i admit and i consider the feeling with which every new englander comes among us to be by habit adverse to our state of society in many particularssome good and some badand this merely because he is not accustomed to them among other things as a whole the population of these states do not relish the tenures by which our large estates are held there are plenty of men from that quarter of the country who are too well taught and whose honesty is too much of proof not to wish to oppose anything that is wrong in connection with this subject still the prejudices of nearly all who come from the east are opposed to the relation of landlord and tenant and this because they do not wish to see large landlords among them not being large landlords themselves i never found any gentleman or man of education from new england who saw any harm in a mans leasing a single farm to a single tenant or halfadozen farms to halfadozen tenants proof that it is not the tenure itself with which they quarrel but with a class of men who are or seem to be their superiors  i have heard the argument used against the leasehold system that it retards the growth and lessens the wealth of any district in which it may prevail  that it does not retard the growth is proved by the fact that farms can be leased always when it often requires years to sell them this estate is half filled now and will be entirely occupied long ere mooseridge will be a third sold that the latter may be the richest and the best tilled district in the end is quite probable and this for the simple reasons that richer men buy than rent to begin with and the owner usually takes better care of his farm than the mere tenant some of the richest best cultivated and most civilized regions on earth however are those in which the tenures of the actual occupants are and ever have been merely leasehold it is easy to talk and to feel in these matters but not quite so easy to come to just conclusions as some imagine there are portions of england for instancenorfolk in particularwhere the improvements are almost entirely owing to the resources and enterprise of the large proprietors as a question of political economy mordaunt depend on it this is one that has two sides to it as a question of mere stomach each man will be apt to view it as his gorge is up or down  shortly after this was said the ladies complained of fatigue a feeling in which we all participated and the party broke up for the night it seems the general had sent back word by the express of the accommodations he should require which enabled the good people of the nest to make such arrangements as rendered everybody reasonably comfortable     chapter xxx      lidthe victory is yours sir      kingit is a glorious one and well sets off                    our scene of mercy to the dead we tender                    our sorrow to the living ample wishes                    of future happinessbeaumont and fletcher   fatigue kept me in bed next morning until it was late on quitting the house i passed through the gateway then always left opendefence being no longer thought ofand walked musingly toward the grave of chainbearer previously to doing this i went as far as each corner of the building however to cast an eye over the fields on one side of the house i saw my father and mother arm in arm gazing around them while on the other aunt mary stood by herself looking wistfully in the direction of a wooded ravine which had been the scene of some important event in the early history of the country when she turned to reenter the building i found her face bathed in tears this respectable woman who was now well turned of forty had lost her betrothed in battle on that very spot a quarter of a century before and was now gazing on the sad scene for the first time since the occurrence of the event  something almost as interesting though not of so sad a nature also drew my parents to the other side of the house when i joined them an expression of grateful happiness a little saddened perhaps by incidental recollections was on the countenance of each my dear mother kissed me affectionately as i drew near and the general cordially gave me his hand while wishing me good morning  we were talking of you observed the last at the very moment you appeared ravensnest is now becoming a valuable property and its income added to the products of this large and very excellent farm that you have in your own hands should keep a country house not only in abundance but with something more you will naturally think of marrying ere long and your mother and i were just saying that you ought to build a good substantial stone dwelling on this very spot and settle down on your own property nothing contributes so much to the civilization of a country as to dot it with a gentry and you will both give and receive advantages by adopting such a course it is impossible for those who have never been witnesses of the result to appreciate the effect produced by one gentlemans family in a neighborhood in the way of manners tastes general intelligence and civilization at large  i am very willing to do my duty sir in this as in other particulars but a good stone country house such as a landlord ought to build on his property will cost money and i have no sum in hand to use for such a purpose  the house will cost far less than you suppose materials are cheap and so is labor just now your mother and myself will manage to let you have a few extra thousands for our town property is beginning to tell again and fear nothing on that score make your selection of a spot and lay the foundation of the house this autumn order the lumber sawed the lime burned and other preparations madeand arrange matters so that you can eat your christmas dinner in the year 1785 in the new residence of ravensnest by that time you will be ready to get married and we may all come up to the housewarming  has anything occurred in particular sir to induce you to imagine i am in any haste to marry you seem to couple matrimony and the new house together in a way to make me think there has  i caught the general there and while my mother turned her head aside and smiled i saw that my father colored a little though he made out to laugh after a moment of embarrassment however he answered with spiritmy good old grandmother coming up and linking her arm at his vacant side as he did so  why mord my boy you can have very little of the sensibility of the littlepages in you he said if you can be a daily spectator of such female loveliness as is now near you and not lose your heart  grandmother fidgeted and so did my mother for i could see that both thought the general had made too bold a demonstration with the tact of their sex they would have been more on their guard i reflected a moment and then determined to be frank the present being as good a time as any other to reveal my secret  i do not intend to be insincere with you my dear sir i answered for i know how much better it is to be open on matters that are of a common interest in a family than to affect mysteriousness i am a true littlepage on the score of sensibility to the charms of the sex and have not lived in daily familiar intercourse with female loveliness without experiencing so much of its influence as to be a warm advocate for matrimony it is my wish to marry and that too before this new abode of ravensnest can be completed  the common exclamation of delight that followed this declamation sounded in my ears like a knell for i knew it must be succeeded by a disappointment exactly proportioned to the present hopes but i had gone too far to retreat and felt bound to explain myself  im afraid my dear parents and my beloved grandmother i continued as soon as i could speak conscious of the necessity of being as prompt as possible that you have misunderstood me  not at all my dear boynot at all interrupted my father you admire priscilla bayard but have not yet so far presumed on your reception as to offer but what of that your modesty is in your favor though i will acknowledge that in my judgment a gentleman is bound to let his mistress know as soon as his own mind is made up that he is a suitor for her hand and that it is ungenerous and unmanly to wait until certain of success remember that mordaunt my boy modesty may be carried to a fault in a matter of this sort  you still misunderstand me sir i have nothing to reproach myself with on the score of manliness though i may have gone too far in another way without consulting my friends beyond sincere goodwill and friendship priscilla bayard is nothing to me and i am nothing to priscilla bayard  mordaunt exclaimed a voice that i never heard without its exciting filial tenderness  i have said but truth dearest mother and truth that ought to have been sooner said miss bayard would refuse me tomorrow were i to offer  you dont know that mordauntyou cant know it until you try interrupted my grandmother somewhat eagerly the minds of young women are not to be judged by the same rules as those of young men such an offer will not come every day i can tell her and shes much too discreet and rightjudging to do anything so silly to be sure i have no authority to say how priscilla feels toward you but if her heart is her own and mordy littlepage be not the youth that has stolen it i am no judge of my own sex  but you forget dearest grandmother that were your flattering opinions in my behalf all trueas i have good reason to believe they are notbut were they true i could only regret it should be so for i love another  this time the sensation was so profound as to produce a common silence just at that moment an interruption occurred of a nature both so sweet and singular as greatly to relieve me at least and to preclude the necessity of my giving any immediate account of my meaning i will explain how it occurred  the reader may remember that there were originally loops in the exterior walls of the house at ravensnest placed there for the purposes of defence and which were used as small windows in these peaceable times we were standing beneath one of those loops not near enough however to be seen or heard by one at the loop unless we raised our voices above the tone in which we were actually conversing out of this loop at that precise instant issued the low sweet strains of one of duss exquisite indian hymns i might almost call them set as was usual with her to a plaintive scotch melody on looking toward the grave of chainbearer i saw susquesus standing over it and i at once understood the impulse which led ursula to sing this song the words had been explained to me and i knew that they alluded to a warriors grave  the raised finger the delighted expression of the eye the attitude of intense listening which my beloved mother assumed each and all denoted the pleasure and emotion she experienced when however the singer suddenly changed the language to english after the last guttural words of the onondago had died on our ears and commenced to the same strain a solemn english hymn that was short in itself but full of piety and hope the tears started out of my mothers and grandmothers eyes and even general littlepage sought an occasion to blow his nose in a very suspicious manner presently the sounds died away and that exquisite melody ceased  in the name of wonder mordaunt who can this nightingale be demanded my father for neither of the ladies could speak  that is the person sir who has my plighted faiththe woman i must marry or remain single  this then must be the dus malbone or ursula malbone of whom i have heard so much from priscilla bayard within the last day or two said my mother in the tone and with the manner of one who is suddenly enlightened on any subject that has much interest with him or her i ought to have expected something of the sort if half the praises of priscilla be true  no one had a better mother than myself thoroughly a lady in all that pertains to the character she was also an humble and pious christian nevertheless humility and piety are in some respects particularly the first matters of convention the fitness of things had great merit in the eyes of both my parents and i cannot say that it is entirely without it in mine in nothing is this fitness of things more appropriate than in equalizing marriages and few things are less likely to be overlooked by a discreet parent than to have all proper care that the child connects itself prudently and that too as much in reference to station habits opinions breeding in particular and the general way of thinking as to fortune principles are inferred among people of principle as a matter of course but subordinate to these worldly position is ever of great importance in the eyes of parents my parents could not be very different from those of other people and i could see that both now thought that ursula malbone the chainbearers niece one who had actually carried chain herself for i had lightly mentioned that circumstance in one of my letters was scarcely a suitable match for the only son of general littlepage neither said much however though my father did put one or two questions that were somewhat to the point ere we separated  am i to understand mordaunt he asked with a little of the gravity a parent might be expected to exhibit on hearing so unpleasant an announcementam i to understand mordaunt that you are actually engaged to this youngehehehthis young person  do not hesitate my dear sir to call ursula malbone a lady she is a lady by both birth and education the last most certainly or she never could have stood in the relation she does to your family  and what relation is that sir  it is just this my dear father i have offered to ursulaindiscreetly hastily if you will as i ought to have waited to consult you and my motherbut we do not always follow the dictates of propriety in a matter of so much feeling i dare say sir you did betterhere i saw a slight smile on the pretty mouth of my mother and i began to suspect that the general had been no more dutiful than myself in this particularbut i hope my forgetfulness will be excused on account of the influence of a passion which we all find so hard to resist  but what is the relation this youngladybears to my family mordaunt you are not already married  far from it sir i should not so far have failed in respect to you threeor even to anneke and katrinke i have offered and have been conditionally accepted  which condition is  the consent of you three the perfect approbation of my whole near connection i believe that dus dear dus does love me and that she would cheerfully give me her hand were she certain of its being agreeable to you but that no persuasion of mine will ever induce her so to do under other circumstances  this is something for it shows the girl has principle answered my father why who goes there  who went there sure enough there went frank malbone and priscilla bayard arm in arm and so engrossed in conversation that they did not see who were observing them i dare say they fancied they were in the woods quite sheltered from curious eyes and at liberty to saunter about as much occupied with each other as they pleased or what is more probable that they thought of nothing just then but of themselves they came out of the court and walked off swiftly into the orchard appearing to tread on air and seemingly as happy as the birds that were carolling on the surrounding trees  there sir i said significantlythere my dear mother is the proof that miss priscilla bayard will not break her heart on my account  this is very extraordinary indeed exclaimed my much disappointed grandmotheris not that the young man who we were told acted as chainbearers surveyor corny  it is my good mother and a very proper and agreeable youth he is as i know by a conversation held with him last night it is very plain we have all been mistakenadded the general though i do not know that we ought to say that we have any of us been deceived  here comes kate with a face which announces that she is fully mistress of the secret i put in perceiving my sister coming round our angle of the building with a countenance which i knew betokened that her mind and heart were full she joined us took my arm without speaking and followed my father who led his wife and mother to a rude bench that had been placed at the foot of a tree where we all took seats each waiting for some other to speak my grandmother broke the silence  do you see pris bayard yonder walking with that mr frank chainbearer or surveyor or whatever his name is katrinke dear asked the good old lady  i do grandmamma answered the good young lady in a voice so pitched as to be hardly audible  and can you explain what it means darling  i believe i can maamififmordaunt wishes to hear  dont mind me kate returned i smilingmy heart will never be broken by miss priscilla bayard  the look of sisterly solicitude that i received from that honesthearted girl ought to have made me feel very grateful and it did make me feel grateful for a sisters affection is a sweet thing i believe the calmness of my countenance and its smiling expression encouraged the dear creature for she now began to tell her story as fast as was at all in rule  the meaning then is this said kate that gentleman is mr francis malbone and he is the engaged suitor of priscilla i have had all the facts from her own mouth  will you then let us hear as many of them as it is proper we should know said the general gravely  there is no wish on the part of priscilla to conceal anything she has known mr malbone several years and they have been attached all that time nothing impeded the affair but his poverty old mr bayard objected to that of course you know as fathers will and priscilla would not engage herself butdo you not remember to have heard of the death of an old mrs hazleton at bath in england this summer mamma the bayards are in halfmourning for her now  certainly my dearmrs hazleton was mr bayards aunt i knew her well once before she became a refugeeher husband was a halfpay colonel hazleton of the royal artillery and they were tories of course the aunt was named priscilla and was godmother to our pris  just sowell this lady has left pris ten thousand pounds in the english funds and the bayards now consent to her marrying mr malbone they say too but i dont think that can have had any influence for mr bayard and his wife are particularly disinterested people as indeed are all the familyadded kate hesitatingly and looking down but they say that the death of some young man will probably leave mr malbone the heir of an aged cousin of his late fathers  and now my dear father and mother you will perceive that miss bayard will not break her heart because i happen to love dus malbone i see by your look katrinke that you have had some hint of this backsliding also  i have and what is more i have seen the young lady and can hardly wonder at it anneke and i have been passing two hours with her this morning and since you cannot get pris i know no other mordaunt who will so thoroughly supply her place anneke is in love with her also  dear good soberminded judicious anneke she had penetrated into the true character of dus in a single interview a circumstance that i ascribed to the impression left by the recent death of chainbearer ordinarily that spirited young woman would not have permitted a sufficiently near approach in a first interview to permit a discovery of so many of her sterling qualities but now her heart was softened and her spirit so much subdued one of annekes habitual gentleness would be very apt to win on her sympathies and draw the two close to each other the reader is not to suppose that dus had opened her mind like a vulgar schoolgirl and made my sister a confidant of the relation in which she and i stood to one another she had not said or hinted a syllable on the subject the information kate possessed had come from priscilla bayard who obtained it from frank as a matter of course and my sister subsequently admitted to me that her friends happiness was augmented by the knowledge that i should not be a sufferer by her earlier preference for malbone and that she was likely to have me for a brotherinlaw all this i gleaned from kate in our subsequent conferences  this is extraordinary exclaimed the generalvery extraordinary and to me quite unexpected  we can have no right to control miss bayards choice observed my discreet and highprincipled mother she is her own mistress so far as we are concerned and if her own parents approve of her choice the less we say about it the better as respects this connection of mordaunts i hope he himself will admit of our right to have opinions  perfectly so my dearest mother all i ask of you is to express no opinion however until you have seen ursulahave become acquainted with her and are qualified to judge of her fitness to be not only mine but any mans wife i ask but this of your justice  it is just and i shall act on the suggestion observed my father you have a right to demand this of us mordaunt and i can promise for your mother as well as myself  after all anneke put in grandmother i am not sure we have no right to complain of miss bayards conduct toward us had she dropped the remotest hint of her being engaged to this malbone i would never have endeavored to lead my grandson to think of her seriously for one moment  your grandson never has thought of her seriously for one moment or for half a moment dearest grandmother i cried so give your mind no concern on that subject nothing of the sort could make me happier than to know that priscilla bayard is to marry frank malbone unless it were to be certain i am myself to marry the latters halfsister  how can this behow could such a thing possibly come to pass my child i do not remember ever to have heard of this personmuch less to have spoken to you on the subject of such a connection  oh dearest grandmother we truant children sometimes get conceits of this nature into our heads and hearts without stopping to consult our relatives as we ought to do  but it is useless to repeat all that was said in the long and desultory conversation that followed i had no reason to be dissatisfied with my parents who ever manifested toward me not only great discretion but great indulgence i confess when a domestic came to say that miss dus was at the breakfasttable waiting for us alone i trembled a little for the effect that might be produced on her appearance by the scenes she had lately gone through she had wept a great deal in the course of the last week and when i last saw her which was the glimpse caught at the funeral she was pale and dejected in aspect a lover is so jealous of even the impression that his mistress will make on those he wishes to admire her that i felt particularly uncomfortable as we entered first the court then the house and last the eatingroom  a spacious and ample board had been spread for the accommodation of our large party anneke priscilla frank malbone aunt mary and ursula were already seated when we entered dus occupying the head of the table no one had commenced the meal nor had the young mistress of the board even begun to pour out the tea and coffee for my presence had brought abundance into the house but there she sat respectfully waiting for those to approach who might be properly considered the principal guests i thought dus had never appeared more lovely her dress was a neatlyarranged and tasteful halfmourning with which her golden hair rosy cheeks and bright eyes contrasted admirably the cheeks of dus too had recovered their color and her eyes their brightness the fact was that the news of her brothers improved fortunes had even been better than we were just told frank found letters for him at the nest announcing the death of his kinsman with a pressing invitation to join the bereaved parent then an aged and bedridden invalid as his adopted son he was urged to bring dus with him and he received a handsome remittance to enable him so to do without inconvenience to himself this alone would have brought happiness back to the countenance of the poor and dependent dus mourned her uncle in sincerity and she long continued to mourn for him but her mourning was that of the christian who hoped chainbearers hurt had occurred several days before and the first feeling of sorrow had become lessened by time and reflection his end had been happy and he was now believed to be enjoying the fruition of his penitence through the sacrifice of the son of god  it was easy to detect the surprise that appeared in the countenances of all my parents as miss malbone rose like one who was now confident of her position and claims to give and to receive the salutations that were proper for the occasion never did any young woman acquit herself better than dus who courtesied gracefully as a queen while she returned the compliments she received with the selfpossession of one bred in courts to this she was largely indebted to nature though her schooling had been good many of the first young women of the colony had been her companions for years and in that day manner was far more attended to than it is getting to be among us now my mother was delighted for as she afterward assured me her mind was already made up to receive ursula as a daughter since she thought it due to honor to redeem my plighted faith general littlepage might not have been so very scrupulous though even he admitted the right of the obligations i had incurred but dus fairly carried him by storm the tempered sadness of her mien gave an exquisite finish to her beauty rendering all she said did and looked that morning perfect in a word everybody was wondering but everybody was pleased an hour or two later and after the ladies had been alone together my excellent grandmother came to me and desired to have a little conversation with me apart we found a seat in the arbor of the court and my venerable parent commenced as follows  well mordaunt my dear it is time that you should think of marrying and of settling in life as miss bayard is happily engaged i do not see that you can do better than to offer to miss malbone never have i seen so beautiful a creature and the generousminded pris tells me she is as good and virtuous and wise as she is lovely she is well born and well educated and may have a good fortune in the bargain if that old mr malbone is as rich as they tell me he is and has conscience enough to make a just will take my advice my dear son and marry ursula malbone  dear grandmother i did take her advice and i am persuaded that to her dying day she was all the more happy under the impression that she had materially aided in bringing about the connection  as general littlepage and colonel follock had come so far they chose to remain a month or two in order to look after their lands and to revisit some scenes in that part of the world in which both felt a deep interest my mother and aunt mary too seemed content to remain for they remembered events which the adjacent country recalled to their minds with a melancholy pleasure in the meanwhile frank went to meet his cousin and had time to return ere our party was disposed to break up during his absence everything was arranged for my marriage with his sister this event took place just two months to a day from that of the funeral of chainbearer a clergyman was obtained from albany to perform the ceremony as neither party belonged to the congregational order and an hour after we were united everybody left us alone at the nest on their return south i say everybody though jaap and susquesus were exceptions these two remained and remain to this hour though the negro did return to lilacsbush and satanstoe to assemble his family and to pay occasional visits  there was much profound feeling but little parade at the wedding my mother had got to love ursula as if she were her own child and i had not only the pleasure but the triumph of seeing the manner in which my betrothed rendered herself from day to day and this without any other means than the most artless and natural more and more acceptable to my friends  this is perfect happiness said dus to me one lovely afternoon that we were strolling in company along the cliff near the nestand a few minutes after she had left my mothers arms who had embraced and blessed her as a pious parent does both to a wellbeloved childthis is perfect happiness mordaunt to be the chosen of you and the accepted of your parents i never knew until now what it is to have a parent uncle chainbearer did all he could for me and i shall cherish his memory to my latest breathbut uncle chainbearer could never supply the place of a mother how blessed how undeservedly blessed does my lot promise to become you will give me not only parents and parents i can love as well as if they were those granted by nature but you will give me also two such sisters as few others possess  and i give you all dearest dus encumbered with such a husband that i am almost afraid you will fancy the other gifts too dearly purchased when you come to know him better  the ingenuous grateful look the conscious blush and the thoughtful pensive smile each and all said that my pleased and partial listener had no concern on that score had i then understood the sex as well as i now do i might have foreseen that a wifes affection augments instead of diminishing that the love the pure and devoted matron bears her husband increases with time and gets to be a part and parcel of her moral existence i am no advocate of what are called strictly marriages of reasoni think the solemn and enduring knot should be tied by the hands of warmhearted impulsive affection increased and strengthened by knowledge and confidential minglings of thought and feeling but i have lived long enough to understand that lively as are the passions of youth they produce no delights like those which spring from the tried and deep affections of a happy married life  and we were married the ceremony took place before breakfast in order to enable our friends to reach the great highway ere night should overtake them the meal that succeeded was silent and thoughtful then my dear dear mother took dus in her arms and kissed and blessed her again and again my honored father did the same bidding my weeping but happy bride remember that she was now his daughter mordaunt is a good fellow at the bottom dear and will love and cherish you as he has promised added the general blowing his nose to conceal his emotion but should he ever forget any part of his vows come to me and i will visit him with a fathers displeasure  no fear of mordauntno fear of mordaunt put in my worthy grandmother who succeeded in the temporary leavetakinghe is a littlepage and all the littlepages make excellent husbands the boy is as like what his grandfather was at his time of life as one pea is like another god bless you daughteryou will visit me at satanstoe this fall when i shall have great pleasure in showing you my generals picture  anneke and kate and pris bayard hugged dus in such a way that i was afraid they would eat her up while frank took his leave of his sister with the manly tenderness he always showed her the fellow was too happy himself however to be shedding many tears though dus actually sobbed on his bosom the dear creature was doubtless running over the past in her mind and putting it in contrast with the blessed present  at the end of the honeymoon i loved dus twice as much as i had loved her the hour we were married had any one told me this was possible i should have derided the thought but thus it was and i may truly add thus has it ever continued to be at the end of that month we left ravensnest for lilacsbush when i had the pleasure of seeing my bride duly introduced to that portion of what is called the world to which she properly belonged previously to quitting the patent however all my plans were made and contracts were signed preparatory to the construction of the house that my father had mentioned the foundation was laid that same season and we did keep our christmas holidays in it the following year by which time dus had made me the father of a noble boy  it is scarcely necessary to say that frank and pris were married as were tom and kate at no great distance of time after ourselves both of those matches have turned out to be perfectly happy old mr malbone did not survive the winter and he left the whole of a very sufficient estate to his kinsman frank was desirous of making his sister a sharer in his good fortune but i would not hear of it dus was treasure enough of herself and wanted not money to enhance her value in my eyes i thought so in 1785 and i think so today we got some plate and presents that were well enough but never would accept any portion of the property the rapid growth of new york brought our vacant lots in that thriving town into the market and we soon became richer than was necessary to happiness i hope the gifts of providence have never been abused of one thing i am certain dus has ever been far more prized by me than any other of my possessions  i ought to say a word of jaap and the indian both are still living and both dwell at the nest for the indian i caused a habitation to be erected in a certain ravine at no great distance from the house and which had been the scene of one of his early exploits in that part of the country here he lives and has lived for the last twenty years and here he hopes to die he gets his food blankets and whatever else is necessary to supply his few wants at the nest coming and going at will he is now drawing fast on old age but retains his elastic step upright movement and vigor i do not see but he may live to be a hundred the same is true of jaap the old fellow holds on and enjoys life like a true descendant of the africans he and sus are inseparable and often stray off into the forest on long hunts even in the winter returning with loads of venison wild turkeys and other game the negro dwells at the nest but half his time he sleeps in the wigwam as we call the dwelling of sus the two old fellows dispute frequently and occasionally they quarrel but as neither drinks the quarrels are never very long or very serious they generally grow out of differences of opinion on moral philosophy as connected with their respective views of the past and the future  lowiny remained with us as a maid until she made a very suitable marriage with one of my own tenants for a little while after my marriage i thought she was melancholy probably through regret for her absent and dispersed family but this feeling soon disappeared and she became contented and happy her good looks improved under the influence of civilization and i have the satisfaction of adding that she never has had any reason to regret having attached herself to us to this moment she is an outdoor dependent and humble friend of my wife and we find her particularly useful in cases of illness among our children  what shall i say of squire newcome he lived to a good old age dying quite recently and with many who knew or rather who did not know him he passed for a portion of the salt of the earth i never proceeded against him on account of his connection with the squatters and he lived his time in a sort of lingering uncertainty as to my knowledge of his tricks that man became a sort of a deacon in his church was more than once a member of the assembly and continued to be a favorite recipient of public favors down to his last moment and this simply because his habits brought him near to the mass and because he took the most elaborate care never to tell them a truth that was unpleasant he once had the temerity to run against me for congress but that experiment proved to be a failure had it been attempted forty years later it might have succeeded better jason died poor and in debt after all his knavery and schemes avidity for gold had overreached itself in his case as it does in those of so many others his descendants notwithstanding remain with us and while they have succeeded to very little in the way of property they are the legitimate heritors of their ancestors vulgarity of mind and mannersof his tricks his dissimulations and his frauds this is the way in which providence visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations  little more remains to be said the owners of mooseridge have succeeded in selling all the lots they wished to put into the market and large sums stand secured on them in the way of bonds and mortgages anneke and kate have received fair portions of this property including much that belonged to colonel follock who now lives altogether with my parents aunt mary i regret to say died a few years since a victim to smallpox she never married of course and left her handsome property between my sisters and a certain lady of the name of ten eyck who needed it and whose principal claim consisted in her being a third cousin of her former lover i believe my mother mourned the death of her friend sincerely as did we all but we had the consolation of believing her happy with the angels  i caused to be erected in the extensive grounds that were laid out around the new dwelling at the nest a suitable monument over the grave of chainbearer it bore a simple inscription and one that my children now often read and comment on with pleasure we all speak of him as uncle chainbearer to this hour and his grave is never mentioned on other terms than those of uncle chainbearers grave excellent old man that he was not superior to the failings of human nature need not be said but so long as he lived he lived a proof of how much more respectable and estimable is the man who takes simplicity and honesty and principle and truth for his guide than he who endeavors to struggle through the world by the aid of falsehood chicanery and trick  the end     the redskins  or  indian and injin  being the conclusion of  the littlepage manuscripts  by j fenimore cooper      in every work regard the writers end     none eer can compass more than they intend                                              pope  illustration all of the girls but mary warren had entered the house she remained at the side of my grandmother    preface   this book closes the series of the littlepage manuscripts which have been given to the world as containing a fair account of the comparative sacrifices of time money and labor made respectively by the landlord and the tenants on a new york estate together with the manner in which usages and opinions are changing among us as well as certain of the reasons of these changes the discriminating reader will probably be able to trace in these narratives the progress of those innovations on the great laws of morals which are becoming so very manifest in connection with this interest setting at naught the plainest principles that god has transmitted to man for the government of his conduct and all under the extraordinary pretence of favoring liberty in this downward course our picture embraces some of the proofs of that looseness of views on the subject of certain species of property which is in a degree perhaps inseparable from the semibarbarous condition of a new settlement the gradation of the squatter from him who merely makes his pitch to crop a few fields in passing to him who carries on the business by wholesale and last though not least in this catalogue of marauders the antirenter  it would be idle to deny that the great principle which lies at the bottom of antirentism if principle it can be called is the assumption of a claim that the interests and wishes of numbers are to be respected though done at a sacrifice of the clearest rights of the few that this is not liberty but tyranny in its worst form every rightthinking and rightfeeling man must be fully aware every one who knows much of the history of the past and of the influence of classes must understand that whenever the educated the affluent and the practised choose to unite their means of combination and money to control the political destiny of a country they become irresistible making the most subservient tools of those very masses who vainly imagine they are the true guardians of their own liberties the wellknown election of 1840 is a memorable instance of the power of such a combination though that was a combination formed mostly for the mere purposes of faction sustained perhaps by the desperate designs of the insolvents of the country such a combination was necessarily wanting in union among the affluent it had not the high support of principles to give it sanctity and it affords little more than the proof of the power of money and leisure when applied in a very doubtful cause in wielding the masses of a great nation to be the instruments of their own subjection no wellintentioned american legislator consequently ought ever to lose sight of the fact that each invasion of the right which he sanctions is a blow struck against liberty itself which in a country like this has no auxiliary so certain or so powerful as justice  the state of new york contains about 43000 square miles of land or something like 27000000 of acres in 1783 its population must have been about 200000 souls with such a proportion between people and surface it is unnecessary to prove that the husbandman was not quite as dependent on the landholder as the landholder was dependent on the husbandman this would have been true had the state been an island but we all know it was surrounded by many other communities similarly situated and that nothing else was so abundant as land all notions of exactions and monopolies therefore must be untrue as applied to those two interests at that day  in 17867 the state of new york then in possession of all powers on the subject abolished entails and otherwise brought its law of real estate in harmony with the institutions at that time hundreds perhaps thousands of the leases which have since become so obnoxious were in existence with the attention of the state drawn directly to the main subject no one saw anything incompatible with the institutions in them it was felt that the landlords had bought the tenants to occupy their lands by the liberality of their concessions and that the latter were the obliged parties had the landlords of that day endeavored to lease for one year or for ten years no tenants could have been found for wild lands but it became a different thing when the owner of the soil agreed to part with it forever in consideration of a very low rent granting six or eight years free from any charge whatever and consenting to receive the product of the soil itself in lieu of money then indeed men were not only willing to come into the terms but eager the best evidence of which is the fact that the same tenants might have bought land out and out in every direction around them had they not preferred the easier terms of the leases now that these same men or their successors have become rich enough to care more to be rid of the encumbrance of the rent than to keep their money the rights of the parties certainly are not altered  in 1789 the constitution of the united states went into operation new york being a party to its creation and conditions by that constitution the state deliberately deprived itself of the power to touch the covenants of these leases without conceding the power to any other government unless it might be through a change of the constitution itself as a necessary consequence these leases in a legal sense belong to the institutions of new york instead of being opposed to them not only is the spirit of the institutions in harmony with these leases but so is the letter also men must draw a distinction between the spirit of the institutions and their own spirits the latter being often nothing more than a stomach that is not easily satisfied it would be just as true to affirm that domestic slavery is opposed to the institutions of the united states as to say the same of these leases it would be just as rational to maintain because a does not choose to make an associate of b that he is acting in opposition to the spirit of the institutions inasmuch as the declaration of independence advances the dogma that men are born equal as it is to say it is opposed to the same spirit for b to pay rent to a according to his covenant  it is pretended that the durable leases are feudal in their nature we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twentyeight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labor for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run forever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases  among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the wellknown english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quartersales fifthsales sixthsales etc of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quartersales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quartersales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions  feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knights service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villain the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knights service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favorable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act  the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villain soccage is that of the days works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these days works and at a stipulated price  but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts the greater the number of the offenders the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency to say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent and to say that they cannot be put down under our form of government is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society if this be really so the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better the notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest the larger the concessions become the greater will be the exactions of a cormorant cupidity as soon as quiet is obtained by these means in reference to the leasehold tenures it will be demanded by some fresh combination to attain some other end  when lee told washington at monmouth sir your troops will not stand against british grenadiers washington is said to have answered sir you have never tried them the same reply might be given to those miserable traducers of this republic who in order to obtain votes affect to think there is not sufficient energy in its government to put down so barefaced an attempt as this of the antirenters to alter the conditions of their own leases to suit their own convenience the county of delaware has of itself nobly given the lie to the assertion the honest portion of its inhabitants scattering the knaves to the four winds the moment there was a fair occasion made for them to act a single energetic proclamation from albany calling a spade a spade and not affecting to gloss over the disguised robbery of these antirenters and laying just principles fairly before the public mind would of itself have crushed the evil in its germ the people of new york in their general capacity are not the knaves their servants evidently suppose  the assembly of new york in its memorable session of 1846 has taxed the rents on long leases thus not only taxing the same property twice but imposing the worst sort of incometax or one aimed at a few individuals it has thimblerigged in its legislation as mr hugh littlepage not unaptly terms it endeavoring to do that indirectly which the constitution will not permit it to do directly in other words as it can pass no direct law impairing the obligation of contracts while it can regulate descents it has enacted so far as one body of the legislature has power to enact anything that on the death of a landlord the tenant may convert his lease into a mortgage on discharging which he shall hold his land in fee  we deem the first of these measures far more tyrannical than the attempt of great britain to tax her colonies which brought about the revolution it is of the same general character that of unjust taxation while it is attended by circumstances of aggravation that were altogether wanting in the policy of the mother country this is not a tax for revenue which is not needed but a tax to choke off landlords to use a common american phrase it is clearly taxing nothing or it is taxing the same property twice it is done to conciliate three or four thousand voters who are now in the market at the expense of three or four hundred who it is known are not to be bought it is unjust in its motives its means and its end the measure is discreditable to civilization and an outrage on liberty  but the other law mentioned is an atrocity so grave as to alarm every man of common principle in the state were it not so feeble in its devices to cheat the constitution as to excite contempt this extraordinary power is exercised because the legislature can control the law of descents though it cannot impair the obligation of contracts had the law said at once that on the death of a landlord each of his tenants should own his farm in fee the ensemble of the fraud would have been preserved since the law of descents would have been so far regulated as to substitute one heir for another but changing the nature of a contract with a party who has nothing to do with the succession at all is not so very clearly altering or amending the law of descents it is scarcely necessary to say that every reputable court in the country whether state or federal would brand such a law with the disgrace it merits  but the worst feature of this law or attempted law remains to be noticed it would have been a premium on murder murder has already been committed by these antirenters and that obviously to effect their ends and they are to be told that whenever you shoot a landlord as some have already often shot at them you can convert your leasehold tenures into tenures in fee the mode of valuation is so obvious too as to deserve a remark a master was to settle the valuation on testimony the witnesses of course would be the neighbors and a whole patent could swear for each other  as democrats we protest most solemnly against such barefaced frauds such palpable cupidity and covetousness being termed anything but what they are if they come of any party at all it is the party of the devil democracy is a lofty and noble sentiment it does not rob the poor to make the rich richer nor the rich to favor the poor it is just and treats all men alike it does not impair the obligations of contracts it is not the friend of a canting legislation but meaning right dare act directly there is no greater delusion than to suppose that true democracy has anything in common with injustice or roguery  nor is it an apology for antirentism in any of its aspects to say that leasehold tenures are inexpedient the most expedient thing in existence is to do right were there no other objection to this antirent movement than its corrupting influence that alone should set every wise man in the community firmly against it we have seen too much of this earth to be so easily convinced that there is any disadvantage nay that there is not a positive advantage in the existence of large leasehold estates when they carry with them no political power as is the fact here the commonplace argument against them that they defeat the civilization of a country is not sustained by fact the most civilized countries on earth are under this system and this system too not entirely free from grave objections which do not exist among ourselves that a poorer class of citizens have originally leased than have purchased lands in new york is probably true and it is equally probable that the effects of this poverty and even of the tenure in the infancy of a country are to be traced on the estates but this is taking a very onesided view of the matter the men who became tenants in moderate but comfortable circumstances would have been mostly laborers on the farms of others but for these leasehold tenures that is the benefit of the system in a new country and the ultra friend of humanity who decries the condition of a tenant should remember that if he had not been in this very condition he might have been in a worse it is indeed one of the proofs of the insincerity of those who are decrying leases on account of their aristocratic tendencies that their destruction will necessarily condemn a numerous class of agriculturists either to fall back into the ranks of the peasant or daylaborer or to migrate as is the case with so many of the same class in new england in point of fact the relation of landlord and tenant is one entirely natural and salutary in a wealthy community and one that is so much in accordance with the necessities of men that no legislation can long prevent it a state of things which will not encourage the rich to hold real estate would not be desirable since it would be diverting their money knowledge liberality feelings and leisure from the improvement of the soil to objects neither so useful nor so praiseworthy  the notion that every husbandman is to be a freeholder is as utopian in practice as it would be to expect that all men were to be on the same level in fortune condition education and habits as such a state of things as the last never yet did exist it was probably never designed by divine wisdom that it should exist the whole structure of society must be changed even in this country ere it could exist among ourselves and the change would not have been made a month before the utter impracticability of such a social fusion would make itself felt by all  we have elsewhere imputed much of the antirent feeling to provincial education and habits this term has given the deepest offence to those who were most obnoxious to the charge nevertheless our opinion is unchanged we know that the distance between the cataract at niagara and the massachusetts line is a large hundred leagues and that it is as great between sandy hook and the 45th parallel of latitude many excellent things moral and physical are to be found within these limits beyond a question but we happen to know by an experience that has extended to other quarters of the world for a term now exceeding forty years that more are to found beyond them if honorable gentlemen at albany fancy the reverse they must still permit us to believe they are too much under the influence of provincial notions     the redskins     chapter i      thy mother was a piece of virtue and     she saidthou wert

fully five years when we reached paris for eighteen months neither of us had seen a line from america when we drove through the barriers on our way from egypt viâ algiers marseilles and lyons not once in all that time had we crossed our own track in a way to enable us to pick up a straggling letter and all our previous precautions to have the epistles meet us at different bankers in italy turkey and malta were thrown away  my uncle was an old travelleri might almost say an old residentin europe for he had passed no less than twenty years of his fiftynine off the american continent a bachelor with nothing to do but to take care of a very ample estate which was rapidly increasing in value by the enormous growth of the town of new york and with tastes early formed by travelling it was natural he should seek those regions where he most enjoyed himself hugh roger littlepage was born in 1786the second son of my grandfather mordaunt littlepage and of ursula malbone his wife my own father malbone littlepage was the eldest child of that connection and he would have inherited the property of ravensnest in virtue of his birthright had he survived his own parents but dying young i stepped into what would otherwise have been his succession in my eighteenth year my uncle ro however had got both satanstoe and lilacsbush two countryhouses and farms which while they did not aspire to the dignity of being estates were likely to prove more valuable in the long run than the broad acres which were intended for the patrimony of the elder brother my grandfather was affluent for not only had the fortune of the littlepages centred in him but so did that of the mordaunts the wealthier family of the two together with some exceedingly liberal bequests from a certain colonel dirck follock or van valkenburgh who though only a very distant connection chose to make my greatgrandmothers or anneke mordaunts descendants his heirs we all had enough my aunts having handsome legacies in the way of bonds and mortgages on an estate called mooseridge in addition to some lots in town while my own sister martha had a clear fifty thousand dollars in money i had town lots also which were becoming productive and a special minority of seven years had made an accumulation of cash that was well vested in new york state stock and which promised well for the future i say a special minority for both my father and grandfather in placing the one myself and a portion of the property and the other the remainder of my estate under the guardianship and ward of my uncle had made a provision that i was not to come into possession until i had completed my twentyfifth year  i left college at twenty and my uncle ro for so martha and myself always called him and so he was always called by some twenty cousins the offspring of our three auntsbut my uncle ro when i was done with college proposed to finish my education by travelling as this was only too agreeable to a young man away we went just after the pressure of the great panic of 18367 was over and our lots were in tolerable security and our stocks safe in america it requires almost as much vigilance to take care of property

already seen enough to ascertain that while our country as this blessed nation is very apt on all occasions appropriate or not to be called by all who belong to it as well as by a good many who do not could teach a great deal to the old world there was a possibilityjust a possibility remark is my wordthat it might also learn a little with a view therefore of acquiring knowledge seriatim as it might be he was for beginning with the hornbook and going on regularly up to the belleslettres and mathematics the manner in which this was effected deserves a notice  most american travellers land in england the country farthest advanced in material civilization then proceed to italy and perhaps to greece leaving germany and the less attractive regions of the north to come in at the end of the chapter my uncles theory was to follow the order of time and to begin with the ancients and end with the moderns though in adopting such a rule he admitted he somewhat lessened the pleasure of the novice since an american fresh from the fresher fields of the western continent might very well find delight in memorials of the past more especially in england which pall on his taste and appear insignificant after he has become familiar with the temple of neptune the parthenon or what is left of it and the coliseum i make no doubt that i lost a great deal of passing happiness in this way by beginning at the beginning in italy and travelling north  such was our course however and landing at leghorn we did the peninsula effectually in a twelvemonth thence passed through spain up to paris and proceeded on to moscow and the baltic reaching england from hamburg when we had got through with the british isles the antiquities of which seemed flat and uninteresting to me after having seen those that were so much more antique we returned to paris in order that i might become a man of the world if possible by rubbing off the provincial specks that had unavoidably adhered to the american diamond while in its obscurity  my uncle ro was fond of paris and he had actually become the owner of a small hotel in the faubourg in which he retained a handsome furnished apartment for his own use the remainder of the house was let to permanent tenants but the whole of the first floor and of the entresol remained in his hands as a special favor he would allow some american family to occupy even his own apartmentor rather appartement for the words are not exactly synonymouswhen he intended to be absent for a term exceeding six months using the money thus obtained in keeping the furniture in repair and his handsome suite of rooms including a salon salle à manger antichambre cabinet several chambres à coucher and a boudoiryes a male boudoir for so he affected to call itin a condition to please even his fastidiousness  on our arrival from england we remained an entire season at paris all that time rubbing the specks off the diamond when my uncle suddenly took it into his head that we ought to see the east he had never been further than greece himself and he now took a fancy to be my companion in such an excursion we were gone two years and a half visiting greece constantinople asia minor the holy land petra the red sea egypt quite to the second cataracts and nearly the whole of barbary the latter region we threw in by way of seeing something out of the common track but so many hats and travellingcaps are to be met with nowadays among the turbans that a wellmannered christian may get along almost anywhere without being spit upon this is a great inducement for travelling generally and ought to be so especially to an american who on the whole incurs rather more risk now of suffering this humiliation at home than he would even in algiers but the animus is everything in morals  we had then been absent two years and a half from paris and had not seen a paper or received a letter from america in eighteen months when we drove through the barrier even the letters and papers received or seen previously to this last term were of a private nature and contained nothing of a general character the twenty millionsit was only the other day they were called the twelve millionsbut the twenty millions we knew had been looking up amazingly after the temporary depression of the moneyed crisis it had gone through and the bankers had paid our drafts with confidence and without extra charges during the whole time we had been absent it is true uncle ro as an experienced traveller went well fortified in the way of credita precaution by no means unnecessary with america after the cry that had been raised against us in the old world  and here i wish to say one thing plainly before i write another line as for falling into the narrow selfadulatory provincial feeling of the american who has never left his mothers apronstring and which causes him to swallow openmouthed all the nonsense that is uttered to the world in the columns of newspapers or in the pages of your yearling travellers who go on excursions before they are half instructed in the social usages and the distinctive features of their own country i hope i shall be just as far removed from such a weakness in any passing remark that may flow from my pen as from the crime of confounding principles and denying facts in a way to do discredit to the land of my birth and that of my ancestors i have lived long enough in the world not meaning thereby the southeast corner of the northwest township of connecticut to understand that we are a vast way behind older nations in thought as well as deed in many things while on the opposite hand they are a vast way behind us in others i see no patriotism in concealing a wholesome truth and least of all shall i be influenced by the puerility of a desire to hide anything of this nature because i cannot communicate it to my countrymen without communicating it to the rest of the world if england or france had acted on this narrow principle where would have been their shakespeares their sheridans their beaumonts and fletchers and their molieres no no great national truths are not to be treated as the gossiping surmises of village crones he who reads what i write therefore must expect to find what i think of matters and things and not exactly what he may happen to think on the same subject any one is at liberty to compare opinions with me but i ask the privilege of possessing some small liberty of conscience in what is far and near proclaimed to be the only free country on the earth by far and near i mean from the st croix to the rio grande and from cape cod to the entrance of st juan de fuca and a pretty farm it makes the interval that lies between these limits one may call it far and near without the imputation of obscurity or that of vanity  our tour was completed in spite of all annoyances and here we were again within the walls of magnificent paris the postilions had been told to drive to the hotel in the rue st dominique and we sat down to dinner an hour after our arrival under our own roof my uncles tenant had left the apartment a month before according to agreement and the porter and his wife had engaged a cook set the rooms in order and prepared everything for our arrival  it must be owned hugh said my uncle as he finished his soup that day one may live quite comfortably in paris if he possess the savoir vivre nevertheless i have a strong desire to get a taste of native air one may say and think what he pleases about the paris pleasures and the paris cuisine and all that sort of thing but home is home be it ever so homely a dinde aux truffes is capital eating so is a turkey with cranberry sauce i sometimes think i could fancy even a pumpkin pie though there is not a fragment of the rock of plymouth in the granite of my frame  i have always told you sir that america is a capital eating and drinking country let it want civilization in other matters as much as it may  capital for eating and drinking hugh if you can keep clear of the grease in the first place and find a real cook in the second there is as much difference between the cookery of new england for instance and that of the middle states barring the dutch as there is between that of england and germany the cookery of the middle states and of the southern states too though that savors a little of the west indiesbut the cookery of the middle states is english in its best sense meaning the hearty substantial savory dishes of the english in their true domestic life with their roastbeef underdone their beefsteaks done to a turn their chops full of gravy their muttonbroth legsofmutton et id omne genus we have some capital things of our own too such as canvasbacks reedbirds sheepshead shad and blackfish the difference between new england and the middle states is still quite observable though in my younger days it was patent i suppose the cause has been the more provincial origin and the more provincial habits of our neighbors by george hugh one could fancy clamsoup just now eh  clamsoup sir well made is one of the most delicious soups in the world if the cooks of paris could get hold of the dish it would set them up for a whole season  what is crême de bavière and all such nicknacks boy to a good plateful of clamsoup well made as you saymade as a cook of jenningss used to make it thirty years since did i ever mention that fellows soup to you before hugh  often sir i have tasted very excellent clamsoup however that he never saw of course you mean soup just flavored by the little hardclamnone of your vulgar potage à la softclam  softclams be hanged they are not made for gentlemen to eat of course i mean the hardclam and the small clam      heres your fine clams     as white as snow     on rockaway     these clams do grow  the cries of new york are quite going out like everything else at home that is twenty years old shall i send you some of this eternal poulet à la marengo i wish it were honest american boiled fowl with a delicate bit of shoatpork alongside of it i feel amazingly homeish this evening hugh  it is quite natural my dear uncle ro and i own to the soft impeachment myself here have we both been absent from our native land five years and half that time almost without hearing from it we know that jacobthis was a free negro who served my uncle a relic of the old domestic system of the colonies whose name would have been jaaf or yop thirty years beforehas gone to our bankers for letters and papers and that naturally draws our thoughts to the other side of the atlantic i dare say we shall both feel relieved at breakfast tomorrow when we shall have read our respective dispatches  come let us take a glass of wine together in the good old york fashion hugh your father and i when boys never thought of wetting our lips with the halfglass of madeira that fell to our share without saying good health mall good health hodge  with all my heart uncle ro the custom was getting to be a little obsolete even before i left home but it is almost an american custom by sticking to us longer than to most people  henri  this was my uncles maître d hotel whom he had kept at boardwages the whole time of our absence in order to make sure of his ease quiet taste skill and honesty on his return  monsieur  i dare saymy uncle spoke french exceedingly well for a foreigner but it is better to translate what he said as we goi dare say this glass of vin de bourgogne is very good it looks good and it came from a winemerchant on whom i can rely but monsieur hugh and i are going to drink together à laméricaine and i dare say you will let us have a glass of madeira though it is somewhat late in the dinner to take it  très volontiers messieursit is my happiness to oblige you  uncle ro and i took the madeira together but i cannot say much in favor of its quality  what a capital thing is a good newtown pippin exclaimed my uncle after eating a while in silence they talk a great deal about their poire beurrée here at paris but to my fancy it will not compare with the newtowners we grow at satanstoe where by the way the fruit is rather better i think than that one finds across the river at newtown itself  they are capital apples sir and your orchard at satanstoe is one of the best i know or rather what is left of it for i believe a portion of your trees are in what is now a suburb of dibbletonborough  yes blast that place i wish i had never parted with a foot of the old neck though i did rather make money by the sale but money is no compensation for the affections  rather make money my dear sir pray may i ask what satanstoe was valued at when you got it from my grandfather  pretty well up hugh for it was and indeed is a firstrate farm including sedges and saltmeadows you will remember that there are quite five hundred acres of it altogether  which you inherited in 1829  of course that was the year of my fathers death why the place was thought to be worth about thirty thousand dollars at that time but land was rather low in westchester in 1829  and you sold two hundred acres including the point the harbor and a good deal of the sedges for the moderate modicum of one hundred and ten thousand cash a tolerable sale sir  no not cash i got only eighty thousand down while thirty thousand were secured by mortgage  which mortgage you hold yet i dare say if the truth were told covering the whole city of dibbletonborough a city ought to be good security for thirty thousand dollars  it is not nevertheless in this case the speculators who bought of me in 1835 laid out their town built a hotel a wharf and a warehouse and then had an auction they sold four hundred lots each twentyfive feet by a hundred regulation size you see at an average of two hundred and fifty dollars receiving onehalf or fifty thousand dollars down and leaving the balance on mortgage soon after this the bubble burst and the best lot at dibbletonborough would not bring under the hammer twenty dollars the hotel and the warehouse stand alone in their glory and will thus stand until they fall which will not be a thousand years hence i rather think  and what is the condition of the townplot  bad enough the landmarks are disappearing and it would cost any man who should attempt it the value of his lot to hire a surveyor to find his twentyfive by a hundred  but your mortgage is good  ay good in one sense but it would puzzle a philadelphia lawyer to foreclose it why the equitable interests in that townplot people the place of themselves i ordered my agent to commence buying up the rights as the shortest process of getting rid of them and he told me in the very last letter i received that he had succeeded in purchasing the titles to three hundred and seventeen of the lots at an average price of ten dollars the remainder i suppose will have to be absorbed  absorbed that is a process i never heard of as applied to land  there is a good deal of it done notwithstanding in america it is merely including within your own possession adjacent land for which no claimant appears what can i do no owners are to be found and then my mortgage is always a title a possession of twenty years under a mortgage is as good as a deed in feesimple with full covenants of warranty barring minors and femes covert  you did better by lilacsbush  ah that was a clean transaction and has left no drawbacks lilacsbush being on the island of manhattan one is sure there will be a town there some day or other it is true the property lies quite eight miles from city hall nevertheless it has a value and can always be sold at something near it then the plan of new york is made and recorded and one can find his lots nor can any man say when the town will not reach kingsbridge  you got a round price for the bush too i have heard sir  i got three hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars in hard cash i would give no credit and have every dollar of the money at this moment in good six per cent stock of the states of new york and ohio  which some persons in this part of the world would fancy to be no very secure investment  more fools they america is a glorious country after all hugh and it is a pride and a satisfaction to belong to it look back at it as i can remember it a nation spit upon by all the rest of christendom  you must at least own my dear sir i put in somewhat pertly perhaps the example might tempt other people for if ever there was a nation that is assiduously spitting on itself it is our own beloved land  true it has that nasty custom in excess and it grows worse instead of better as the influence of the better mannered and better educated diminishes but this is a spot on the suna mere flaw in the diamond that friction will take out but what a countrywhat a glorious country in truth it is you have now done the civilized parts of the old world pretty thoroughly my dear boy and must be persuaded yourself of the superiority of your native land  i remember you have always used this language uncle ro yet have you passed nearly onehalf of your time out of that glorious country since you have reached mans estate  the mere consequence of accidents and tastes i do not mean that america is a country for a bachelor to begin with the means of amusement for those who have no domestic hearths are too limited for the bachelor nor do i mean that society in america in its ordinary meaning is in any way as wellordered as tasteful as wellmannered as agreeable or as instructive and useful as society in almost any european country i know i have never supposed that the man of leisure apart from the affections could ever enjoy himself half as much at home as he may enjoy himself in this part of the world and i am willing to admit that intellectually most gentlemen in a great european capital live as much in one day as they would live in a week in such places as new york and philadelphia and baltimore  you do not include boston i perceive sir  of boston i say nothing they take the mind hard there and we had better let such a state of things alone but as respects a man or woman of leisure a man or woman of taste or man or woman of refinement generally i am willing enough to admit that cæteris paribus each can find far more enjoyment in europe than in america but the philosopher the philanthropist the political economistin a word the patriot may well exult in such elements of profound national superiority as may be found in america  i hope these elements are not so profound but they can be dug up at need uncle ro  there will be little difficulty in doing that my boy look at the equality of the laws to begin with they are made on the principles of natural justice and are intended for the benefit of societyfor the poor as well as the rich  are they also intended for the rich as well as the poor  well i will grant you a slight blemish is beginning to appear in that particular it is a failing incidental to humanity and we must not expect perfection there is certainly a slight disposition to legislate for numbers in order to obtain support at the polls which has made the relation of debtor and creditor a little insecure possibly but prudence can easily get along with that it is erring on the right side is it not to favor the poor instead of the rich if either is to be preferred  justice would favor neither but treat all alike i have always heard that the tyranny of numbers was the worst tyranny in the world  perhaps it is where there is actually tyranny and for a very obvious reason one tyrant is sooner satisfied than a million and has even a greater sense of responsibility i can easily conceive that the czar himself if disposed to be a tyrant which i am far from thinking to be the case with nicholas might hesitate about doing that under his undivided responsibility which one of our majorities would do without even being conscious of the oppression it exercised or caring at all about it but on the whole we do little of the last and not in the least enough to counterbalance the immense advantages of the system  i have heard very discreet men say that the worst symptom of our system is the gradual decay of justice among us the judges have lost most of their influence and the jurors are getting to be lawmakers as well as lawbreakers  there is a good deal of truth in that i will acknowledge also and you hear it asked constantly in a case of any interest not which party is in the right but who is on the jury but i contend for no perfection all i say is that the country is a glorious country and that you and i have every reason to be proud that old hugh roger our predecessor and namesake saw fit to transplant himself into it a century and a half since  i dare say now uncle ro it would strike most europeans as singular that a man should be proud of having been born an americanmanhattanese as you and i both were  all that may be true for there have been calculated attempts to bring us into discredit of late by harping on the failure of certain states to pay the interest on their debts but all that is easily answered and more so by you and me as new yorkers there is not a nation in europe that would pay its interest if those who are taxed to do so had the control of these taxes and the power to say whether they were to be levied or not  i do not see how that mends the matter these countries tell us that such is the effect of your system there while we are too honest to allow such a system to exist in this part of the world  pooh all gammon that they prevent the existence of our system for very different reasons and they coerce the payment of the interest on their debts that they may borrow more this business of repudiation as it is called however has been miserably misrepresented and there is no answering a falsehood by an argument no american state has repudiated its debt that i know of though several have been unable to meet their engagements as they have fallen due  unable uncle ro  yes unablethat is the precise word take pennsylvania for instance that is one of the richest communities in the civilized world its coal and iron alone would make any country affluent and a portion of its agricultural population is one of the most affluent i know of nevertheless pennsylvania owing to a concurrence of events could not pay the interest on her debt for two years and a half though she is doing it now and will doubtless continue to do it the sudden breaking down of that colossal moneyed institution the soidisant bank of the united states after it ceased to be in reality a bank of the government brought about such a state of the circulation as rendered payment by any of the ordinary means known to government impossible i know what i say and repeat impossible it is well known that many persons accustomed to affluence had to carry their plate to the mint in order to obtain money to go to market then something may be attributed to the institutions without disparaging a peoples honesty our institutions are popular just as those of france are the reverse and the people they who were on the spotthe home creditor with his account unpaid and with his friends and relatives in the legislature and present to aid him contended for his own money before any should be sent abroad  was that exactly right sir  certainly not it was exactly wrong but very particularly natural do you suppose the king of france would not take the money for his civil list if circumstances should compel the country to suspend on the debt for a year or two or the ministers their salaries my word for it each and all of them would prefer themselves as creditors and act accordingly every one of these countries has suspended in some form or other and in many instances balanced the account with the sponge their clamor against us is altogether calculated with a view to political effect  still i wish pennsylvania for instance had continued to pay at every hazard  it is well enough to wish hugh but it is wishing for an impossibility then you and i as new yorkers have nothing to do with the debt of pennsylvania no more than london would have to do with the debt of dublin or quebec we have always paid our interest and what is more paid it more honestly if honesty be the point than even england has paid hers when our banks suspended the state paid its interest in as much paper as would buy the specie in open market whereas england made paper legal tender and paid the interest on her debt in it for something like fiveandtwenty years and that too when her paper was at a large discount i knew of one american who held near a million of dollars in the english debt on which he had to take unconvertible paper for the interest for a long series of years no no this is all gammon hugh and is not to be regarded as making us a whit worse than our neighbors the equality of our laws is the fact in which i glory  if the rich stood as fair a chance as the poor uncle ro  there is a screw loose there i must confess but it amounts to no great matter  then the late bankrupt law  ay that was an infernal procedurethat much i will acknowledge too it was special legislation enacted to pay particular debts and the law was repealed as soon as it had done its duty that is a much darker spot in our history than what is called repudiation though perfectly honest men voted for it  did you ever hear of a farce they got up about it at new york just after we sailed  never what was it hugh though american plays are pretty much all farces  this was a little better than common and on the whole really clever it is the old story of faust in which a young spendthrift sells himself soul and body to the devil on a certain evening as he is making merry with a set of wild companions his creditor arrives and insisting on seeing the master is admitted by the servant he comes on clubfooted and behorned as usual and betailed too i believe but tom is not to be scared by trifles he insists on his guest being seated on his taking a glass of wine and then on dicks finishing his song but though the rest of the company had signed no bonds to satan they had certain outstanding bookdebts which made them excessively uncomfortable and the odor of brimstone being rather strong tom arose approached his guest and desired to know the nature of the particular business he had mentioned to his servant this bond sir said satan significantly this bond what of it pray it seems all right is not that your signature i admit it signed in your blood a conceit of your own i told you at the time that ink was just as good in law it is past due seven minutes and fourteen seconds so it is i declare but what of that i demand payment nonsense no one thinks of paying nowadays why even pennsylvania and maryland dont pay i insist on payment oh you do do you tom draws a paper from his pocket and adds magnificently there then if youre so urgentthere is a discharge under the new bankrupt law signed smith thompson this knocked the devil into a cockedhat at once  my uncle laughed heartily at my story but instead of taking the matter as i had fancied he might it made him think better of the country than ever  well hugh we have wit among us it must be confessed he cried with the tears running down his cheeks if we have some rascally laws and some rascals to administer them but here comes jacob with his letters and papersi declare the fellow has a large basketful  jacob a highly respectable black and the greatgrandson of an old negro named jaaf or yop who was then living on my own estate at ravensnest had just then entered with the porter and himself lugging in the basket in question there were several hundred newspapers and quite a hundred letters the sight brought home and america clearly and vividly before us and having nearly finished the dessert we rose to look at the packages it was no small task to sort our mail there being so many letters and packages to be divided  here are some newspapers i never saw before said my uncle as he tumbled over the pile the guardian of the soilthat must have something to do with oregon  i dare say it has sir here are at least a dozen letters from my sister  ay your sister is single and can still think of her brother but mine are married and one letter a year would be a great deal this is my dear old mothers hand however that is something ursula malbone would never forget her child well bon soir hugh each of us has enough to do for one evening  au revoir sir we shall meet at ten tomorrow when we can compare our news and exchange gossip     chapter ii      why droops my lord like overripened corn     hanging the head at ceres plenteous load                                           king henry vi   i did not get into my bed that night until two nor was i out of it until halfpast nine it was near eleven when jacob came to tell me his master was in the salle à manger and ready to eat his breakfast i hastened up stairs sleeping in the entresol and was at table with my uncle in three minutes i observed on entering that he was very grave and i now perceived that a couple of letters and several american newspapers lay near him his goodmorrow hugh was kind and affectionate as usual but i fancied it sad  no bad news from home i hope sir i exclaimed under the first impulse of feeling marthas last letter is of quite recent date and she writes very cheerfully i know that my grandmother was perfectly well six weeks since  i know the same hugh for i have a letter from herself written with her own blessed hand my mother is in excellent health for a woman of fourscore but she naturally wishes to see us and you in particular grandchildren are ever the pets with grandmothers  i am glad to hear all this sir for i was really afraid on entering the room that you had received some unpleasant news  and is all your news pleasant after so long a silence  nothing that is disagreeable i do assure you patt writes in charming spirits and i dare say is in blooming beauty by this time though she tells me that she is generally thought rather plain that is impossible for you know when we left her at fifteen she had every promise of great beauty  as you say it is impossible that martha littlepage should be anything but handsome for fifteen is an age when in america one may safely predict the womans appearance your sister is preparing for you an agreeable surprise i have heard old persons say that she was very like my mother at the same time of life and dus malbone was a sort of toast once in the forest  i dare say it is all as you think more especially as there are several allusions to a certain harry beekman in her letters at which i should feel flattered were i in mr harrys place do you happen to know anything of such a family as the beekmans sir  my uncle looked up in a little surprise at this question a thorough new yorker by birth associations alliances and feelings he held all the old names of the colony and state in profound respect and i had often heard him sneer at the manner in which the newcomers of my day who had appeared among us to blossom like the rose scattered their odors through the land it was but a natural thing that a community which had grown in population in half a century from half a million to two millions and a half and that as much by immigration from adjoining communities as by natural increase should undergo some change of feeling in this respect but on the other hand it was just as natural that the true new yorker should not  of course you know hugh that it is an ancient and respected name among us answered my uncle after he had given me the look of surprise i have already mentioned there is a branch of the beekmans or bakemans as we used to call them settled near satanstoe and i dare say that your sister in her frequent visits to my mother has met with them the association would be but natural and the other feeling to which you allude is i dare say but natural to the association though i cannot say i ever experienced it  you will still adhere to your asseverations of never having been the victim of cupid i find sir  hugh hugh let us trifle no more there is news from home that has almost broken my heart  i sat gazing at my uncle in wonder and alarm while he placed both his hands on his face as if to exclude this wicked world and all it contained from his sight i did not speak for i saw that the old gentleman was really affected but waited his pleasure to communicate more my impatience was soon relieved however as the hands were removed and i once more caught a view of my uncles handsome but clouded countenance  may i ask the nature of this news i then ventured to inquire  you may and i shall now tell you it is proper indeed that you should hear all and understand it all for you have a direct interest in the matter and a large portion of your property is dependent on the result had not the manor troubles as they were called been spoken of before we left home  certainly though not to any great extent we saw something of it in the papers i remember just before we went to russia and i recollect you mentioned it as a discreditable affair to the state though likely to lead to no very important result  so i then thought but that hope has been delusive there were some reasons why a population like ours should chafe under the situation of the estate of the late patroon that i thought natural though unjustifiable for it is unhappily too much a law of humanity to do that which is wrong more especially in matters connected with the pocket  i do not exactly understand your allusions sir  it is easily explained the van rensselaer property is in the first place of great extentthe manor as it is still called and once was spreading east and west eightandforty miles and north and south twentyfour with a few immaterial exceptions including the sites of three or four towns three of which are cities containing respectively six twenty and forty thousand souls this large surface was the property of a single individual since his death it has become the property of two subject to the conditions of the leases of which by far the greater portion are what are called durable  i have heard all this of course sir and know something of it myself but what is a durable lease for i believe we have none of that nature at ravensnest  no your leases are all for three lives and most of them renewals at that there are two sorts of durable leases as we term them in use among the landlords of new york both give the tenant a permanent interest being leases forever reserving annual rent with the right to distrain and covenants of reentry but one class of these leases gives the tenant a right at any time to demand a deed in feesimple on the payment of a stipulated sum while the other gives him no such privilege thus one class of these leases is called a durable lease with a clause of redemption while the other is a simple durable lease  and are there any new difficulties in relation to the manor rents  far worse than that the contagion has spread until the greatest ills that have been predicted from democratic institutions by their worst enemies seriously menace the country i am afraid hugh i shall not be able to call new york any longer an exception to the evil example of a neighborhood or the country itself a glorious country  this is so serious sir that were it not that your looks denote the contrary i might be disposed to doubt your words  i fear my words are only too true dunning has written me a long account of his own made out with the precision of a lawyer and in addition he has sent me divers papers some of which openly contend for what is substantially a new division of property and what in effect would be agrarian laws  surely my dear uncle you cannot seriously apprehend anything of that nature from our orderloving lawloving propertyloving americans  your last description may contain the secret of the whole movement the love of property may be so strong as to induce them to do a great many things they ought not to do i certainly do not apprehend that any direct attempt is about to be made in new york to divide its property nor do i fear any open declared agrarian statute for what i apprehend is to come through indirect and gradual innovations on the right that will be made to assume the delusive aspect of justice and equal rights and thus undermine the principles of the people before they are aware of the dangers themselves in order that you may not only understand me but may understand facts that are of the last importance to your own pockets i will first tell you what has been done and then tell you what i fear is to follow the first difficultyor rather the first difficulty of recent occurrencearose at the death of the late patroon i say of recent occurrence since dunning writes me that during the administration of john jay an attempt to resist the payment of rent was made on the manor of the livingstons but he put it down instanter  yes i should rather think that roguery would not be apt to prosper while the execution of the laws was intrusted to such a man the age of such politicians however seems to have ended among us  it did not prosper governor jay met the pretension as we all know such a man would meet it and the matter died away and has been nearly forgotten it is worthy of remark that he put the evil down but this is not the age of john jays to proceed to my narrative when the late patroon died there was due to him a sum of something like two hundred thousand dollars of backrents and of which he had made a special disposition in his will vesting the money in trustees for a certain purpose it was the attempt to collect this money which first gave rise to dissatisfaction those who had been debtors so long were reluctant to pay in casting round for the means to escape from the payment of their just debts these men feeling the power that numbers ever give over right in america combined to resist with others who again had in view a project to get rid of the rents altogether out of this combination grew what have been called the manor troubles men appeared in a sort of mockindian dress calico shirts thrown over their other clothes and with a species of calico masks on their faces who resisted the bailiffs processes and completely prevented the collection of rents these men were armed mostly with rifles and it was finally found necessary to call out a strong body of the militia in order to protect the civil officers in the execution of their duties  all this occurred before we went to the east i had supposed those antirenters as they were called had been effectually put down  in appearance they were but the very governor who called the militia into the field referred the subject of the griefs of the tenants to the legislature as if they were actually aggrieved citizens when in truth it was the landlords or the rensselaersfor at that time the troubles were confined to their propertywho were the aggrieved parties this false step has done an incalculable amount of mischief if it do not prove the entering wedge to rive asunder the institutions of the state  it is extraordinary when such things occur that any man can mistake his duty why were the tenants thus spoken of while nothing was said beyond what the law compelled in favor of the landlords  i can see no reason but the fact that the rensselaers were only two and that the disaffected tenants were probably two thousand with all the cry of aristocracy and feudality and nobility neither of the rensselaers by the letter of the law has one particle more of political power or political right than his own coachman or footman if the last be a white man while in practice he is in many things getting to be less protected  then you think sir that this matter has gained force from the circumstance that so many votes depend on it  out of all question its success depends on the violations of principles that we have been so long taught to hold sacred that nothing short of the overruling and corrupting influence of politics would dare to assail them if there were a landlord to each farm as well as a tenant universal indifference would prevail as to the griefs of the tenants and if two to one tenant universal indignation at their impudence  of what particular griefs do the tenants complain  you mean the rensselaer tenants i suppose why they complain of such covenants as they can though their deepest affliction is to be found in the fact that they do not own other mens lands the patroon had quartersales on many of his farmsthose that were let in the last century  well what of that a bargain to allow of quartersales is just as fair as any other bargain  it is fairer in fact than most bargains when you come to analyze it since there is a very good reason why it should accompany a perpetual lease is it to be supposed that a landlord has no interest in the character and habits of his tenants he has the closest interest in it possible and no prudent man should let his lands without holding some sort of control over the assignment of leases now there are but two modes of doing this either by holding over the tenant a power through his interests or a direct veto dependent solely on the landlords will  the last would be apt to raise a pretty cry of tyranny and feudality in america  pretty cries on such subjects are very easily raised in america more people join in them than understand what they mean nevertheless it is quite as just when two men bargain that he who owns every right in the land before the bargain is made should retain this right over his property which he consents to part with only with limitations as that he should grant it to another these men in their clamor forget that until their leases were obtained they had no right in their lands at all and that what they have got is through those very leases of which they complain take away the leases and they would have no rights remaining now on what principle can honest men pretend that they have rights beyond the leases on the supposition even that the bargains are hard what have governors and legislators to do with thrusting themselves in between parties so situated as special umpires i should object to such umpires moreover on the general and controlling principle that must govern all righteous arbitrationyour governors and legislators are not impartial they are political or party men one may say without exception and such umpires when votes are in the question are to be sorely distrusted i would as soon trust my interests to the decision of feed counsel as trust them to such judges  i wonder the really impartial and upright portion of the community do not rise in their might and put this thing downrip it up root and branch and cast it away at once  that is the weak point of our system which has a hundred strong points while it has this besetting vice our laws are not only made but they are administered on the supposition that there are both honesty and intelligence enough in the body of the community to see them well made and well administered but the sad reality shows that good men are commonly passive until abuses become intolerable it being the designing rogue and manager who is usually the most active vigilant philanthropists do exist i will allow but it is in such small numbers as to effect little on the whole and nothing at all when opposed by the zeal of a mercenary opposition no nolittle is ever to be expected in a political sense from the activity of virtue while a great deal may be looked for from the activity of vice  you do not take a very favorable view of humanity sir  i speak of the world as i have found it in both hemispheres or as your neighbor the magistrate squire newcome has it the four hemispheres our representation is at the best but an average of the qualities of the whole community somewhat lessened by the fact that men of real merit have taken a disgust at a state of things that is not very tempting to their habits or tastes as for a quartersale i can see no more hardship in it than there is in paying the rent itself and by giving the landlord this check on the transfer of his lands he compels a compromise that maintains what is just the tenant is not obliged to sell and he makes his conditions accordingly when he has a good tenant to offer in his stead when he offers a bad tenant he ought to pay for it  many persons with us would think it very aristocratic i cried laughingly that a landlord should have it in his power to say i will not accept this or that substitute for yourself  it is just as aristocratic and no more so than it would be to put it in the power of the tenant to say to the landlord you shall accept this or that tenant at my hands the covenant of the quartersale gives each party a control in the matter and the result has ever been a compromise that is perfectly fair as it is hardly possible that the circumstance should have been overlooked in making the bargain and he who knows anything of such matters knows that every exaction of this sort is always considered in the rent as for feudality so long as the power to alienate exists at all in the tenant he does not hold by a feudal tenure he has bought himself from all such tenures by his covenant of quartersale and it only remains to say whether having agreed to such a bargain in order to obtain this advantage he should pay the stipulated price or not  i understand you sir it is easy to come at the equity of this matter if one will only go back to the original facts which color it the tenant had no rights at all until he got his lease and can have no rights which that lease does not confer  then the cry is raised of feudal privileges because some of the rensselaer tenants are obliged to find so many days work with their teams or substitutes to the landlord and even because they have to pay annually a pair of fat fowls we have seen enough of america hugh to know that most husbandmen would be delighted to have the privilege of paying their debt in chickens and work instead of in money which renders the cry only so much the more wicked but what is there more feudal in a tenants thus paying his landlord than in a butchers contracting to furnish so much meat for a series of years or a mail contractors agreeing to carry the mail in a fourhorse coach for a term of years eh no one objects to the rent in wheat and why should they object to the rent in chickens is it because our republican farmers have got to be so aristocratic themselves that they do not like to be thought poulterers this is being aristocratic on the other side these dignitaries should remember that if it be plebeian to furnish fowls it is plebeian to receive them and if the tenant has to find an individual who has to submit to the degradation of tendering a pair of fat fowls the landlord has to find an individual who has to submit to the degradation of taking them and of putting them away in the larder it seems to me that one is an offset to the other  but if i remember rightly uncle ro these little matters were always commuted for in money  they always must lie at the option of the tenant unless the covenants went to forfeiture which i never heard that they did for the failure to pay in kind at the time stipulated would only involve a payment in money afterward the most surprising part of this whole transaction is that men among us hold the doctrine that these leasehold estates are opposed to our institutions when being guaranteed by the institutions they in truth form a part of them were it not for these very institutions to which they are said to be opposed and of which they virtually form a part we should soon have a pretty kettle of fish between landlord and tenant  how do you make it out that they form a part of the institutions sir  simply because the institutions have a solemn profession of protecting property there is such a parade of this that all our constitutions declare that property shall never be taken without due form of law and to read one of them you would think the property of the citizen is held quite as sacred as his person now some of these very tenures existed when the state institutions were framed and not satisfied with this we of new york in common with our sister states solemnly prohibited ourselves in the constitution of the united states from ever meddling with them nevertheless men are found hardy enough to assert that a thing which in fact belongs to the institutions is opposed to them  perhaps they mean sir to their spirit or to their tendency  ah there may be some sense in that though much less than the declaimers fancy the spirit of institutions is their legitimate object and it would be hard to prove that a leasehold tenure with any conditions of mere pecuniary indebtedness whatever is opposed to any institutions that recognize the full rights of property the obligation to pay rent no more creates political dependency than to give credit from an ordinary shop not so much indeed more especially under such leases as those of the rensselaers for the debtor on a bookdebt can be sued at any moment whereas the tenant knows precisely when he has to pay there is the great absurdity of those who decry the system as feudal and aristocratic for they do not see that those very leases are more favorable to the tenant than any other  i shall have to ask you to explain this to me sir being too ignorant to comprehend it  why these leases are perpetual and the tenant cannot be dispossessed the longer a lease is other things being equal the better it is for the tenant all the world over let us suppose two farms the one leased for five years and the other forever which tenant is most independent of the political influence of his landlord to say nothing of the impossibility of controlling votes in this way in america from a variety of causes certainly he who has a lease forever he is just as independent of his landlord as his landlord can be of him with the exception that he has rent to pay in the latter case he is precisely like any other debtorlike the poor man who contracts debts with the same storekeeper for a series of years as for the possession of the farm which we are to suppose is a desirable thing for the tenant he of the long lease is clearly most independent since the other may be ejected at the end of each five years nor is there the least difference as to acquiring the property in fee since the landlord may sell equally in either case if so disposed and if not disposed no honest man under any system ought to do anything to compel him so to do directly or indirectly and no truly honest man would  i put some of the words of my uncle ro in small capitals as the spirit of the times not of the institutions renders such hints necessary but to continue our dialogue  i understand you now sir though the distinction you make between the spirit of the institutions and their tendencies is what i do not exactly comprehend  it is very easily explained the spirit of the institutions is their intention their tendencies are the natural direction they take under the impulses of human motives which are always corrupt and corrupting the spirit refers to what things ought to be the tendencies to what they are or are becoming the spirit of all political institutions is to place a check on the natural propensities of men to restrain them and keep them within due bounds while the tendencies follow those propensities and are quite often in direct opposition to the spirit that this outcry against leasehold tenures in america is following the tendencies of our institutions i am afraid is only too true but that it is in any manner in compliance with their spirit i utterly deny  you will allow that institutions have their spirit which ought always to be respected in order to preserve harmony  out of all question the first great requisite of a political system is the means of protecting itself the second to check its tendencies at the point required by justice wisdom and good faith in a despotism for instance the spirit of the system is to maintain that one man who is elevated above the necessities and temptations of a nationwho is solemnly set apart for the sole purpose of government fortified by dignity and rendered impartial by positionwill rule in the manner most conducive to the true interests of his subjects it is just as much the theory of russia and prussia that their monarchs reign not for their own good but for the good of those over whom they are placed as it is the theory in regard to the president of the united states we all know that the tendencies of a despotism are to abuses of a particular character and it is just as certain that the tendencies of a republic or rather of a democratic republicfor republic of itself means but little many republics having had kingsbut it is just as certain that the tendencies of a democracy are to abuses of another character whatever man touches he infallibly abuses and this more in connection with the exercise of political power perhaps than in the management of any one interest of life though he abuses all even to religion less depends on the nominal character of institutions perhaps than on their ability to arrest their own tendencies at the point required by everything that is just and right hitherto surprisingly few grave abuses have followed from our institutions but this matter looks frightfully serious for i have not told you half hugh  indeed sir i beg you will believe me quite equal to hearing the worst  it is true antirentism did commence on the estate of the rensselaers and with complaints of feudal tenures and of days works and fat fowls backed by the extravagantly aristocratic pretension that a manor tenant was so much a privileged being that it was beneath his dignity as a free man to do that which is daily done by mailcontractors stagecoach owners victuallers and even by themselves in their passing bargains to deliver potatoes onions turkeys and pork although they had solemnly covenanted with their landlords to pay the fat fowls and to give the days works the feudal system has been found to extend much further and troubles as they are called have broken out in other parts of the state resistance to process and a cessation of the payment of rents have occurred on the livingston property in hardenbergin short in eight or ten counties of the state even among the bona fide purchasers on the holland purchase this resistance has been organized and a species of troops raised who appear disguised and armed wherever a levy is to be made several men have already been murdered and there is the strong probability of a civil war  in the name of what is sacred and right what has the government of the state been doing all this time  in my poor judgment a great deal that it ought not to have done and very little that it ought you know the state of politics at home hugh how important new york is in all national questions and how nearly tied is her voteless than ten thousand majority in a canvass of near a half million of votes when this is the case the leastprincipled part of the voters attain an undue importancea truth that has been abundantly illustrated in this question the natural course would have been to raise an armed constabulary force and to have kept it in motion as the antirenters have kept their injins in motion which would have soon tired out the rebels for rebels they are who would thus have had to support one army in part and the other altogether such a movement on the part of the state well and energetically managed would have drawn half the injins at once from the ranks of disaffection to those of authority for all that most of these men want is to live easy and to have a parade of military movements instead of that the legislature substantially did nothing until blood was spilt and the grievance had got to be not only profoundly disgraceful for such a state and such a country but utterly intolerable to the wellaffected of the revolted counties as well as to those who were kept out of the enjoyment of their property then indeed it passed the law which ought to have been passed the first year of the injin systema law which renders it felony to appear armed and disguised but dunning writes me this law is openly disregarded in delaware and schoharie in particular and that bodies of injins in full costume and armed of a thousand men have appeared to prevent levies or sales where it will end heaven knows  do you apprehend any serious civil war  it is impossible to say where false principles may lead when they are permitted to make head and to become widely disseminated in a country like ours still the disturbances as such are utterly contemptible and could and would be put down by an energetic executive in ten days after he had time to collect a force to do it with in some particulars the present incumbent has behaved perfectly well while in others in my judgment he has inflicted injuries on the right that it will require years to repair if indeed they are ever repaired  you surprise me sir and this the more especially as i know you are generally of the same way of thinking on political subjects with the party that is now in power  did you ever know me to support what i conceived to be wrong hugh on account of my political affinities asked my uncle a little reproachfully as to manner but let me tell you the harm that i conceive has been done by all the governors who have had anything to do with the subject and that includes one of a party to which i am opposed and two that are not in the first place they have all treated the matter as if the tenants had really some cause of complaint when in truth all their griefs arise from the fact that other men will not let them have their property just as they may want it and in some respects on their own terms  that is certainly a grief not to be maintained by reason in a civilized country and in a christian community  umph christianity like liberty suffers fearfully in human hands one is sometimes at a loss to recognize either i have seen ministers of the gospel just as dogged just as regardless of general morality and just as indifferto the right in upholding their parties as i ever saw laymen and i have seen laymen manifesting tempers in this respect that properly belong to devils but our governors have certainly treated this matter as if the tenants actually had griefs when in truth their sole oppression is in being obliged to to pay rents that are merely nominal and in not being able to buy other mens property contrary to their wishes and very much at their own prices one governor has even been so generous as to volunteer a mode of settling disputes with which by the way he has no concern there being courts to discharge that office that is singularly presuming on his part to say the least and which looks a confounded sight more like aristocracy or monarchy than anything connected with leasehold tenure  why what can the man have done  he has kindly taken on himself the office of doing that for which i fancy he can find no authority in the institutions or in their spiritno less than advising citizens how they may conveniently manage their own affairs so as to get over difficulties that he himself substantially admits while giving this very advice are difficulties that the law sanctions  this is a very extraordinary interference in a public functionary because one of the parties to a contract that is solemnly guaranteed by the law chooses to complain of its nature rather than of its conditions to pretend to throw the weight of his even assumed authority into the scales on either side of the question  and that is a popular government hugh in which it tells so strongly against a man to render him unpopular that not one man in a million has the moral courage to resist public opinion even when he is right you have hit the nail on the head boy it is in the last degree presuming and what would be denounced as tyrannical in any monarch in europe but he has lived in vain who has not learned that they who make the the loudest professions of a love of liberty have little knowledge of the quality beyond submission to the demands of numbers our executive has carried his fatherly care even beyond this he has actually suggested the terms of a bargain by which he thinks the difficulty can be settled which in addition to the gross assumption of having a voice in a matter that in no manner belongs to him has the palpable demerit of recommending a pecuniary compromise that is flagrantly wrong as a mere pecuniary compromise  you astonish me sir what is the precise nature of his recommendation  that the rensselaers should receive such a sum from each tenant as would produce an interest equal to the value of the present rent now in the first place here is a citizen who has got as much property as he wants and who wishes to live for other purposes than to accumulate this property is not only invested to his entire satisfaction as regards convenience security and returns but also in a way that is connected with some of the best sentiments of his nature it is property that has descended to him through ancestors for two centuries property that is historically connected with his nameon which he was born on which he has lived and on which he has hoped to die property in a word that is associated with all the higher feelings of humanity because some interloper perhaps who has purchased an interest in one of his farms six months before feels an aristocratic desire not to have a landlord and wishes to own a farm in fee that in fact he has no other right to than he gets through his lease the governor of the great state of new york throws the weight of his official position against the old hereditary owner of the soil by solemnly suggesting in an official document that is intended to produce an effect on public opinion that he should sell that which he does not wish to sell but wishes to keep and that at a price which i conceive is much below its true pecuniary value we have liberty with a vengeance if these are some of its antics  what makes the matter worse is the fact that each of the rensselaers has a house on his estate so placed as to be convenient to look after his interest which interests he is to be at the trouble of changing leaving him his house on his hands because forsooth one of the parties to a plain and equitable bargain wishes to make better conditions than he covenanted for i wonder what his excellency proposes that the landlords shall do with their money when they get it buy new estates and build new houses of which to be dispossessed when a new set of tenants may choose to cry out against aristocracy and demonstrate their own love for democracy by wishing to pull others down in order to shove themselves into their places  you are right again hugh but it is a besetting vice of america to regard life as all means and as having no end in a worldly point of view i dare say men may be found among us who regard it as highly presuming in any man to build himself an ample residence and to announce by his mode of living that he is content with his present means and does not wish to increase them at the very moment they view the suggestions of the governor as the pink of modesty and excessively favorable to equal rights i like that thought of yours about the house too in order to suit the spirit of the new york institutions it would seem that a new york landlord should build on wheels that he may move his abode to a new state when it suits the pleasure of his tenants to buy him out  do you suppose the rensselaers would take their money the principal of the rent at seven per cent and buy land with it after their experience of the uncertainty of such possessions among us  not they said my uncle ro laughing no no they would sell the manorhouse and the beverwyck for taverns and then any one might live in them who would pay the principal sum of the cost of a dinner bag their dollars and proceed forthwith to wall street and commence the shaving of notesthat occupation having been decided as i see by the late arrivals to be highly honorable and praiseworthy hitherto they have been nothing but drones but by the time they can go to the quick with their dollars they will become useful members of society and be honored and esteemed accordingly  what next might have been said i do not know for just then we were interrupted by a visit from our common banker and the discourse was necessarily changed     chapter iii      oh when shall i visit the land of my birth     the loveliest land on the face of the earth     when shall i those scenes of affection explore           our forests our fountains           our hamlets our mountains     with the pride of our mountains the maid i adore                                             montgomery   it was truly news for an american who had been so long cut off from intelligence from home thus suddenly to be told that some of the scenes of the middle agesscenes connected with real wrongs and gross abuses of human rightswere about to be enacted in his own land that country which boasted itself not only to be the asylum of the oppressed but the conservator of the right i was grieved at what i had heard for during my travels i had cherished a muchloved image of justice and political excellence that i now began to fear must be abandoned my uncle and myself decided at once to return home a step that indeed was required by prudence i was now of an age to enter into the full possession of my own property so far as new laws and new lords would permit and the letters received by my late guardian as well as certain newspapers communicated the unpleasant fact that a great many of the tenants of ravensnest had joined the association paid tribute for the support of injins and were getting to be as bad as any of the rest of them so far as designs and schemes to plunder were concerned though they still paid their rents the latter circumstance was ascribed by our agent to the fact that many leases were about to fall in and it would be in my power to substitute more honest and betterdisposed successors for the present occupants of the several farms measures were taken accordingly for quitting paris as soon as possible so that we might reach home late in the month of may  if we had time i would certainly throw in a memorial or two to the legislature observed my uncle a day or two before we proceeded to havre to join the packet i have a strong desire to protest against the invasion of my rights as a freeman that is connected with some of their contemplated laws i do not at all like the idea of being abridged of the power of hiring a farm for the longest time i can obtain it which is one of the projects of some of the ultra reformers of free and equal new york it is wonderful hugh into what follies men precipitate themselves as soon as they begin to run into exaggerations whether of politics religion or tastes here are half of the exquisite philanthropists who see a great evil affecting the rights of human nature in one mans hiring a farm from another for as long a term as he can obtain it who are at the very extreme in their opinion on free trade so freetrade are some of the journals which think it a capital thing to prevent landlords and tenants from making their own bargains that they have actually derided the idea of having established fares for hackneycoaches but that it would be better to let the parties stand in the rain and higgle about the price on the freetrade principle some of these men are either active agents in stimulating the legislature to rob the citizen of this very simple control of his property or passive lookerson while others do it  votes sir votes  it is indeed votes sir votes nothing short of votes could reconcile these men to their own inconsistencies as for yourself hugh it might be well to get rid of that canopied pew  of what canopied pew i am sure i do not understand you  do you forget that the familypew in st andrews church at ravensnest has a wooden canopy over ita relic of our colonial opinions and usages  now you mention it i do remember a very clumsy and to own the truth a very ugly thing that i have always supposed was placed there by those who built the church by way of ornament  that ugly thing by way of ornament was intended for a sort of canopy and was by no means an uncommon distinction in the state and colony as recently as the close of the last century the church was built at the expense of my grandfather general littlepage and his bosom friend and kinsman colonel dirck follock both good whigs and gallant defenders of the liberty of their country they thought it proper that the littlepages should have a canopied pew and that is the state in which they caused the building to be presented to my father the old work still stands and dunning writes me that among the other arguments used against your interests is the fact that your pew is thus distinguished from those of the rest of the congregation  it is a distinction no man would envy me could it be known that i have ever thought the clumsy illshaped thing a nuisance and detestable as an ornament i have never even associated it in my mind with personal distinction but have always supposed it was erected with a view to embellish the building and placed over our pew as the spot where such an excrescence would excite the least envy  in all that with one exception you have judged quite naturally forty years ago such a thing might have been done and the majority of the parishioners would have seen in it nothing out of place but that day has gone by and you will discover that on your own estate and in the very things created by your family and yourself you will actually have fewer rights of any sort beyond those your money will purchase than any man around you the simple fact that st andrews church was built by your greatgrandfather and by him presented to the congregation will diminish your claim to have a voice in its affairs with many of the congregation  this is so extraordinary that i must ask the reason  the reason is connected with a principle so obviously belonging to human nature generally and to american nature in particular that i wonder you ask it it is envy did that pew belong to the newcomes for instance no one would think anything of it  nevertheless the newcomes would make themselves ridiculous by sitting in a pew that was distinguished from those of their neighbors the absurdity of the contrast would strike every one  and it is precisely because the absurdity does not exist in your case that your seat is envied no one envies absurdity however you will readily admit hugh that a church and a churchyard are the two last places in which human distinction ought to be exhibited all are equal in the eyes of him we go to the one to worship and all are equal in the grave i have ever been averse to everything like worldly distinction in a congregation and admire the usage of the romish church in even dispensing with pews altogether monuments speak to the world and have a general connection with history so that they be tolerated to a certain point though notorious liars  i agree with you sir as to the unfitness of a church for all distinction and shall be happy on every account to get rid of my canopy though that has an historical connection also i am quite innocent of any feeling of pride while sitting under it though i will confess to some of shame at its quizzical shape when i see it has attracted the eyes of intelligent strangers  it is but natural that you should feel thus for while we may miss distinctions and luxuries to which we have ever been accustomed they rarely excite pride in the possessor even while they awaken envy in the lookeron  nevertheless i cannot see what the old pew has to do with the rents or my legal rights  when a cause is bad everything is pressed into it that it is believed may serve a turn no man who had a good legal claim for property would ever think of urging any other nor would any legislator who had sound and sufficient reasons for his measuresreasons that could properly justify him before god and man for his lawshave recourse to slang to sustain him if these antirenters were right they would have no need of secret combinations or disguises bloodandthunder names and special agents in the legislature of the land the right requires no false aid to make it appear the right but the wrong must get such support as it can press into its service your pew is called aristocratic though it confers no political power it is called a patent of nobility though it neither gives nor takes away and it is hated and you with it for the very reason that you can sit in it and not make yourself ridiculous i suppose you have not examined very closely the papers i gave you to read  enough so to ascertain that they are filled with trash  worse than trash hugh with some of the loosest principles and most atrocious feelings that degrade poor human nature some of the reformers propose that no man shall hold more than a thousand acres of land while others lay down the very intelligible and distinct principle that no man ought to hold more than he can use even petitions to that effect i have been told have been sent to the legislature  which has taken care not to allude to their purport either in debate or otherwise as i see nothing to that effect in the reports  ay i dare say the slangwhangers of those honorable bodies will studiously keep all such enormities out of sight as some of them doubtless hope to step into the shoes of the present landlords as soon as they can get the feet out of them which are now in but these are the projects and the petitions in the columns of the journals and they speak for themselves among other things they say it is nobility to be a landlord  i see by the letter of mr dunning that they have petitioned the legislature to order an inquiry into my title now we hold from the crown  so much the worse hugh faugh hold from a crown in a republican country i am amazed you are not ashamed to own it do you not know boy that it has been gravely contended in a court of justice that in obtaining our national independence from the king of great britain the people conquered all his previous grants which ought to be declared void and of none effect  that is an absurdity of which i had not heard i answered laughing why the people of new york who held all their lands under the crown would in that case have been conquering them for other persons my good grandfather and greatgrandfather both of whom actually fought and bled in the revolution must have been very silly thus to expose themselves to take away their own estates in order to give them to a set of immigrants from new england and other parts of the world  quite justly said hugh added my uncle joining in the laugh nor is this half of the argument the state too in its corporate character has been playing the swindler all this time you may not know the fact but i as your guardian do know that the quitrents reserved by the crown when it granted the lands of mooseridge and ravensnest were claimed by the state and that wanting money to save the people from taxes it commuted with us receiving a certain gross sum in satisfaction of all future claims  ay that i did not know can the fact be shown  certainlyit is well known to all old fellows like myself for it was a very general measure and very generally entered into by all the landholders in our case the receipts are still to be found among the family papers in the cases of the older estates such as those of the van rensselaers the equity is still stronger in their favor since the conditions to hold the land included an obligation to bring so many settlers from europe within a given time conditions that were fulfilled at great cost as you may suppose and on which in truth the colony had its foundation  how much it tells against a peoples honesty to wish to forget such facts in a case like this  there is nothing forgotten for the facts were probably never known to those who prate about the conquered rights from the crown as you say however the civilization of a community is to be measured by its consciousness of the existence of all principles of justice and a familiarity with its own history the great bulk of the population of new york have no active desire to invade what is right in this antirent struggle having no direct interests at stake their crime is a passive inactivity which allows those who are either working for political advancement or those who are working to obtain other mens property to make use of them through their own laws  but is it not an embarrassment to such a region as that directly around albany to have such tenures to the land and for so large a body of people to be compelled to pay rent in the very heart of the state as it might be and in situations that render it desirable to leave enterprise as unshackled as possible  i am not prepared to admit this much even as a general principle one argument used by these antirenters is for instance that the patroons in their leases reserved the millseats now what if they did some one must own the millseats and why not the patroon as well as another to give the argument any weight not as law not as morals but as mere expediency it must be shown that the patroons would not let these millseats at as low rents as any one else and my opinion is that they would let them at rents of not half the amount that would be asked were they the property of so many individuals scattered up and down the country but admitting that so large an estate of this particular sort has some inconveniences in that particular spot can there be two opinions among men of integrity about the mode of getting rid of it every thing has its price and in a business sense everything is entitled to its price no people acknowledge this more than the americans or practise on it so extensively let the rensselaers be tempted by such offers as will induce them to sell but do not let them be invaded by that most infernal of all acts of oppression special legislation in order to bully or frighten them from the enjoyment of what is rightfully their own if the state think such a description of property injurious in its heart let the state imitate england in her conduct toward the slaveholdersbuy them out not tax them out and wrong them out and annoy them out but hugh enough of this at present we shall have much more than we want of it when we get home among my letters i have one from each of my other wards  still harping on my daughter sir i answered laughing i hope that the vivacious miss henrietta coldbrooke and the meek miss anne marston are both perfectly well  both in excellent health and both write charmingly i must really let you see the letter of henrietta as i do think it is quite creditable to her i will step into my room and get it  i ought to let the reader into a secret here that will have some connection with what is to follow a deadset had been made at me previously to leaving home to induce me to marry either of three young ladiesmiss henrietta coldbrooke miss anne marston and miss opportunity newcome the advances in the case of miss henrietta coldbrooke and miss anne marston came from my uncle ro who as their guardian had a natural interest in their making what he was pleased to think might be a good connection for either while the advances on account of miss opportunity newcome came from herself under such circumstances it may be well to say who these young ladies actually were  miss henrietta coldbrooke was the daughter of an englishman of good family and some estate who had emigrated to america and married under the impulse of certain theories in politics which induced him to imagine that this was the promised land i remember him as a disappointed and dissatisfied widower who was thought to be daily growing poorer under the consequences of indiscreet investments and who at last got to be so very english in his wishes and longings as to assert that the common muscovy was a better bird than the canvasback he died however in time to leave his only child an estate which under my uncles excellent management was known by me to be rather more than one hundred and seventynine thousand dollars and which produced a net eight thousand a year this made miss henrietta a belle at once but having a prudent friend in my grandmother as yet she had not married a beggar i knew that uncle ro went quite as far as was proper in his letters in the way of hints touching myself and my dear excellent honesthearted straightforward old grandmother had once let fall an expression in one of her letters to myself which induced me to think that these hints had actually awakened as much interest in the young ladys bosom as could well be connected with what was necessarily nothing but curiosity  miss anne marston was also an heiress but on a very diminished scale she had rather more than three thousand a year in buildings in town and a pretty little sum of about sixteen thousand dollars laid by out of its savings she was not an only child however having two brothers each of whom had already received as much as the sister and each of whom as is very apt to be the case with the heirs of new york merchants was already in a fair way of getting rid of his portion in riotous living nothing does a young american so much good under such circumstances as to induce him to travel it makes or breaks at once if a downright fool he is plucked by european adventurers in so short a time that the agony is soon over if only vain and frivolous because young and illeducated the latter being a new york endemic but with some foundation of native mind he lets his whiskers grow becomes fuzzy about the chin dresses better gets to be much better mannered soon loses his taste for the low and vulgar indulgences of his youth and comes out such a gentleman as one can only make who has entirely thrown away the precious moments of youth if tolerably educated in boyhood with capacity to build on the chances are that the scales will fall from his eyes very fast on landing in the old worldthat his ideas and tastes will take a new turnthat he will become what nature intended him for an intellectual man and that he will finally return home conscious alike of the evils and blessings the advantages and disadvantages of his own system and countrya wiser and it is to be hoped a better man how the experiment had succeeded with the marstons neither myself nor my uncle knew for they had paid their visit while we were in the east and had already returned to america as for miss anne she had a mother to take care of her mind and person though i had learned she was pretty sensible and discreet  miss opportunity newcome was a belle of ravensnest a village on my own property a rural beauty and of rural education virtues manners and habits as ravensnest was not particularly advanced in civilization or to make use of the common language of the country was not a very aristocratic place i shall not dwell on her accomplishments which did well enough for ravensnest but would not essentially ornament my manuscript  opportunity was the daughter of ovid who was the son of jason of the house of newcome in using the term house i adopt it understandingly for the family had dwelt in the same tenement a leasehold property of which the fee was in myself and the dwelling had been associated with the name of newcome from time immemorial that is for about eighty years all that time had a newcome been the tenant of the mill tavern store and farm that lay nearest the village of ravensnest or little nest as it was commonly called and it may not be impertinent to the moral of my narrative if i add that for all that time and for something longer had i and my ancestors been the landlords i beg the reader to bear this last fact in mind as there will soon be occasion to show that there was a strong disposition in certain persons to forget it  as i have said opportunity was the daughter of ovid there was also a brother who was named seneca or seneky as he always pronounced it himself the son of ovid the son of jason the first of the name at ravensnest this seneca was a lawyer in the sense of a license granted by the justices of the supreme court as well as by the court of common pleas in and for the county of washington as there had been a sort of hereditary education among the newcomes for three generations beginning with jason and ending with seneca and as the latter was at the bar i had occasionally been thrown into the society of both brother and sister the latter indeed used to be fond of visiting the nest as my house was familiarly called ravensnest being its true name whence those of the patent and village and as opportunity had early manifested a partiality for my dear old grandmother and not less dear young sister who occasionally passed a few weeks with me during the vacations more especially in the autumns i had many occasions of being brought within the influence of her charmsopportunities that i feel bound to state opportunity did not neglect i have understood that her mother who bore the same name had taught ovid the art of love by a very similar demonstration and had triumphed that lady was still living and may be termed opportunity the great while the daughter can be styled opportunity the less there was very little difference between my own years and those of the young lady and as i had last passed through the fiery ordeal at the sinister age of twenty there was not much danger in encountering the risk anew now i was five years older but i must return to my uncle and the letter of miss henrietta coldbrooke  here it is hugh cried my guardian gayly and a capital letter it is i wish i could read the whole of it to you but the two girls made me promise never to show their letters to any one which could mean only you before they would promise to write anything to me beyond commonplaces now i get their sentiments freely and naturally and the correspondence is a source of much pleasure to me i think however i might venture just to give you one extract  you had better not sir there would be a sort of treachery in it that i confess i would rather not be accessory to if miss coldbrooke does not wish me to read what she writes she can hardly wish that you should read any of it to me  uncle ro glanced at me and i fancied he seemed dissatisfied with my nonchalance he read the letter through to himself however laughing here smiling there then muttering capital good charming girl worthy of hannah more etc etc as if just to provoke my curiosity but i had no desire to read hannah more as any young fellow of fiveandtwenty can very well imagine and i stood it all with the indifference of a stoic my guardian had to knock under and put the letters in his writing desk  well the girls will be glad to see us he said after a moment of reflection and not a little surprised in my very last letter to my mother i sent them word that we should not be home until october and now we shall see them as early as june at least  patt will be delighted i make no doubt as for the other two young ladies they have so many friends and relations to care for that i fancy our movements give them no great concern  then you do both injustice as their letters would prove they take the liveliest interest in our proceedings and speak of my return as if they look for it with the greatest expectation and joy  i made my uncle ro a somewhat saucy answer but fair dealing compels me to record it  i dare say they do sir was my reply but what young lady does not look with expectation and joy for the return of a friend who is known to have a long purse from paris  well hugh you deserve neither of those dear girls and if i can help it you shall have neither  thankee sir  poh this is worse than sillyit is rude i dare say neither would accept you were you to offer tomorrow  i trust not sir for her own sake it would be a singularly palpable demonstration were either to accept a man she barely knew and whom she had not seen since she was fifteen  uncle ro laughed but i could see he was confoundedly vexed and as i loved him with all my heart though i did not love matchmaking i turned the discourse in a pleasant way on our approaching departure  ill tell you what ill do hugh cried my uncle who was a good deal of a boy in some things for the reason i suppose that he was an old bachelor ill just have wrong names entered on board the packet and well surprise all our friends neither jacob nor your man will betray us we know and for that matter we can send them both home by the way of england each of us has trunks in london to be looked after and let the two fellows go by the way of liverpool that is a good thought and occurred most happily  with all my heart sir my fellow is of no more use to me at sea than an automaton would be and i shall be glad to get rid of his rueful countenance he is a capital servant on terra firma but a perfect niobe on the briny main  the thing was agreed on and a day or two afterward both our bodyservants that is to say jacob the black and hubert the german were on their way to england my uncle let his apartment again for he always maintained i should wish to bring my bride to pass a winter in it and we proceeded to havre in a sort of incognito there was little danger of our being known on board the packet and we had previously ascertained that there was not an acquaintance of either in the ship there was a strong family resemblance between my uncle and myself and we passed for father and son in the ship as old mr davidson and young mr davidson of marylandor myrrland as it is doric to call that state we had no concern in this part of the deception unless abstaining from calling my supposed father uncle as one would naturally do in strange society can be so considered  the passage itselfby the way i wish all landsmen would be as accurate as i am here and understand that a voyage means out and home or thence and back again while a passage means from place to placebut our passage was pregnant with no events worth recording we had the usual amount of good and bad weather the usual amount of eating and drinking and the usual amount of ennui the latter circumstance perhaps contributed to the digesting of a further scheme of my uncles which it is now necessary to state  a reperusal of his letters and papers had induced him to think the antirent movement a thing of more gravity even than he had at first supposed the combination on the part of the tenants we learned also from an intelligent new yorker who was a fellowpassenger extended much further than our accounts had given us reason to believe and it was deemed decidedly dangerous for landlords in many cases to be seen on their own estates insult personal degradation or injury and even death it was thought might be the consequences in many cases the blood actually spilled had had the effect to check the more violent demonstrations it is true but the latent determination to achieve their purposes was easily to be traced among the tenants in the face of all their tardy professions of moderation and a desire for nothing but what was right in this case what was right was the letter and spirit of the contracts and nothing was plainer than the fact that these were not what was wanted  professions pass for nothing with the experienced when connected with a practice that flatly contradicts them it was only too apparent to all who chose to look into the matter and that by evidence which could not mislead that the great body of the tenants in various counties of new york were bent on obtaining interests in their farms that were not conveyed by their leases without the consent of their landlords and insomuch that they were bent on doing that which should be discountenanced by every honest man in the community the very fact that they supported or in any manner connived at the socalled injin system spoke all that was necessary as to their motives and when we come to consider that these injins had already proceeded to the extremity of shedding blood it was sufficiently plain that things must soon reach a crisis  my uncle roger and myself reflected on all these matters calmly and decided on our course i trust with prudence as that decision has proved to be pregnant with consequences that are likely to affect my future life i shall now briefly give an outline of what induced us to adopt it  it was allimportant for us to visit ravensnest in person while it might be hazardous to do so openly the nest house stood in the very centre of the estate and ignorant as we were of the temper of the tenants it might be indiscreet to let our presence be known and circumstances favored our projects of concealment we were not expected to reach the country at all until autumn or fall as that season of the year is poetically called in america and this gave us the means of reaching the property unexpectedly and as we hoped undetected our arrangement then was very simple and will be best related in the course of the narrative  the packet had a reasonably short passage as we were twentynine days from land to land it was on a pleasant afternoon in may when the hummocklike heights of nevesink were first seen from the deck and an hour later we came in sight of the towerresembling sails of the coasters which were congregating in the neighborhood of the low point of land that is so very appropriately called sandy hook the lighthouses rose out of the water soon after and objects on the shore of new jersey next came gradually out of the misty background until we got near enough to be boarded first by the pilot and next by the newsboat the first preceding the last for a wonder news usually being far more active in this good republic than watchfulness to prevent evil my uncle ro gave the crew of this newsboat a thorough scrutiny and finding no one on board her whom he had ever before seen he bargained for a passage up to town  we put our feet on the battery just as the clocks of new york were striking eight a customhouse officer had examined our carpetbags and permitted them to pass and we had disburdened ourselves of the effects in the ship by desiring the captain to attend to them each of us had a townhouse but neither would go near his dwelling mine being only kept up in winter for the use of my sister and aunt who kindly took charge of her during the season while my uncles was opened principally for his mother at that season we had reason to think neither was tenanted but by one or two old family servants and it was our cue also to avoid them but jack dunning as my uncle always called him was rather more of a friend than of an agent and he had a bachelor establishment in chambers street that was precisely the place we wanted thither then we proceeded taking the route of greenwich street fearful of meeting some one in broadway by whom we might be recognized     chapter iv      cit speak speak     i cit you are all resolved rather to die than to famish     cit resolved resolved     i cit first you know caius marcus is chief enemy to the people     cit we knowt we knowt     i cit lets kill him and well have corn at our price                   ist a verdictcoriolanus   the most inveterate manhattanese if he be anything of a man of the world must confess that new york is after all but a ragfair sort of a place so far as the eye is concerned i was particularly struck with this fact even at that hour as we went stumbling along over an atrociously bad sidewalk my eyes never at rest as any one can imagine after five years of absence i could not help noting the incongruities the dwellings of marble in close proximity with miserable low constructions in wood the wretched pavements and above all the country air of a town of near four hundred thousand souls i very well know that many of the defects are to be ascribed to the rapid growth of the place which gives it a sort of hobbledehoy look but being a manhattanese by birth i thought i might just as well own it all at once if it were only for the information of a particular portion of my townsmen who may have been under a certain delusion on the subject as for comparing the bay of new york with that of naples on the score of beauty i shall no more be guilty of any such folly to gratify the cockney feelings of broadway and bond street than i should be guilty of the folly of comparing the commerce of the ancient parthenope with that of old new york in order to excite complacency in the bosom of some bottegajo in the toledo or on the chiaja our fastgrowing manhattan is a great town in its waya wonderful placewithout a parallel i do believe on earth as a proof of enterprise and of the accumulation of business and it is not easy to make such a town appear ridiculous by any jibes and innuendoes that relate to the positive things of this world though nothing is easier than to do it for itself by setting up to belong to the sisterhood of such places as london paris vienna and st petersburg there is too much of the american notion of the omnipotence of numbers among us manhattanese which induces us to think that the higher rank in the scale of places is to be obtained by majorities no no let us remember the familiar axiom of ne sutor ultra crepidum new york is just the queen of business but not yet the queen of the world every man who travels ought to bring back something to the common stock of knowledge and i shall give a hint to my townsmen by which i really think they may be able to tell for themselves as by feeling a sort of moral pulse when the town is rising to the level of a capital when simplicity takes the place of pretension is one good rule but as it may require a good deal of practice or native taste to ascertain this fact i will give another that is obvious to the senses which will at least be strongly symptomatic and that is this when squares cease to be called parks when horsebazaars and fashionable streets are not called tattersalls and bond street when washington market is rechristened bear market and franklin and fulton and other great philosophers and inventors are plucked of the unmerited honors of having shambles named after them when commercial is not used as a prefix to emporium when people can return from abroad without being asked if they are reconciled to their country and strangers are not interrogated at the second question how do you like our city then may it be believed that the town is beginning to go alone and that it may set up for itself  although new york is out of all question decidedly provincial laboring under the peculiar vices of provincial habits and provincial modes of thinking it contains many a man of the world and some too who have never quitted their own fireside of this very number was the jack dunning as my uncle ro called him to whose house in chambers street we were now proceeding  if we were going anywhere but to dunnings said my uncle as we turned out of greenwich street i should have no fear of being recognized by the servants for no one here thinks of keeping a man six months dunning however is of the old school and does not like new faces so he will have no irishman at his door as is the case with two out of three of the houses at which one calls nowadays  in another minute we were at the bottom of mr dunnings stoupwhat an infernal contrivance it is to get in and out at the door by in a hottycold climate like oursbut there we were and i observed that my uncle hesitated  parlez au suisse said i ten to one he is fresh from some ballythis or ballythat  no no it must be old garry the niggermy uncle ro was of the old school himself and would say niggerjack can never have parted with garry  garry was the diminutive of garret a somewhat common dutch christian name among us  we rang and the door openedin about five minutes although the terms aristocrat and aristocracy are much in mens mouths in america just now as well as those of feudal and the middle ages and this too as applied to modes of living as well as to leasehold tenures there is but one porter in the whole country and he belongs to the white house at washington i am afraid even that personage royal porter as he is is often out of the way and the reception he gives when he is there is not of the most brilliant and princely character when we had waited three minutes my uncle ro said  i am afraid garry is taking a nap by the kitchen fire ill try him again  uncle ro did try again and two minutes later the door opened  what is your pleasure demanded the suisse with a strong brogue  my uncle started back as if he had met a sprite but he asked if mr dunning was at home  he is indeed sir  is he alone or is he with company  he is indeed  but what is he indeed  he is that  can you take the trouble to explain which that it is has he company or is he alone  just that sir walk in and hell be charmed to see you a fine gentleman is his honor and pleasure it is to live with him im sure  how long is it since you left ireland my friend  isnt it a mighty bit now yer honor answered barney closing the door tirteen weeks if its one day  well go ahead and show us the way this is a bad omen hugh to find that jack dunning of all men in the country should have changed his servantgood quiet lazy respectable old grayheaded garry the niggerfor such a bogtrotter as that fellow who climbs those stairs as if accustomed only to ladders  dunning was in his library on the second floor where he passed most of his evenings his surprise was equal to that which my uncle had just experienced when he saw us two standing before him a significant gesture however caused him to grasp his friend and clients hand in silence and nothing was said until the swiss had left the room although the fellow stood with the door in his hand a most inconvenient time just to listen to what might pass between the host and his guests at length we got rid of him honest wellmeaning fellow that he was after all and the door was closed  my last letters have brought you home roger said jack the moment he could speak for feeling as well as caution had something to do with his silence  they have indeed a great change must have come over the country by what i hear and one of the very worst symptoms is that you have turned away garry and got an irishman in his place  ah old men must die as well as old principles i find my poor fellow went off in a fit last week and i took that irishman as a pis aller after losing poor garry who was born a slave in my fathers house i became indifferent and accepted the first comer from the intelligence office  we must be careful dunning not to give up too soon but hear my story and then to other matters  my uncle then explained his wish to be incognito and his motive dunning listened attentively but seemed uncertain whether to dissent or approve the matter was discussed briefly and then it was postponed for further consideration  but how comes on this great moral dereliction called antirentism is it on the wane or the increase  on the wane to the eye perhaps but on the increase so far as principles the rights and facts are concerned the necessity of propitiating votes is tempting politicians of all sides to lend themselves to it and there is imminent danger now that atrocious wrongs will be committed under the form of law  in what way can the law touch an existing contract the supreme court of the united states will set that right  that is the only hope of the honest let me tell you it is folly to expect that a body composed of such men as usually are sent to the state legislature can resist the temptation to gain power by conciliating numbers that is out of the question individuals of these bodies may resist but the tendency there will be as against the few and in favor of the many bolstering their theories by claptraps and slang political phrases the scheme to tax the rents under the name of quitrents will be resorted to in the first place  that will be a most iniquitous proceeding and would justify resistance just as much as our ancestors were justified in resisting the taxation of great britain  it would more so for here we have a written covenant to render taxation equal the landlord already pays one tax on each of these farmsa full and complete tax that is reserved from the rent in the original bargain with the tenant and now the wish is to tax the rents themselves and this not to raise revenue for that is confessedly not wanted but most clearly with a design to increase the inducements for the landlords to part with their property if that can be done the sales will be made on the principle that none but the tenant must be as indeed no one else can be the purchaser and then we shall see a queer exhibitionmen parting with their property under the pressure of a clamor that is backed by as much law as can be pressed into its service with a monopoly of price on the side of the purchaser and all in a country professing the most sensitive love of liberty and where the prevailing class of politicians are freetrade men  there is no end of these inconsistencies among politicians  there is no end of knavery when men submit to noses instead of principles call things by their right names ro as they deserve to be this matter is so plain that he who runs can read  but will this scheme of taxation succeed it does not affect us for instance as our leases are for three lives  oh that is nothing for you they contemplate a law that will forbid the letting of land for the future for a period longer than five years hughs leases will soon be falling in and then he cant make a slave of any man for a longer period than five years  surely no one is so silly as to think of passing such a law with a view to put down aristocracy and to benefit the tenant i cried laughing  ay you may laugh young sir resumed jack dunning but such is the intention i know very well what will be your course of reasoning you will say the longer the lease the better for the tenant if the bargain be reasonably good and landlords cannot ask more for the use of their lands than they are really worth in this country there happening to be more land than there are men to work it no no landlords rather get less for their lands than they are worth instead of more for that plain reason to compel the tenant to take a lease therefore for a term as short as five years is to injure him you think to place him more at the control of his landlord through the little interest connected with the cost and trouble of moving and through the natural desire he may possess to cut the meadows he has seeded and to get the full benefit of manure he has made and carted i see how you reason young sir but you are behind the ageyou are sadly behind the age  the age is a queer one if i am all over the world it is believed that long leases are favors or advantages to tenants and nothing can make it otherwise cæteris paribus then what good will the tax do after violating right and moral justice if not positive law to lay it on a hundred dollars of rent i should have to pay some fiftyfive cents of taxes as i am assessed on other things at ravensnest and does anybody suppose i will give up an estate that has passed through five generations of my family on account of a tribute like that  mighty well sirmighty well sir this is fine talk but i would advise you not to speak of your ancestors at all landlords cant name their ancestors with impunity just now  i name mine only as showing a reason for a natural regard for my paternal acres  that you might do if you were a tenant but not as a landlord in a landlord it is aristocratic and intolerable pride and to the last degree offensiveas dogberry says tolerable and not to be endured  but it is a fact and it is natural one should have some feelings connected with it  the more it is a fact the less it will be liked people associate social position with wealth and estates but not with farms and the longer one has such things in a family the worse for them  i do believe jack put in my uncle ro that the rule which prevails all over the rest of the world is reversed here and that with us it is thought a familys claim is lessened and not increased by time  to be sure it is answered dunning without giving me a chance to speak do you know that you wrote me a very silly letter once from switzerland about a family called de blonay that had been seated on the same rock in a little castle some six or eight hundred years and the sort of respect and veneration the circumstance awakened well all that was very foolish as you will find when you pay your incognito visit to ravensnest i will not anticipate the result of your schooling but go to school  as the rensselaers and other great landlords who have estates on durable leases will not be very likely to give them up except on terms that will suit themselves for a tax as insignificant as that mentioned by hugh said my uncle what does the legislature anticipate from passing the law  that its members will be called the friends of the people and not the friends of the landlords would any man tax his friends if he could help it  but what will that portion of the people who compose the antirenters gain by such a measure  nothing and their complaints will be just as loud and their longings as active as ever nothing that can have any effect on what they wish will be accomplished by any legislation in the matter one committee of the assembly has actually reported you may remember that the state might assume the lands and sell them to the tenants or some one else or something of the sort  the constitution of the united states must be hughs ægis  and that alone will protect him let me tell you but for that noble provision of the constitution of the federal government his estate would infallibly go for onehalf of its true value there is no use in mincing things or in affecting to believe men more honest than they arean infernal feeling of selfishness is so much talked of and cited and referred to on all occasions in this country that a man almost renders himself ridiculous who appears to rest on principle  have you heard what the tenants of ravensnest aim at in particular  they want to get hughs lands thats all nothing more i can assure you  on what conditions pray demanded i  as you light of chaps to use a saying of their own some even profess a willingness to pay a fair price  but i do not wish to sell for even a fair price i have no desire to part with property that is endeared to me by family feeling and association i have an expensive house and establishment on my estate which obtains its principal value from the circumstance that it is so placed that i can look after my interests with the least inconvenience to myself what can i do with the money but buy another estate and i prefer this that i have  poh boy you can shave notes youll recollect said uncle ro dryly the calling is decided to be honorable by the highest tribunal and no man should be above his business  you have no right sir in a free country returned the caustic jack dunning to prefer one estate to another more especially when other people want it your lands are leased to honest hardworking tenants who can eat their dinners without silver forks and whose ancestors  stop i cried laughing i bar all ancestry no man has a right to ancestry in a free country youll remember  that means landlord ancestry as for tenant ancestry one can have a pedigree as long as the maison de levis no sir every tenant you have has every right to demand that his sentiment of family feeling should be respected his father planted that orchard and he loves the apples better than any other apples in the world  and my father procured the grafts and made him a present of them  his grandfather cleared that field and converted its ashes into pots and pearls  and my grandfather received that year ten shillings of rent for land off which his received two hundred and fifty dollars for his ashes  his greatgrandfather honest and excellent mannay superhonest and confiding creaturefirst took up the land when a wilderness and with his own hands felled the timber and sowed the wheat  and got his pay twentyfold for it all or he would not have been fool enough to do it i had a greatgrandfather too and i hope it will not be considered aristocratic if i venture to hint as much hea dishonest pestilent knave no doubtleased that very lot for six years without any rent at all in order that the poor confiding creature might make himself comfortable before he commenced paying his sixpence or shilling an acre rent for the remainder of three lives with a moral certainty of getting a renewal on the most liberal terms known to a new country and who knew the whole time he could buy land in fee within ten miles of his door but who thought this a better bargain than that  enough of this folly cried uncle ro joining in the laugh we all know that in our excellent america he who has the highest claims to anything must affect to have the least to stifle the monster envy and being of one mind as to principles let us come to facts what of the girls jack and of my honored mother  she noble heroic woman she is at ravensnest at this moment and as the girls would not permit her to go alone they are all with her  and did you jack dunning suffer them to go unattended into a part of the country that is in open rebellion demanded my uncle reproachfully  come come hodge littlepage this is very sublime as a theory but not so clear when reduced to practice i did not go with mrs littlepage and her young fry for the good and substantial reason that i did not wish to be tarred and feathered  so you leave them to run the risk of being tarred and feathered in your stead  say what you will about the cant of freedom that is becoming so common among us and from which we were once so free say what you will ro of the inconsistency of those who raise the cry of feudality and aristocracy and nobility at the very moment they are manifesting a desire for exclusive rights and privileges in their own persons say what you will of dishonesty envy that prominent american vice knavery covetousness and selfishness and i will echo all you can utter but do not say that a woman can be in serious danger among any material body of americans even if antirenters and mockredskins in the bargain  i believe you are right there jack on reflection pardon my warmth but i have lately been living in the old world and in a country in which women were not long since carried to the scaffold on account of their politics  because they meddled with politics your mother is in no serious danger though it needs nerve in a woman to be able to think so there are few women in the state and fewer of her time of life anywhere that would do what she has done and i give the girls great credit for sticking by her half the young men in town are desperate at the thought of three such charming creatures thus exposing themselves to insult your mother has only been sued  sued whom does she owe or what can she have done to have brought this indignity on her  you know or ought to know how it is in this country littlepage we must have a little law even when most bent on breaking it a downright straightforward rascal who openly sets law at defiance is a wonder then we have a great talk of liberty when plotting to give it the deepest stab and religion even gets to share in no small portion of our vices thus it is that the antirenters have dragged in the law in aid of their designs i understand one of the rensselaers has been sued for money borrowed in a ferryboat to help him across a river under his own door and for potatoes bought by his wife in the streets of albany  but neither of the rensselaers need borrow money to cross the ferry as the ferrymen would trust him and no lady of the rensselaer family ever bought potatoes in the streets of albany ill answer for it  you have brought back some knowledge from your travels i find said jack dunning with comic gravity your mother writes me that she has been sued for twentyseven pairs of shoes furnished her by a shoemaker whom she never saw or heard of until she received the summons  this then is one of the species of annoyances that has been adopted to bully the landlords out of their property  it is and if the landlords have recourse even to the covenants of their leases solemnly and deliberately made and as solemnly guaranteed by a fundamental law the cry is raised of aristocracy and oppression by these very men and echoed by many of the creatures who get seats in high places among usor what would be high places if filled with men worthy of their trusts  i see you do not mince your words jack  why should i words are all that is left me i am of no more weight in the government of this state than that irishman who let you in just now will be five years henceless for he will vote to suit a majority and as i shall vote understandingly my vote will probably do no one any good  dunning belonged to a school that mingles a good deal of speculative and impracticable theory with a great deal of sound and just principles but who render themselves useless because they will admit of no compromises he did not belong to the class of american doctrinaires however or to those who contendno not contend for no one does that any longer in this country whatever may be his opinion on the subjectbut those who think that political power as in the last resort should be the property of the few for he was willing new york should have a very broad constituency nevertheless he was opposed to the universal suffrage in its wide extent that does actually exist as i suppose quite threefourths of the whole population are opposed to it in their hearts though no political man of influence now existing has the moral calibre necessary to take the lead in putting it down dunning deferred to principles and not to men he well knew that an infallible whole was not to be composed of fallible parts and while he thought majorities ought to determine many things that there are rights and principles that are superior to even such unanimity as man can manifest and much more to their majorities but dunning had no selfish views connected with his political notions wanting no office and feeling no motive to affect that which he neither thought nor wished he never had quitted home or it is highly probable his views of the comparative abuses of the different systems that prevail in the world would have been essentially modified those he saw had unavoidably a democratic source there being neither monarch nor aristocrat to produce any other and under such circumstances as abuses certainly abound it is not at all surprising that he sometimes a little distorted facts and magnified evils  and my noble highspirited and venerable mother has actually gone to the nest to face the enemy exclaimed my uncle after a thoughtful pause  she has indeed and the noble highspirited though not venerable young ladies have gone with her returned mr dunning in his caustic way  all three do you mean  every one of themmartha henrietta and anne  i am surprised that the last should have done so anne marston is such a meek quiet peaceloving person that i should think she would have preferred remaining as she naturally might have done without exciting remark with her own mother  she has not nevertheless mrs littlepage would brave the antirenters and the three maidens would be her companions i dare say ro you know how it is with the gentle sex when they make up their minds  my girls are all good girls and have given me very little trouble answered my uncle complacently  yes i dare say that may be true you have only been absent from home five years this trip  an attentive guardian notwithstanding since i left you as a substitute has my mother written to you since her arrival among the hosts of the philistines  she has indeed littlepage answered dunning gravely i have heard from her three times for she writes to urge my not appearing on the estate i did intend to pay her a visit but she tells me that it might lead to a violent scene and can do no good as the rents will not be due until autumn and master hugh is now of age and was to be here to look after his own affairs i have seen no motive for incurring the risk of the tarring and feathering we american lawyers young gentleman wear no wigs  does my mother write herself or employ another inquired my uncle with interest  she honors me with her own hand your mother writes much better than you do yourself roger  that is owing to her once having carried chain as she would say herself has martha written to you  of course sweet little patty and i are bosom friends as you know  and does she say anything of the indian and the negro  jaaf and susquesus to be sure she does both are living still and both are well i saw them myself and even ate of their venison so lately as last winter  those old fellows must have each lived a great deal more than his century jack they were with my grandfather in the old french war as active useful menolder than my grandfather  ay a nigger or a redskin before all others for holding on to life when they have been temperate let me seethat expedition of abercrombies was about eighty years since why these fellows must be well turned of their hundred though jaap is rather the oldest judging from appearances  i believe no one knows the age of either a hundred each has been thought now for many years susquesus was surprisingly active too when i last saw himlike a healthy man of eighty  he has failed of late though he actually shot a deer as i told you last winter both the old fellows stray down to the nest martha writes me and the indian is highly scandalized at the miserable imitations of his race that are now abroad i have even heard that he and yop have actually contemplated taking the field against them seneca newcome is their especial aversion  how is opportunity i inquired does she take any part in this movement  a decided one i hear she is antirent while she wishes to keep on good terms with her landlord and that is endeavoring to serve god and mammon she is not the first however by a thousand that wears two faces in this business  hugh has a deep admiration of opportunity observed my uncle and you had needs be tender in your strictures the modern seneca i take it is dead against us  seneky wishes to go to the legislature and of course he is on the side of votes then his brother is a tenant at the mill and naturally wishes to be the landlord he is also interested in the land himself one thing has struck me in this controversy as highly worthy of notice and it is the naïveté with which men reconcile the obvious longing of covetousness with what they are pleased to fancy the principles of liberty when a man has worked a farm a certain number of years he boldly sets up the doctrine that the fact itself gives him a high moral claim to possess it forever a moments examination will expose the fallacy by which these sophists apply the flattering unction to their souls they work their farms under a lease and in virtue of its covenants now in a moral sense all that time can do in such a case is to render these covenants the more sacred and consequently more binding but these worthies whose morality is all on one side imagine that these timehonored covenants give them a right to fly from their own conditions during their existence and to raise pretensions far exceeding anything they themselves confer the moment they cease  poh poh jack there is no need of refining at all to come at the merits of such a question this is a civilized country or it is not if it be a civilized country it will respect the rights of property and its own laws and if the reverse it will not respect them as for setting up the doctrine at this late day when millions and millions are invested in this particular species of property that the leasehold tenure is opposed to the spirit of institutions of which it has substantially formed a part ever since those institutions have themselves had an existence it requires a bold front and more capacity than any man at albany possesses to make the doctrines go down men may run off with the notion that the tendencies to certain abuses which mark every system form their spirit but this is a fallacy that a very little thought will correct is it true that proposals have actually been made by these pretenders to liberty to appoint commissioners to act as arbitrators between the landlords and tenants and to decide points that no one has any right to raise  true as holy writ and a regular star chamber tribunal it would be it is wonderful after all how extremes do meet  that is as certain as the return of the sun after night but let us now talk of our project jack and of the means of getting among these selfdeluded mendeluded by their own covetousnesswithout being discovered for i am determined to see them and to judge of their motives and conduct for myself  take care of the tarbarrel and of the pillowcase of feathers roger  i shall endeavor so to do  we then discussed the matter before us at length and leisurely i shall not relate all that was said as it would be going over the same ground twice but refer the reader to the regular narrative at the usual hour we retired to our beds retaining the name of davidson as convenient and prudent next day mr john dunning busied himself in our behalf and made himself exceedingly useful to us in his character of an old bachelor he had many acquaintances at the theatre and through his friends of the greenroom he supplied each of us with a wig both my uncle and myself spoke german reasonably well and our original plan was to travel in the character of immigrant trinket and essence pedlers but i had a fancy for a handorgan and a monkey and it was finally agreed that mr hugh roger littlepage senior was to undertake this adventure with a box of cheap watches and gilded trinkets while mr hugh roger littlepage junior was to commence his travels at home in the character of a musicgrinder modesty will not permit me to say all i might in favor of my own skill in music in general but i sang well for an amateur and played both on the violin and flute far better than is common  everything was arranged in the course of the following day our wigs of themselves completely effecting all the disguises that were necessary as for my uncle he was nearly bald and a wig was no great encumbrance but my shaggy locks gave me some trouble a little clipping however answered the turn and i had a hearty laugh at myself in costume that afternoon before dunnings dressingroom glass we got round the felony law about being armed and disguised by carrying no weapons but our tools in the way of trade     chapter v      and she hath smiles to earth unknown     smiles that with motion of their own     do spread and sink and rise     that come and go with endless play     and ever as they pass away     are hidden in her eyeswordsworth   i was early in costume the following morning i question if my own mother could have known me had she lived long enough to see the whiskers sprout on my cheeks and to contemplate my countenance as a man i went into dunnings library drew the little hurdygurdy from its hidingplace slung it and began to play st patricks day in the morning with spirit and i trust i may add with execution i was in the height of the air when the door opened and barney thrust his highcheekedbone face into the room his mouth as wide open as that of a frozen porker  where the divil did ye come from demanded the new footman with the muscles of that vast aperture of his working from grin to grim and grim to grin again yees wilcome to the tchune but how comes ye here  i coomes vrom halle in preussen vat isht your vaterland  bee yees a jew  neini isht a goot christian vilt you haf yankee tootle  yankee tunder yell wake up the masther and hell be displaised else ye might work on that tchune till the end of time that i should hear it here in my own liberary and ould ireland tree thousand laigues away  a laugh from dunning interrupted the dialogue when barney vanished no doubt anticipating some species of american punishment for a presumed delinquency whether the blundering wellmeaning honest fellow really ascertained who we were that breakfasted with his master i do not know but we got the meal and left the house without seeing his face again dunning having a young yellow fellow to do the service of the table  i need scarcely say that i felt a little awkward at finding myself in the streets of new york in such a guise but the gravity and selfpossession of my uncle were a constant source of amusement to me he actually sold a watch on the wharf before the boat left it though i imputed his success to the circumstance that his price was what a brother dealer who happened to be trading in the same neighborhood pronounced onconscionably low we took a comfortable stateroom between us under the pretence of locking up our property and strolled about the boat gaping and looking curious as became our class  here are at least a dozen people that i know said my uncle as we were lounging aroundloafing around is the modern doricabout the time that the boat was paddling past fort washington i have reconnoitred in all quarters and find quite a dozen i have been conversing with an old schoolfellow and one with whom i have ever lived in tolerable intimacy for the last ten minutes and find my broken english and disguise are perfect i am confident my dear mother herself would not recognize me  we can then amuse ourselves with my grandmother and the young ladies i answered when we reach the nest for my part it strikes me that we had better keep our own secret to the last moment  hush as i live there is seneca newcome this moment he is coming this way and we must be germans again  sure enough there was squire seneky as the honest farmers around the nest call him though many of them must change their practices or it will shortly become so absurd to apply the term honest to them that no one will have the hardihood to use it newcome came slowly toward the forecastle on which we were standing and my uncle determined to get into conversation with him as a means of further proving the virtue of our disguises as well as possibly of opening the way to some communications that might facilitate our visit to the nest with this view the pretended pedler drew a watch from his pocket and offering it meekly to the inspection of the quasi lawyer he said  puy a vatch shentlemans  hey what oh a watch returned seneca in that high condescending vulgar key with which the salt of the earth usually affect to treat those they evidently think much beneath them in intellect station or some other great essential at the very moment they are bursting with envy and denouncing as aristocrats all who are above them hey a watch is it what countryman are you friend  a charmansein teutscher  a germanine tycher is the place you

despise aristocracywhat seneca hated with the strongest hate he ever fancied he despised the most and by aristocracy he merely understood gentlemen and ladies in the true signification of the wordswhy im always ready to help along the honest citizen if you could make up your mind now to part with this one watch for nawthin i think i could tell you a part of the country where you might sell the other nineteen in a week  goot exclaimed my uncle cheerfully take himhe ist your broberty and wilcome only show me de town where i canst sell de nineteen udders  had my uncle ro been a true son of peddling he would have charged a dollar extra on each of the nineteen and made eleven dollars by his present liberality  it is no town at allonly a township returned the liberal seneca did you expect

the way into that part of the country as your pay  agreed shentlemans vat i vants is atfice and vat you vants is a watch  here uncle ro laughed so much like himself when he ought clearly to have laughed in broken english that i was very much afraid he might give the alarm to our companion but he did not from that time the best relation existed between us and seneca who in the course of the day recognized us by sundry smiles and winks though i could plainly see he did not like the antiaristocratic principle sufficiently to wish to seem too intimate with us before we reached the islands however he gave us directions where to meet him in the morning and we parted when the boat stopped alongside of the pier at albany that afternoon the best friends in the world  albany dear good old albany exclaimed my uncle ro as we stopped on the draw of the bridge to look at the busy scene in the basin where literally hundreds of canalboats were either lying to discharge or to load or were coming and going to say nothing of other craft dear good old albany you are a town to which i ever return with pleasure for you at least never disappoint me a firstrate countryplace you are and though i miss your quaint old dutch church and your rusticlooking old english church from the centre of your principal street almost every change you make is respectable i know nothing that tells so much against you as changing the name of market street by the paltry imitation of broadway but considering that a horde of yankees have come down upon you since the commencement of the present century you are lucky that the street was not called the appian way but excellent old albany whom even the corruptions of politics cannot change in the core lying against the hillside and surrounded with thy picturesque scenery there is an air of respectability about thee that i admire and a quiet prosperity that i love yet how changed since my boyhood thy simple stoops have all vanished thy gables are disappearing marble and granite are rising in thy streets too but they take honest shapes and are free from the ambition of mounting on stilts thy basin has changed the whole character of thy once semisylvan semicommercial river but it gives to thy young manhood an appearance of abundance and thrift that promise well for thy age  the reader may depend on it that i laughed heartily at this rhapsody for i could hardly enter into my uncles feelings albany is certainly a very good sort of a place and relatively a more respectablelooking town than the commercial emporium which after all externally is a mere huge expansion of a very marked mediocrity with the pretension of a capital in its estimate of itself but albany lays no claim to be anything more than a provincial town and in that class it is highly placed by the way there is nothing in which our people to speak idiomatically more deceive themselves than in their estimate of what composes a capital it would be ridiculous to suppose that the representatives of such a government as this could impart to any place the tone opinions habits and manners of a capital for if they did they would impart it on the novel principle of communicating that which they do not possess in their own persons congress itself though tolerably free from most shackles including those of the constitution is not up to that in my opinion a man accustomed to the world might be placed blindfolded in the most finished quarter of new york and the place has new quarters in which the incongruities i have already mentioned do not exist and my life on it he could pronounce as soon as the bandage was removed that he was not in a town were the tone of a capital exists the last thing to make a capital is trade indeed the man who hears the words business and the merchants ringing in his ears may safely conclude de facto that he is not in a capital now a new york village is often much less rustic than the villages of the most advanced country of europe but a new york town is many degrees below any capital of a large state in the old world  will new york ever be a capital yesout of all question yes but the day will not come until after the sudden changes of condition which immediately and so naturally succeeded the revolution have ceased to influence ordinary society and those above again impart to those below more than they receive this restoration to the natural state of things must take place as soon as society gets settled and there will be nothing to prevent a town living under our own institutionsspirit tendencies and allfrom obtaining the highest tone that ever yet prevailed in a capital the folly is in anticipating the natural course of events nothing will more hasten these events however than a literature that is controlled not by the lower but by the higher opinion of the country which literature is yet in a great degree to be created  i had dispensed with the monkey after trying to get along with the creature for an hour or two and went around only with my music i would rather manage an army of antirenters than one monkey with the hurdygurdy slung around my neck therefore i followed my uncle who actually sold another watch before we reached a tavern of course we did not presume to go to congress hall or the eagle for we knew we should not be admitted this was the toughest part of our adventures i am of opinion my uncle made a mistake for he ventured to a secondclass house under the impression that one of the sort usually frequented by men of our supposed stamp might prove too coarse for us altogether i think we should have been better satisfied with the coarse fare of a coarse tavern than with the shabbygenteel of the house we blundered into in the former everything would have reminded us in a way we expected to be reminded that we were out of the common track and we might have been amused with the change though it is one singularly hard to be endured i remember to have heard a young man accustomed from childhood to the better habits of the country but who went to sea a lad before the mast declare that the coarseness of his shipmatesand there is no vulgarity about a true sailor even when coarsestgave him more trouble to overcome than all the gales physical sufferings labor exposures and dangers put together i must confess i have found it so too in my little experience while acting as a strolling musician i could get along with anything better than the coarse habits which i encountered at the table your silverforkisms and your purely conventional customs as a matter of course no man of the world attaches any serious importance to but there are conventionalities that belong to the fundamental principles of civilized society which become second nature and with which it gets to be hard indeed to dispense i shall say as little as possible of the disagreeables of my new trade therefore but stick to the essentials  the morning of the day which succeeded that of our arrival at albany my uncle ro and i took our seats in the train intending to go to saratoga viâ troy i wonder the trojan who first thought of playing this travestie on homer did not think of calling the place troyville or troyborough that would have been semiamerican at least whereas the present appellation is so purely classical it is impossible to walk through the streets of this neat and flourishing town which already counts its twenty thousand souls and not have the images of achilles and hector and priam and hecuba pressing on the imagination a little uncomfortably had the place been called try the name would have been a sensible one for it is trying all it can to get the better of albany and much as i love the latter venerable old town i hope troy may succeed in its trying to prevent the hudson from being bridged by the way i will here remark for the benefit of those who have never seen any country but their own that there is a view on the road between schenectady and this grecian place just where the heights give the first full appearance of the valley of the hudson including glimpses of waterford lansingburg and albany with a full view of both troys which gives one a better idea of the affluence of european scenery than almost any other spot i can recall in america to my hurdygurdy  i made my first essay as a musician in public beneath the windows of the principal inn of troy i cannot say much in favor of the instrument though i trust the playing itself was somewhat respectable this i know full well that i soon brought a dozen fair faces to the windows of the inn and that each was decorated with a smile then it was that i regretted the monkey such an opening could not but awaken the dormant ambition of even a patriot of the purest water and i will own i was gratified  among the curious who thus appeared were two whom i at once supposed to be father and daughter the former was a clergyman and as i fancied by something in his air of the church begging pardon of those who take offence at this exclusive title and to whom i will just give a hint in passing any one at all acquainted with mankind will at once understand that no man who is certain of possessing any particular advantage ever manifests much sensibility because another lays claim to it also in the constant struggles of the jealous for instance on the subject of that universal source of jealous feeling social position that man or woman who is conscious of claims never troubles himself or herself about them for them the obvious fact is sufficient if it be answered to this that the pretension of the church is exclusive i shall admit it is and conclusive too it is not exclusive however in the sense urged since no one denies that there are many branches to the church although those branches do not embrace everything i would advise those who take offence at our styling ourselves the church to style themselves the church just as they call all their parsons bishops and see who will care about it that is a touchstone which will soon separate the true metal from the alloy  my parson i could easily see was a church clergymannot a meetinghouse clergyman how i ascertained that fact at a glance i shall not reveal but i also saw in his countenance some of that curiosity which marks simplicity of character it was not a vulgar feeling but one which induced him to beckon me to approach a little nearer i did so when he invited me in it was a little awkward at first i must acknowledge to be beckoned about in this manner but there was something in the air and countenance of the daughter that induced me not to hesitate about complying i cannot say that her beauty was so very striking though she was decidedly pretty but the expression of her face eyes smile and all put together was so singularly sweet and feminine that i felt impelled by a sympathy i shall not attempt to explain to enter the house and ascend to the door of a parlor that i saw at once was public though it then contained no one but my proper hosts  walk in young man said the father in a benevolent tone of voice i am curious to see that instrument and my daughter here who has a taste for music wishes it as much as i do myself what do you call it  hurtygurty i answered  from what part of the world do you come my young friend continued the clergyman raising his meek eyes to mine still more curiously vrom charmany vrom preussen vere did reign so late de good koenig wilhelm  what does he say molly  so the pretty creature bore the name of mary i liked the molly too it was a good sign as none but the truly respectable dare use such familiar appellations in these ambitious times molly sounded as if these people had the âplomb of position and conscious breeding had they been vulgar it would have been mollissa  it is not difficult to translate father answered one of the sweetest voices that had ever poured its melody on my ear and which was rendered still more musical by the slight laugh that mingled with it he says he is from germanyfrom prussia where the good king william lately reigned  i liked the father toothat sounded refreshing after passing a night among a tribe of foulnosed adventurers in humanity every one of whom had done his or her share toward caricaturing the once pretty appellatives of pa and ma a young lady may still say papa or even mamma though it were far better that she said father and mother but as for pa and ma they are now done with in respectable life they will not even do for the nursery  and this instrument is a hurdygurdy continued the clergyman what have we herethe name spelt on it  dat isht de makers namehochstiel fecit  fecit repeated the clergyman is that german  neindat isht latin facio feci factum facerefeci fecisti fecit it means make i suppose you know  the parson looked at me and at my dress and figure with open surprise and smiled as his eye glanced at his daughter if asked why i made this silly display of lowerform learning i can only say that i chafed at being fancied a mere everyday street musician that had left his monkey at home by the charming girl who stood gracefully bending over her fathers elbow as the latter examined the inscription that was stamped on a small piece of ivory which had been let into the instrument i could see that mary shrunk back a little under the sensitive feeling so natural to her sex that she was manifesting too much freedom of manner for the presence of a youth who was nearer to her own class than she could have supposed it possible for a player on the hurdygurdy to be a blush succeeded but the glance of the soft blue eye that instantly followed seemed to set all at rest and she leaned over her fathers elbow again  you understand latin then demanded the parent examining me over his spectacles from head to foot  a leetle sirjust a ferry leetle in my coontry efery mans isht obliget to be a soldier some time and them tat knows latin can be made sergeants and corporals  that is prussia is it  yapreussen vere so late did reign de goot koenig wilhelm  and is latin much understood among you i have heard that in hungary most wellinformed persons even speak the tongue  in charmany it isht not so we all larnts someting but not all dost larn eferyting  i could see a smile struggling around the sweet lips of that dear girl after i had thus delivered myself as i fancied with a most accurate inaccuracy but she succeeded in repressing it though those provoking eyes of hers continued to laugh much of the time our interview lasted  oh i very well know that in prussia the schools are quite good and that your government pays great attention to the wants of all classes rejoined the clergyman but i confess some surprise that you should understand anything of latin now even in this country where we boast so much  yees i could not refrain from drawling out dey does poast a great teal in dis coontry  mary actually laughed whether it was at my words or at the somewhat comical manner i had assumeda manner in which simplicity was tant soit peu blended with ironyi shall not pretend to say as for the father his simplicity was of proof and after civilly waiting until my interruption was done he resumed what he had been on the point of saying  i was about to add continued the clergyman that even in this country where we boast so muchthe little minx of a daughter passed her hand over her eyes and fairly colored with the effort she made not to laugh againof the common schools and of their influence on the public mind it is not usual to find persons of your condition who understand the dead languages  yeees i replied it isht my condition dat misleats you sir mine fater wast a shentlemans and he gifet me as goot an etication as de koenig did gif to de kron prinz  here my desire to appear well in the eyes of mary caused me to run into another silly indiscretion how i was to explain the circumstance of the son of a prussian gentleman whose father had given him an education as good as that which the king of his country had given to its crown prince being in the streets of troy playing on a hurdygurdy was a difficulty i did not reflect on for a moment the idea of being thought by that sweet girl a mere uneducated boor was intolerable to me and i threw it off by this desperate falsehoodfalse in its accessories but true in its main factsas one would resent an insult fortune favored me however far more than i had any right to expect  there is a singular disposition in the american character to believe every wellmannered european at least a count i do not mean that those who have seen the world are not like other persons in this respect but a very great proportion of the country never has seen any other world than a world of business the credulity on this subject surpasseth belief and were i to relate facts of this nature that might be established in a court of justice the very parties connected with them would be ready to swear that they are caricatures now wellmannered i trust i am and though plainly dressed and thoroughly disguised neither my air nor attire was absolutely mean as my clothes were new i was neat in my appearance and there were possibly some incongruities about the last that might have struck eyes more penetrating than those of my companions i could see that both father and daughter felt a lively interest in me the instant i gave them reason to believe i was one of better fortunes so many crude notions exist among us on the subject of convulsions and revolutions in europe that i dare say had i told any improbable tale of the political condition of prussia it would have gone down for nothing so much resembles the ignorance that prevails in america generally concerning the true state of things in europe as the ignorance that prevails in europe generally concerning the true state of things in america as for mary her soft eyes seemed to me to be imbued with thrice their customary gentleness and compassion as she recoiled a step in native modesty and gazed at me when i had made my revelation  if such is the case my young friend returned the clergyman with benevolent interest you ought and might easily be placed in a better position than this you are now in have you any knowledge of greek  certainlygreek is moch study in charmany  in for a penny in for a pound i thought  and the modern languagesdo you understand any of them  i speaks de five great tongues of europe more ast less well and i read dem all easily  the five tongues said the clergyman counting on his fingers what can they be mary  french and german and spanish and italian i suppose sir  these make but four what can be the fifth my dear  de yoong laty forgets de englisch de englisch is das funf  oh yes the english exclaimed the pretty creature pressing her lips together to prevent laughing in my face  truei had forgotten the english not being accustomed to think of it as a mere european tongue i suppose young man you naturally speak the english less fluently than any other of your five languages  ya  again the smile struggled to the lips of mary  i feel a deep interest in you as a stranger and am sorry we have only met to part so soon which way shall you be likely to direct your steps my prussian young friend  i go to a place which is callet ravensnestgoot place to sell vatch dey tells me  ravensnest exclaimed the father  ravensnest repeated the daughter and that in tones which put the hurdygurdy to shame  why ravensnest is the place where i live and the parish of which i am the clergymanthe protestant episcopal clergyman i mean  this then was the rev mr warren the divine who had been called to our church the very summer i left home and who had been there ever since my sister martha had written me much concerning these people and i felt as if i had known them for years mr warren was a man of good connections and some education but of no fortune whatever who had gone into the churchit was the church of his ancestors one of whom had actually been an english bishop a century or two agofrom choice and contrary to the wishes of his friends as a preacher his success had never been great but for the discharge of his duties no man stood higher and no man was more respected the living of st andrews ravensnest would have been poor enough had it depended on the contributions of the parishioners these last gave about one hundred and fifty dollars a year for their share of the support of a priest i gave another hundred as regularly as clockwork and had been made to do so throughout a long minority and my grandmother and sister made up another fifty between them but there was a glebe of fifty acres of capital land a woodlot and a fund of two thousand dollars at interest the whole proceeding from endowments made by my grandfather during his lifetime altogether the living may have been worth a clear five hundred dollars a year in addition to a comfortable house hay wood vegetables pasture and some advantages in the way of small crops few country clergymen were better off than the rector of st andrews ravensnest and all as a consequence of the feudal and aristocratic habits of the littlepages though i say it perhaps who might better not in times like these  my letters had told me that the rev mr warren was a widower that mary was his only child that he was a truly pious not a shampious and really zealous clergyman a man of purest truth whose word was gospelof great simplicity and integrity of mind and character that he never spoke evil of others and that a complaint of this world and its hardships seldom crossed his lips he loved his fellowcreatures both naturally and on principle mourned over the state of the diocese and greatly preferred piety even to highchurchism highchurchman he was nevertheless though it was not a highchurchmanship that outweighed the loftier considerations of his christian duties and left him equally without opinions of his own in matters of morals and without a proper respect in practice for those that he had solemnly vowed to maintain  his daughter was described as a sweettempered arch modest sensible and wellbred girl that had received a far better education than her fathers means would have permitted him to bestow through the liberality and affection of a widowed sister of her mothers who was affluent and had caused her to attend the same school as that to which she had sent her own daughters in a word she was a most charming neighbor and her presence at ravensnest had rendered marthas annual visits to the old house built in 1785 not only less irksome but actually pleasant such had been my sisters account of the warrens and their qualities throughout a correspondence of five years i have even fancied that she loved this mary warren better than she loved any of her uncles wards herself of course excepted  the foregoing flashed through my mind the instant the clergyman announced himself but the coincidence of our being on the way to the same part of the country seemed to strike him as forcibly as it did myself what mary thought of the matter i had no means of ascertaining  this is singular enough resumed mr warren what has directed your steps toward ravensnest  dey tell mine ooncle tis goot place to sell moch vatch  you have an uncle then ah i see him there in the street showing a watch at this moment to a gentleman is your uncle a linguist too and has he been as well educated as you seem to be yourself  certainhe moch more of a shentleman dan ast de shentleman to whom he now sell vatch  these must be the very persons put in mary a little eagerly of whom mr newcome spoke as thethe dear girl did not like to say pedlers after what i had told them of my origin so she addeddealers in watches and trinkets who intended to visit our part of the country  you are right my dear and the whole matter is now clear mr newcome said he expected them to join us at troy when we should proceed in the train together as far as saratoga but here comes opportunity herself and her brother cannot be far off  at that moment sure enough my old acquaintance opportunity newcome came into the room a public parlor with an air of great selfsatisfaction and a nonchalance of manner that was not a little more peculiar to herself than it is to most of her caste i trembled for my disguise since to be quite frank on a very delicate subject opportunity had made so very dead a set at mesetting a cap is but a pitiful phrase to express the assault i had to withstandas scarcely to leave a hope that her feminine instinct increased and stimulated with the wish to be mistress of the nest house could possibly overlook the thousand and one personal peculiarities that must still remain about one whose personal peculiarities she had made her particular study     chapter vi      oh sic a geek she gave her head     and sic a toss she gave her feather     man saw ye neer a bonnier lass     before among the blooming heather                               allan cunningham   ah here are some charming french vignettes cried opportunity running up to a table where lay some inferior colored engravings that were intended to represent the cardinal virtues under the forms of tawdry female beauties the workmanship was french as were the inscriptions now opportunity knew just enough french to translate these inscriptions simple and schoolgirl as they were as wrong as they could possibly be translated under the circumstances  la vertue cried opportunity in a high decided way as if to make sure of an audience the virtue la solitude pronouncing the last word in a desperately english accent the solitude la charité the charity it is really delightful mary as sarah soothings would say to meet with these glimmerings of taste in this wilderness of the world  i wondered who the deuce sarah soothings could be but afterward learned this was the nomdeguerre of a female contributor to the magazines who i dare say silly as she might be was never silly enough to record the sentiments opportunity had just professed to repeat as for the la charité and the la vertue they did not in the least surprise me for martha the hussy often made herself merry by recording that young ladys tours de force in french on one occasion i remember she wrote me that when opportunity wished to say on est venu me chercher instead of saying i am come for in homely english which would have been the best of all she had flown off in the high flight of je suis venue pour  mary smiled for she comprehended perfectly the difference between la solitude and the solitude but she said nothing i must acknowledge that i was so indiscreet as to smile also though opportunitys back being turned toward us these mutual signs of intelligence that escaped us both through the eyes opened a species of communication that to me at least was infinitely agreeable  opportunity having shown the owner of the strange figure at which she had just glanced on entering the room that she had studied french now turned to take a better look at him i have reason to think my appearance did not make a very happy impression on her for she tossed her head drew a chair seated herself in the manner most opposed to the descent of down and opened her budget of news without the least regard to my presence and apparently with as little attention to the wishes and tastes of her companions her accent and jumping hitching mode of speaking with the high key in which she uttered her sentiments too all grated on my ears which had become a little accustomed to different habits in young ladies in particular in the other hemisphere i confess myself to be one of those who regard an even quiet graceful mode of utterance as even a greater charm in a woman than beauty its effect is more lasting and seems to be directly connected with the character mary warren not only pronounced like one accustomed to good society but the modulations of her voice which was singularly sweet by nature were even and agreeable as is usual with wellbred women and as far as possible from the jerking fluttering now rapid now drawling manner of opportunity perhaps in this age of loose attire loose habits and freeandeasy deportment the speech denotes the gentleman or the lady more accurately than any other offhand test  sen is enough to wear out anybodys patience exclaimed opportunity we must quit troy in half an hour and i have visits that i ought to pay to miss jones and miss white and miss black and miss green and miss brown and three or four others and i cant get him to come near me  why not go alone asked mary quietly it is but a step to two or three of the houses and you cannot possibly lose your way i will go with you if you desire it  oh lose my way no indeed i know it too well for that i wasnt educated in troy not to know something of the streets but it looks so to see a young lady walking in the streets without a beau i never wish to cross a room in company without a beau much less to cross a street no if sen dont come in soon i shall miss seeing every one of my friends and that will be a desperate disappointment to us all but it cant be helped walk without a beau i will not if i never see one of them again  will you accept of me miss opportunity asked mr warren it will afford me pleasure to be of service to you  lord mr warren you dont think of setting up for a beau at your time of life do you everybody would see that youre a clergyman and i might just as well go alone no if sen dont come in at once i must lose my visits and the young ladies will be so put about it i know araminta maria wrote me in the most particular manner never to go through troy without stopping to see her if i didnt see another mortal and katherine clotilda has as much as said she would never forgive me if i passed her door but seneca cares no more for the friendship of young ladies than he doesmiss newcome pronounced this word doos notwithstanding her education as she did been ben and fifty others just as much out of the common waybut seneca cares no more for the friendship of young ladies than he does for the young patroon i declare mr warren i believe sen will go crazy unless the antirenters soon get the best of it he does nothing but think and talk of rents and aristocracy and poodle usages from morning till night  we all smiled at the little mistake of miss opportunity but it was of no great consequence and i dare say she knew what she meant as well as most others who use the same term though they spell it more accurately poodle usages are quite as applicable to anything now existing in america as feudal usages  your brother is then occupied with a matter of the last importance to the community of which he is a member answered the clergyman gravely on the termination of this antirent question hangs in my judgment a vast amount of the future character and much of the future destiny of new york  i wonder now im surprised to hear you say this mr warren for generally youre thought to be unfriendly to the movement sen says however that everything looks well and that he believes the tenants will get their lands throughout the state before theyve done with it he tells me we shall have injins enough this summer at ravensnest the visit of old mrs littlepage has raised a spirit that will not easily be put down he says  and why should the visit of mrs littlepage to the house of her grandson and to the house built by her own husband and in which she passed the happiest days of her life raise a spirit as you call it in any one in that part of the country  oh youre episcopal mr warren and we all know how the episcopals feel about such matters but for my part i dont think the littlepages are a bit better than the newcomes though i wont liken them to some i could name at ravensnest but i dont think they are any better than you yourself and why should they ask so much more of the law than other folks  i am not aware that they do ask more of the law than others and if they do im sure they obtain less the law in this country is virtually administered by jurors who take good care to graduate justice so far as they can by a scale suited to their own opinions and quite often to their prejudices as the last are so universally opposed to persons in mrs littlepages class in life if there be a chance to make her suffer it is pretty certain it will be improved  sen says he cant see why he should pay rent to a littlepage any more than a littlepage should pay rent to him  i am sorry to hear it since there is a very sufficient reason for the former and no reason at all for the latter your brother uses the land of mr littlepage and that is the reason why he should pay him rent if the case were reversed then indeed mr littlepage should pay rent to your brother  but what reason is there that these littlepages should go on from father to son from generation to generation as our landlords when were just as good as they its time there was some change besides only think weve been at the mills now hard upon eighty years grandpa having first settled there and we have had them very mills now for three generations among us  high time therefore opportunity that there should be some change put in mary with a demure smile  oh youre so intimate with marthy littlepage im not surprised at anything you think or say but reason is reason for all that i havent the least grudge in the world against young hugh littlepage if foreign lands havent spoilt him as they say theyre desperate apt to do hes an agreeable young gentleman and i cant say that he used to think himself any better than other folks  i should say none of the family are justly liable to the charge of so doing returned mary  well im amazed to hear you say that mary warren to my taste marthy littlepage is as disagreeable as she can be if the antirent cause had nobody better than she is to oppose it it would soon triumph  may i ask miss newcome what particular reason you have for so thinking asked mr warren who had kept his eye on the young lady the whole time she had been thus running on with an interest that struck me as somewhat exaggerated when one remembered the character of the speaker and the value of her remarks  i think so mr warren because everybody says so was the answer if marthy littlepage dont think herself better than other folks why dont she act like other folks nothing is good enough for her in her own conceit  poor little patt who was the very beau idéal of nature and simplicity as nature and simplicity manifest themselves under the influence of refinement and goodbreeding was here accused of fancying herself better than this ambitious young lady for no other reason than the fact of the little distinctive peculiarities of her air and deportment which opportunity had found utterly unattainable after one or two efforts to compass them in this very fact is the secret of a thousand of the absurdities and vices that are going up and down the land at this moment like raging lions seeking whom they may devour men often turn to their statutebooks and constitution to find the sources of obvious evils that in truth have their origin in some of the lowest passions of human nature the entrance of seneca at that moment however gave a new turn to the discourse though it continued substantially the same i remarked that seneca entered with his hat on and that he kept his head covered during most of the interview that succeeded notwithstanding the presence of the two young ladies and the divine as for myself i had been so free as to remove my cap though many might suppose it was giving myself airs while others would have imagined it was manifesting a degree of respect to human beings that was altogether unworthy of freemen it is getting to be a thing so particular and aristocratic to take off the hat on entering a house that few of the humbler democrats of america now ever think of it  as a matter of course opportunity upbraided her delinquent brother for not appearing sooner to act as her beau after which she permitted him to say a word for himself that seneca was in high goodhumor was easily enough to be seen he even rubbed his hands together in the excess of his delight  something has happened to please sen cried the sister her own mouth on a broad grin in her expectation of coming in for a share of the gratification i wish you would get him to tell us what it is mary hell tell you anything  i cannot describe how harshly this remark grated on my nerves the thought that mary warren could consent to exercise even the most distant influence over such a man as seneca newcome was to the last degree unpleasant to me and i could have wished that she would openly and indignantly repel the notion but mary warren treated the whole matter very much as a person who was accustomed to such remarks would be apt to do i cannot say that she manifested either pleasure or displeasure but a cold indifference was if anything uppermost in her manner possibly i should have been content with this but i found it very difficult to be so seneca however did not wait for miss warren to exert her influence to induce him to talk but appeared well enough disposed to do it of his own accord  something has happened to please me i must own he answered and i would as lief mr warren should know what it is as not things go ahead finely among us antirenters and we shall carry all our pints before long  i wish i were certain no points would be carried but those that ought to be carried mr newcome was the answer but what has happened lately to give a new aspect to the affair  were gaining strength among the politicians both sides are beginning to court us and the spirit of the institutions will shortly make itself respected  i am delighted to hear that it is in the intention of the institutions to repress covetousness and uncharitableness and all frauds and to do nothing but what is right observed mr warren  ah here comes my friend the travelling jeweller said seneca interrupting the clergyman in order to salute my uncle who at that instant showed himself in the door of the room cap in hand walk in mr dafidson since that is your name rev mr warrenmiss mary warrenmiss opportunity newcome my sister who will be glad to look at your wares the cars will be detained on some special business and we have plenty of time before us  all this was done with a coolness and indifference of manner which went to show that seneca had no scruples whatever on the subject of whom he introduced to any one as for my uncle accustomed to these free and easy manners and probably not absolutely conscious of the figure he cut in his disguise he bowed rather too much like a gentleman for one of his present calling though my previous explanation of our own connection and fallen fortunes had luckily prepared the way for this deportment  come in mr dafidson and open your boxmy sister may fancy some of your trinkets i never knew a girl that didnt  the imaginary pedler entered and placed his box on a table near which i was standing the whole party immediately gathering around it my presence had attracted no particular attention from either seneca or his sister the room being public and my connection with the vender of trinkets known in the meantime seneca was too full of his good news to let the subject drop while the watches rings chains brooches bracelets etc were passed under examination  yes mr warren i trust we are about to have a complete development of the spirit of our institutions and that in futur there will be no privileged classes in new york at least  the last will certainly be a great gain sir the divine coldly answered hitherto those who have most suppressed the truth and who have most contributed to the circulation of flattering falsehoods have had undue advantages in america  seneca obviously enough did not like this sentiment but i thought by his manner that he was somewhat accustomed to meeting with such rebuffs from mr warren  i suppose you will admit there are privileged classes now among us mr warren  i am ready enough to allow that sir it is too plain to be denied  waall i should like to hear you pint em out that i might see if we agree in our sentiments  demagogues are a highly privileged class the editors of newspapers are another highly privileged class doing things daily and hourly which set all law and justice at defiance and invading with perfect impunity the most precious rights of their fellowcitizens the power of both is enormous and as in all cases of great and irresponsible power both enormously abuse it  waall thats not my way of thinking at all in my judgment the privileged classes in this country are your patroons and your landlords men thats not satisfied with a reasonable quantity of land but who wish to hold more than the rest of their fellowcreaturs  i am not aware of a single privilege that any patroonof whom by the way there no longer exists one except in nameor any landlord possesses over any one of his fellowcitizens  do you call it no privilege for a man to hold all the land that may happen to be in a township i call that a great privilege and such as no man should have in a free country other people want land as well as your van rensselaers and littlepages and other people mean to have it too  on that principle every man who owns more of any one thing than his neighbor is privileged even i poor as i am and am believed to be am privileged over you mr newcome i own a cassock and have two gowns one old and one new and various other things of the sort of which you have not one what is more i am privileged in another sense since i can wear my cassock and gown and bands and do wear them often whereas you cannot wear one of them at all without making yourself laughed at  oh but them are not privileges i care anything about if i did i would put on the things as the law does not prohibit it  i beg your pardon mr newcome the law does prohibit you from wearing my cassock and gown contrary to my wishes  waall waall mr warren we never shall quarrel about that i dont desire to wear your cassock and gown  i understand you then it is only the things that you desire to use that you deem it a privilege for the law to leave me  i am afraid we shall never agree mr warren about this antirent business and im very sorry for it as i wish particularly to think as you do glancing his eye most profanely toward mary as he spoke i am for the movementprinciple while you are too much for the standstill doctrine  i am certainly for remaining stationary mr newcome if progress mean taking away the property of old and longestablished families in the country to give it to those whose names are not to be found in our history or indeed to give it to any but those to whom it rightfully belongs  we shall never agree my dear sir we shall never agree then turning toward my uncle with the air of superiority that the vulgar so easily assumewhat do you say to all this friend dafidsonare you uprent or downrent  ja mynheer was the quiet answer i always downs mit der rent vens i leave a house or a garten it is goot to pay de debts ja it ist herr goot  this answer caused the clergyman and his daughter to smile while opportunity laughed outright  you wont make much of your dutch friend sen cried this buoyant young lady he says you ought to keep on paying rent  i apprehend mr dafidson does not exactly understand the case answered seneca who was a good deal disconcerted but was bent on maintaining his point i have understood you to say that you are a man of liberal principles mr dafidson and that youve come to america to enjoy the light of intelligence and the benefits of a free government  ja ven i might coome to america i say vell dat tis a goot coontry vhere an honest man might haf vhat he arns ant keep it too ja ja dat ist vhat i say and vhat i dinks  i understand you sir you come from a part of the world where the nobles eat up the fat of the land taking the poor mans share as well as their own to live in a country where the law is or soon will be so equal that no citizen will dare to talk about his estates and hurt the feelins of such as havent got any  my uncle so well affected an innocent perplexity at the drift of this remark as to make me smile in spite of an effort to conceal it mary warren saw that smile and another glance of intelligence was exchanged between us though the young lady immediately withdrew her look a little consciously and with a slight blush  i say that you like equal laws and equal privileges friend dafidson continued seneca with emphasis and that you have seen too much of the evils of nobility and of feudal oppression in the old world to wish to fall in with them in the new  der noples ant der feudal privileges ist no goot answered the trinketpedler shaking his head with an appearance of great distaste  ay i knew it would be so you see mr warren no man who has ever lived under a feudal system can ever feel otherwise  but what have we to do with feudal systems mr newcome and what is there in common between the landlords of new york and the nobles of europe and between their leases and feudal tenures  what is there a vast deal too much sir take my word for it do not our very governors even while ruthlessly calling on one citizen to murder another  nay nay mr newcome interrupted mary warren laughing the governors call on the citizens not to murder each other  i understand you miss mary but we shall make antirenters of you both before we are done surely sir there is a great deal too much resemblance between the nobles of europe and our landlords when the honest and freeborn tenants of the last are obliged to pay tribute for permission to live on the very land that they till and which they cause to bring forth its increase  but men who are not noble let their lands in europe nay the very serfs as they become free and obtain riches buy lands and let them in some parts of the old world as i have heard and read  all feudal sir the whole system is pernicious and feudal serf or no serf  but mr newcome said mary warren quietly though with a sort of demure irony in her manner that said she was not without humor and understood herself very well even you let your landland that you lease too and which you do not own except as you hire it from mr littlepage  seneca gave a hem and was evidently disconcerted but he had too much of the game of the true progressive movementwhich merely means to lead in changes though they may lead to the devilto give the matter up repeating the hem more to clear his brain than to clear his throat he hit upon his answer and brought it out with something very like triumph  that is one of the evils of the present system miss mary did i own the two or three fields you mean and to attend to which i have no leisure i might sell them but now it is impossible since i can give no deed the instant my poor uncle diesand he cant survive a week being as you must know nearly gonethe whole property mills taverns farms timberlot and all fall in to young hugh littlepage who is off frolicking in europe doing no good to himself or others ill venture to say if the truth were known that is another of the hardships of the feudal system it enables one man to travel in idleness wasting his substance in foreign lands while it keeps another at home at the ploughhandles and the carttail  and why do you suppose mr hugh littlepage wastes his substance and is doing himself and country no good in foreign lands mr newcome that is not at all the character i hear of him nor is it the result that i expect to see from his travels  the money he spends in europe might do a vast deal of good at ravensnest sir  for my part my dear sir put in mary again in her quiet but pungent way i think it remarkable that neither of our late governors has seen fit to enumerate the facts just mentioned by mr newcome among those that are opposed to the spirit of the institutions it is indeed a great hardship that mr seneca newcome cannot sell mr hugh littlepages land  i complain less of that cried seneca a little hastily than of the circumstance that all my rights in the property must go with the death of my uncle that at least even you miss mary must admit is a great hardship  if your uncle were unexpectedly to revive and live twenty years mr newcome  no no miss mary answered seneca shaking his head in a melancholy manner that is absolutely impossible it would not surprise me to find him dead and buried on our return  but admit that you may be mistaken and that your lease should continueyou would still have a rent to pay  of that i wouldnt complain in the least if mr dunning littlepages agent will just promise in as much as half a sentence that we can get a new lease on the old terms id not say a syllable about it  well here is one proof that the system has its advantages exclaimed mr warren cheerfully im delighted to hear you say this for it is something to have a class of men among us whose simple promises in a matter of money have so much value it is to be hoped that their example will not be lost  mr newcome has made an admission i am also glad to hear added mary as soon as her father had done speaking his willingness to accept a new lease on the old terms is a proof that he has been living under a good bargain for himself hitherto and that down to the present moment he has been the obliged party  this was very simply said but it bothered seneca amazingly as for myself i was delighted with it and could have kissed the pretty arch creature who had just uttered the remark though i will own that as much might have been done without any great reluctance had she even held her tongue as for seneca he did what most men are apt to do when they have the consciousness of not appearing particularly well in a given point of view he endeavored to present himself to the eyes of his companions in another  there is one thing mr warren that i think you will admit ought not to be he cried exulting whatever miss mary thinks about it and that is that the littlepage pew in your church ought to come down  i will not say that much mr newcome though i rather think my daughter will i believe my dear you are of mr newcomes way of thinking in respect to this canopied pew and also in respect to the old hatchments  i wish neither was in the church answered mary in a low voice  from that moment i was fully resolved neither should be as soon as i got into a situation to control the matter  in that i agree with you entirely my child resumed the clergyman and were it not for this movement connected with the rents and the false principles that have been so boldly announced of late years i might have taken on myself the authority as rector to remove the hatchments even according to the laws connected with the use of such things they should have been taken away a generation or two back as to the pew it is a different matter it is private property was constructed with the church which was built itself by the joint liberality of the littlepages and mother trinity and it would be a most ungracious act to undertake to destroy it under such circumstances and more especially in the absence of its owner  you agree however that it ought not to be there asked seneca with exultation  i wish with all my heart it were not i dislike everything like worldly distinction in the house of god and heraldic emblems in particular seem to be very much out of place where the cross is seen to be in its proper place  waall now mr warren i cant say i much fancy crosses about churches either whats the use in raising vain distinctions of any sort a church is but a house after all and ought so to be regarded  true said mary firmly but the house of god  yes yes we all know miss mary that you episcopalians look more at outward things and more respect outward things than most of the other denominations of the country  do you call leases outward things mr newcome asked mary archly and contracts and bargains and promises and the rights of property and the obligation to do as you would be done by  law good folks cried opportunity who had been all this time tumbling over the trinkets i wish it was down with the rent for ever with all my heart and that not another word might ever be said on the subject here is one of the prettiest pencils mary i ever did see and its price is only four dollars i wish sen youd let the rent alone and make me a present of this very pencil  as this was an act of which seneca had not the least intention of being guilty he merely shifted his hat from one side of his head to the other began to whistle and then he coolly left the room my uncle ro profited by the occasion to beg miss opportunity would do him the honor to accept the pencil as an offering from himself  you ant surely in earnest exclaimed opportunity flushing up with surprise and pleasure why you told me the price was four dollars and even that seems to me desperate little  dat ist de price to anudder said the gallant trinketdealer but dat ist not de price to you miss opportunity ve shall trafel togedder ant vhen ve gets to your coontry you vill dell me de best houses vhere i might go mit my vatches ant drinkets  that i will and get you in at the nest house in the bargain cried opportunity pocketing the pencil without further parley  in the meantime my uncle selected a very neat seal the handsomest he had being of pure metal and having a real topaz in it and offered it to mary warren with his best bow i watched the clergymans daughter with anxiety as i witnessed the progress of this galanterie doubting and hoping at each change of the ingenuous and beautiful countenance of her to whom the offering was made mary colored smiled seemed embarrassed and as i feared for a single moment doubting but i must have been mistaken as she drew back and in the sweetest manner possible declined to accept the present i saw that opportunitys having just adopted a different course added very much to her embarrassment as otherwise she might have said something to lessen the seeming ungraciousness of the refusal luckily for herself however she had a gentleman to deal with instead of one in the station that my uncle ro had voluntarily assumed when this offering was made the pretended pedler was ignorant altogether of the true characters of the clergyman and his daughter not even knowing that he saw the rector of st andrews ravensnest but the manner of mary at once disabused him of an error into which he had fallen through her association with opportunity and he now drew back himself with perfect tact bowing and apologizing in a way that i thought must certainly betray his disguise it did not however for mr warren with a smile that denoted equally satisfaction at his daughters conduct and a grateful sense of the others intended liberality but with a simplicity that was of proof turned to me and begged a tune on the flute which i had drawn from my pocket and was holding in my hand as expecting some such invitation  if i have any accomplishment it is connected with music and particularly with the management of the flute on this occasion i was not at all backward about showing off and i executed two or three airs from the best masters with as much care as if i had been playing to a salon in one of the best quarters of paris i could see that mary and her father were both surprised at the execution and that the first was delighted we had a most agreeable quarter of an hour together and might have had two had not opportunitywho was certainly well named being apropos of everythingbegun of her own accord to sing though not without inviting mary to join her as the latter declined this public exhibition as well as my uncle ros offering senecas sister had it all to herself and she sang no less than three songs in quick succession and altogether unasked i shall not stop to characterize the music or the words of these songs any further than to say they were all more or less of the jim crow school and executed in a way that did them ample justice  as it was understood that we were all to travel in the same train the interview lasted until we were ready to proceed nor did it absolutely terminate then as mary and opportunity sat together mr warren asked me to share his seat regardless of the hurdygurdy though my attire in addition to its being perfectly new and neat was by no means of the mean character that it is usual to see adorning streetmusic in general on the whole so long as the instrument was not en evidence i might not have seemed very much out of place seated at mr warrens side in this manner we proceeded to saratoga my uncle keeping up a private discourse the whole way with seneca on matters connected with the rent movement  as for the divine and myself we had also much interesting talk together i was questioned about europe in general and germany in particular and had reason to think my answers gave surprise as well as satisfaction it was not an easy matter to preserve the doric of my assumed dialect though practice and fear contributed their share to render me content to resort to it i made many mistakes of course but my listeners were not the persons to discover them i say my listeners for i soon ascertained that mary warren who sat on the seat directly before us was a profoundly attentive listener to all that passed this circumstance did not render me the less communicative though it did increase the desire i felt to render what i said worthy of such a listener as for opportunity she read a newspaper a little while munched an apple a very little while and slept the rest of the way but the journey between modern troy and saratoga is not a long one and was soon accomplished     chapter vii                              i will tell you     if youll bestow a small of what you have little     patience a while youll hear the bellys answer                                             menenius agrippa   at the springs we parted mr warren and his friends finding a conveyance with their own horses in readiness to carry them the remainder of the distance as for my uncle and myself it was understood that we were to get on in the best manner we could it being expected that we should reach ravensnest in the course of a day or two according to the theory of our new business we ought to travel on foot but we had a reservation in petto that promised us also the relief of a comfortable wagon of some sort or other  well said my uncle the moment we had got far enough from our new acquaintance to be out of earshot i must say one thing in behalf of mr seneky as he calls himself or sen as his elegant sister calls him and that is that i believe him to be one of the biggest scoundrels the state holds  this is not drawing his character en beau i answered laughing but why do you come out so decidedly upon him at this particular moment  because this particular moment happens to be the first in which i have had an opportunity to say anything since i have known the rascal you must have remarked that the fellow held me in discourse from the time we left troy until we stopped here  certainly i could see that his tongue was in motion unceasingly what he said i have to conjecture  he said enough to lay bare his whole character our subject was antirent which he commenced with a view to explain it to a foreigner but i managed to lead him on step by step until he let me into all his notions and expectations on the subject why hugh the villain actually proposed that you and i should enlist and turn ourselves into two of the rascally mock redskins  enlist do they still persevere so far as to keep up that organization in the very teeth of the late law  the law what do two or three thousand voters care for any penal law in a country like this who is to enforce the law against them did they commit murder and were they even convicted as might happen under the excitement of such a crime they very well know nobody would be hanged honesty is always too passive in matters that do not immediately press on its direct interests it is for the interest of every honest man in the state to set his face against this antirent movement and to do all he can by his vote and influence to put it down into the dirt out of which it sprang and into which it should be crushed but not one in a hundred even of those who condemn it toto coelo will go a foot out of their way even to impede its progress all depends on those who have the power and they will exert that power so as to conciliate the active rogue rather than protect the honest man you are to remember that the laws are executed here on the principle that what is everybodys business is nobodys business  you surely do not believe that the authorities will wink at an open violation of the laws  that will depend on the characters of individuals most will but some will not you and i would be punished soon enough were there a chance but the mass would escape oh we have had some precious disclosures in our corner of the car the two or three men who joined newcome are from antirent districts and seeing me with their friend little reserve has been practised one of those men is an antirent lecturer and being somewhat didactic he favored me with some of his arguments seriatim  how have they got to lectures i should have supposed the newspapers would have been the means of circulating their ideas  oh the newspapers like hogs swimming too freely have cut their own throats and it seems to be fashionable just at this moment not to believe them lecturing is the great moral lever of the nation at present  but a man can lie in a lecture as well as in a newspaper  out of all question and if many of the lecturers are of the school of this mr holmeslecturer holmes as seneca called himbut if many are of his school a pretty set of libertytakers with the truth must they be  you detected him then in some of these liberties  in a hundred nothing was easier than for a man in my situation to do that knowing as i did so much of the history of the landtitles of the state one of his arguments partakes so largely of the weak side of our system that i must give it to you he spoke of the gravity of the disturbancesof the importance to the peace and character of the state of putting an end to them and then by way of corollary to his proposition produced a scheme for changing the titles in order to satisfy the people  the people of course meaning the tenants the landlords and their rights passing for nothing  that is one beautiful feature of the moralityan eye or a cheek if you willbut here is the nose and highly roman it is a certain portion of the community wish to get rid of the obligations of their contracts and finding it cannot be done by law they resort to means that are opposed to all law in order to effect their purposes public lawbreakers violators of the public peace they make use of their own wrong as an argument for perpetuating another that can be perpetuated in no other way i have been looking over some of the papers containing proclamations etc and find that both lawmakers and lawbreakers are of one mind as to this charming policy without a single manly effort to put down the atrocious wrong that is meditated the existence of the wrong itself is made an argument for meeting it with concessions and thus sustaining it instead of using the means the institutions have provided for putting down all such unjust and illegal combinations the combinations are a sufficient reason of themselves why the laws should be altered and wrong be done to a few in order that many may be propitiated and their votes secured  this is reasoning that can be used only where real grievances exist but there are no real grievances in the case of the tenants they may mystify weak heads in the instance of the manor leases with their quartersales fat hens loads of wood and days works but my leases are all on three lives with rent payable in money and with none of the conditions that are called feudal though no more feudal than any other bargain to pay articles in kind one might just as well call a bargain made by a butcher to deliver pork for a series of years feudal however feudal or not my leases and those of most other landlords are running on lives and yet by what i can learn the discontent is general and the men who have solemnly bargained to give up their farms at the expiration of their lives are just as warm for the down rent and titles in fee as the manor tenants themselves they say that the obligations given for actual purchases are beginning to be discredited  you are quite right and there is one of the frauds practised on the world at large in the public documents only the manor leases with their pretended feudal covenants and their perpetuity are kept in view while the combination goes to all leases or nearly all and certainly to all sorts of leases where the estates are of sufficient extent to allow of the tenants to make head against the landlords i dare say there are hundreds of tenants even on the property of the rensselaers who are honest enough to be willing to comply with their contracts if the conspirators would let them but the rapacious spirit is abroad among the occupants of other lands as well as among the occupants of theirs and the government considers its existence a proof that concessions should be made the discontented must be appeased right or not  did seneca say anything on the subject of his own interests  he did not so much in conversation with me as in the discourse he held with lecturer holmes i listened attentively happening to be familiar through tradition and through personal knowledge with all the leading facts of the case as you will soon be called on to act in that matter for yourself i may as well relate them to you they will serve also as guides to the moral merits of the occupation of half the farms on your estate these are things moreover you would never know by public statements since all the good bargains are smothered in silence while those that may possibly have been a little unfavorable to the tenant are proclaimed far and near it is quite possible that among the many thousands of leased farms that are to be found in the state some bad bargains may have been made by the tenants but what sort of a government is that which should undertake to redress evils of this nature if either of the rensselaers or you yourself were to venture to send a memorial to the legislature setting forth the grievances you labor under in connection with this very milllotand serious losses do they bring to you let me tell you though grievances in the proper sense of the term they are notyou and your memorial would be met with a general and merited shout of ridicule and derision one man has no rights as opposed to a dozen  so much difference is there between de la rochefoucauld et de la rochefoucauld  all the difference in the world but let me give you the facts for they will serve as a rule by which to judge of many others in the first place my greatgrandfather mordaunt the patentee as he was called first let the milllot to the grandfather of this seneca the tenant then being quite a young man in order to obtain settlers in that early day it was necessary to give them great advantages for there was vastly more land than there were people to work it the first lease therefore was granted on highly advantageous terms to that jason newcome whom i can just remember he had two characters the one and the true which set him down as a covetous envious narrowminded provincial who was full of cant and roguery some traditions exist among us of his having been detected in stealing timber and in various other frauds in public he is one of those virtuous and hardworking pioneers who have transmitted to their descendants all their claims those that are supposed to be moral as well as those that are known to be legal this flummery may do for elderly ladies who affect snuff and bohea and for some men who have minds of the same calibre but they are not circumstances to influence such legislators and executives as are fit to be legislators and executives not a great while before my fathers marriage the said jason still living and in possession the lease expired and a new one was granted for three lives or twentyone years certain of which one of the lives is still running that lease was granted on terms highly favorable to the tenant sixty years since old newcome luckily for himself and his posterity having named this longlived son as one of his three lives now seneky god bless him is known to lease a few of the lots that have fallen to his share of the property for more money than is required to meet all your rent on the whole such in effect has been the fact with that milllot for the last thirty years or even longer and the circumstance of the great length of time so excellent a bargain has existed is used as an argument why the newcomes ought to have a deed of the property for a nominal price or indeed for no price at all if the tenants could have their wishes  i am afraid there is nothing unnatural in thus perverting principles half mankind appear to me really to get a great many of their notions dessus dessous  half is a small proportion as you will find my boy when you grow older but was it not an impudent proposal of seneca when he wished you and me to join the corps of injins  what answer did you make though i suppose it would hardly do for us to go disguised and armed now that the law makes it a felony even while our motive at the bottom might be to aid the law  catch me at that act of folly why hugh could they prove such a crime on either of us or any one connected with an old landed family we should be the certain victims no governor would dare pardon us no no clemency is a word reserved for the obvious and confirmed rogues  we might get a little favor on the score of belonging to a very powerful body of offenders  true i forgot that circumstance the more numerous the crimes and the criminals the greater the probability of impunity and this too not on the general principle that power cannot be resisted but on the particular principle that a thousand or two votes are of vast importance where three thousand can turn an election god only knows where this thing is to end  we now approached one of the humbler taverns of the place where it was necessary for those of our apparent pretensions to seek lodgings and the discourse was dropped it was several weeks too early in the season for the springs to be frequented and we found only a few of those in the place who drank the waters because they really required them my uncle had been an old stager at saratogaa beau of the purest water as he laughingly described himselfand he was enabled to explain all that was necessary for me to know an american wateringplace however is so very much inferior to most of those in europe as to furnish very little in their best moments beyond the human beings they contain to attract the attention of the traveller  in the course of the afternoon we availed ourselves of the opportunity of a return vehicle to go as far as sandy hill where we passed the night the next morning bright and early we got into a hired wagon and drove across the country until near night when we paid for our passage sent the vehicle back and sought a tavern at this house where we passed the night we heard a good deal of the injins having made their appearance on the littlepage lands and many conjectures as to the probable result we were in a township or rather on a property that was called mooseridge and which had once belonged to us but which having been sold and in a great measure paid for by the occupants no one thought of impairing the force of the covenants under which the parties held the most trivial observer will soon discover that it is only when something is to be gained that the aggrieved citizen wishes to disturb a covenant now i never heard anyone say a syllable against either of the covenants of his lease under which he held his farm let him be ever so loud against those which would shortly compel him to give it up had i complained of the factand such facts aboundedthat my predecessors had incautiously let farms at such low prices that the lessees had been enabled to pay the rents for half a century by subletting small portions of them as my uncle ro had intimated i should be pointed at as a fool stick to your bond would have been the cry and shylock would have been forgotten i do not say that there is not a vast difference between the means of acquiring intelligence the cultivation the manners the social conditions and in some senses the social obligations of an affluent landlord and a really hardworking honest wellintentioned husbandman his tenantdifferences that should dispose the liberal and cultivated gentleman to bear in mind the advantages he has perhaps inherited and not acquired by his own means in such a way as to render him in a certain degree the repository of the interests of those who hold him but while i admit all this and say that the community which does not possess such a class of men is to be pitied as it loses one of the most certain means of liberalizing and enlarging its notions and of improving its civilization i am far from thinking that the men of this class are to have their real superiority of position with its consequences thrown into their faces only when they are expected to give while they are grudgingly denied it on all other occasions there is nothing so likely to advance the habits opinions and true interests of a rural population as to have them all directed by the intelligence and combined interests that ought to mark the connection between landlord and tenant it may do for one class of political economists to prate about a state of things which supposes every husbandman a freeholder and rich enough to maintain his level among the other freeholders of the state but we all know that as many minute gradations in means must and do exist in a community as there exist gradations in characters a majority soon will in the nature of things be below the level of the freeholder and by destroying the system of having landlords and tenants two great evils are createdthe one preventing men of large fortunes from investing in lands as no man will place his money where it will be insecure or profitless thereby cutting off real estate generally from the benefits that might be and would be conferred by their capital as well as cutting it off from the benefits of the increased price which arise from having such buyers in the market and the other is to prevent any man from being a husbandman who has not the money necessary to purchase a farm but they who want farms now and they who will want votes next november do not look quite so far ahead as that while shouting equal rights they are in fact for preventing the poor husbandman from being anything but a daylaborer  we obtained tolerably decent lodging at our inn though the profoundest patriot america possesses if he know anything of other countries or of the best materials of his own cannot say much in favor of the sleeping arrangements of an ordinary country inn the same money and the same trouble would render that which is now the very beau ideal of discomfort at least tolerable and in many instances good but who is to produce this reform according to the opinions circulated among us the humblest hamlet we have has already attained the highest point of civilization and as for the people without distinction of classes it is universally admitted that they are the best educated the acutest and the most intelligent in christendomno i must correct myself they are all this except when they are in the act of leasing lands and then the innocent and illiterate husbandmen are the victims of the arts of designing landlords the wretches21  footnote 21 mr hugh littlepage writes a little sharply but there is truth in all he says at the bottom his tone is probably produced by the fact that there is so serious an attempt to deprive him of his old paternal estate an attempt which is receiving support in high quarters in addition to this provocation the littlepages as the manuscript shows farther on are traduced as one means of effecting the objects of the antirenters no man in any community in which it is necessary to work on public sentiment in order to accomplish such a purpose ever being wronged without being calumniated as respects the inns truth compels me as an old traveller to say that mr littlepage has much reason for what he says i have met with a better bed in the lowest french tavern i ever was compelled to use and in one instance i slept in an inn frequented by carters than in the best purely country inn in america in the way of neatness however more is usually to be found in our new york village taverns than in the public hotels of paris itself as for the hit touching the intelligence of the people it is merited for i have myself heard subtle distinctions drawn to show that the people of a former generation were not as knowing as the people of this and imputing the covenants of the older leases to that circumstance instead of imputing them to their true cause the opinions and practices of the times half a centurys experience would induce me to say that the people were never particularly dull in making a bargaineditor  we passed an hour on the piazza after eating our supper and there being a collection of men assembled there inhabitants of the hamlet we had an opportunity to get into communication with them my uncle sold a watch and i played on the hurdygurdy by way of making myself popular after this beginning the discourse turned on the engrossing subject of the day antirentism the principal speaker was a young man about sixandtwenty of a sort of shabbygenteel air and appearance whom i soon discovered to be the attorney of the neighborhood his name was hubbard while that of the other principal speaker was hall the last was a mechanic as i ascertained and was a plainlooking workingman of middle age each of these persons seated himself on a common kitchen chair leaning back against the side of the house and of course resting on the two hindlegs of the rickety support while he placed his own feet on the rounds in front the attitudes were neither graceful nor picturesque but they were so entirely common as to excite no surprise as for hall he appeared perfectly contented with his situation after fidgeting a little to get the two supporting legs of his chair just where he wanted them but hubbards eye was restless uneasy and even menacing for more than a minute he drew a knife from his pocketa small neat penknife only it is truegazed a little wildly about him and just as i thought he intended to abandon his nicely poised chair and to make an assault on one of the pillars that upheld the roof of the piazza the innkeeper advanced holding in his hand several narrow slips of pine board one of which he offered at once to squire hubbard this relieved the attorney who took the wood and was soon deeply plunged in to me the unknown delights of whittling i cannot explain the mysterious pleasure that so many find in whittling though the prevalence of the custom is so well known but i cannot explain the pleasure so many find in chewing tobacco or in smoking the precaution of the landlord was far from being unnecessary and appeared to be taken in good part by all to whom he offered whittlingpieces some six or eight in the whole the state of the piazza indeed proved that the precaution was absolutely indispensable if he did not wish to see the house come tumbling down about his head in order that those who have never seen such things may understand their use i will go a little out of the way to explain  the inn was of wood a hemlock frame with a siding of clapboards in this there was nothing remarkable many countries of europe even still building principally of wood houses of lath and plaster were quite common until within a few years even in large towns i remember to have seen some of these constructions while in london in close connection with the justly celebrated westminster hall and of such materials is the muchtalked of miniature castle of horace walpole at strawberry hill but the inn of mooseridge had some pretensions to architecture besides being three or four times larger than any other house in the place a piazza it enjoyed of course it must be a pitiful village inn that does not and building accessories and all rejoiced in several coats of a spurious white lead the columns of this piazza as well as the clapboards of the house itself however exhibited the proofs of the danger of abandoning your true whittler to his own instincts spreadeagles fivepoints american flags huzzas for polk the initials of names and names at full length with various other similar conceits records and ebullitions of patriotic or partyotic feelings were scattered up and down with an affluence that said volumes in favor of the mint in which they had been coined but the most remarkable memorial of the industry of the guests was to be found on one of the columns and it was one at a corner too and consequently of double importance to the superstructureunless indeed the house were built on that wellknown principle of american architecture of the last century which made the architrave uphold the pillar instead of the pillar the architrave the column in question was of white pine as usualthough latterly in brick edifices bricks and stucco are much resorted toand at a convenient height for the whittlers it was literally cut twothirds in two the gash was very neatly madethat much must be said for itindicating skill and attention and the surfaces of the wound were smoothed in a manner to prove that appearances were not neglected  vat do das i asked of the landlord pointing to this gaping wound in the main column of his piazza  that oh thats only the whittlers answered the host with a goodnatured smile  assuredly the americans are the bestnatured people on earth here was a man whose house was nearly tumbling down about his earsalways bating the principle in architecture just namedand he could smile as nero may be supposed to have done when fiddling over the conflagration of rome  but vhy might de vhittler vhittle down your house  oh this is a free country you know and folks do pretty much as they like in it returned the still smiling host i let em cut away as long as i dared but it was high time to get out whittlingpieces i believe you must own its best always to keep a ruff roof over a mans head to be ready for bad weather a week longer would have had the column in two  vell i dinks i might not bear dat vhat ist mein house ist mein house ant dey shall not so moch vittles  by letting em so much vittles there they so much vittles in the kitchen so you see there is policy in having your underpinnin knocked away sometimes if its done by the right sort of folks  youre a stranger in these parts friend observed hubbard complacently for by this time his whittlingpiece was reduced to a shape and he could go on reducing it according to some law of the art of whittling with which i am not acquainted we are not so particular in such matters as in some of your countries in the old world  jadas i can see but does not woot ant column cost money in america someding  to be sure it does there is not a man in the country who would undertake to replace that pillar with a new one paint and all for less than ten dollars  this was an opening for a discussion on the probable cost of putting a new pillar into the place of the one that was injured opinions differed and quite a dozen spoke on the subject some placing the expense as high as fifteen dollars and others bringing it down as low as five i was struck with the quiet and selfpossession with which each man delivered his opinion as well as with the language used the accent was uniformly provincial that of hubbard included having a strong and unpleasant taint of the dialect of new england in it and some of the expressions savored a little of the stilts of the newspapers but on the whole the language was sufficiently accurate and surprisingly good considering the class in life of the speakers the conjectures too manifested great shrewdness and familiarity with practical things as well as in a few instances some reading hall however actually surprised me he spoke with a precision and knowledge of mechanics that would have done credit to a scholar and with a simplicity that added to the influence of what he said some casual remark induced me to put invell i might spose an injin voult cut so das column but i might not spose a vhite man could this opinion gave the discourse a direction toward antirentism and in a few minutes it caught all the attention of my uncle ro and myself  this business is going ahead after all observed hubbard evasively after others had had their say  mores the pity put in hall it might have been put an end to in a month at any time and ought to be put an end to in a civilized land  you will own neighbor hall notwithstanding it would be a great improvement in the condition of the tenants all over the state could they change their tenures into freeholds  no doubt twould and so it would be a great improvement in the condition of my journeyman in my shop if he could get to be the boss but that is not the question here the question is what right has the state to say any man shall sell his property unless he wishes to sell it a pretty sort of liberty we should have if we all held our houses and gardens under such laws as that supposes  but do we not all hold our houses and gardens and farms too by some such law rejoined the attorney who evidently respected his antagonist and advanced his own opinions cautiously if the public wants land to use it can take it by paying for it  yes to use but use is everything ive read that old report of the committee of the house and dont subscribe to its doctrines at all public policy in that sense doesnt at all mean public use if land is wanted for a road or a fort or a canal it must be taken under a law by appraisement or the thing could not be had at all but to pretend because one side to a contract wishes to alter it that the state has a right to interfere on the ground that the discontented can be bought off in this way easier and cheaper than they can be made to obey the laws is but a poor way of supporting the right the same principle carried out might prove it would be easier to buy off pickpockets by compromising than to punish them or it would be easy to get round all sorts of contracts in this way  but all governments use this power when it becomes necessary neighbor hall  that word necessary covers a great deal of ground squire hubbard the most that can be made of the necessity here is to say it is cheaper and may help along parties to their objects better no man doubts that the state of new york can put down these antirenters and i trust will put them down so far as force is concerned there is then no other necessity in the case to begin with than the necessity which demagogues always feel of getting as many votes as they can  after all neighbor hall these votes are pretty powerful weapons in a popular government  ill not deny that and now they talk of a convention to alter the constitution it is a favorable moment to teach such managers they shall not abuse the right of suffrage in this way  how is it to be prevented you are a universal suffrage man i know  yes im for universal suffrage among honest folks but do not wish to have my rulers chosen by them that are never satisfied without having their hands in their neighbors pockets let em put a clause into the constitution providing that no town or village or county shall hold a poll within a given time after the execution of process has been openly resisted in it that would take the conceit out of all such lawbreakers in very short order  it was plain that this idea struck the listeners and several even avowed their approbation of the scheme aloud hubbard received it as a new thought but was more reluctant to admit its practicability as might be expected from a lawyer accustomed to practice in a small way his objections savored more of narrow views than of the notions of a statesman  how would you determine the extent of the district to be disfranchised he asked  take the legal limits as they stand if process be resisted openly by a combination strong enough to look down the agents of the law in a town disfranchise that town for a given period if in more than one town disfranchise the offending towns if a county disfranchise the whole county  but in that way you would punish the innocent with the guilty  it would be for the good of all besides you punish the innocent for the guilty or with the guilty rather in a thousand ways you and i are taxed to keep drunkards from starving because it is better to do that than to offend humanity by seeing men die of hunger or tempting them to steal when you declare martial law you punish the innocent with the guilty in one sense and so you do in a hundred cases all we have to ask is if it be not wiser and better to disarm demagogues and those disturbers of the public peace who wish to pervert their right of suffrage to so wicked an end by so simple a process than to suffer them to effect their purposes by the most flagrant abuse of their political privileges  how would you determine when a town should lose the right of voting  by evidence given in open court the judges would be the proper authority to decide in such a case and they would decide beyond all question nineteen times in twenty right it is the interest of every man who is desirous of exercising the suffrage on right principles to give him some such protection against them that wish to exercise the suffrage on wrong a peaceofficer can call on the posse comitatus or on the people to aid him if enough appear to put down the rebels well and good but if enough do not appear let it be taken as proof that the district is not worthy of giving the votes of freemen they who abuse such a liberty as man enjoys in this country are the least entitled to our sympathies as for the mode that could easily be determined as soon as you settle the principle  the discourse went on for an hour neighbor hall giving his opinions still more at large i listened equally with pleasure and surprise these then after all i said to myself are the real bone and sinew of the country there are tens of thousands of this sort of men in the state and why should they be domineered over and made to submit to a legislation and to practices that are so often without principle by the agents of the worst part of the community will the honest forever be so passive while the corrupt and dishonest continue so active on my mentioning these notions to my uncle he answered  yes it ever has been so and i fear ever will be so there is the curse of this country pointing to a table covered with newspapers the invariable companion of an american inn of any size so long as men believe what they find there they can be nothing but dupes or knaves  but there is good in newspapers  that adds to the curse if they were nothing but lies the world would soon reject them but how few are able to separate the true from the false now how few of these pages speak the truth about this very antirentism occasionally an honest man in the corps does come out but where one does this ten affect to think what they do not believe in order to secure votesvotes votes votes in that simple word lies all the mystery of the matter  jefferson said if he were to choose between a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government he would take the last  ay jefferson did not mean newspapers as they are now i am old enough to see the change that has taken place in his day three or four fairly convicted lies would damn any editor now there are men that stand up under a thousand ill tell you what hugh this country is jogging on under two of the most antagonist systems possiblechristianity and the newspapers the first is daily hammering into every man that he is a miserable frail goodfornothing being while the last is eternally proclaiming the perfection of the people and the virtues of selfgovernment  perhaps too much stress ought not to be laid on either  the first is certainly true under limitations that we all understand but as to the last i will own i want more evidence than a newspaper eulogy to believe it  after all my uncle ro is sometimes mistaken though candor compels me to acknowledge that he is very often right     chapter viii                  i see thee still     remembrance faithful to her trust     calls thee in beauty from the dust     thou comest in the morning light     thourt with me through the gloomy night     in dreams i meet thee as of old     then thy soft arms my neck enfold     and thy sweet voice is in my ear     in every sense to memory dear                 i see thee stillsprague   it was just ten in the morning of the succeeding day when my uncle ro and myself came in sight of the old house at the nest i call it old for a dwelling that has stood more than half a century acquires a touch of the venerable in a country like america to me it was truly old the building having stood there where i then saw it for a period more than twice as long as that of my own existence and was associated with all my early ideas from childhood i had regarded that place as my future home as it had been the home of my parents and grandparents and in one sense of those who had gone before them for two generations more the whole of the land in sightthe rich bottoms then waving with grassthe sidehills the woods the distant mountainsthe orchards dwellings barns and all the other accessories of rural life that appertained to the soil were mine and had thus become without a single act of injustice to any human being so far as i knew and believed even the red man had been fairly bought by herman mordaunt the patentee and so susquesus the redskin of ravensnest as our old onondago was often called had ever admitted the fact to be it was natural that i should love an estate thus inherited and thus situated no civilized man no man indeed savage or not had ever been the owner of those broad acres but those who were of my own blood this is what few besides americans can say and when it can be said truly in parts of the country where the arts of life have spread and amid the blessings of civilization it becomes the foundation of a sentiment so profound that i do not wonder those adventurerserrant who are flying about the face of the country thrusting their hands into every mans mess have not been able to find it among their other superficial discoveries nothing can be less like the ordinary cravings of avarice than the feeling that is thus engendered and i am certain that the general tendency of such an influence is to elevate the feelings of him who experiences it  and there were men among us high in political stationhigh as such men ever can get for the consequence of having such men in power is to draw down station itself nearer to their own natural levelbut men in power had actually laid down propositions in political economy which if carried out would cause me to sell all that estate reserving perhaps a single farm for my own use and reinvest the money in such a way as that the interest i obtained might equal my present income it is true this theory was not directly applied to me as my farms were to fall in by the covenants of their leases but it had been directly applied to stephen and william van rensselaer and by implication to others and my turn might come next what business had the rensselaers or the livingstons or the hunters or the littlepages or the morgans or the verplancks or the wadsworths or five hundred others similarly placed to entertain sentiments that interfered with business or that interfered with the wishes of any straggling yankee who had found his way out of new england and wanted a particular farm on his own terms it is aristocratic to put sentiment in opposition to trade and trade itself is not to be trade any longer than all the profit is to be found on the side of numbers even the principles of holy trade are to be governed by majorities  even my uncle ro who never owned a foot of the property could not look at it without emotion he too had been born therehad passed his childhood thereand loved the spot without a particle of the grovelling feeling of avarice he took pleasure in remembering that our race had been the only owners of the soil on which he stood and had that very justifiable pride which belongs to enduring respectability and social station  well hugh he cried after both of us had stood gazing at the gray walls of the good and substantial but certainly not very beautiful dwelling here we are and we now may determine on what is next to be done shall we march down to the village which is four miles distant you will remember and get our breakfasts there shall we try one of your tenants or shall we plunge at once in medias res and ask hospitality of my mother and your sister  the last might excite suspicion i fear sir tar and feathers would be our mildest fate did we fall into the hands of the injins  injins why not go at once to the wigwam of susquesus and get out of him and yop the history of the state of things i heard them speaking of the onondago at our tavern last night and while they said he was generally thought to be much more than a hundred that he was still like a man of eighty that indian is full of observation and may let us into some of the secrets of his brethren  they can at least give us the news from the family and though it might seem in the course of things for pedlers to visit the nest house it will be just as much so for them to halt at the wigwam  this consideration decided the matter and away we went toward the ravine or glen on the side of which stood the primitivelooking hut that went by the name of the wigwam the house was a small cabin of logs neat and warm or cool as the season demanded as it was kept up and was whitewashed and occasionally furnished anew by the landlordthe odious creature he who paid for so many similar things in the neighborhoodit was never unfit to be seen though never of a very alluring cottagelike character there was a garden and it had been properly made that very season the negro picking and pecking about it during the summer in a way to coax the vegetables and fruits on a little though i well knew that the regular weedings came from an assistant at the nest who was ordered to give it an eye and an occasional halfday on one side of the hut there was a hogpen and a small stable for a cow but on the other the trees of the virgin forest which had never been disturbed in that glen overshadowed the roof this somewhat poetical arrangement was actually the consequence of a compromise between the tenants of the cabin the negro insisting on the accessories of his rude civilization while the indian required the shades of the woods to reconcile him to his position here had these two singularly associated beingsthe one deriving his descent from the debased races of africa and the other from the fierce but loftyminded aboriginal inhabitant of this continentdwelt for nearly the whole period of an ordinary human life the cabin itself began to look really ancient while those who dwelt in it had little altered within the memory of man such instances of longevity whatever theorists may say on the subject are not unfrequent among either the blacks or the natives though probably less so among the last than among the first and still less so among the first of the northern than of the southern sections of the republic it is common to say that the great age so often attributed to the people of these two races is owing to ignorance of the periods of their births and that they do not live longer than the whites this may be true in the main for a white man is known to have died at no great distance from ravensnest within the last fiveandtwenty years who numbered more than his sixscore of years but aged negroes and aged indians are nevertheless so common when the smallness of their whole numbers is remembered as to render the fact apparent to most of those who have seen much of their respective people  there was no highway in the vicinity of the wigwam for so the cabin was generally called though wigwam in the strict meaning of the word it was not as the little building stood in the grounds of the nest house which contain two hundred acres a bit of virgin forest included and exclusively of the fields that belonged to the adjacent farm it was approached only by footpaths of which several led to and from it and by one narrow winding carriageroad which in passing for miles through the grounds had been led near the hut in order to enable my grandmother and sister and i dare say my dear departed mother while she lived to make their calls in their frequent airings by this sweeping road we approached the cabin  there are the two old fellows sunning themselves this fine day exclaimed my uncle with something like a tremor in his voice as we drew near enough to the hut to distinguish objects hugh i never see these men without a feeling of awe as well as of affection they were the friends and one was the slave of my grandfather and as long as i can remember have they been aged men they seem to be set up here as monuments of the past to connect the generations that are gone with those that are to come  if so sir they will soon be all there is of their sort it really seems to me that if things continue much longer in their present direction men will begin to grow jealous and envious of history itself because its actors have left descendants to participate in any little credit they may have gained  beyond all contradiction boy there is a strange perversion of the old and natural sentiments on this head among us but you must bear in mind the fact that of the two millions and a half the state contains not half a million probably possess any of the true york blood and can consequently feel any of the sentiments connected with the birthplace and the older traditions of the very society in which they live a great deal must be attributed to the facts of our condition though i admit those facts need not and ought not to unsettle principles but look at those two old fellows there they are true to the feelings and habits of their races even after passing so long a time together in this hut there squats susquesus on a stone idle and disdaining work with his rifle leaning against the appletree while jaafor yop as i believe it is better to call himis pecking about in the garden still a slave at his work in fancy at least  and which is the happiest sirthe industrious old man or the idler  probably each finds most happiness in indulging his own early habits the onondago never would work however and i have heard my father say great was his happiness when he found he was to pass the remainder of his day in otium cum dignitate and without the necessity of making baskets  yop is looking at us had we not better go up at once and speak to them  yop may stare the most openly but my life on it the indian sees twice as much his faculties are the best to begin with and he is a man of extraordinary and characteristic observation in his best days nothing ever escaped him as you say we will approach  my uncle and myself then consulted on the expediency of using broken english with these two old men of which at first we saw no necessity but when we remembered that others might join us and that our communication with the two might be frequent for the next few days we changed our minds and determined rigidly to observe our incognitos  as we came up to the door of the hut jaaf slowly left his little garden and joined the indian who remained immovable and unmoved on the stone which served him for a seat we could see but little change in either during the five years of our absence each being a perfect picture in his way of extreme but not decrepit old age in the men of his race of the two the blackif black he could now be called his color being a muddy graywas the most altered though that seemed scarcely possible when i saw him last as for the trackless or susquesus as he was commonly called his temperance throughout a long life did him good service and his halfnaked limbs and skeletonlike body for he wore the summerdress of his people appeared to be made of a leather long steeped in a tannin of the purest quality his sinews too though much stiffened seemed yet to be of whipcord and his whole frame a species of indurated mummy that retained its vitality the color of the skin was less red than formerly and more closely approached to that of the negro as the latter now was though perceptibly different  sagosago cried my uncle as we came quite near seeing no risk in using that familiar semiindian salutation22 sago sago dis charmin mornin in my tongue dat might be guten tag  footnote 22 the editor has often had occasion to explain the meaning of terms of this nature the colonists caught a great many words from the indians they first knew and used them to all other indians though not belonging to their language and these other tribes using them as english a sort of limited lingua franca has grown up in the country that everybody understands it is believed that moccason squaw pappoose sago tomahawk wigwam etc etc all belong to this class of words there can be little doubt that the sobriquet of yankees is derived from yengees the manner in which the tribes nearest to new england pronounced the word english it is to this hour a provincialism of that part of the country to pronounce this word english instead of inglish its conventional sound the change from english to yengees is very triflingeditor  sago returned the trackless in his deep guttural voice while old yop brought two lips together that resembled thick pieces of overdone beefsteak fastened his redencircled gummy eyes on each of us in turn pouted once more working his jaws as if proud of the excellent teeth they still held and said nothing as the slave of a littlepage he held pedlers as inferior beings for the ancient negroes of new york ever identified themselves more or less with the families to which they belonged and in which they so often were born sago repeated the indian slowly courteously and with emphasis after he had looked a moment longer at my uncle as if he saw something about him to command respect  dis ist charmin day frients said uncle ro placing himself coolly on a log of wood that had been hauled for the stove and wiping his brow vat might you calls dis coontry  dis here answered yop not without a little contempt dis is york colony where you come from to ask sich a question  charmany dat ist far off but a goot country ant dis ist goot country too  why you leab him den if he be good country eh  vhy you leaf africa canst you dell me dat retorted uncle ro somewhat coolly  nebber was dere growled old yop bringing his blubber lips together somewhat in the manner the boar works his jaws when it is prudent to get out of his way im yorknigger born and nebber seen no africa and nebber want to see him nudder  it is scarcely necessary to say that jaaf belonged to a school by which the term of colored gentleman was never used the men of his time and stamp called themselves niggers and ladies and gentlemen of that age took them at their word and called them niggers too a word that no one of the race ever uses now except in the way of reproach and which by one of the singular workings of our very wayward and common nature he is more apt to use than any other when reproach is intended  my uncle paused a moment to reflect before he continued a discourse that had not appeared to commence under very flattering auspices  who might lif in dat big stone house asked uncle ro as soon as he thought the negro had had time to cool a little  anybody can see you no yorker by dat werry speech answered yop not at all mollified by such a question who should lib dere but ginral littlepage  vell i dought he wast dead long ago  what if he be it is his house and he lib in it and ole young missus lib dere too  now there had been three generations of generals among the littlepages counting from father to son first there had been brigadiergeneral evans littlepage who held that rank in the militia and died in service during the revolution the next was brigadiergeneral cornelius littlepage who got his rank by brevet at the close of the same war in which he had actually figured as a colonel of the new york line third and last was my own grandfather majorgeneral mordaunt littlepage he had been a captain in his fathers regiment at the close of the same struggle got the brevet of major at its termination and rose to be a majorgeneral of the militia the station he held for many years before he died as soon as the privates had the power to elect their own officers the position of a majorgeneral in the militia ceased to be respectable and few gentlemen could be induced to serve as might have been foreseen the militia itself fell into general contempt where it now is and where it will ever remain until a different class of officers shall be chosen the people can do a great deal no doubt but they cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear as soon as officers from the old classes shall be appointed the militia will come up for in no interest in life is it so material to have men of certain habits and notions and education in authority as in those connected with the military service a great many fine speeches may be made and much patriotic eulogy expended on the intrinsic virtue and intelligence of the people and divers projects entertained to make citizensoldiers as they are called but citizens never can be and never will be turned into soldiers at all good or bad until proper officers are placed over them to return to yop  bray vhat might be de age of das laty dat you callet olt young missus asked my uncle  gosh she nutten but galborn some time just ater old french war remember her well nough when she miss dus malbone young masser

nebber so lucky as hab a good master niggers gettin scarce dey tells me nowadays in dis world  injins too i dinks dere ist no more redskins might be blenty  the manner in which the onondago raised his figure and the look he fastened on my uncle were both fine and startling as yet he had said nothing beyond the salutation but i could see he now intended to speak  new tribe he said after regarding us for half a minute intently what you call himwhere he come from  ja jadas ist der antirent redskins haf you seen em trackless  sartain come to see meface in bagbehave like squaw poor injinpoor warrior  yees i believe dat ist true enough i cant bear soch injinmight not be soch injin in the world vhat you call em eh  susquesus shook his head slowly and with dignity then he gazed intently at my uncle after which he fastened his eyes in a similar manner on me in this manner his looks turned from one to the other for some little time when he again dropped them to the earth calmly and in silence i took out the hurdygurdy and began to play a lively airone that was very popular among the american blacks and which i am sorry to say is getting to be not less so among the whites no visible effect was produced on susquesus unless a slight shade of contempt was visible on his dark features with jaaf however it was very different old as he was i could see a certain nervous twitching of the lower limbs which indicated that the old fellow actually felt some disposition to dance it soon passed away though his grim hard wrinkled duskygray countenance continued to gleam with a sort of dull pleasure for some time there was nothing surprising in this the indifference of the indian to melody being almost as marked as the negros sensitiveness to its power  it was not to be expected that men so aged would be disposed to talk much the onondago had ever been a silent man dignity and gravity of character uniting with prudence to render him so but jaaf was constitutionally garrulous though length of days had necessarily much diminished the propensity at that moment a fit of thoughtful and melancholy silence came over my uncle too and all four of us continued brooding on our own reflections for two or three minutes after i had ceased to play presently the even smooth approach of carriagewheels was heard and a light summer vehicle that was an old acquaintance came whirling round the stable and drew up within ten feet of the spot where we were all seated  my heart was in my mouth at this unexpected interruption and i could perceive that my uncle was scarcely less affected amid the flowing and pretty drapery of summer shawls and the other ornaments of the female toilet were four youthful and sunny faces and one venerable with years in a word my grandmother my sister and my uncles two other wards and mary warren were in the carriage yes the pretty gentle timid yet spirited and intelligent daughter of the rector was of the party and seemingly quite at home and at her ease as one among friends she was the first to speak even though it was in a low quiet voice addressed to my sister and in words that appeared extorted by surprise  there are the very two pedlers of whom i told you martha she said and now you may hear the flute well played  i doubt if he can play better than hugh was my dear sisters answer but well have some of his music if it be only to remind us of him who is so far away  the music we can and will have my child cried my grandmother cheerfully though that is not wanted to remind us of our absent boy goodmorrow susquesus i hope this fine day agrees with you  sago returned the indian making a dignified and even graceful forward gesture with one arm though he did not rise weadder goodgreat spirit good dat reason how squaws do  we are all well i thank you trackless goodmorrow jaaf how do you do this fine morning  yop or jaap or jaaf rose tottering made a low obeisance and then answered in the semirespectful semifamiliar manner of an old confidential family servant as the last existed among our fathers  tank ee miss dus wid all my heart he answered pretty well today but old sus he fail and grow oler and oler despate fast  now of the two the indian was much the finest relic of human powers though he was less uneasy and more stationary than the black but the propensity to see the mote in the eye of his friend while he forgot the beam in his own was a longestablished and wellknown weakness of jaaf and its present exhibition caused everybody to smile i was delighted with the beaming laughing eyes of mary warren in particular though she said nothing  i cannot say i agree with you jaaf returned my smiling grandmother the trackless bears his years surprisingly and i think i have not seem him look better this many a day than he is looking this morning we are none of us as young as we were when we first became acquainted jaafwhich is now near if not quite threescore of years ago  you nuthin but gal nudder growled the negro ole sus be raal ole fellow but miss dus and masser mordaunt dey get married only tudder day why dat was ater the revylooshen  it was indeed replied the venerable woman with a touch of melancholy in her tones but the revolution took place many many a long year since  well now i be surprise miss dus how you call dat so long when he only be tudder day retorted the pertinacious negro who began to grow crusty and to speak in a short spiteful way as if displeased by hearing that to which he could not assent masser corny was little ole praps if he lib but all de rest ob you nuttin but children tell me one ting miss dus be it true deys got a town at satanstoe  an attempt was made a few years since to turn the whole country into towns and among other places the neck but i believe it will never be anything more than a capital farm  so besser dat good land i tell you one acre down der wort more than twenty acre up here  my grandson would not be pleased to hear you say that jaaf  who your grandson miss dus remember you had little baby tudder day but baby cant hab baby  ah jaaf my old friend my babies have long since been men and women and are drawing on to old age one and he was my firstborn is gone before us to a better world and his boy is now your young master this young lady that is seated opposite to me is the sister of that young master and she would be grieved to think you had forgotten her  jaaf labored under the difficulty so common to old age he was forgetful of things of more recent date while he remembered those which had occurred a century ago the memory is a tablet that partakes of the peculiarity of all our opinions and habits in youth it is easily impressed and the images then engraved on it are distinct deep and lasting while those that succeed become crowded and take less root from the circumstance of finding the ground already occupied in the present instance the age was so great that the change was really startling the old negros recollections occasionally coming on the mind like a voice from the grave as for the indian as i afterward ascertained he was better preserved in all respects than the black his great temperance in youth freedom from labor exercise in the open air united to the comforts and abundance of semicivilized habits that had now lasted for nearly a century contributed to preserve both mind and body as i now looked at him i remembered what i had heard in my boyhood of his history  there had ever been a mystery about the life of the onondago if any one of our set had ever been acquainted with the facts it was andries coejemans a halfuncle of my dear grandmother a person who has been known among us by the sobriquet of the chainbearer my grandmother had told me that uncle chainbearer as we all called the old relative did know about susquesus in his timethe reason why he had left his tribe and become a hunter and warrior and runner among the palefacesand that he had always said the particulars did his red friend great credit but that he would reveal it no further so great however was uncle chainbearers reputation for integrity that such an opinion was sufficient to procure for the onondago the fullest confidence of the whole connection and the experience of fourscore years and ten had proved that this confidence was well placed some imputed the sort of exile in which the old man had so long lived to love others to war and others again to the consequences of those fierce personal feuds that are known to occur among men in the savage state but all was just as much a mystery and matter of conjecture now we were drawing near the middle of the nineteenth century as it had been when our forefathers were receding from the middle of the eighteenth to return to the negro  although jaaf had momentarily forgotten me and quite forgotten my parents he remembered my sister who was in the habit of seeing him so often in what manner he connected her with the family it is not easy to say but he knew her not only by sight but by name and as one might say by blood  yes yes cried the old fellow a little eagerly champing his thick lips together somewhat as an alligator snaps his jaws yes i knows miss patty of course miss patty is werry hansome and grows hansomer and hansomer ebbery time i sees heryah yah yah the laugh of that old negro sounded startling and unnatural yet there was something of the joyous in it after all like every negros laugh yah yah yah yes miss patty wonerful hansome and werry like miss dus i spose now miss patty was born about e time dat ginral washington die  as this was a good deal more than doubling my sisters age it produced a common laugh among the lighthearted girls in the carriage a gleam of intelligence that almost amounted to a smile also shot athwart the countenance of the onondago while the muscles of his face worked but he said nothing i had reason to know afterward that the tablet of his memory retained its records better  what friends have you with you today jaaf inquired my grandmother inclining her head toward us pedlers graciously at the same time a salutation that my uncle ro and myself rose hastily to acknowledge  as for myself i own honestly that i could have jumped into the vehicle and kissed my dear grandmothers still goodlooking but colorless cheeks and hugged patt and possibly some of the others to my heart uncle ro had more command of himself though i could see that the sound of his venerable parents voice in which the tremor was barely perceptible was near overcoming him  dese be pedler maam i do spose answered the black deys got box wid sometin in him and deys got new kind of fiddle come young man gib miss dus a tunea libely one sich as make an ole nigger dance  i drew round the hurdygurdy and was beginning to flourish away when a gentle sweet voice raised a little louder than usual by eagerness interrupted me  oh not that thing not that the flute the flute exclaimed mary warren blushing to the eyes at her own boldness the instant she saw that she was heard and that i was about to comply  it is hardly necessary to say that i bowed respectfully laid down the hurdygurdy drew the flute from my pocket and after a few flourishes commenced playing one of the newest airs or melodies from a favorite opera i saw the color rush into marthas cheeks the moment i had got through a bar or two and the start she gave satisfied me that the dear girl remembered her brothers flute i had played on that very instrument ever since i was sixteen but i had made an immense progress in the art during the five years just passed in europe masters at naples paris vienna and london had done a great deal for me and i trust i shall not be thought vain if i add that nature had done something too my excellent grandmother listened in profound attention and all four of the girls were enchanted  that music is worthy of being heard in a room observed the former as soon as i concluded the air and we shall hope to hear it this evening at the nest house if you remain anywhere near us in the meantime we must pursue our airing  as my grandmother spoke she leaned forward and extended her hand to me with a benevolent smile i advanced received the dollar that was offered and unable to command my feelings raised the hand to my lips respectfully but with fervor had marthas face been near me it would have suffered also i suppose there was nothing in this respectful salutation that struck the spectators as very much out of the way foreigners having foreign customs but i saw a flush in my venerable grandmothers cheek as the carriage moved off she had noted the warmth of the manner my uncle had turned away i dare say to conceal the tears that started to his eyes and jaaf followed toward the door of the hut whither my uncle moved in order to do the honors of the place this left me quite alone with the indian  why no kiss face of grandmodder asked the onondago coolly and quietly  had a clap of thunder broken over my head i could not have been more astonished the disguise that had deceived my nearest relationsthat had baffled seneca newcome and had set at naught even his sister opportunityhad failed to conceal me from that indian whose faculties might be supposed to have been numbed with age  is it possible that you know me susquesus i exclaimed signing toward the negro at the same time by way of caution that you remember me at all i should have thought this wig these clothes would have concealed me  sartain answered the aged indian calmly know young chief soon as see him know faderknow mudder know granfader granmuddergreatgranfader his fader too know all why forget young chief  did you know me before i kissed my grandmothers hand or only by that act  know as soon as see him what eyes good for if dont know know uncle dere sartain welcome home  but you will not let others know us too trackless we have always been friends i hope  be sure friends why ole eagle wid white head strike young pigeon nebber hatchet in e path between susquesus and any of de tribe of ravensnest too ole to dig him up now  there are good reasons why my uncle and myself should not be known for a few days perhaps you have heard something of the trouble that has grown up between the landlords and the tenants in the land  what dat trouble  the tenants are tired of paying rent and wish to make a new bargain by which they can become owners of the farms on which they live  a grim light played upon the swarthy countenance of the indian his lips moved but he uttered nothing aloud  have you heard anything of this susquesus  little bird sing sich song in my eardidnt like to hear it  and of indians who are moving up and down the country armed with rifles and dressed in calico  what tribe dem injin asked the trackless with a quickness and a fire i did not think it possible for him to retain what ey do marchin bouton warpath eh  in one sense they may be said to be so they belong to the antirent tribe do you know such a nation  poor injin dat blieve why come so latewhy no come when e foot of susquesus light as feather of birdwhy stay away till palefaces plentier dan leaf on tree or snow in air hundred year ago when dat oak little sich injin might be good now he good for nuttin  but you will keep our secret suswill not even tell the negro who we are  the trackless simply nodded his head in assent after this he seemed to me to sink back in a sort of brooding lethargy as if indisposed to pursue the subject i left him to go to my uncle in order to relate what had just passed mr roger littlepage was as much astonished as i had been myself at hearing that one so aged should have detected us through disguises that had deceived our nearest of kin but the quiet penetration and close observation of the man had long been remarkable as his good faith was of proof however neither felt any serious apprehension of being betrayed as soon as he had a moment for reflection     chapter ix      he saw a cottage with a double coachhouse       a cottage of gentility     and the devil did grin for his darling sin       is the pride that apes humilitydevils thoughts   it was now necessary to determine what course we ought next to pursue it might appear presuming in men of our pursuits to go to the nest before the appointed time and did we proceed on to the village we should have the distance between the two places to walk over twice carrying our instruments and jewelbox after a short consultation it was decided to visit the nearest dwellings and to remain as near my own house as was practicable making an arrangement to sleep somewhere in its immediate vicinity could we trust any one with our secret our fare would probably be all the better but my uncle thought it most prudent to maintain a strict incognito until he had ascertained the true state of things in the town  we took leave of the indian and the negro therefore promising to visit them again in the course of that or the succeeding day and followed the path that led to the farmhouse it was our opinion that we might at least expect to meet with friends in the occupants of the home farm the same family had been retained in possession there for three generations and being hired to manage the husbandry and to take care of the dairy there was not the same reason for the disaffection that was said so generally to exist among the tenantry prevailing among them the name of this family was miller and it consisted of the two heads and some six or seven children most of the latter being still quite young  tom miller was a trusty lad when i knew much of him said my uncle as we drew near to the barn in which we saw the party mentioned at work and he is said to have behaved well in one or two alarms they have had at the nest this summer still it may be wiser not to let even him into our secret as yet  i am quite of your mind sir i answered for who knows that he has not just as strong a desire as any of them to own the farm on which he lives he is the grandson of the man who cleared it from the forest and has much the same title as the rest of them  very true and why should not that give him just as good a right to claim an interest in the farm beyond that he has got under his contract to work it as if he held a lease he who holds a lease gets no right beyond his bargain nor does this man the one is paid for his labor by the excess of his receipts over the amount of his annual rent while the other is paid partly in what he raises and partly in wages in principle there is no difference whatever not a particle yet i question if the veriest demagogue in the state would venture to say that the man or the family which works the farm for hire even for a hundred years gets the smallest right to say he shall not quit it if its owner please as soon as his term of service is up  the love of money is the root of all evil and when that feeling is uppermost one can never tell what a man will do the bribe of a good farm obtained for nothing or for an insignificant price is sufficient to upset the morality of even tom miller  you are right hugh and here is one of the points in which our political men betray the cloven foot they write and proclaim and make speeches as if the antirent troubles grew out of the durable lease system solely whereas we all know that it is extended to all descriptions of obligations given for the occupancy of landlife leases leases for a term of years articles for deeds and bonds and mortgages it is a widespread though not yet universal attempt of those who have the least claim to the possession of real estate to obtain the entire right and that by agencies that neither the law nor good morals will justify it is no new expedient for partisans to place en évidence no more of their principles and intentions than suits their purposes but here we are within earshot and must resort to the high dutch guten tag guten tag continued uncle ro dropping easily into the broken english of our masquerade as we walked into the barn where miller two of his older boys and a couple of hired men were at work grinding scythes and preparing for the approaching hayharvest it might be warm day dis fine mornin  goodday goodday cried miller hastily and glancing his eye a little curiously at our equipments what have you got in your boxessences  nein vatches and drinkets setting down the box and opening it at once for the inspection of all present vont you burchase a goot vatch dis bleasant mornin  be they raal gold asked miller a little doubtingly and all them chains and rings be they gold too  not true golt nein i might not say dat but goot enough golt for blain folks like you and me  them things would never do for the grand quality over at the big house cried one of the laborers who was unknown to me but whose name i soon ascertained was joshua brigham and who spoke with a sort of malicious sneer that at once betrayed he was no friend you mean em for poor folks i spose  i means dem for any bodies dat vill pay deir money for em answered my uncle vould you like a vatch  that would i and a farm too if i could get em cheap answered brigham with a sneer he did not attempt to conceal how do you sell farms today  i haf got no farms i sells drinkets and vatches but i doesnt sell farms vhat i haf got i vill sell but i cannot sells vhat i haf not got  oh youll get all you want if youll stay long enough in this country this is a free land and just the place for a poor man or it will be as soon as we get all the lords and aristocrats out of it  this was the first time i had ever heard this political blarney with my own ears though i had understood it was often used by those who wish to give to their own particular envy and covetousness a grand and sounding air  vell i haf heards dat in america dere might not be any noples ant aristocrats put in my uncle with an appearance of beautiful simplicity and dat dere ist not ein graaf in der whole coontry  oh theres all sorts of folks here just as they are to be found elsewhere cried miller seating himself coolly on the end of the grindstoneframe to open and look into the mysteries of one of the watches now joseph brigham here calls all thats above him in the world aristocrats but lie doesnt call all thats below him his equals  i liked that speech and i liked the cool decided way in which it was uttered it denoted in its spirit a man who saw things as they are and who was not afraid to say what he thought about them my uncle ro was surprised and that agreeably too and he turned to miller to pursue the discourse  den dere might not be any nopility in america after all he asked inquiringly  yes theres plenty of such lords as josh here who want to be uppermost so plaguily that they dont stop to touch all the rounds of the ladder i tell him friend he wants to get on too fast and that he mustnt set up for a gentleman before he knows how to behave himself  josh looked a little abashed at a rebuke that came from one of his own class and which he must have felt in secret was merited but the demon was at work in him and he had persuaded himself that he was the champion of a quality as sacred as liberty when in fact he was simply and obviously doing neither more nor less than breaking the tenth commandment he did not like to give up while he skirmished with miller as the dog that has been beaten already two or three times growls over a bone at the approach of his conqueror  well thank heaven he cried i have got some spirit in my body  thats very true joshua answered miller laying down one watch and taking up another but it happens to be an evil spirit  now heres them littlepages what makes them better than other folks  you had better let the littlepages alone joshua seein theyre a family that you know nothing at all about  i dont want to know them though i do happen to know all i want to know i despise em  no you dont joshy my boy nobody despises folks they talk so spitefully about whats the price of this here watch friend  four dollars said my uncle eagerly falling lower than was prudent in his desire to reward miller for his good feeling and sound sentiments ja jayou might haf das vatch for four dollars  im afraid it isnt good for anything returned miller feeling the distrust that was natural at hearing a price so low lets have another look at its inside  no man probably ever bought a watch without looking into its works with an air of great intelligence though none but a mechanician is any wiser for his survey tom miller acted on this principle for the good looks of the machine he held in his hand and the four dollars tempted him sorely it had its effect too on the turbulent and envious joshua who seemed to understand himself very well in a bargain neither of the men had supposed the watches to be of gold for though the metal that is in a watch does not amount to a great deal it is usually of more value than all that was asked for the article now under examination in point of fact my uncle had this very watch invoiced to him at twice the price he now put it at  and what do you ask for this demanded joshua taking up another watch of very similar looks and of equal value to the one that miller still retained open in his hand wont you let this go for three dollars  no der brice of dat is effery cent of forty dollars answered uncle ro stubbornly  the two men now looked at the pedler in surprise miller took the watch from his hired man examined it attentively compared it with the other and then demanded its price anew  you might haf eider of dem vatches for four dollars returned my uncle as i thought incautiously  this occasioned a new surprise though brigham fortunately referred the difference to a mistake  oh he said i understood you to say forty dollars four dollars is a different matter  josh interrupted the more observant and coolerheaded miller it is high time now you and peter go and look ater them sheep the conch will soon be blowing for dinner if you want a trade you can have one when you get back  notwithstanding the plainness of his appearance and language tom miller was captain of his own company he gave this order quietly and in his usual familiar way but it was obviously to be obeyed without a remonstrance in a minute the two hired men were off in company leaving no one behind in the barn but miller his sons and us two i could see there was a motive for all this but did not understand it  now hes gone continued tom quietly but laying an emphasis that sufficiently explained his meaning perhaps youll let me know the true price of this watch ive a mind for it and maybe we can agree  four dollars answered my uncle distinctly i haf said you might haf it for dat money and vhat i haf said once might always be  i will take it then i almost wish you had asked eight though four dollars saved is suthin for a poor man its so plaguy cheap im a little afraid ont but ill ventur there theres your money and in hard cash  dank you sir wont das ladies choose to look at my drinkets  oh if you want to deal with ladies who buy chains and rings the nest house is the place my woman wouldnt know what to do with sich things and dont set herself up for a fine lady at all that chap who has just gone for the sheep is the only great man we have about this farm  ja ja he ist a nople in a dirty shirt ja ja why hast he dem pig feelins  i believe you have named them just as they ought to be pigs feelins its because he wishes to thrust his own snout all over the trough and is mad when he finds anybody elses in the way were getting to have plenty of such fellows up and down the country and an uncomfortable time they give us boys i do believe it will turn out ater all that josh is an injin  i know he is answered the oldest of the two sons a lad of nineteen where else should he be so much of nights and sundays but at their traininsand what was the meanin of the calico bundle i saw under his arm a month ago as i told you on at the time  if i find it out to be as you say harry he shall tramp off of this farm ill have no injins here  vell i dought i dit see an olt injin in a hut up yonder ast by der woots put in my uncle innocently  oh that is susquesus an onondago he is a true injin and a gentleman but we have a parcel of the mock gentry about who are a pest and an eyesore to every honest man in the country half on em are nothing but thieves in mock injin dresses the law is agin em right is agin em and every true friend of liberty in the country ought to be agin em  vhat ist der matter in dis coontry i hear in europe how america ist a free lant ant how efery man hast his rights but since i got here dey do nothin but talk of barons and noples and tenants and arisdograts and all der bat dings i might leaf behint me in der olt worlt  the plain matter is friend that they who have got little envy them thats got much and the struggle is to see which is the strongest on the one side is the law and right and bargains and contracts and on the other thousandsnot of dollars but of men thousands of voters dye understand  ja jai oonderstands dat ist easy enough but vhy do dey dalk so much of noples and arisdogratsist der noples and arisdograts in america  well i dont much understand the natur of sich things there sartainly is a difference in men and a difference in their fortuns and edications and such sort of things  und der law den favors der rich man at der cost of der poor in america too does it und you haf arisdograts who might not pay taxes and who holt all der offices and get all der pooblic money and who ist petter pefore de law in all dings dan ast dem dat be not arisdograts is it so  miller laughed outright and shook his head at this question continuing to examine the trinkets the whole time  no no my friend weve not much of that in this part of the world either rich men get very few offices to begin with for its an argooment in favor of a man for an office that hes poor and wants it folks dont so much ask who the office wants as who wants the office then as for taxes there isnt much respect paid to the rich on that score young squire littlepage pays the tax on this farm directly himself and its assessed half as high agin all things considered as any other farm on his estate  but dat is not right  right who says it isor who thinks there is anything right about assessments anywhere i have heard assessors with my own ears use such words as thesesich a man is rich and can afford to pay and sich a man is poor and it will come hard on him oh they kiver up dishonesty nowadays under all sorts of argooments  but der law der rich might haf der law on deir side surely  in what way i should like to know juries be everything and juries will go accordin to their feelins as well as other men ive seen the things with my own eyes the country pays just enough a day to make poor men like to be on juries and they never fail to attend while them that can pay their fines stay away and so leave the law pretty much in the hands of one party no rich man gains his cause unless his case is so strong it cant be helped  i had heard this before there being a very general complaint throughout the country of the practical abuses connected with the jury system i have heard intelligent lawyers complain that whenever a cause of any interest is to be tried the first question asked is not what are the merits which has the law and the facts on his side but who is likely to be on the jurythus obviously placing the composition of the jury before either law or evidence systems may have a very fair appearance on paper and as theories that are execrable in practice as for juries i believe the better opinion of the intelligent of all countries is that while they are a capital contrivance to resist the abuse of power in narrow governments in governments of a broad constituency they have the effect which might easily be seen of placing the control of the law in the hands of those who would be most apt to abuse it since it is adding to instead of withstanding and resisting the controlling authority of the state from which in a popular government most of the abuses must unavoidably proceed  as for my uncle ro he was disposed to pursue the subject with miller who turned out to be a discreet and conscientious man after a very short pause as if to reflect on what had been said he resumed the discourse  vhat den makes arisdograts in dis coontry asked my uncle  waalno man but an american of new england descent as was the case with miller can give this word its attic soundwaal its hard to say i hear a great deal about aristocrats and i read a great deal about aristocrats in this country and i know that most folks look upon them as hateful but im by no means sartain i know what an aristocrat is do you happen to know anything about it friend  ja ja an arisdograt ist one of a few men dat hast all de power of de government in deir own hands  king that isnt what we think an aristocrat in this part of the world why we call them critters here dimigogues now young squire littlepage who owns the nest house over yonder and who is owner of all this estate far and near is what we call an aristocrat and he hasnt power enough to be named townclerk much less to anything considerable or what is worth having  how can he be an arisdograt den  how sure enough if your account be true i tell you tis the dimigogues that be the aristocrats of america why josh brigham who has just gone for the sheep can get more votes for any office in the country than young littlepage  berhaps dis young littlebage ist a pat yoong man  not he hes as good as any on em and better than most besides if he was as wicked as lucifer the folks of the country dont know anything about it sin hes ben away ever sin he has ben a man  vhy den gant he haf as many votes as dat poor ignorant fellow might hafdas ist ott  it is odd but its true as gospel why it may not be so easy to tell many men many minds you know some folks dont like him because he lives in a big house some hate him because they think he is better off than they are themselves others mistrust him because he wears a fine coat and some pretend to laugh at him because he got his property from his father and grandther and so on and didnt make it himself accordin to some folks notions nowadays a man ought to enjy only the property he heaps together himself  if dis be so your herr littlebage ist no arisdograt  waal that isnt the idee hereaway we have had a great many meetins latterly about the right of the people to their farms and there has been a good deal of talk at them meetins consarnin aristocracy and feudal tenors do you know what a feudal tenor is  ja dere ist moch of dat in teutchlandin mine coontry it ist not ferry easy to explain it in a few vords but der brincipal ding ist dat der vassal owes a serfice to hist lort in de olten dimes dis serfice vast military und dere ist someding of dat now it ist de noples who owe der feudal serfice brincipally in mine coontry and dey owes it to the kings and brinces  and dont you call giving a chicken for rent feudal service in germany  uncle ro and i laughed in spite of our efforts to the contrary there being a bathos in this question that was supremely ridiculous curbing his merriment however as soon as he could my uncle answered the question  if der landlort has a right to coome and dake as many chickens as he bleases und ast often ast he bleases den dat wouldt look like a feudal right but if de lease says dat so many chickens moost be paid a year for der rent vhy dat ist all der same as baying so much moneys und it might be easier for der tenant to bay in chicken ast it might be to bay in der silver vhen a man canst bay his debts in vhat he makes himself he ist ferry interpentent  it does seem so i vow yet theres folks about here and some at albany that call it feudal for a man to have to carry a pair of fowls to the landlords office and the landlord an aristocrat for asking it  but der man canst sent a poy or a gal or a nigger wid his fowls if he bleases  sartain all that is asked is that the fowls should come  und vhen der batroon might owe hist tailor or hist shoemaker must he not go to hist shop or find him and bay him vhat he owes or be suet for der debt  thats true too boys put me in mind of telling that to josh this evening yes the greatest landlord in the land must hunt up his creditor or be sued all the same as the lowest tenant  und he most bay in a particlar ding he most bay in golt or silver  true lawful tender is as good for one as tis for tother  und if your herr littlebage signs a baper agreein to gif der apples from dat orchart to somebody on his landts most he send or carry der apples too  to be sure that would be the bargain  und he most carry der ferry apples dat grows on dem ferry drees might it not be so  all true as gospel if a man contracts to sell the apples of one orchard he cant put off the purchaser with the apples of another  und der law ist der same for one ast for anudder in dese tings  there is no difference and there should be none  und der batroons und der landlordts wants to haf der law changet so dat dey may be excuset from baying der debts accordin to der bargains und to gif dem atfantages over der poor tenants  i never heard anything of the sort and dont believe they want any such change  of vhat den dost der beople complain  of having to pay rent at all they think the landlords ought to be made to sell their farms or give them away some stand out for the last  but der landlordts dont vant to sell deir farms und dey might not be made to sell vhat ist deir own und vhat dey dont vant to sell any more dan der tenants might be made to sell deir hogs and deir sheep vhen dey dont vant to sell dem  it does seem so boys as ive told the neighbors all along but ill tell this dutchman all about it some folks want the state to look ater the title of young littlepage pretending he has no title  but der state wilt do dat widout asking for it particularly vill it not  i never heard that it would  if anybody hast a claim to der broperty vilt not der courts try it  yes yesin that way but a tenant cant set up a title agn his landlord  vhy should he he canst haf no title but his landlorts and it vould be roguery and cheatery to let a man get into der bossession of a farm under der pretence of hiring it und den come out und claim it as owner if any tenant dinks he hast a better right dan his landlort he can put der farm vhere it vast before he might be a tenant und den der state wilt examine into der title i fancy  yes yesin that way but these men want it another way what they want is for the state to set up a legal examination and turn the landlords off altogether if they can and then let themselves have the farms in their stead  but dat would not be honest to dem dat hafent nothing to do wid der farms if der state owns der farms it ought to get as moch as it can for dem and so safe all der people from baying taxes it looks like roguery all roundt  i believe it is that and nothing else as you say the state will examine into the title as it is and there is no need of any laws about it  would der state dink you pass a law dat might inquire into de demands dat are made against der batroons vhen der tratesman sent in deir bills  i should like to see any patroon ask sich a thing he would be laughed at from york to buffalo  und he would desarf if by vhat i see frient your denants be der arisdograts und der landlordts der vassals  why you seewhat may your name beas were likely to become acquainted i should like to know your name  my name is greisenbach und i comes from preussen  well mr greisenbach the difficulty about aristocracy is this hugh littlepage is rich and his money gives him advantages that other men cant enjy now that sticks in some folks crops  oh den it ist meant to divite broperty in dis coontry und to say no man might haf more ast anudder  folks dont go quite as far as that yet though some of their talk does squint thataway i must own now there are folks about here that complain that old madam littlepage and her young ladies dont visit the poor  vell if deys be hardhearted und hast no feelins for der poor and miseraple  no no that is not what i mean neither as for that sort of poor everybody allows they do more for them than anybody else about here but they dont visit the poor that isnt in want  vell it ist a ferry coomfortable sort of poor dat ist not in any vant berhaps you mean dey dont associate wid em as equals  thats it now on that head i must say there is some truth in the charge for the gals over at the nest never come here to visit my gal and kitty is as nice a young thing as there is about  und gitty goes to visit the gal of the man who lives over yonter in de house on der hill pointing to a residence of a man of the very humblest class in the town  hardly kittys by no means proud but i shouldnt like her to be too thick there  oh youre an arisdograt den after all else might your daughter visit dat mans daughter  i tell you grunzebach or whatever your name may be returned miller a little angrily though a particularly goodnatured man in the main that my gal shall not visit old stevens daghters  vell im sure she might do as she bleases but i dinks der mademoiselles littlepage might do ast dey pleases too  there is but one littlepage gal if you saw them out this morning in the carriage you saw two york gals and parson warrens daghter with her  und dis parson warren might be rich too  not he he hasnt a sixpence on arth but what he gets from the parish why he is so poor his friends had to edicate his daghter i have heern say over and over  und das littlepage gal und de warren gal might be goot friends  they are the thickest together of any two young women in this part of the world ive never seen two gals more intimate now theres a young lady in the town one opportunity newcome who one might think would stand before mary warren at the big house any day in the week but she doesnt mary takes all the shine out on her  which ist der richest obbordunity or mary  by all accounts mary warren has nothing while opportunity is thought to come next to matty herself as to property of all the young gals about here but opportunity is no favorite at the nest  den it would seem after all dat dis miss littlebage does not choose her friends on account of riches she likes mary warren who ist boor und she does not like obbordunity who ist vell to do in de vorlt berhaps der littlepages be not as big arisdograts as you supposes  miller was bothered while i felt a disposition to laugh one of the commonest errors of those who from position and habits are unable to appreciate the links which connect cultivated society together is to refer everything to riches riches in a certain sense as a means and through their consequences may be a principal agent in dividing society into classes but long after riches have taken wings their fruits remain when good use has been made of their presence so untrue is the vulgar opinionor it might be better to say the opinion of the vulgarthat money is the one tie which unites polished society that it is a fact which all must know who have access to the better circles of even our own commercial towns that those circles loosely and accidentally constructed as they are receive with reluctance nay often sternly exclude vulgar wealth from their associations while the door is open to the cultivated who have nothing the young in particular seldom think much of money while family connections early communications similarity of opinions and most of all of tastes bring sets together and often keep them together long after the golden band has been broken  but men have great difficulty in comprehending things that lie beyond their reach and money being apparent to the senses while refinement through its infinite gradations is visible principally and in some cases exclusively to its possessors it is not surprising that common minds should refer a tie that to them would otherwise be mysterious to the more glittering influence and not to the less obvious infinite indeed are the gradations of cultivated habits nor are as many of them the fruits of caprice and selfindulgence as men usually suppose there is a common sense nay a certain degree of wisdom in the laws of even etiquette while they are confined to equals that bespeak the respect of those who understand them as for the influence of associations on mens manners on their exteriors and even on their opinions my uncle ro has long maintained that it is so apparent that one of his time of life could detect the man of the world at such a place as saratoga even by an intercourse of five minutes and what is more that he could tell the class in life from which he originally emerged he tried it the last summer on our return from ravensnest and i was amused with his success though he made a few mistakes it must be admitted  that young man comes from the better circles but he has never travelled he said alluding to one of a group which still remained at table while he who is next him has travelled but commenced badly this may seem a very nice distinction but i think it is easily made there are two brothers of an excellent family in pennsylvania he continued as one might know from the name the eldest has travelled the youngest has not this was a still harder distinction to make but one who knew the world as well as my uncle ro could do it he went on amusing me by his decisionsall of which were respectable and some surprisingly accuratein this way for several minutes now like has an affinity to like and in this natural attraction is to be found the secret of the ordinary construction of society you shall put two men of superior minds in a room full of company and they will find each other out directly and enjoy the accident the same is true as to the mere modes of thinking that characterize social castes and it is truer in this country perhaps than most others from the mixed character of our associations of the two i am really of opinion that the man of high intellect who meets with one of moderate capacity but of manners and social opinions on a level with his own has more pleasure in the communication than with one of equal mind but of inferior habits  that patt should cling to one like mary warren seemed to me quite as natural as that she should be averse to much association with opportunity newcome the money of the latter had my sister been in the least liable to such an influence was so much below what she had been accustomed all her life to consider affluence that it would have had no effect even had she been subject to so low a consideration in regulating her intercourse with others but this poor tom miller could not understand he could only reason from what he knew and he knew little of the comparative notions of wealth and less of the powers of cultivation on the mind and manners he was struck however with a fact that did come completely within the circle of his own knowledge and that was the circumstance that mary warren while admitted to be poor was the bosom friend of her whom he was pleased to call sometimes the littlepage gal it was easy to see he felt the force of this circumstance and it is to be hoped that as he was certainly a wiser he also became a better man on one of the most common of the weaknesses of human frailty  waal he replied to my uncles last remark after fully a minute of silent reflection i dont know it would seem so i vow and yet it hasnt been my wifes notion nor is it kittys youre quite upsetting my idees about aristocrats for though i like the littlepages ive always set em down as desprate aristocrats  nein nein dem as vat you calls dimigogues be der american arisdograts dey gets all der money of der pooblic und haf all der power but dey gets a little mads because dey might not force demselves on der gentlemen and laties of der coontry as well as on der lands und der offices  i swan i dont know but this may be true ater all i dont know what right anybody has to complain of the littlepages  does dey dreat beoples vell as might coome to see dem  yes indeed if folks treat them well as sometimes doesnt happen ive seen hogs heretom was a little saxon in his figures but their nature will prove their justificationive seen hogs about here bolt right in before old madam littlepage and draw their chairs up to her fire and squirt about the tobacco and never think of even taking off their hats them folks be always huffy about their own importance though they never think of other peoples feelins  we were interrupted by the sound of wheels and looking round we perceived that the carriage of my grandmother had driven up to the farmhouse door on its return home miller conceived it to be no more than proper to go and see if he were wanted and we followed him slowly it being the intention of my uncle to offer his mother a watch by way of ascertaining if she could penetrate his disguise     chapter x      will you buy any tape     or lace for your cape      come to the peddler     moneys a meddler     that doth utter all mens wareawinters tale   there they sat those four young creatures a perfect galaxy of bright and beaming eyes there was not a plain face among them and i was struck with the circumstance of how rare it was to meet with a youthful and positively ugly american female kitty too was at the door by the time we reached the carriage and she also was a blooming and attractivelooking girl it was a thousand pities that she spoke however the vulgarity of her utterance tone of voice cadences and accents the latter a sort of singing whine being in striking contrast to a sort of healthful and vigorous delicacy that marked her appearance all the bright eyes grew brighter as i drew nearer carrying the flute in my hand but neither of the young ladies spoke  buy a vatch maams said uncle ro approaching his mother cap in hand with his box open  i thank you friend but i believe all here are provided with watches already  mine ist ferry sheaps  i dare say they may be returned dear grandmother smiling though cheap watches are not usually the best is that very pretty pencil gold  yes maams it ist of goot gold if it might not be i might not say so  i saw suppressed smiles among the girls all of whom however were too wellbred to betray to common observers the sense of the ridiculous that each felt at the equivoque that suggested itself in my uncles words  what is the price of this pencil asked my grandmother  uncle roger had too much tact to think of inducing his mother to take a purchase as he had influenced miller and he mentioned something near the true value of the article which was fifteen dollars  i will take it returned my grandmother dropping three halfeagles into the box when turning to mary warren she begged her acceptance of the pencil with as much respect in her manner as if she solicited instead of conferred a favor  mary warrens handsome face was covered with blushes she looked pleased and she accepted the offering though i thought she hesitated one moment about the propriety of so doing most probably on account of its value my sister asked to look at this little present and after admiring it it passed from hand to hand each praising its shape and ornaments all my uncles wares indeed were in perfect good taste the purchase having been made of an importer of character and paid for at some cost the watches it is true were with one or two exceptions cheap as were most of the trinkets but my uncle had about his person a watch or two and some fine jewelry that he had brought from europe himself expressly to bestow in presents among which had been the pencil in question and which he had dropped into the box but a moment before it was sold  waal madam littlepage cried miller who used the familiarity of one born on the estate this is the queerest watchpedler ive met with yet he asks fifteen dollars for that pencil and only four for this watch showing his own purchase as he concluded  my grandmother took the watch in her hand and examined it attentively  it strikes me as singularly cheap she remarked glancing a little distrustfully as i fancied at her son as if she thought he might be selling his brushes cheaper than those who only stole the materials because he stole them ready made i know that these watches are made for very little in the cheap countries of europe but one can hardly see how this machinery was put together for so small a sum  i has em matam at all brices put in my uncle  i have a strong desire to purchase a good ladys watch but should a little fear buying of any but a known and regular dealer  you neednt fear us maam i ventured to say if we might sheat anypodies we shouldnt sheat so goot a laty  i do not know whether my voice struck patts ear pleasantly or a wish to see the project of her grandmother carried out at once induced my sister to interfere but interfere she did and that by urging her aged parent to put confidence in us years had taught my grandmother caution and she hesitated  but all these watches are of base metal and i want one of good gold and handsome finish observed my grandmother  my uncle immediately produced a watch that he had bought of blondel in paris for five hundred francs and which was a beautiful little ornament for a ladys belt he gave it to my grandmother who read the name of the manufacturer with some little surprise the watch itself was then examined attentively and was applauded by all  and what may be the price of this demanded my grandmother  one hoondred dollars matam and sheaps at dat  tom miller looked at the bit of tinsel in his own hand and at the smaller but exquisitelyshaped article that my grandmother held up to look at suspended by its bit of ribbon and was quite as much puzzled as he had evidently been a little while before in his distinctions between the rich and the poor tom was not able to distinguish the base from the true that was all  my grandmother did not appear at all alarmed at the price though she cast another distrustful glance or two over her spectacles at the imaginary pedler at length the beauty of the watch overcame her  if you will bring this watch to yonder large dwelling i will pay you the hundred dollars for it she said i have not as much money with me here  ja jaferry goot you might keep das vatch laty und i will coome for der money after i haf got some dinners of somebodys  my grandmother had no scruple about accepting of the credit of course and she was about to put the watch in her pocket when patt laid her little gloved hand on it and cried  now dearest grandmother let it be done at oncethere is no one but us three present you know  such is the impatience of a child exclaimed the elder lady laughing well you shall be indulged i gave you that pencil for a keepsake mary only en attendant it having been my intention to offer a watch as soon as a suitable one could be found as a memorial of the sense i entertain of the spirit you showed during that dark week in which the antirenters were so menacing here then is such a watch as i might presume to ask you to have the goodness to accept  mary warren seemed astounded the color mounted to her temples then she became suddenly pale i had never seen so pretty a picture of gentle female distressa distress that arose from conflicting but creditable feelings  oh mrs littlepage she exclaimed after looking in astonishment at the offering for a moment and in silence you cannot have intended that beautiful watch for me  for you my dear the beautiful watch is not a whit too good for my beautiful mary  but dear dear mrs littlepage it is altogether too handsome for my stationfor my means  a lady can very well wear such a watch and you are a lady in every sense of the word and so you need have no scruples on that account as for the means you will not misunderstand me if i remind you that it will be bought with my means and there can be no extravagance in the purchase  but we are so poor and that watch has so rich an appearance it scarcely seems right  i respect your feelings and sentiments my dear girl and can appreciate them i suppose you know i was once as poor nay much poorer than you are yourself  you mrs littlepage no that can hardly be you are of an affluent and very respectable family i know  it is quite true nevertheless my dear i shall not affect extreme humility and deny that the malbones did and do belong to the gentry of the land but my brother and myself were once so much reduced as to toil with the surveyors in the woods quite near this property we had then no claim superior to yours and in many respects were reduced much lower besides the daughter of an educated and wellconnected clergyman has claims that in a worldly point of view alone entitle her to a certain consideration you will do me the favor to accept my offering  dear mrs littlepage i do not know how to refuse you or how to accept so rich a gift you will let me consult my father first  that will be no more than proper my dear returned my beloved grandmother quietly putting the watch into her own pocket mr warren luckily dines with us and the matter can be settled before we sit down to table  this ended the discussion which had commenced under an impulse of feeling that left us all its auditors as for my uncle and myself it is scarcely necessary to say we were delighted with the little scene the benevolent wish to gratify on the one side with the natural scruples on the other about receiving made a perfect picture for our contemplation the three girls who were witnesses of what passed too much respected marys feelings to interfere though patt restrained herself with difficulty as to tom miller and kitty they doubtless wondered why warrens gal was such a fool as to hesitate about accepting a watch that was worth a hundred dollars this was another point they did not understand  you spoke of dinner continued my grandmother looking at my uncle if you and your companion will follow us to the house i will pay you for the watch and order you a dinner in the bargain  we were right down glad to accept this offer making our bows and expressing our thanks as the carriage whirled off we remained a moment to take our leave of miller  when youve got through at the nest said that semiworthy fellow give us another call here i should like my woman and kitty to have a look at your finery before you go down to the village with it  with a promise to return to the farmhouse we proceeded on our way to the building which in the familiar parlance of the country was called the nest or the nest house from ravensnest its true name and which tom miller in his country dialect called the neest the distance between the two buildings was less than half a mile the grounds of the family residence lying partly between them many persons would have called the extensive lawns which surrounded my paternal abode a park but it never bore that name with us they were too large for a paddock and might very well have come under the former appellation but as deer or animals of any sort except those that are domestic had never been kept within it the name had not been used we called them the groundsa term which applies equally to large and small enclosures of this naturewhile the broad expanse of verdure which lies directly under the windows goes by the name of the lawn notwithstanding the cheapness of land among us there has been very little progress made in the art of landscape gardening and if we have anything like park scenery it is far more owing to the gifts of a bountiful nature than to any of the suggestions of art thanks to the cultivated taste of downing as well as to his welldirected labors this reproach is likely to be soon removed and country life will acquire this pleasure among the many others that are so peculiarly its own after lying for more than twenty yearsa stigma on the national tastedisfigured by ravines or gullies and otherwise in a rude and discreditable condition the grounds of the white house have been brought into a condition to denote that they are the property of a civilized country the americans are as apt at imitation as the chinese with a far greater disposition to admit of change and little beyond good models is required to set them on the right track but it is certain that as a nation we have yet to acquire nearly all that belongs to the art i have mentioned that lies beyond avenues of trees with an occasional tuft of shrubbery the abundance of the latter that forms the wilderness of sweets the masses of flowers that spot the surface of europe the beauty of curved lines and the whole finesse of surprises reliefs backgrounds and vistas are things so little known among us as to be almost arisdogratic as my uncle ro would call the word  little else had been done at ravensnest than to profit by the native growth of the trees and to take advantage of the favorable circumstances in the formation of the grounds most travellers imagine that it might be an easy thing to lay out a park in the virgin forest as the axe might spare the thickets and copses and woods that elsewhere are the fruits of time and planting this is all a mistake however as the rule though modified exceptions may and do exist the tree of the american forest shoots upward toward the light growing so tall and slender as to be unsightly and even when time has given its trunk a due size the top is rarely of a breadth to ornament a park or a lawn while its roots seeking their nourishment in the rich alluvium formed by the decayed leaves of a thousand years lie too near the surface to afford sufficient support after losing the shelter of its neighbors it is owing to reasons like these that the ornamental grounds of an american countryhouse have usually to be commenced ab origine and that natural causes so little aid in furnishing them  my predecessors had done a little toward assisting nature at the nest and what was of almost equal importance in the state of knowledge on this subject as it existed in the country sixty years since they had done little to mar her efforts the results were that the grounds of ravensnest possess a breadth that is the fruit of the breadth of our lands and a rural beauty which without being much aided by art was still attractive the herbage was kept short by sheep of which one thousand of the fine wool were feeding on the lawns along the slopes and particularly on the distant heights as we crossed the grounds on our way to the doors  the nest house was a respectable new york country dwelling as such buildings were constructed among us in the last quarter of the past century a little improved and enlarged by the second and third generations of its owners the material was of stone the low cliff on which it stood supplying enough of an excellent quality and the shape of the main corps de bâtiment as near a square as might be each face of this part of the constructions offered five windows to view this being almost the prescribed number for a country residence in that day as three have since got to be in towns these windows however had some size the main building being just sixty feet square which was about ten feet in each direction larger than was common so soon after the revolution but wings had been added to the original building and that on a plan which conformed to the shape of a structure in square logs that had been its predecessor on its immediate site these wings were only of a story and a half each and doubling on each side of the main edifice just far enough to form a sufficient communication they ran back to the very verge of a cliff some forty feet in height overlooking at their respective ends a meandering rivulet and a wide expanse of very productive flats that annually filled my barns with hay and my cribs with corn of this level and fertile bottomland there was near a thousand acres stretching in three directions of which two hundred belonged to what was called the nest farm the remainder was divided among the farms of the adjacent tenantry this little circumstance among the thousandandone other atrocities that were charged upon me had been made a ground of accusation to which i shall presently have occasion to advert i shall do this the more readily because the fact has not yet reached the ears and set in motion the tongues of legislatorsheaven bless us how words do get corrupted by too much usein their enumeration of the griefs of the tenants of the state  everything about the nest was kept in perfect order and in a condition to do credit to the energy and taste of my grandmother who had ordered all these things for the last few years or since the death of my grandfather this circumstance connected with the fact that the building was larger and more costly than those of most of the other citizens of the country had of late years caused ravensnest to be termed an aristocratic residence this word aristocratic i find since my return home has got to be a term of expansive signification its meaning depending on the particular habits and opinions of the person who happens to use it thus he who chews tobacco thinks it aristocratic in him who deems the practice nasty not to do the same the man who stoops accuses him who is straight in the back of having aristocratic shoulders and i have actually met with one individual who maintained that it was excessively aristocratic to pretend not to blow ones nose with his fingers it will soon be aristocratic to maintain the truth of the familiar latin axiom of de gustibus non disputandum est  as we approached the door of the nest house which opened on the piazza that stretched along three sides of the main building and the outer ends of both wings the coachman was walking his horses away from it on the road that led to the stables the party of ladies had made a considerable circuit after quitting the farm and had arrived but a minute before us all the girls but mary warren had entered the house careless on the subject of the approach of two pedlers she remained however at the side of my grandmother to receive us  i believe in my soul whispered uncle ro that my dear old mother has a secret presentiment who we are by her manifesting so much respect tousand tanks matam tousand tanks he continued dropping into his halfaccurate halfblundering broken english for dis great honor such as we might not expect das laty of das house to wait for us at her door  this young lady tells me that she has seen you before and that she understands you are both persons of education and good manners who have been driven from your native country by political troubles such being the case i cannot regard you as common pedlers i have known what it was to be reduced in fortunemy dear grandmothers voice trembled a littleand can feel for those who thus suffer  matam dere might be moch trut in some of dis answered my uncle taking off his cap and bowing very much like a gentleman an act in which i imitated him immediately we haf seen petter tays und my son dere hast peen edicated at an university but we are now poor pedlers of vatches und dem dat might make moosic in der streets  my grandmother looked as a lady would look under such circumstances neither too free to forget present appearances nor coldly neglectful of the past she knew that something was due to her own household and to the example she ought to set it while she felt that far more was due to the sentiment that unites the cultivated we were asked into the house were told a table was preparing for us and were treated with a generous and considerate hospitality that involved no descent from her own character or that of the sex the last being committed to the keeping of every lady  in the meantime business proceeded with my uncle he was paid his hundred dollars and all his stores of value including rings brooches earrings chains bracelets and other trinkets that he had intended as presents to his wards were produced from his pockets and laid before the bright eyes of the three girlsmary warren keeping in the background as one who ought not to look on things unsuited to her fortune her father had arrived however had been consulted and the pretty watch was already attached to the girdle of the prettier waist i fancied the tear of gratitude that still floated in her serene eyes was a jewel of a far higher price than any my uncle could exhibit  we had been shown into the library a room that was in the front of the house and of which the windows all opened on the piazza i was at first a little overcome at thus finding myself and unrecognized under the paternal roof and in a dwelling that was my own after so many years of absence shall i confess it everything appeared diminutive and mean after the buildings to which i had been accustomed in the old world i am not now drawing comparisons with the palaces of princes and the abodes of the great as the american is apt to fancy whenever anything is named that is superior to the things to which he is accustomed but to the style dwellings and appliances of domestic life that pertain to those of other countries who have not a claim in anything to be accounted my superiorsscarcely my equals in a word american aristocracy or that which it is getting to be the fashion to stigmatize as aristocratic would be deemed very democratic in most of the nations of europe our swiss brethren have their chateaux and their habits that are a hundred times more aristocratic than anything about ravensnest without giving offence to liberty and i feel persuaded were the proudest establishment in all america pointed out to a european as an aristocratic abode he would be very apt to laugh at it in his sleeve the secret of this charge among ourselves is the innate dislike which is growing up in the country to see any man distinguished from the mass around him in anything even though it should be in merit it is nothing but the expansion of the principle which gave rise to the traditionary feud between the plebeians and patricians of albany at the commencement of this century and which has now descended so much farther than was then contemplated by the soidisant plebeians of that day as to become quite disagreeable to their own descendants but to return to myself  i will own that so far from finding any grounds of exultation in my own aristocratical splendor when i came to view my possessions at home i felt mortified and disappointed the things that i had fancied really respectable and even fine from recollection now appeared very commonplace and in many particulars mean really i found myself saying sotto voce all this is scarcely worthy of being the cause of deserting the right setting sound principles at defiance and of forgetting god and his commandments perhaps i was too inexperienced to comprehend how capacious is the maw of the covetous man and how microscopic the eye of envy  you are welcome to ravensnest said mr warren approaching and offering his hand in a friendly way much as he would address any other young friend we arrived a little before you and i have had my ears and eyes open ever since in the hope of hearing your flute and of seeing your form in the highway near the parsonage where you promised to visit me  mary was standing at her fathers elbow as when i first saw her and she gazed wistfully at my flute as she would not have done had she seen me in my proper attire assuming my proper character  i danks you sir was my answer we might haf plenty of times for a little moosic vhen das laties shall be pleaset to say so i canst blay yankee doodle hail coloombias and der star spangled banner und all dem airs as dey so moch likes at der taverns and on der road  mr warren laughed and he took the flute from my hand and began to examine it i now trembled for the incognito the instrument had been mine for many years and was a very capital one with silver keys stops and ornaments what if pattwhat if my dear grandmother should recognize it i would have given the handsomest trinket in my uncles collection to get the flute back again into my own hands but before an opportunity offered for that it went from hand to hand as the instrument that had produced the charming sounds heard that morning until it reached those of martha the dear girl was thinking of the jewelry which it will be remembered was rich and intended in part for herself and she passed the instrument on saying hurriedly  see dear grandmother this is the flute which you pronounced the sweetesttoned of any you had ever heard  my grandmother took the flute started put her spectacles closer to her eyes examined the instrument and turned palefor her cheeks still retained a little of the color of their youthand then cast a glance hurriedly and anxiously at me i could see that she was pondering on something profoundly in her most secret mind for a minute or two luckily the others were too much occupied with the box of the pedler to heed her movements she walked slowly out of the door almost brushing me as she passed and went into the hall here she turned and catching my eye she signed for me to join her obeying this signal i followed until i was led into a little room in one of the wings that i well remembered as a sort of private parlor attached to my grandmothers own bedroom to call it a boudoir would be to caricature things its furniture being just that of the sort of room i have mentioned or of a plain neat comfortable country parlor here my grandmother took her seat on a sofa for she trembled so she could not stand and then she turned to gaze at me wistfully and with an anxiety it would be difficult for me to describe  do not keep me in suspense she said almost awfully in tone and manner am i right in my conjecture  dearest grandmother you are i answered in my natural voice  no more was needed we hung on each others necks as had been my wont in boyhood  but who is that pedler hugh demanded my grandmother after a time can it possibly be roger my son  it is no other we have come to visit you incog  and why this disguiseis it connected with the troubles  certainly we have wished to take a near view with our own eyes and supposed it might be unwise to come openly in our proper characters  in this you have done well yet i hardly know how to welcome you in your present characters on no account must your real names be revealed the demons of tar and feathers the sons of liberty and equality who illustrate their principles as they do their courage by attacking the few with the many would be stirring fancying themselves heroes and martyrs in the cause of justice did they learn you were here ten armed and resolute men might drive a hundred of them i do believe for they have all the cowardice of thieves but they are heroes with the unarmed and feeble are you safe yourselves appearing thus disguised under the new law  we are not armed not having so much as a pistol and that will protect us  i am sorry to say hugh that this country is no longer what i once knew it its justice if not wholly departed is taking to itself wings and its blindness not in a disregard of persons but in a faculty of seeing only the stronger side a landlord in my opinion would have but little hope with jury judge or executive for doing that which thousands of the tenants have done still do and will continue to do with perfect impunity unless some dire catastrophe stimulate the public functionaries to their duties by awakening public indignation  this is a miserable state of things dearest grandmother and what makes it worse is the cool indifference with which most persons regard it a better illustration of the utter selfishness of human nature cannot be given than in the manner in which the body of the people look on and see wrong thus done to a few of their number  such persons as mr seneca newcome would answer that the public sympathizes with the poor who are oppressed by the rich because the last do not wish to let the first rob them of their estates we hear a great deal of the strong robbing the weak all over the world but few among ourselves i am afraid are sufficiently clearsighted to see how vivid an instance of the truth now exists among ourselves  calling the tenants the strong and the landlords the weak  certainly numbers make strength in this country in which all power in practice and most of it in theory rests with the majority were there as many landlords as there are tenants my life on it no one would see the least injustice in the present state of things  so says my uncle but i hear the light steps of the girlswe must be on our guard  at that instant martha entered followed by all three of the girls holding in her hand a very beautiful manilla chain that my uncle had picked up in his travels and had purchased as a present to my future wife whomsoever she might turn out to be and which he had had the indiscretion to show to his ward a look of surprise was cast by each girl in succession as she entered the room on me but neither said and i fancy neither thought much of my being shut up there with an old lady of eighty after the first moment other thoughts were uppermost at the moment  look at this dearest grandmamma cried patt holding up the chain as she entered the room here is just the most exquisite chain that was ever wrought and of the purest gold but the pedler refuses to part with it  perhaps you do not offer enough my child it is indeed very very beautiful pray what does he say is its value  one hundred dollars he says and i can readily believe it for its weight is near half the money i do wish hugh were at home i am certain he would contrive to get it and make it a present to me  nein nein young lady put in the pedler who a little unceremoniously had followed the girls into the room though he knew of course precisely where he was coming dat might not be dat chain is der broperty of my son tere und i haf sworn it shalt only be gifen to his wife  patt colored a little and she pouted a good deal then she laughed outright  if it is only to be had on those conditions i am afraid i shall never own it she said saucily though it was intended to be uttered so low as not to reach my ears i will pay the hundred dollars out of my own pocketmoney however if that will buy it do say a good word for me grandmamma  how prettily the hussy uttered that word of endearment so different from the paw and maw one hears among the dirtynoses that are to be found in the mudpuddles but our grandparent was puzzled for she knew with whom she had to deal and of course saw that money would do nothing nevertheless the state of the game rendered it necessary to say and do something that might have an appearance of complying with pattys request  can i have more success in persuading you to change your mind sir she said looking at her son in a way that let him know at once or at least made him suspect at once that she was in his secret it would give me great pleasure to be able to gratify my granddaughter by making her a present of so beautiful a chain  my uncle ro advanced to his mother took the hand she had extended with the chain in it in order the better to admire the trinket and he kissed it with a profound respect but in such a manner as to make it seem to the lookerson an act of european usage rather than what it was the tempered salute of a child to his parent  laty he then said with emphasis if anyboty might make me change a resolution long since made it would be one as fenerable und gracious und goot as i am sartain you most be but i haf vowet to gif dat chain to das wife of mine son vhen he might marry one day some bretty young american und it might not be  dear grandmother smiled but now she understood that it was really intended the chain was to be an offering to my wife she no longer wished to change its destination she examined the bauble a few moments and said to me  do you wish this as well as your unfather i should say it is a rich present for a poor man to make  ja ja laty it ist so but vhen der heart goes golt might be tought sheap to go wid it  the old lady was half ready to laugh in my face at hearing this attempt at germanic english but the kindness and delight and benevolent tenderness of her still fine eyes made me wish to throw myself in her arms again and kiss her patt continued to bouder for a moment or two longer but her excellent nature soon gave in and the smiles returned to her countenance as the sun issues from behind a cloud in may  well the disappointment may and must be borne she said goodnaturedly though it is much the most lovely chain i have ever seen  i dare say the right person will one day find one quite as lovely to present to you said henrietta coldbrooke a little pointedly  i did not like this speech it was an allusion that a wellbred young woman ought not to have made at least before others even pedlers and it was one that a young woman of a proper tone of feeling would not be apt to make i determined from that instant the chain should never belong to miss henrietta though she was a fine showy girl and though such a decision would disappoint my uncle sadly i was a little surprised to see a slight blush on patts cheeks and then i remembered something of the name of the traveller beekman turning toward mary warren i saw plain enough that she was disappointed because my sister was disappointed and for no other reason in the world  your grandmother will meet with another chain when she goes to town that will make you forget this she whispered affectionately close at my sisters ears  patt smiled and kissed her friend with a warmth of manner that satisfied me these two charming young creatures loved each other sincerely but my dear old grandmothers curiosity had been awakened and she felt a necessity for having it appeased she still held the chain and as she returned it to me who happened to be nearest to her she said  and so sir your mind is sincerely made up to offer this chain to your future wife  yes laty or what might be better to das young frau before we might be marriet  and is your choice made glancing round at the girls who were grouped together looking at some other trinkets of my uncles have you chosen the young woman who is to possess so handsome a chain  nein nein i answered returning the smile and glancing also at the group dere ist so many peautiful laties in america one neednt be in a hurry in goot time i shalt find her dat ist intended for me  well grandmamma interrupted patt since nobody can have the chain unless on certain conditions here are the three other things that we have chosen for ann henrietta and myself and they are a ring a pair of bracelets and a pair of earrings the cost altogether will be two hundred dollars can you approve of that  my grandmother now she knew who was the pedler understood the whole matter and had no scruples the bargain was soon made when she sent us all out of the room under the pretence we should disturb her while settling with the watchseller her real object however was to be alone with her son not a dollar passing between them of course     chapter xi      our life was changed another love       in this lone woof began to twine     but oh the golden thread was wove       between my sisters heart and minewillis   half an hour later uncle ro and myself were seated at table eating our dinners as quietly as if we were in an inn the footman who had set the table was an old family servant one who had performed the same sort of duty in that very house for a quarter of a century of course he was not an american no man of american birth ever remained so long a time in an inferior station or in any station so low as that of a houseservant if he has good qualities enough to render it desirable to keep him he is almost certain to go up in the world if not one does not care particularly about having him but europeans are less elastic and less ambitious and it is no uncommon thing to find one of such an origin remaining a long time in the same service such had been the fact with this man who had followed my own parents from europe when they returned from their marriage tour and had been in the house on the occasion of my birth from that time he had continued at the nest never marrying nor ever manifesting the smallest wish for any change he was an englishman by birth and what is very unusual in a servant of that country when transferred to america the lettingup which is certain to attend such a change from the depression of the original condition to that in which he is so suddenly placed had not made him saucy an american is seldom what is called impudent under any circumstances he is careless nay ignorant of forms pays little or no purely conventional respect does not understand half the social distinctions which exist among the higher classes of even his own countrymen and fancies there are equalities in things about which in truth there is great inequality between himself and others merely because he has been taught that all men are equal in rights but he is so unconscious of any pressure as seldom to feel a disposition to revenge himself by impudence  but while john was not impudent either he had a footmans feeling toward those whom he fancied no better than himself he had set the table with his customary neatness and method and he served the soup with as much regularity as he would have done had we sat there in our proper characters but then he withdrew he probably remembered that the landlord or upper servant of an english hotel is apt to make his appearance with the soup and to disappear as that disappears so it was with john after removing the soup he put a dumbwaiter near my uncle touched a carvingknife or two as much as to say help yourselves and quitted the room as a matter of course our dinner was not a very elaborate one it wanting two or three hours to the regular time of dining though my grandmother had ordered in my hearing one or two delicacies to be placed on the table that had surprised patt among the extraordinary things for such guests was wine the singularity however was a little explained by the quality commanded which was rhenish  my uncle ro was a little surprised at the disappearance of john for seated in that room he was so accustomed to his face that it appeared as if he were not half at home without him  let the fellow go he said withdrawing his hand from the bellcord which he had already touched to order him back again we can talk more freely without him well hugh here you are under your own roof eating a charitable dinner and treated as hospitably as if you did not own all you can see for a circle of five miles around you it was a lucky idea of the old ladys by the way to think of ordering this rudesheimer in our character of dutchmen how amazingly well she is looking boy  indeed she is and i am delighted to see it i do not know why my grandmother may not live these twenty years for even that would not make her near as old as sus who i have often heard her say was a middleaged man when she was born  true she seems like an elder sister to me rather than as a mother and is altogether a most delightful old woman but if we had so charming an old woman to receive us so are there also some very charming young womenhey hugh  i am quite of your way of thinking sir and must say i have not in many a day seen two as charming creatures as i have met with here  twoumph a body would think one might suffice pray which may be the two master padishah  patt and mary warren of course the other two are well enough but these two are excellent  my uncle ro looked grum but he said nothing for some time eating is always an excuse for a broken conversation and he ate away as if resolute not to betray his disappointment but it is a hard matter for a gentleman to do nothing but eat at table and so he was obliged to talk  everything looks well here after all hugh observed my uncle these antirenters may have done an infinite deal of harm in the way of abusing principles but they do not seem to have yet destroyed any material things  it is not their cue sir the crops are their own and as they hope to own the farms it would be scarcely wise to injure what no doubt they begin to look on as their own property too as for the nest house grounds farm etc i dare say they will be very willing to leave me them for a while longer provided they can get everything else away from me  for a time longer at least though that is the folly of those who expect to get along by concessions as if men were ever satisfied with the yielding of a part when they ask that which is wrong in itself without sooner or later expecting to get the whole as well might one expect the pickpocket who had abstracted a dollar to put back twoandsixpence change but things really look well around the place  so much the better for us though to my judgment and taste miss mary warren looks better than anything else i have yet seen in america  another umph expressed my uncles dissatisfactiondispleasure would be too strong a wordand he continued eating  you have really some good rhenish in your cellar hugh resumed uncle ro after tossing off one of the knowing green glasses fullthough i never could understand why any man should wish to drink his wine out of green when he might do it out of crystal it must have been a purchase of mine made when we were last in germany and for the use of my mother  as you please sir it neither adds nor subtracts from the beauty of martha and her friend  since you are disposed to make these boyish allusions be frank with me and say at once how you like my wards  meaning of course sir my own sister exclusively i will be as sincere as possible and say that as to miss marston i have no opinion at all and as to miss coldbrooke she is what in europe would be called a fine woman  you can say nothing as to her mind hugh for you have had no opportunity for forming an opinion  not much of a one i will own nevertheless i should have liked her better had she spared the allusion to the proper person who is one day to forge a chain for my sister to begin with  poh poh that is the mere squeamishness of a boy i do not think her in the least pert or forward and your construction would be tant soi peu vulgar  put your own construction on it mon oncle i do not like it  i do not wonder young men remain unmarried they are getting to be so ultra in their tastes and notions  a stranger might have retorted on an old bachelor for such a speech by some allusion to his own example but i well knew that my uncle ro had once been engaged and that he lost the object of his passion by death and too much respected his constancy and true sentiments ever to joke on such subjects i believe he felt the delicacy of my forbearance rather more than common for he immediately manifested a disposition to relent and to prove it by changing the subject  we can never stay here tonight he said it would be at once to proclaim our namesour name i might saya name that was once so honored and beloved in this town and which is now so hated  no no not as bad as that we have done nothing to merit hatred  raison de plus for hating us so much the more heartily when men are wronged who have done nothing to deserve it the evildoer seeks to justify his wickedness to himself by striving all he can to calumniate the injured party and the more difficulty he finds in doing that to his mind the more profound is his hatred rely on it we are most sincerely disliked here on the spot where we were once both much beloved such is human nature  at that moment john returned to the room to see how we were getting on and to count his forks and spoons for i saw the fellow actually doing it my uncle somewhat indiscreetly i fancied but by merely following the chain of thought then uppermost in his mind detained him in conversation  dis broperty he said inquiringly is de broperty of one yeneral littlepage i hears say  not of the general who was madam littlepages husband and who has long been dead but of his grandson mr hugh  und vhere might he be dis mr hughmight he be at hand or might he not  no hes in europe that is to say in hengland john thought england covered most of europe though he had long gotten over his wish to return mr hugh and mr roger be both habsent from the country just now  dat ist unfortunate for dey dells me dere might be moch troobles hereabouts and injinacting  there is indeed and a wicked thing it is that there should be anything of the sort  und vhat might be der reason of so moch trooblesand vhere ist der blame  well that is pretty plain i fancy returned john who in consequence of being a favored servant at headquarters fancied himself a sort of cabinet minister and had much pleasure in letting his knowledge be seen the tenants on this estate wants to be landlords and as they cant be so so long as mr hugh lives and wont let em why they just tries all sorts of schemes and plans to frighten people out of their property i never go down to the village but i has a talk with some of them and that in a way that might do them some good if anything can  und vhat dost you sayand vid whom dost you talk as might do dem moch goot  why you see i talks more with one squire newcome as they calls him though hes no more of a real squire than you beonly a sort of an attorney like such as they has in this country you come from the old countries i believe  ja jadat ist yeswe comes from charmany so you can say vhat you pleases  they has queer squires in this part of the world if truth must be said but thats neither here nor there though i give this mr seneca newcome as good as he sends what is it you wants i says to himyou cant all be landlordssomebody must be tenants and if you didnt want to be tenants how come you to be so land is plenty in this country and cheap too and why didnt you buy your land at first instead of coming to rent of mr hugh and now when you have rented to be quarrelling about the very thing you did of your own accord  dere you didst dell em a goot ting and vhat might der squire say to dat  oh he was quite dumfounded at first then he said that in old times when people first rented these lands they didnt know as much as they do now or they never would have done it  und you could answer dat or vast it your durn to be dumfounded  i pitched it into him as they says i did says i hows this says iyou are forever boasting how much you americans knowand how the people knows everything that ought to be done about politics and religionand you proclaim far and near that your yeomen are the salt of the earthand yet you dont know how to bargain for your leases a pretty sort of wisdom is this says i i had him there for the people round about here is only too sharp at a trade  did he own that you vast right and dat he vast wrong dis herr squire newcome  not he he will never own anything that makes against his own doctrine unless he does it ignorantly but i havent told you half of it i told him says i how is it you talk of one of the littlepage family cheating you when as you knows yourselves you had rather have the word of one of the family than have each others bonds says i you know sir it must be a poor landlord that a tenant cant and wont take his word and this they all know to be true for a gentleman as has a fine estate is raised above temptation like and has a pride in him to do what is honorable and fair and in my opinion it is good to have a few such people in a country if it be only to keep the wicked one from getting it altogether in his own keeping  und did you say dat moch to der squire  no that i just say to you two seeing that we are here talking together in a friendly way but a man neednt be ashamed to say it anywhere for its a religious truth but i says to him newcome says i you who has been living so long on the property of the littlepages ought to be ashamed to wish to strip them of it but youre not satisfied with keeping gentlemen down quite as much out of sight as you can by holding all the offices yourselves and taking all the money of the public you can lay your hands on for your own use but you wants to trample them under your feet i says and so take your revenge for being what you be says i  vell my friend said my uncle you vast a bolt man to dell all dis to der beoples of dis coontry vhere i have heard a man may say just vhat he hast a mind to say so dat he dost not speak too moch trut  thats itthats it you have been a quick scholar i find i told this mr newcome says i youre bold enough in railing at kings and nobles for you very well know says i that they are three thousand miles away from you and can do you no harm but you would no more dare get up before your masters the people here and say what you really think about em and what i have heard you say of them in private than you would dare put your head before a cannon as the gunner touched it off oh i gave him a lesson you may be sure  although there was a good deal of the english footman in johns logic and feeling there was also a good deal of truth in what he said the part where he accused newcome of holding one set of opinions in private concerning his masters and another in public is true to the life there is not at this moment within the wide reach of the american borders one demagogue to be found who might not with justice be accused of precisely the same deception there is not one demagogue in the whole country who if he lived in a monarchy would not be the humblest advocate of men in power ready to kneel at the feet of those who stood in the sovereigns presence there is not at this instant a man in power among us a senator or a legislator who is now the seeming advocate of what he wishes to call the rights of the tenants and who is for overlooking principles and destroying law and right in order to pacify the antirenters by extraordinary concessions that would not be among the foremost under a monarchial system to recommend and support the freest application of the sword and the bayonet to suppress what would then be viewed ay and be termed the rapacious longings of the disaffected to enjoy the property of others without paying for it all this is certain for it depends on a law of morals that is infallible any one who wishes to obtain a clear index to the true characters of the public men he is required to support or oppose has now the opportunity for each stands before a mirror that reflects him in his just proportions and in which the dullest eye has only to cast a glance in order to view him from head to foot  the entrance of my grandmother put a stop to johns discourse he was sent out of the room on a message and then i learned the object of this visit my sister had been let into the secret of our true characters and was dying to embrace me my dear grandmother rightly enough had decided it would be to the last degree unkind to keep her in ignorance of our presence and the fact known nature had longings which must be appeased i had myself been tempted twenty times that morning to snatch patt to my heart and kiss her as i used to do just after my beard began to grow and she was so much of a child as to complain the principal thing to be arranged then was to obtain an interview for me without awakening suspicion in the observers my grandmothers plan was arranged however and she now communicated it to us  there was a neat little dressingroom annexed to marthas bedroom in that the meeting was to take place  she and mary warren are now there waiting for your appearance hugh  mary warrendoes she then know who i am  not in the least she has no other idea than that you are a young german of good connections and well educated who has been driven from his own country by political troubles and who is reduced to turn his musical taste and acquisitions to account in the way you seem to do until he can find some better employment all this she had told us before we met you and you are not to be vain hugh if i add that your supposed misfortunes and great skill with the flute and good behavior have made a friend of one of the best and most truehearted girls i ever had the good fortune to know i say good behavior for little just now can be ascribed to good looks  i hope i am not in the least revolting in appearance in this disguise for my sisters sake  the hearty laugh of my dear old grandmother brought me up and i said no more coloring i believe a little at my own folly even uncle ro joined in the mirth though i could see he wished mary warren even safely translated along with her father and that the latter was archbishop of canterbury i must acknowledge that i felt a good deal ashamed of the weakness i had betrayed  you are very well hugh darling continued my grandmother though i must think you would be more interesting in your own hair which is curling than in that long wig still one can see enough of your face to recognize it if one has the clew and i told martha at the first that i was struck with a certain expression of the eyes and smile that reminded me of her brother but there they are mary and martha in the drawingroom waiting for your appearance the first is so fond of music and indeed is so practised in it as to have been delighted with your flute and she has talked so much of your skill as to justify us in seeming to wish for a further exhibition of your skill henrietta and ann having less taste that way have gone together to select bouquets in the greenhouse and there is now an excellent opportunity to gratify your sister i am to draw mary out of the room after a little while when you and martha may say a word to each other in your proper characters as for you roger you are to open your box again and i will answer for it that will serve to amuse your other wards should they return too soon from their visit to the gardener  everything being thus explained and our dinner ended all parties proceeded to the execution of the plan each in his or her designated mode when my grandmother and i reached the dressingroom however martha was not there though mary warren was her bright but serene eyes full of happiness and expectation martha had retired to the inner room for a moment whither my grandmother suspecting the truth followed her as i afterward ascertained my sister fearful of not being able to suppress her tears on my entrance had withdrawn in order to struggle for selfcommand without betraying our secret i was told to commence an air without waiting for the absent young lady as the strain could easily be heard through the open door  i might have played ten minutes before my sister and grandmother came out again both had been in tears though the intense manner in which mary warren was occupied with the harmony of my flute probably prevented her from observing it to me however it was plain enough and glad was i to find that my sister had succeeded in commanding her feelings in a minute or two my grandmother profited by a pause to rise and carry away with her mary warren though the last left the room with a reluctance that was very manifest the pretence was a promise to meet the divine in the library on some business connected with the sundayschools  you can keep the young man for another air martha observed my grandmother and i will send jane to you as i pass her room  jane was my sisters own maid and her room was close at hand and i dare say dear grandmother gave her the order in mary warrens presence as soon as she quitted the room else might mary warren well be surprised at the singularity of the whole procedure but jane did not make her appearance nevertheless as for myself i continued to play as long as i thought any ear was near enough to hear me then i laid aside my flute in the next instant patt was in my arms where she lay some time weeping but looking inexpressibly happy  oh hugh what a disguise was this to visit your own house in she said as soon as composed enough to speak  would it have done to come here otherwise you know the state of the country and the precious fruits our boasted tree of liberty is bringing forth the owner of the land can only visit his property at the risk of his life  martha pressed me in her arms in a way to show how conscious she was of the danger i incurred in even thus visiting her after which we seated ourselves side by side on a little divan and began to speak of those things that were most natural to a brother and sister who so much loved each other and who had not met for five years my grandmother had managed so well as to prevent all interruption for an hour if we saw fit to remain together while to others it should seem as if patt had dismissed me in a few minutes  not one of the other girls suspects in the least who you are said martha smiling when we had got through with the questions and answers so natural to our situation i am surprised that henrietta has not for she prides herself on her penetration she is as much in the dark as the others however  and miss mary warrenthe young lady who has just left the roomhas she not some small notion that i am not a common dutch musicgrinder  patt laughed and that so merrily as to cause the tones of her sweet voice to fill me with delight as i remembered what she had been in childhood and girlhood five years before and she shook her bright tresses off her cheeks ere she would answer  no hugh she replied she fancies you an uncommon dutch musicgrinder an artiste that not only grinds but who dresses up his harmonies in such a way as to be palatable to the most refined taste how came mary to think you and my uncle two reduced german gentlemen  and does the dear girl believethat is does miss mary warren do us so much honor as to imagine that  indeed she does for she told us as much as soon as she got home and henrietta and ann have made themselves very merry with their speculations on the subject of miss warrens great incognito they call you herzog von geige  thank them for that i am afraid i answered a little too pointedly for i saw that patt seemed surprised but your american towns are just such halfway things as to spoil young women making them neither refined and polished as they might be in real capitals while they are not left the simplicity and nature of the country  well master hugh this is being very cross about a very little and not particularly complimentary to your own sister and why not your american towns as well as oursare you no longer one of us  certainly one of yours always my dearest patt though not one of every chattering girl who may set up for a belle with her dukes of fiddle but enough of thisyou like the warrens  very much so father and daughter the first is just what a clergyman should be of a cultivation and intelligence to fit him to be any mans companion and a simplicity like that of a child your remember his predecessorso dissatisfied so selfish so lazy so censorious so unjust to every person and thing around him and yet so exacting and at the same time so  what thus far you have drawn his character well i should like to hear the remainder  i have said more than i ought already for one has an idea that by bringing a clergyman into disrepute it brings religion and the church into discredit too a priest must be a very bad man to have injurious things said of him in this country hugh  that is perhaps true but you like mr warren better than him who has left you  a thousand times and in all things in addition to having a most pious and sincere pastor we have an agreeable and wellbred neighbor from whose mouth in the five years that he has dwelt here i have not heard a syllable at the expense of a single fellowcreature you know how it is apt to be with the other clergy and ours in the countryforever at swords points and if not actually quarrelling keeping up a hollow peace  that is only too trueor used to be true before i went abroad  and it is so now elsewhere ill answer for it though it be so no longer here mr warren and mr peck seem to live on perfectly amicable terms though as little alike at bottom as fire and water  by the way how do the clergy of the different sects up and down the country behave on the subject of antirent  i can answer only from what i hear with the exception of mr warrens course he has preached two or three plain and severe sermons on the duty of honesty in our worldly transactions one of which was from the tenth commandment of course he said nothing of the particular trouble but everybody must have made the necessary application of the hometruths he uttered i question if another voice has been raised far and near on the subject although i have heard mr warren say the movement threatens more to demoralize new york than anything that has happened in his time  and the man down at the village  oh he goes of course with the majority when was one of that sect known to oppose his parish in anything  and mary is as sound and as highprincipled as her father  quite so though there has been a good deal said about the necessity of mr warrens removing and giving up st andrews since he preached against covetousness all the antirenters say i hear that they know he meant them and that they wont put up with it  i dare say each one fancying he was almost called out by name that is the way when conscience works  i should be very very sorry to part with mary and almost as much so to part with her father there is one thing however that mr warren himself thinks we had better have done hugh and that is to take down the canopy from over our pew you can have no notion of the noise that foolish canopy is making up and down the country  i shall not take it down it is my property and there it shall remain as for the canopy it was a wrong distinction to place in a church i am willing to allow but it never gave offence until it has been thought that a cry against it would help to rob me of my lands at halfprice or at no price at all as it may happen  all that may be true but if improper for a church why keep it  because i do not choose to be bullied out of what is my own even though i care nothing about it there might have been a time when the canopy was unsuited to the house of god and that was when those who saw it might fancy it canopied the head of a fellowcreature who had higher claims than themselves to divine favor but in times like these when men estimate merit by beginning at the other end of the social scale there is little danger of any ones falling into the mistake the canopy shall stand little as i care about it now i would actually prefer it should come down and i can fully see the impropriety of making any distinctions in the temple but it shall stand until concessions cease to be dangerous it is a right of property and as such i will maintain it if others dislike it let them put canopies over their pews too the best test in such a matter is to see who could bear it a pretty figure seneca newcome would cut for instance seated in a canopied pew even his own set would laugh at him which i fancy is more than they yet do at me  martha was disappointed but she changed the subject we next talked of our own little private affairs as they were connected with smaller matters  for whom is that beautiful chain intended hugh asked patt laughingly i can now believe the pedler when he says it is reserved for your future wife but who is that wife to be will her name be henrietta or ann  why not ask also if it will be marywhy exclude one of your companions while you include the other two  patt startedseemed surprised her cheeks flushed and then i saw that pleasure was the feeling predominant  am i too late to secure that jewel as a pendant to my chain i asked half in jest half seriously  too soon at least to attract it by the richness and beauty of the bawble a more natural and disinterested girl than mary warren does not exist in the country  be frank with me martha and say at once has she a favored suitor  why this seems really serious exclaimed my sister laughing but to put you out of your pain i will answer i know of but one one she has certainly or female sagacity is at fault  but is he one that is favored you can never know how much depends on your answer  of that you can judge for yourself it is squire seneky newcome as he is called hereaboutsthe brother of the charming opportunity who still reserves herself for you  and they are as rank antirenters as any male and female in the country  they are rank newcomites and that means that each is for himself would you believe it but opportunity really gives herself airs with mary warren  and how does mary warren take such an assumption  as a young person shouldquietly and without manifesting any feeling but there is something quite intolerable in one like opportunity newcomes assuming a superiority over any true lady mary is as well educated and as well connected as any of us and is quite as much accustomed to good company while opportunity here patt laughed and then added hurriedly but you know opportunity as well as i do  oh yes she is la vertue or the virtue and je suis venue pour  the latter allusion patt understood well enough having laughed over the story a dozen times and she laughed again when i explained the affair of the solitude  then came a fit of sisterly feeling patt insisted on taking off my wig and seeing my face in its natural dress i consented to gratify her when the girl really behaved like a simpleton first she pushed about my curls until they were arranged to suit the silly creature when she ran back several steps clapped her hands in delight then rushed into my arms and kissed my forehead and eyes and called me her brotherher only brotherher dear dear hugh and by a number of other such epithets until she worked herself and me too into such an excess of feeling that we sat down side by side and each had a hearty fit of crying perhaps some such burst as this was necessary to relieve our minds and we submitted to it wisely  my sister wept the longest as a matter of course but as soon as she had dried her eyes she replaced the wig and completely restored my disguise trembling the whole time lest some one might enter and detect me  you have been very imprudent hugh in coming here at all she said while thus busy you can form no notion of the miserable state of the country or how far the antirent poison has extended or the malignant nature of its feeling the annoyances they have attempted with dear grandmother are odious you they would scarcely leave alive  the country and the people must have strangely altered then in five years our new york population has hitherto had very little of the assassinlike character tar and feathers are the blackguards and have been the petty tyrants weapons from time immemorial in this country but not the knife  and can anything sooner or more effectually alter a people than longings for the property of others is not the love of money the root of all eviland what right have we to suppose our ravensnest population is better than another when that sordid feeling is thoroughly aroused you know you have written one yourself that all the american can or does live for is money  i have written you dear that the country in its present condition leaves no other incentive to exertion and therein it is cursed military fame military rank even are unattainable under our system the arts letters and science bring little or no reward and there being no political rank that a man of refinement would care for men must live for money or live altogether for another state of being but i have told you at the same time martha that notwithstanding all this i believe the american a less mercenary being in the ordinary sense of the word than the european that two men might be bought for instance in any european country for one here this last i suppose to be the result of the facility of making a living and the habits it produces  never mind causes mr warren says there is a desperate intention to rob existing among these people and that they are dangerous as yet they do a little respect women but how long they will do that one cannot know  it may all be so it must be so respecting what i have heard and read yet this vale looks as smiling and as sweet at this very moment as if an evil passion never sullied it but depend on my prudence which tells me that we ought now to part i shall see you again and again before i quit the estate and you will of course join us somewhereat the springs perhapsas soon as we find it necessary or expedient to decamp  martha promised this of course and i kissed her previously to separating no one crossed my way as i descended to the piazza which was easily done since i was literally at home i lounged about on the lawn a few minutes and then showing myself in front of the library windows i was summoned to the room as i had expected  uncle ro had disposed of every article of the fine jewelry that he had brought home as presents for his wards the pay was a matter to be arranged with mrs littlepage which meant no pay at all and as the donor afterward told me he liked this mode of distributing the various ornaments better than presenting them himself as he was now certain each girl had consulted her own fancy  as the hour of the regular dinner was approaching we took our leave soon after not without receiving kind and pressing invitations to visit the nest again ere we left the township of course we promised all that was required intending most faithfully to comply on quitting the house we returned toward the farm though not without pausing on the lawn to gaze around us on a scene so dear to both from recollection association and interest but i forget this is aristocratical the landlord has no right to sentiments of this nature which are feelings that the sublimated liberty of the law is beginning to hold in reserve solely for the benefit of the tenant     chapter xii       there shall be in england seven half penny loaves sold for a      penny the threehooped pot shall have ten hoops and i will      make it felony to drink small beer all the realm shall be in      common and in cheapside shall my palfrey go to grassjack      cade   i do not see sir i remarked as we moved on from the last of these pauses why the governors and the legislators and writers on this subject of antirentism talk so much of feudality and chickens and days works and durable leases when we have none of these while we have all the disaffection they are said to produce  you will understand that better as you come to know more of men no party alludes to its weak points it is just as you say but the proceedings of your tenants for instance give the lie to the theories of the philanthropists and must be kept in the background it is true that the disaffection has not yet extended to onehalf or to onefourth of the leased estates in the country perhaps not to onetenth if you take the number of the landlords as the standard instead of the extent of their possessions but it certainly will should the authorities tamper with the rebels much longer  if they tax the incomes of the landlords under the durable rent system why would not the parties aggrieved have the same right to take up arms to resist such an act of oppression as our fathers had in 1776  their cause would be better for that was only a constructive right and one dependent on general principles whereas this is an attempt at a most mean evasion of a written law the meanness of the attempt being quite as culpable as its fraud every human being knows that such a tax so far as it has any object beyond that of an electionsop is to choke off the landlords from the maintenance of their covenants which is a thing that no state can do directly without running the risk of having its law pronounced unconstitutional by the courts of the united states if indeed not by its own courts  the court of errors think you  the court of errors is doomed by its own abuses catiline never abused the patience of rome more than that mongrel assembly has abused the patience of every sound lawyer in the state fiat justitia ruat coelum is interpreted now into let justice be done and the court fall no one wishes to see it continued and the approaching convention will send it to the capulets if it do nothing else to be commended it was a pitiful imitation of the house of lords system with this striking difference the english lords are men of education and men with a vast deal at stake and their knowledge and interests teach them to leave the settlement of appeals to the legal men of their body of whom there are always a respectable number in addition to those in possession of the woolsack and the bench whereas our senate is a court composed of small lawyers country doctors merchants farmers with occasionally a man of really liberal attainments under the direction of an acute and honest judge as most of our true judges actually are the court of errors would hardly form such a jury as would allow a creditable person to be tried by his peers in a case affecting character for instance and here we have it set up as a court of the last resort to settle points of law  i see it has just made a decision in a libel suit at which the profession sneers  it has indeed now look at that very decision for instance as the measure of its knowledge an editor of a newspaper holds up a literary man to the world as one anxious to obtain a small sum of money in order to put it into wall street for shaving purposes now the only material question raised was the true signification of the word shaving if to say a man is a shaver in the sense in which it is applied to the use of money be bringing him into discredit then was the plaintiffs declaration sufficient if not it was insufficient being wanting in what is called an innuendo the dictionaries and men in general understand by shaving extortion and nothing else to call a man a shaver is to say he is an extortioner without going into details but in wall street and among moneydealers certain transactions that in their eyes and by the courts are not deemed discreditable have of late been brought within the category of shaving thus it is technically or by convention among bankers termed shaving if a man buy a note at less than its face which is a legal transaction on the strength of this last circumstance as is set forth in the published opinions the highest court of appeals in new york has decided that it does not bring a man into discredit to say he is a shaverthus making a conventional signification of the brokers of wall street higher authority for the use of the english tongue than the standard lexicographers and all the rest of those who use the language on the same principle if a set of pickpockets at the five points should choose to mystify their trade a little by including in the term to filch the literal borrowing of a pockethandkerchief it would not be a libel to accuse a citizen of filching his neighbors handkerchief  but the libel was uttered to the world and not to the brokers of wall street only who might possibly understand their own terms  very true and was uttered in a newspaper that carried the falsehood to europe for the writer of the charge when brought up for it publicly admitted that he had no ground for suspecting the literary man of any such practices he called it a joke every line of the context however showed it was a malicious charge the decision is very much as if a man who is sued for accusing another of stealing should set up a defence that he meant stealing hearts for the word is sometimes used in that sense when men use epithets that convey discredit in their general meaning it is their business to give them a special signification in their own contexts if such be their real intention but i much question if there be a respectable moneydealer even in wall street who would not swear if called on in a court of justice so to do that he thought the general charge of shaving discreditable to any man  and you think the landlords whose rents were taxed sir would have a moral right to resist  beyond all question as it would be an incometax on them only of all in the country what is more i am fully persuaded that two thousand men embodied to resist such tyranny would look down the whole available authority of the state inasmuch as i do not believe citizens could be found to take up arms to enforce a law so flagrantly unjust men will look on passively and see wrongs inflicted that would never come out to support them by their own acts but we are approaching the farm and there are tom miller and his hired men waiting our arrival  it is unnecessary to repeat in detail all that passed in this our second visit to the farmhouse miller received us in a friendly manner and offered us a bed if we would pass the night with him this business of a bed had given us more difficulty than anything else in the course of our peregrinations new york has long got over the twoman and threeman bed system as regards its best inns at no respectable new york inn is a gentleman now asked to share even his room without an apology and a special necessity with another much less his bed but the rule does not hold good as respects pedlers and musicgrinders we had ascertained that we were not only expected to share the same bed but to occupy that bed in a room filled with other beds there are certain things that get to be second nature and that no masquerading will cause to go down and among others one gets to dislike sharing his room and his toothbrush this little difficulty gave us more trouble that night at tom millers than anything we had yet encountered at the taverns bribes had answered our purpose but this would not do so well at a farm residence at length the matter was got along with by putting me in the garret where i was favored with a straw bed under my own roof the decent mrs miller making many apologies for not having a feathersmootherer into which to squash me i did not tell the good woman that i never used feathers summer or winter for had i done so she would have set me down as a poor creature from oppressed germany where the folks did not know how to live nor would she have been so much out of the way quoad the beds for in all my journeyings i never met with such uncomfortable sleeping as one finds in germany off the rhine and out of the large towns23  footnote 23 as the honorable gentleman from albany does not seem to understand the precise signification of provincial i can tell him that one sign of such a character is to admire a bed at an american country inneditor  while the negotiation was in progress i observed that josh brigham as the antirent disposed hireling of millers was called kept a watchful eye and an open ear on what was done and said of all men on earth the american of that class is the most distrustful as he calls it himself and has his suspicions the soonest awakened the indian on the warpaththe sentinel who is posted in a fog near his enemy an hour before the dawn of daythe husband that is jealous or the priest that has become a partisan is not a whit more apt to fancy conjecture or assert than the american of that class who has become distrustful this fellow brigham was the very beau ideal of the suspicious school being envious and malignant as well as shrewd observant and covetous the very fact that he was connected with the injins as turned out to be the case added to his natural propensities the consciousness of guilt and rendered him doubly dangerous the whole time my uncle and myself were crossing over and figuring in in order to procure for each a room though it were only a closet his watchful distrustful looks denoted how much he saw in our movements to awaken curiosity if not downright suspicion when all was over he followed me to the little lawn in front of the house whither i had gone to look at the familiar scene by the light of the setting sun and began to betray the nature of his own suspicions by his language  the old man meaning my uncle ro must have plenty of gold watches about him he said to be so plaguy particlar consarnin his bed peddlin sich matters is a ticklish trade i guess in some parts  ja it ist dangerous somevhere but it might not be so in dis goot coontry  why did the old fellow then try so hard to get that little room all to himself and shove you off into the garret we hired men dont like the garret which is a hot place in summer  in charmany one man hast ever one bed i answered anxious to get rid of the subject  i bounced a little as one has onehalf of a bed would be nearer to the truth though the other half might be in another room  oh thats it ist waal every country has its ways i spose jarmany is a despate aristocratic land i take it  ja dere ist moch of de old feudal law and feudal coostum still remaining in charmany  landlords a plenty i guess if the truth was known leases as long as my arm i calkerlate  vell dey do dink in charmany dat de longer might be de lease de better it might be for de denant  as that was purely a german sentiment or at least not an american sentiment according to the notions broached by statesmen among ourselves i made it as dutch as possible by garnishing it well with ds  thats a droll idee now we think here that a lease is a bad thing and the less you have of a bad thing the better  vell dat ist queer so queer as i dont know vhat vill dey do as might help it  oh the legislature will set it all right they mean to pass a law to prevent any more leases at all  und vill de beople stand dat dis ist a free country efferybody dells me and vilt der beoples agree not to hire lands if dey vants to  oh you see we wish to choke the landlords off from their present leases and by and by when that is done the law can let up again  but ist dat right der law should be joost und not hold down und let oop as you calls it  you dont understand us yet i see why thats the prettiest and the neatest legislation on airth thats just what the bankrupt law did  vhat did her bankroopt law do bray vhat might you mean nowi dont know  do why it did wonders for some on us i can tell you it paid our debts and let us up when we was down and thats no trifle i can tell you i took the benefit as it is called myself  youyou might take der benefit of a bankrupt law you lifing here ast a hiret man on dis farm  sartain why not all a man wanted under that law was about 60 to carry him through the mill and if he could rake and scrape that much together he might wipe off as long a score as he pleased i had been dealin in speckylation and thats a make or break business i can tell you well i got to be about 42322 wuss than nothin but having about 90 in hand i went through the mill without getting cogged the smallest morsel a man doos a good business to my notion when he can make twenty cents pay a whull dollar of debt  und you did dat goot business  you may say that and now i means to make antirentism get me a farm cheapwhat i call cheap and that ant none of your 30 or 40 an acre i can tell you  it was quite clear that mr joshua brigham regarded these transactions as so many pragmatic sanctions that were to clear the moral and legal atmospheres of any atoms of difficulty that might exist in the forms of old opinions to his getting easily out of debt in the one case and suddenly rich in the other i dare say i looked bewildered but i certainly felt so at thus finding myself face to face with a low knave who had a deliberate intention as i now found to rob me of a farm it is certain that joshua so imagined for inviting me to walk down the road with him a short distance he endeavored to clear up any moral difficulties that might beset me by pursuing the subject  you see resumed joshua i will tell you how it is these littlepages have had this land long enough and its time to give poor folks a chance the young spark that pretends to own all the farms you see far and near never did anything for em in his life only to be his fathers son now to my notion a man should do suthin for his land and not be obligated for it to mere natur this is a free country and what right has one man to land more than another  or do his shirt or do his dobacco or do his coat or do anyding else  well i dont go as far as that a man has a right to his clothes and maybe to a horse or a cow but he has no right to all the land in creation the law gives a right to a cow as agin execution  und doesnt der law gif a right to der landt too you must not depend on der law if you might succeed  we like to get as much law as we can on our side americans like law now youll read in all the booksour books i mean them thats printed herethat the americans be the most lawful people on airth and that theyll do more

indignation meetins and both sides have em in abundance when things get to be warm our meetin tomorrow is for deliberation and libertyprinciples generally we may pass some indignation resolutions about aristocrats for nobody can bear them critturs in this part of the country i can tell you  lest this manuscript should get into the hands of some of those who do not understand the real condition of new york society it may be well to explain that aristocrat means in the parlance of the country no other than a man of gentlemanlike tastes habits opinions and associations there are gradations among the aristocracy of the state as well as among other men thus he who is an aristocrat in a hamlet would be very democratic in a village and he of the village might be no aristocrat in the town at all though in the towns generally indeed always when their population has the least of a town character the distinction ceases altogether men quietly dropping into the traces of civilized society and talking or thinking very little about it to see the crying evils of american aristocracy then one must go into the country there indeed a plenty of cases exist thus if there happen to be a man whose property is assessed at twentyfive per cent above that of all his neighborswho must have right on his side bright as a cloudless sun to get a verdict if obliged to appeal to the lawswho pays fifty per cent more for everything he buys and receives fifty per cent less for everything he sells than any other person near himwho is surrounded by rancorous enemies in the midst of a seeming state of peacewho has everything he says and does perverted and added to and lied aboutwho is traduced because his dinnerhour is later than that of other folkswho dont stoop but is straight in the backwho presumes to doubt that this country in general and his own township in particular is the focus of civilizationwho hesitates about signing his name to any flagrant instance of ignorance bad taste or worse morals that his neighbors may get up in the shape of a petition remonstrance or resolutiondepend on it that man is a prodigious aristocrat and one who for his many offences and manner of lording it over mankind deserves to be banished i ask the readers pardon for so abruptly breaking in upon joshuas speech but such very different notions exist about aristocrats in different parts of the world that some such explanation was necessary in order to prevent mistakes i have forgotten one mark of the tribe that is perhaps more material than all the rest which must not be omitted and is thisif he happen to be a man who prefers his own pursuits to public life and is regardless of popularity he is just guilty of the unpardonable sin the people will forgive anything sooner than this though there are folks who fancy it as infallible a sign of an aristocrat not to chew tobacco but unless i return to joshua the reader will complain that i cause him to stand still  no no continued mr brigham anything but an aristocrat for me i hate the very name of the sarpents and wish there warnt one in the land tomorrow we are to have a great antirent lecturer out  a vhat  a lecturer one that lecturs you understand on antirentism temperance aristocracy government or any other grievance that may happen to be uppermost have you no lecturers in jarmany  ja ja dere ist lecturers in das universitiesblenty of dem  well we have em universal and particlar as we happen to want em tomorrow were to have one they tell me the smartest man that has appeared in the cause he goes it strong and the injins mean to back him up with all sorts of shrieks and whoopins your hurdygurdy there makes no sort of music to what our tribe can make when we fairly open our throats  vell dis ist queer i vast told dat der americans vast all philosophers und dat all dey didt vast didt in a toughtful and sober manner und now you dells me dey screams deir arguments like injins  that we do i wish youd been here in the hardcider and logcabin times and youd a seen reason and philosophy as you call it i was a whig that summer though i went democrat last season theres about five hundred on us in this country that makes the most of things i can tell you whats the use of a vote if a body gets nothin by it but tomorrow youll see the business done up and matters detarmined for this part of the world in fine style we know what were about and we mean to carry things through quite to the end  und vhat do you means to do  well seein that you seem to be of the right sort and be so likely to put on the injin shirt ill tell you all about it we mean to get good and old farms at favorable rates thats what we mean to do the peoples up and in arnest and what the people want theyll have this time they want farms and farms they must have whats the use of havin a government of the people if the peoples obliged to want farms weve begun agin the rensselaers and the durables and the quartersales and the chickens but we dont by no manner of means think of eending there what should we get by that a man wants to get suthin when he puts his foot into a matter of this natur we know whos our frinds and whos our inimies could we have some men i could name for governors all would go clear enough the first winter we would tax the landlords out and law em about in one way and another so as to make em right down glad to sell the last rod of their lands and that cheap too  und who might own these farms all oop and down der coontry dat i see  as the law now stands littlepage owns em but if we alter the law enough he wunt if we can only work the legislature up to the stickin pint we shall get all we want would you believe it the man wunt sell a single farm they say but wishes to keep every one on em for himself is that to be borne in a free country theyd hardly stand that in jarmany im thinkin a man that is such an aristocrat as to refuse to sell anything i despise  vell dey stand to der laws in charmany and broperty is respected in most coontries you vouldnt do away wid der rights of broperty if you mights i hopes  not i if a man owns a watch or a horse or a cow im for having the law such that a poor man can keep em even agin execution were getting the laws pretty straight on them pints in old york i can tell you a poor man let him be ever so much in debt can hold on to a mighty smart lot of things nowadays and laugh at the law right in its face ive known chaps that owed as much as 200 hold on to as good as 300 though most of their debts was for the very things they held on to  what a picture is this yet is it not true a state of society in which a man can contract a debt for a cow or his household goods and laugh at his creditor when he seeks his pay on the one hand and on the other legislators and executives lending themselves to the chicanery of another set that are striving to deprive a particular class of its rights of property directly in the face of written contracts this is straining at the gnat and swallowing the camel with a vengeance and all for votes does any one really expect a community can long exist favored by a wise and justicedispensing providence in which such things are coolly attempteday and coolly done it is time that the american began to see things as they are and not as they are said to be in the speeches of governors fourthofjuly orations and electioneering addresses i write warmly i know but i feel warmly and i write like a man who sees that a most flagitious attempt to rob him is tampered with by some in power instead of being met as the boasted morals and intelligence of the country would require by the stern opposition of all in authority cursesdeep deep cursesere long will fall on all who shrink from their duty in such a crisis even the very men who succeed if succeed they should will in the end curse the instruments of their own success24  footnote 24 that mr hugh littlepage does not feel or express himself too strongly on the state of things that has now existed among us for long long years the following case but one that illustrates the melancholy truth among many will show at a time when the tenants of an extensive landlord to whom tens of thousands were owing for rent were openly resisting the law and defeating every attempt to distrain though two ordinary companies of even armed constables would have put them down the sheriff entered the house of that very landlord and levied on his furniture for debt had that gentleman on the just and pervading principle that he owed no allegiance to an authority that did not protect him resisted the sheriffs officer he would have gone to the states prison and there he might have staid until his last hour of service was expendededitor  a firstrate lecturer on feudal tenors joshua was not in the least particular in his language but in the substance he knew what he was talking about as well as some who are in high places chickens and days works we expect a great deal from this man who is paid well for coming  und who might bay himder state  nowe havent got to that yet though some think the state will have to do it in the long run at present the tenants are taxed so much on the dollar accordin to rent or so much an acre and that way the needful money is raised but one of our lecturers told us a time back that it was money put out at use and every man ought to keep an account of what he give for the time was not far off when he would get it back with double interest it is paid now for a reform he said and when the reform is obtained no doubt the state would feel itself so much indebted to us all that it would tax the late landlords until we got all our money back again and more too  dat vould pe a bretty speculation ja dat might be most bootiful  why yes it wouldnt be a bad operation living on the inimy as a body might say but youll not catch our folks livin on themselves i can tell you that they might do without societies no weve an object and when folks has an object they commonly look sharp ater it we dont let on all we want and mean openly and youll find folks among us thatll stoutly deny that antirenters has anything to do with the injin system but folks ant obliged to believe the moon is all cheese unless theyve a mind to some among us maintain that no man ought to hold more than a thousand acres of land while others think natur has laid down the law on that pint and that a man shouldnt hold more than he has need on  und vich side dost you favorvich of dese obinions might not be yours  im not particlar so i get a good farm i should like one with comfortable buildins ont and one that hasnt been worked to death for them two principles i think id stand out but whether there be four hundred acres or four hundred and fifty or even five hundred im no way onaccommodatin i expect therell be trouble in the eend when we come to the division but im not the man to make it i spose i shall get my turn at the town offices and other chances and givin me my rights to them ill take up with almost any farm young littlepage has though i should rather have one in the main valley here than one more out of the way still i dont set myself down as at all particlar  und vhat do you expect to bay mr littlepage for der farm ast you might choose  that depends on circumstances the injins mainly expect to come in cheap some folks think its best to pay suthin as it might stand agin law better should it come to that while other some see no great use in paying anything them thats willing to pay mainly hold out for paying the principal of the first rents  i doesnt oonderstandt vhat you means by der brincipal of der first rents  its plain enough when you get the lay ont you see these lands were let pretty low when they were first taken up from the forest in order to get folks to live here thats the way were obliged to do in america or people wont come many tenants paid no rent at all for six eight or ten years and ater that until their three lives run out as it is called they paid only sixpence an acre or six dollars and a quarter on the hundred acres that was done you see to buy men to come here at all and you can see by the price that was paid how hard a time they must have had ont now some of our folks hold that the whull time ought to be countedthat which was rent free and that which was notin a way that ill explain to you for id have you to know i havent entered into this business without looking to the right and the wrong ont  exblain exblain i might hear you exblain and you most exblain  why youre in a hurry friend griezenbach or whatever your name be but ill explain if you wish it spose now a lease run thirty yearsten on nothin and twenty on sixpences well a hundred sixpences makes fifty shillings and twenty times fifty makes a thousand as all the rent paid in thirty years if you divide a thousand by thirty it leaves thirtythree shillings and a fractionjoshua calculated like an american of his class accurately and with rapidityfor the average rent of the thirty years calling thirtythree shillings four dollars and its plaguey little more we have that for the interest which at seven per cent will make a principal of rather more than fifty dollars though not as much as sixty as sich matters ought to be done on liberal principles they say littlepage ought to take fifty dollars and give a deed for the hundred acres  und vhat might be der rent of a hoondred acres nowhe might get more dan sixpence today  that he does most all of the farms are running out on second and some on third leases four shilling an acre is about the average of the rents accordin to circumstances  den you dinks der landlort ought to accept one years rent for der farms  i dont look on it in that light he ought to take fifty dollars for a hundred acres you forget the tenants have paid for their farms over and over again in rent they feel as if they have paid enough and that it was time to stop  extraordinary as this reasoning may seem in most mens minds i have since found it is a very favorite sentiment among antirenters are we to go on and pay rent forever they ask with logical and virtuous indignation  und vhat may be der aferage value of a hoondred acre farm in dis part of de coontry i inquired  from two thousand five hundred to three thousand dollars it would be more but tenants wont put good buildings on farms you know seein that they dont own them i heard one of our leaders lamentin that he didnt foresee what times were comin to when he repaired his old house or he would have built a new one but a man cant foretell everything i dare say many has the same feelins now  den you dinks herr littlebage ought to accept 50 for vhat is worth 2500 das seems fery little  you forget the back rent that has been paid and the work the tenant has done what would the farm be good for without the work that has been done on it  ja jai oonderstandst und vhat vould der work be goot for vidout der landt on which it vast done  this was rather an incautious question to put to a man as distrustful and roguish as joshua brigham the fellow cast a lowering and distrustful look at me but ere there was time to answer miller of whom he stood in healthful awe called him away to look after the cows  here then i had enjoyed an opportunity of hearing the opinions of one of my own hirelings on the interesting subject of my right to my own estate i have since ascertained that while these sentiments are sedulously kept out of view in the proceedings of the government which deals with the whole matter as if the tenants were nothing but martyrs to hard bargains and the landlords their taskmasters of greater or less lenity they are extensively circulated in the infected districts and are held to be very sound doctrines by a large number of the bone and sinew of the land of course the reasoning is varied a little to suit circumstances and to make it meet the facts but of this school is a great deal and a very great deal of the reasoning that circulates on the leased property and from what i have seen and heard already i make no doubt that there are quasi legislators among us who instead of holding the manly and only safe doctrine which ought to be held on such a subject and saying that these deluded men should be taught better are ready to cite the very fact that such notions do exist as a reason for the necessity of making concessions in order to keep the peace at the cheaper rate that profound principle of legislation which concedes the right in order to maintain quiet is admirably adapted to forming sinners and if carried out in favor of all who may happen to covet their neighbors goods would in a short time render this community the very paradise of knaves  as for joshua brigham i saw no more of him that night for he quitted the farm on leave just as it got to be dark where he went i do not know but the errand on which he left us could no longer be a secret to me as the family retired early and we ourselves were a good deal fatigued everybody was in bed by nine oclock and judging from myself soon asleep previously to saying goodnight however miller told us of the meeting of the next day and of his intention to attend it     chapter xiii      he knows the game how true he keeps the wind     silenceking henry vi   after an early breakfast next morning the signs of preparation for a start became very apparent in the family not only miller but his wife and daughter intended to go down to little neest as the hamlet was almost invariably called in that fragment of the universe in contradistinction to the neest proper i found afterward that this very circumstance was cited against me in the controversy it being thought lèsemajesté for a private residence to monopolize the major of the proposition while a hamlet had to put up with the minor the latter moreover including two taverns which are exclusively the property of the public there being exclusiveness with the public as well as with aristocratsmore especially in all things that pertain to power or profit as to the two last even joshua brigham was much more of an aristocrat than i was myself it must be admitted that the americans are a humane population for they are the only people who deem that bankruptcy gives a claim to public favor25  footnote 25 absurd as this may seem it is nevertheless true and for a reason that is creditable rather than the reversea wish to help along the unfortunate it is a great mistake however as a rule to admit of any other motive for selecting for public trusts than qualificationeditor  as respects the two nests had not so much more serious matter been in agitation the precedence of the names might actually have been taken up as a question of moment i have heard of a lawsuit in france touching a name that has been illustrious in that country for a period so long as to extend beyond the reach of manas indeed was apparent by the matter in controversyand which name has obtained for itself a high place in the annals of even our own republic i allude to the house of grasse which was seated prior to the revolution and may be still at a place called grasse in the southern part of the kingdom the town being almost as famous for the manufacture of pleasant things as the family for its exploits in arms about a century since the marquis de grasse is said to have had a procès with his neighbors of the place to establish the fact whether the family gave its name to the town or the town gave its name to the family the marquis prevailed in the struggle but greatly impaired his fortune in achieving that new victory as my house or its predecessor was certainly erected and named while the site of little nest was still in the virgin forest one would think its claims to the priority of possession beyond dispute but such might not prove to be the case on a trial there are two histories among us as relates to both public and private things the one being as nearly true as is usual while the other is invariably the fruits of the human imagination everything depending so much on majorities that soon gets to be the most authentic tradition which has the most believers for under the system of numbers little regard is paid to superior advantages knowledge or investigation all depending on three as against two which makes one majority i find a great deal of this spurious history is getting to be mixed up with the antirent controversy facts coming out daily that long have lain dormant in the graves of the past these facts affect the whole structure of the historical picture of the state and colony leaving touches of black where the pencil had originally put in white and placing the high lights where the shadows have before always been understood to be in a word men are telling the stories as best agrees with their present views and not at all as they agree with the fact  it was the intention of tom miller to give my uncle ro and me a dearborn to ourselves while he drove his wife kitty and a help as far as the little neest in a twohorse vehicle that was better adapted to such a freight thus disposed of then we all left the place in company just as the clock in the farmhouse entry struck nine i drove our horse myself and mine he was in fact every hoof vehicle and farming utensil on the nest farm being as much my property under the old laws as the hat on my head it is true the millers had now been fifty years or more nay nearly sixty in possession and by the new mode of construction it is possible some may fancy that we had paid them wages so long for working the land and for using the cattle and utensils that the title in a moral sense had passed out of me in order to pass into tom miller if use begets a right why not to a wagon and horse as well as to a farm  as we left the place i gazed wistfully toward the nest house in the hope of seeing the form of some one that i loved at a window on the lawn or in the piazza not a soul appeared however and we trotted down the road a short distance in the rear of the other wagon conversing on such things as came uppermost in our minds the distance we had to go was about four miles and the hour named for the commencement of the lecture which was to be the great affair of the day had been named at eleven this caused us to be in no hurry and i rather preferred to coincide with the animal i drove and move very slowly than hurry on and arrive an hour or two sooner than was required in consequence of this feeling on our part miller and his family were soon out of sight it being their wish to obtain as much of the marvels of the day as was possible  the road of course was perfectly well known to my uncle and myself but had it not been there was no danger of missing our way as we had only to follow the general direction of the broad valley through which it ran then miller had considerately told us that we must pass two churches or a church and a meetinus the spires of both of which were visible most of the way answering for beacons referring to this term of meetinghouse does it not furnish conclusive evidence of itself of the inconsistent folly of that wisest of all earthly beings man it was adopted in contradistinction from and in direct opposition to the supposed idolatrous association connected with the use of the word church at a time when certain sects would feel offended at hearing their places of worship thus styled whereas at the present day those very sectarians are a little disposed to resent this exclusive appropriation of the proscribed word by the sects who have always adhered to it as offensively presuming and in a slight degree arisdogradic i am a little afraid that your outandouters in politics religion love of liberty and other human excellences are somewhat apt to make these circuits in their eccentric orbits and to come out somewhere quite near the places from which they started  the road between the nest house and little nest the hamlet is rural and quite as agreeable as is usually found in a part of the country that is without waterviews or mountain scenery our new york landscapes are rarely nay never grand as compared with the noble views one finds in italy switzerland spain and the finer parts of europe but we have a vast many that want nothing but a finish to their artificial accessories to render them singularly agreeable such is the case with the principal vale of ravensnest which at the very moment we were driving through it struck my uncle and myself as presenting a picture of rural abundance mingled with rural comfort that one seldom sees in the old world where the absence of enclosures and the concentration of the dwellings in villages leave the fields naked and with a desolate appearance in spite of their high tillage and crops  this is an estate worth contending for now said my uncle as we trotted slowly on although it has not hitherto been very productive to its owner the first halfcentury of an american property of this sort rarely brings much to its proprietor beyond trouble and vexation  and after that time the tenant is to have it pretty much at his own price as a reward for his own labor  what evidences are to be found wherever the eye rests of the selfishness of man and his unfitness to be left to the unlimited control of his own affairs in england they are quarrelling with the landlords who do compose a real aristocracy and make the laws about the manner in which they protect themselves and the products of their estates while here the true owner of the soil is struggling against the power of numbers with the people who are the only aristocrats we possess in order to maintain his right of property in the simplest and most naked form a common vice is at the bottom of both wrongs and that is the vice of selfishness  but how are abuses like those of which we complain hereabuses of the most formidable character of any that can exist since the oppressors are so many and so totally irresponsible by their numbersto be avoided if you give the people the right of selfgovernment  god help the nation where selfgovernment in its literal sense exists hugh the term is conventional and properly viewed means a government in which the source of authority is the body of the nation and does not come from any other sovereign when a people that has been properly educated by experience calmly selects its agents and coolly sets to work to adopt a set of principles to form its fundamental law or constitution the machine is on the right track and will work well enough so long as it is kept there but this running off and altering the fundamental principles every time a political faction has need of recruits is introducing tyranny in its worst forma tyranny that is just as dangerous to real liberty as hypocrisy is to religion  we were now approaching st andrews church and the rectory with its glebe the latter lying contiguous to the churchyard or as it is an americanism to say the graveyard there had been an evident improvement around the rectory since i had last seen it shrubbery had been planted care was taken of the fences the garden was neatly and well worked the fields looked smooth and everything denoted that it was new lords and new laws the last incumbent had been a whining complaining narrowminded selfish and lazy priest the least estimable of all human characters short of the commission of the actual and higher crimes but his successor had the reputation of being a devout and real christianone who took delight in the duties of his holy office and who served god because he loved him i am fully aware how laborious is the life of a country priest and how contracted and mean is the pittance he in common receives and how much more he merits than he gets if his reward were to be graduated by things here but this picture like every other has its different sides and occasionally men do certainly enter the church from motives as little as possible connected with those that ought to influence them  there is the wagon of mr warren at his door observed my uncle as we passed the rectory can it be that he intends visiting the village also on an occasion like this  nothing more probable sir if the character patt has given of him be true i answered she tells me he has been active in endeavoring to put down the covetous spirit that is getting uppermost in the town and has even preached boldly though generally against the principles involved in the question the other man they say goes for popularity and preaches and prays with the antirenters  no more was said but on we went soon entering a large bit of wood a part of the virgin forest this wood exceeding a thousand acres in extent stretched down from the hills along some broken and otherwise little valuable land and had been reserved from the axe to meet the wants of some future day it was mine therefore in the fullest sense of the word and singular as it may seem one of the grounds of accusation brought against me and my predecessors was that we had declined leasing it thus on the one hand we were abused for having leased our land and on the other for not having leased it the fact is we in common with other extensive landlords are expected to use our property as much as possible for the particular benefit of other people while those other people are expected to use their property as much as possible for their own particular benefit  there was near a mile of forest to pass before we came out again in the open country at about a mile and a halfs distance from the hamlet on our left this little forest did not extend more than a hundred rods terminating at the edge of the rivuletor creek as the stream is erroneously called and for no visible reason but the fact that it was only a hundred feet widewhich swept close under the broken ground mentioned at this point on our right however the forest stretched away for more than a mile until indeed it became lost and confounded with other portions of wood that had been reserved for the farms on which they grew as is very usual in america in cases where roads pass through a forest a second growth had shot up on each side of this highway which was fringed for the whole distance with large bushes of pine hemlock chestnut and maple in some places these bushes almost touched the track while in others a large space was given we were winding our way through this wood and had nearly reached its centre at a point where no house was visibleand no house indeed stood within half a mile of uswith the view in front and in rear limited to some six or eight rods in each direction by the young trees when our ears were startled by a low shrill bandittilike whistle i must confess that my feelings were anything but comfortable at that interruption for i remembered the conversation of the previous night i thought by the sudden jump of my uncle and the manner he instinctively felt where he ought to have had a pistol to meet such a crisis that he believed himself already in the hands of the philistines  a half minute sufficed to tell us the truth i had hardly stopped the horse in order to look around me when a line of men all armed and disguised issued in single file from the bushes and drew up in the road at right angles to its course there were six of these injins as they are called and indeed call themselves each carrying a rifle horn and pouch and otherwise equipped for the field the disguises were very simple consisting of a sort of loose calico huntingshirt and trowsers that completely concealed the person the head was covered by a species of hood or mask equally of calico that was fitted with holes for the eyes nose and mouth and which completed the disguise there were no means of recognizing a man thus equipped unless it might be by the stature in cases in which the party was either unusually tall or unusually short a middlesized man was perfectly safe from recognition so long as he did not speak and could keep his equipments those who did speak altered their voices as we soon found using a jargon that was intended to imitate the imperfect english of the native owners of the soil although neither of us had ever seen one of the gang before we knew these disturbers of the public peace to be what in truth they were the instant our eyes fell on them one could not well be mistaken indeed under the circumstances in which we were placed but the tomahawks that one or two carried the manner of their march and other pieces of mummery that they exhibited would have told us the fact had we met them even in another place  my first impulse was to turn the wagon and to endeavor to lash the lazy beast i drove into a run fortunately before the attempt was made i turned my head to see if there was room for such an exploit and saw six others of these injins drawn across the road behind us it was now so obviously the wisest course to put the best face on the matter that we walked the horse boldly up to the party in front until he was stopped by one of the gang taking him by the bridle  sago sago cried one who seemed to act as a chief and whom i shall thus designate speaking in his natural voice though affecting an indian pronunciation how do how dowhere come from ehwhere go eh what you say tooup rent or down rent eh  ve ist two charmans returned uncle ro in his most desperate dialect the absurdity of men who spoke the same language resorting to such similar means of deception tempting me sorely to laugh in the fellows faces ve ist two charmans dat ist goin to hear a mans sbeak about bayin rent und to sell vatches might you buy a vatch goot shentlemans  although the fellows doubtless knew who we were so far as our assumed characters went and had probably been advised of our approach this bait took and there was a general jumping up and down and a common powwowing among them indicative of the pleasure such a proposal gave in a minute the whole party were around us with some eight or ten more who appeared from the nearest bushes we were helped out of the wagon with a gentle violence that denoted their impatience as a matter of course i expected that all the trinkets and watches which were of little value fortunately would immediately disappear for who could doubt that men engaged in attempting to rob on so large a scale as these fellows were engaged in would hesitate about doing a job on one a little more diminutive i was mistaken however some sort of imperceptible discipline keeping those who were thus disposed of whom there must have been some in such a party in temporary order the horse was left standing in the middle of the highway right glad to take his rest while we were shown the trunk of a fallen tree near by on which to place our box of wares a dozen watches were presently in the hands of as many of these seeming savages who manifested a good deal of admiration at their shining appearance while this scene which was half mummery and half nature was in the course of enactment the chief beckoned me to a seat on the further end of the tree and attended by one or two of his companions he began to question me as follows  mind tell truth he

injin by the arm and led him away grumbling and growling as the thunder mutters in the horizon after the storm has passed on for myself i made several profitable reflections concerning the inevitable fate of those who attempt to serve god and mammon this antirentism is a question in which so far as a governor is concerned there is but one course to pursue and that is to enforce the laws by suppressing violence and leaving the parties to the covenants of leases to settle their differences in the courts like the parties to any other contracts it is a poor rule that will not work both ways many a landlord has made a hard bargain for himself and i happen to know of one case in particular in which a family has long been and is still kept out of the enjoyment of a very valuable estate as to any benefit of importance purely by the circumstance that a weakminded possessor of the property fancied he was securing souls for paradise by letting his farms on leases for ninetynine years at nominal rents with a covenant that the tenant should go twice to a particular church now nothing is plainer than that it is a greater hardship to the citizen who is the owner of many farms so situated than to the citizen who is the lessee of only one with a hard covenant and on general principles the landlord in question would be most entitled to relief since one man who suffers a good deal is more an object of true commiseration than many who suffer each a little what would a governor be apt to say if my landlord should go with his complaints to the foot of the executive chair and tell him that the very covenant which had led his predecessor into the mistake of thus wasting his means was openly disregarded that farms worth many thousands of dollars had now been enjoyed by the tenants for near a century for mere nominal rents and that the owner of the land in fee had occasion for his property etc etc would the governor recommend legislative action in that case would the length of such leases induce him to recommend that no lease should exceed five years in duration would the landlords who should get up a corps of injins to worry their tenants into an abandonment of their farms be the objects of commiserationand would the law slumber for years over their rebellions and depredations until two or three murders aroused public indignation let them answer that know as a landlord i should be sorry to incur the ridicule that would attend even a public complaint of the hardships of such a case a common sneer would send me to the courts for my remedy if i had one and the whole difference between the if and ifs of the two cases would be that a landlord gives but one vote while his tenants may be legion26  footnote 26 this is no invented statement but strictly one that is

gave back the watch he was examining and in less than half a minute we were alone on the log this movement was so sudden that it left us in a little doubt as to the proper mode of proceeding my uncle however coolly set about replacing his treasures in their box while i went to the horse which had shaken off his headstall and was quietly grazing along the roadside a minute or two might have been thus occupied when the trotting of a horse and the sound of wheels announced the near approach of one of those vehicles which have got to be almost nationala dearborn or a onehorse wagon as it came out from behind a screen of bushes formed by a curvature in the road i saw that it contained the rev mr warren and his sweet daughter  the road being narrow and our vehicle in its centre it was not possible for the newcomers to proceed until we got out of the way and the divine pulled up as soon as he reached the spot where we stood  good morning gentlemen said mr warren cordially and using a word that in his mouth i felt meant all it expressed good morning gentlemen are you playing handel to the woodnymphs or reciting eclogues  neider neider herr pastor we meet wid coostomers here and dey has joost left us answered uncle ro who certainly enacted his part with perfect âplomb and the most admirable mimicry as to manner guten tag guten tag might der herr pastor been going to der village  we are i understand there is to be a meeting there of the misguided men called antirenters and that several of my parishioners are likely to be present on such an occasion i conceive it to be my duty to go among my own particular people and whisper a word of advice nothing can be farther from my notions of propriety than for a clergyman to be mingling and mixing himself up with political concerns in general but this is a matter that touches morality and the minister of god is neglectful of his duty who keeps aloof when a word of admonition might aid in preventing some wavering brother from the commission of a grievous sin this last consideration has brought me out to a scene i could otherwise most heartily avoid  this might be well enough i said to myself but what has your daughter to do in such a scene is the mind of mary warren then after all no better than vulgar minds in generaland can she find a pleasure in the excitement of lectures of this cast and in that of public meetings no surer test can be found of cultivation than the manner in which it almost intuitively shrinks from communion unnecessarily with tastes and principles below its own level yet here was the girl with whom i was already half in loveand that was saying as little as could be said tooactually going down to the little nest to hear an itinerant lecturer on political economy utter his crudities and to see and be seen i was grievously disappointed and would at the moment have cheerfully yielded the best farm on my estate to have had the thing otherwise my uncle must have had some similar notion by the remark he made  und doost das jung frau go to see the injins too to bersuade em dey ist fery vicked  marys face had been a little pale for her i thought as the wagon drew up but it immediately became scarlet she even suffered her head to droop a little and then i perceived that she cast an anxious and tender glance at her father i cannot say whether this look were or were not intended for a silent appeal unconsciously made but the father without even seeing it acted as if he fancied it might be  no no he said hurriedly this dear girl is doing violence to all her feelings but one in venturing to such a place her filial piety has proved stronger than her fears and her tastes and when she found that go i would no argument of mine could persuade her to remain at home i hope she will not repent it  the color did not quit marys face but she looked grateful at finding her true motives appreciated and she even smiled though she said nothing my own feelings underwent another sudden revulsion there was no want of those tastes and inclinations that can alone render a young woman attractive to any man of sentiment but there was high moral feeling and natural affection enough to overcome them in a case in which she thought duty demanded the sacrifice it was very little probable that anything would or could occur that day to render the presence of mary warren in the least necessary or useful but it was very pleasant to me and very lovely in her to think otherwise under the strong impulses of her filial attachment  another idea however and one far less pleasant suggested itself to the minds of my uncle and myself and almost at the same instant it was this the conversation was carried on in a high key or loud enough to be heard at some little distance the horse and part of the wagon interposing between the speakers and there was the physical certainty that some of those whom we knew to be close at hand in the bushes must hear all that was said and might take serious offense at it under this apprehension therefore my uncle directed me to remove our own vehicle as fast as possible in order that the clergyman might pass mr warren however was in no hurry to do this for he was utterly ignorant of the audience he had and entertained that feeling toward us that men of liberal acquirements are apt to feel when they see others of similar educations reduced by fortune below their proper level he was consequently desirous of manifesting his sympathy with us and would not proceed even after i had opened the way for him  it is a painful thing continued mr warren to find men mistaking their own cupidity for the workings of a love of liberty to me nothing is more palpable than that this antirent movement is covetousness incited by the father of evil yet you will find men among us who fancy they are aiding the cause of free institutions by joining in it when in truth they are doing all they can to bring them into discredit and to insure their certain downfall in the end  this was sufficiently awkward for by going near enough to give a warning in a low voice and have that warning followed by a change in the discourse we should be betraying ourselves and might fall into serious danger at the very moment the clergyman was thus speaking i saw the masked head of streak o lightning appearing through an opening in some small pines that grew a little in the rear of the wagon a position that enabled him to hear every syllable that was uttered i was afraid to act myself and trusted to the greater experience of my uncle  whether the last also saw the pretended chief was more than i knew but he decided to let the conversation go on rather leaning to the antirent side of the question as the course that could do no serious evil while it might secure our own safety it is scarcely necessary to say all these considerations glanced through our minds so swiftly as to cause no very awkward or suspicious pause in the discourse  brhaps dey doosnt like to bay rent put in my uncle with a roughness of manner that was in accordance with the roughness of the sentiment beoples might radder haf deir landts for nuttin dan bay rents for dem  in that case then let them go and buy lands for themselves if they do not wish to pay rent why did they agree to pay rent  may be dey changes deir minds vhat is goot today doosnt always seem goot tomorrow  that may be true but we have no right to make others suffer for our own fickleness i dare say now that it might be better for the whole community that so large a tract of land as that included in the manor of rensselaerwyck for instance and lying as it does in the very heart of the state should be altogether in the hands of the occupants than have it subject to the divided interest that actually exists but it does not follow that a change is to be made by violence or by fraudulent means in either of the latter cases the injury done the community would be greater than if the present tenures were to exist a thousand years i dare say much the larger portion of those farms can be bought off at a moderate advance on their actual moneyvalue and that is the way to get rid of the difficulty not by bullying owners out of their property if the state finds a political consideration of so much importance for getting rid of the tenures let the state tax itself to do so and make a liberal offer in addition to what the tenants will offer and ill answer for it the landlords will not stand so much in their own way as to decline good prices  but maybes dey wont sell all der landts dey may wants to keep some of dem  they have a right to say yes or no while we have no right to juggle or legislate them out of their property the legislature of this state has quite lately been exhibiting one of the most pitiable sights the world has seen in my day it has been struggling for months to find a way to get round the positive provisions of laws and constitutions in order to make a sacrifice of the rights of a few to secure the votes of the many  votes ist a goot ding at election dimeshaw haw haw exclaimed my uncle  mr warren looked both surprised and offended the coarseness of manner that my uncle had assumed effected its object with the injins but it almost destroyed the divines previous good opinion of our characters and quite upset his notions of our refinement and principles there was no time for explanations however for just as my uncles broad and wellacted haw haw haw was ended a shrill whistle was heard in the bushes and some forty or fifty of the injins came whooping and leaping out from their cover filling the road in all directions immediately around the wagons  mary warren uttered a little scream at this startling scene and i saw her arm clinging to that of her father by a sort of involuntary movement as if she would protect him at all hazards then she seemed to rally and from that instant her character assumed an energy an earnestness a spirit and an intrepidity that i had least expected in one so mild in aspect and so really sweet in disposition  all this was unnoticed by the injins they had their impulses too and the first thing they did was to assist mr warren and his daughter to alight from the wagon this was done not without decorum of manner and certainly not without some regard to the holy office of one of the parties and to the sex of the other nevertheless it was done neatly and expeditiously leaving us all mr warren and mary my uncle and myself with a cluster of some fifty injins around us standing in the centre of the highway     chapter xiv      no toil in despair       no tyrant no slave     no breadtax is there       with a maw like the grave   all this was so suddenly done as scarce to leave us time to think there was one instant notwithstanding while two injins were assisting mary warren to jump from the wagon when my incognito was in great danger perceiving that the young lady was treated with no particular disrespect i so far overcame the feeling as to remain quiet though i silently changed my position sufficiently to get near her elbow where i could and did whisper a word or two of encouragement but mary thought only of her father and had no fears for herself she saw none but him trembled only for him dreaded and hoped for him alone  as for mr warren himself he betrayed no discomposure had he been about to enter the desk his manner could not have been more calm he gazed around him to ascertain if it were possible to recognize any of his captors but suddenly turned his head away as if struck with the expediency of not learning their names even though it had been possible he might be put on the stand as a witness against some misguided neighbor did he know his person all this was so apparent in his benevolent countenance that i think it struck some among the injins and still believe it may have had a little influence on their treatment of him a pot of tar and a bag of feathers had been brought into the road when the gang poured out of the bushes but whether this were merely accidental or it had originally been intended to use them on mr warren i cannot say the offensive materials soon and silently disappeared and with them every sign of any intention to offer personal injury  what have i done that i am thus arrested in the public highway by men armed and disguised contrary to law demanded the divine as soon as the general pause which succeeded the first movement invited him to speak this is a rash and illegal step that may yet bring repentance  no preachee now answered streak o lightning preachee for meetin no good for road  mr warren afterward admitted to me that he was much relieved by this reply the substitution of the word meeting for church giving him the grateful assurance that this individual at least was not one of his own people  admonition and remonstrance may always be useful when crime is meditated you are now committing a felony for which the states prison is the punishment prescribed by the laws of the land and the duties of my holy office direct me to warn you of the consequences the earth itself is but one of gods temples and his ministers need never hesitate to proclaim his laws on any part of it  it was evident that the calm severity of the divine aided no doubt by his known character produced an impression on the gang for the two who had still hold of his arms released them and a little circle was now formed in the centre of which he stood  if you will enlarge this circle my friends continued mr warren and give room i will address you here where we stand and let you know my reasons why i think your conduct ought to be  no nono preachee here suddenly interrupted streak o lightning go to village go to meetinuspreachee theretwo preacher denbring wagon and put him in march march path open  although this was but an injin imitation of indian sententiousness and somewhat of a caricature everybody understood well enough what was meant mr warren offered no resistance but suffered himself to be placed in millers wagon with my uncle at his side without opposition then it was however that he bethought himself of his daughter though his daughter had never ceased to think of him i had some little difficulty in keeping her from rushing into the crowd and clinging to his side mr warren rose and giving her an encouraging smile bade her be calm told her he had nothing to fear and requested that she would enter his own wagon again and return home promising to rejoin her as soon as his duties at the village were discharged  here is no one to drive the horse my child but our young german acquaintance the distance is very short and if he will thus oblige me he can come down to the village with the wagon as soon as he has seen you safe at our own door  mary warren was accustomed to defer to her fathers opinions and she so far submitted now as to permit me to assist her into the wagon and to place myself at her side whip in hand proud of and pleased with the precious charge thus committed to my care these arrangements made the injins commenced their march about half of them preceding and the remainder following the wagon that contained their prisoner four however walked on each side of the vehicle thus preventing the possibility of escape no noise was made and little was said the orders being given by signs and signals rather than by words  our wagon continued stationary until the party had got at least a hundred yards from us no one giving any heed to our movements i had waited thus long for the double purpose of noting the manner of the proceedings among the injins and to obtain room to turn at a spot in the road a short distance in advance of us and which was wider than common to this spot i now walked the horse and was in the act of turning the animals head in the required direction when i saw mary warrens little gloved hand laid hurriedly on the reins she endeavored to keep the head of the horse in the road  no no said the charming girl speaking earnestly as if she would not be denied we will follow my father to the village i may not must not cannot quit him  the time and place were every way propitious and i determined to let mary warren know who i was by doing it i might give her confidence in me at a moment when she was in distress and encourage her with the hope that i might also befriend her father at any rate i was determined to pass for an itinerant dutch musicgrinder with her no longer  miss mary miss warren i commenced cautiously and with quite as much hesitation and diffidence of feeling as of manner i am not what i seemthat is i am no musicgrinder  the start the look and the alarm of my companion were all eloquent and natural her hand was still on the reins and she now drew on them so hard as actually to stop the horse i thought she intended to jump out of the vehicle as a place no longer fit for her  be not alarmed miss warren i said eagerly and i trust so earnestly as to inspire a little confidence you will not think the worse of me at finding i am your countryman instead of a foreigner and a gentleman instead of a musicgrinder i shall do all you ask and will protect you with my life  this is so extraordinaryso unusual the whole country appears unsettled pray sir if you are not the person whom you have represented yourself to be who are you  one who admires your filial love and couragewho honors you for them both i am the brother of your friend marthai am hugh littlepage  the little hand now abandoned the reins and the dear girl turned half round on the cushion of the seat gazing at me in mute astonishment i had been cursing in my heart the lank locks of the miserable wig i was compelled to wear ever since i had met with mary warren as unnecessarily deforming and ugly for one might have as well a becoming as a horridly unbecoming disguise off went my cap therefore and off went the wig after it leaving my own shaggy curls for the sole setting of my face  mary made a slight exclamation as she gazed at me and the deadly paleness of her countenance was succeeded by a slight blush a smile too parted her lips and i fancied she was less alarmed  am i forgiven miss warren i asked and will you recognize me for the brother of your friend  does marthadoes mrs littlepage know of this the charming girl at length asked  both i have had the happiness of being embraced by both my grandmother and my sister you were taken out of the room yesterday by the first that i might be left alone with the last for that very purpose  i see it all now yes i thought it singular then though i felt there could be no impropriety in any of mrs littlepages acts dearest martha how well she played her part and how admirably she has kept your secret  it is very necessary you see the condition of the country and will understand that it would be imprudent in me to appear openly even on my own estate i have a written covenant authorizing me to visit every farm near us to look after my own interests yet it may be questioned if it would be safe to visit one among them all now that the spirits of misrule and covetousness are up and doing  replace your disguise at once mr littlepage said mary eagerly dodo not delay an instant  i did as desired mary watching the process with interested and at the same time amused eyes i thought she looked as sorry as i felt myself when that lank villanous wig was again performing its office  am i as well arranged as when we first met miss warren do i appear again the musicgrinder  i see no difference returned the dear girl laughing how musical and cheering to me were the sounds of her voice in that little burst of sweet feminine merriment indeed indeed i do not think even martha could know you now for the person you the moment before seemed  my disguise is then perfect i was in hopes it left a little that my friends might recognize while it effectually concealed me from my enemies  it doesoh it does now i know who you are i find no difficulty in tracing in your features the resemblance to your portrait in the family gallery at the nest the eyes too cannot be altered without artificial brows and those you have not  this was consoling but all that time mr warren and the party in front had been forgotten perhaps it was excusable in two young persons thus situated and who had now known each other a week to think more of what was just then passing in the wagon than to recollect the tribe that was marching down the road and the errand they were on i felt the necessity however of next consulting my companion as to our future movements mary heard me in evident anxiety and her purpose seemed unsettled for she changed color under each new impulse of her feelings  if it were not for one thing she answered after a thoughtful pause i should insist on following my father  and what may be the reason of this change of purpose  would it be altogether safe for you mr littlepage to venture again among those misguided men  never think of me miss warren you see i have been among them already undetected and it is my intention to join them again even should i first have to take you home decide for yourself  i will then follow my father my presence may be the means of saving him from some indignity  i was rejoiced at this decision on two accounts of which one might have been creditable enough to me while the other i am sorry to say was rather selfish i delighted in the dear girls devotion to her parent and i was glad to have her company as long as possible that morning without entering into a very close analysis of motives however i drove down the road keeping the horse on a very slow gait being in no particular hurry to quit my present fair companion  mary and i had now a free and in some sense a confidential dialogue her manner toward me had entirely changed for while it maintained the modesty and retenue of her sex and station it displayed much of that frankness which was the natural consequence of her great intimacy at the nest and as i have since ascertained of her own ingenuous nature the circumstance too that she now felt she was with one of her own class who had opinions habits tastes and thoughts like her own removed a mountain of restraint and made her communications natural and easy i was near an hour i do believe in driving the two miles that lay between the point where the injins had met and the village and in that hour mary warren and i became better acquainted than would have been the case under ordinary circumstances in a year  in the first place i explained the reasons and manners of my early and unexpected return home and the motives by which i had been governed in thus coming in disguise on my own property then i said a little of my future intentions and of my disposition to hold out to the last against every attempt on my rights whether they might come from the open violence and unprincipled designs of those below or the equally unprincipled schemes of those above a spurious liberty and political cant were things that i despised as every intelligent and independent man must and i did not intend to be persuaded i was an aristocrat merely because i had the habits of a gentleman at the very moment when i had less political influence than the hired laborers in my own service  mary warren manifested a spirit and an intelligence that surprised me she expressed her own belief that the proscribed classes of the country had only to be true to themselves to be restored to their just rights and that on the very principle by which they were so fast losing them the opinions she thus expressed are worthy of being recorded  everything that is done in that way said this gentle but admirable creature has hitherto been done on a principle that is quite as false and vicious as that by which they are now oppressed we have had a great deal written and said lately about uniting people of property but it has been so evidently with an intention to make money rule and that in its most vulgar and vicious manner that persons of right feelings would not unite in such an effort but it does seem to me mr littlepage that if the gentlemen of new york would form themselves into an association in defence of their rights and for nothing else and let it be known that they would not be robbed with impunity they are numerous enough and powerful enough to put down this antirent project by the mere force of numbers thousands would join them for the sake of principles and the country might be left to the enjoyment of the fruits of liberty without getting any of the fruits of its cant  this is a capital idea and might easily be carried out it requires nothing but a little selfdenial with the conviction of the necessity of doing something if the downward tendency is to be ever checked short of civil war and a revolution that is to let in despotism in its more direct form despotism in the indirect is fast appearing among us as it is  i have heard of a proposition for the legislature to appoint special commissioners who are to settle all the difficulties between the landlords and the tenants i remarked a scheme in the result of which some people profess to have a faith i regard it as only one of the many projects that have been devised to evade the laws and institutions of the country as they now exist  mary warren seemed thoughtful for a moment then her eye and face brightened as if she were struck with some thought suddenly after which the color deepened on her cheek and she turned to me as if half doubting and yet half desirous of giving utterance to the idea that was uppermost  you wish to say something miss warren  i dare say it will be very sillyand i hope you wont think it pedantic in a girl but really it does look so to mewhat difference would there be between such a commission and the starchamber judges of the stuarts mr littlepage  not much in general principles certainly as both would be the instruments of tyrants but a very important one in a great essential the starchamber courts were legal whereas this commission would be flagrantly illegal the adoption of a special tribunal to effect certain purposes that could exist only in the very teeth of the constitution both in its spirit and its letter yet this project comes from men who prate about the spirit of the institutions which they clearly understand to be their own spirit let that be what it may  providence i trust will not smile on such desperate efforts to do wrong said mary warren solemnly  one hardly dare look into the inscrutable ways of a power that has its motives so high beyond our reach providence permits much evil to be done and is very apt to be as frederick of prussia expressed it on the side of strong battalions so far as human vision can penetrate of one thing however i feel certain and that is that they who are now the most eager to overturn everything to effect present purposes will be made to repent of it bitterly either in their own persons or in those of their descendants  that is what is meant my father says by visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations but there is the party with their prisoners just entering the village who is your companion mr littlepageone hired to act as an assistant  it is my uncle himself you have often heard i should think of mr roger littlepage  mary gave a little exclamation at hearing this and she almost laughed after a short pause she blushed brightly and turned to me as she said  and my father and i have supposed you the one a pedler and the other a streetmusician  but beddlars and moosicgrinders of goot etications as might be panished for deir bolitics  now indeed she laughed out for the long and frank dialogue we had held together made this change to broken english seem as if a third person had joined us i profited by the occasion to exhort the dear girl to be calm and not to feel any apprehension on the subject of her father i pointed out how little probable it was that violence would be offered to a minister of the gospel and showed her by the number of persons that had collected in the village that it was impossible he should not have many warm and devoted friends present i also gave her permission to nay requested she would tell mr warren the fact of my uncles and my own presence and the reasons of our disguises trusting altogether to the very obvious interest the dear girl took in our safety that she would add of her own accord the necessary warning on the subject of secrecy just as this conversation ended we drove into the hamlet and i helped my fair companion to alight  mary warren now hastened to seek her father while i was left to take care of the horse this i did by fastening him to the rails of a fence that was lined for a long distance by horses and wagons drawn up by the wayside surprisingly few persons in the country at this day are seen on horseback notwithstanding the vast difference in the amount of the population ten horsemen were to be met with forty years ago by all accounts on the highways of the state for one today the wellknown vehicle called a dearborn with its four light wheels and mere shell of a box is in such general use as to have superseded almost every other species of conveyance coaches and chariots are no longer met with except in the towns and even the coachee the english sociable which was once so common has very generally given way to a sort of carriagewagon that seems a very general favorite my grandmother who did use the statelylooking and elegant chariot in town had nothing but this carriagewagon in the country and i question if onehalf of the population of the state would know what to call the former vehicle if they should see it  as a matter of course the collection of people assembled at little nest on this occasion had been brought together in dearborns of which there must have been between two and three hundred lining the fences and crowding the horsesheds of the two inns the american countryman in the true sense of the word is still quite rustic in many of his notions though on the whole less marked in this particular than his european counterpart as a rule he has yet to learn that the little liberties which are tolerated in a thinly peopled district and which are of no great moment when put in practice under such circumstances become oppressive and offensive when reverted to in places of much resort the habits of popular control too come to aid in making them fancy that what everybody does in their part of the country can have no great harm in it it was in conformity with this tendency of the institutions perhaps that very many of the vehicles i have named were thrust into improper places stopping up the footways impeding the entrances to doors here and there letting down bars without permission and garnishing orchards and pastures with onehorse wagons nothing was meant by all these liberties beyond a desire to dispose of the horses and vehicles in the manner easiest to their owners nevertheless there was some connection between the institutions and these little liberties which some statesmen might fancy existed in the spirit of the former this however was a capital mistake inasmuch as the spirit of the institutions is to be found in the laws which prohibit and punish all sorts of trespasses and which are enacted expressly to curb the tendencies of human nature no no as my uncle ro says nothing can be less alike sometimes than the spirit of institutions and their tendencies  i was surprised to find nearly as many females as men had collected at the little nest on this occasion as for the injins after escorting mr warren as far as the village as if significantly to admonish him of their presence they had quietly released him permitting him to go where he pleased mary had no difficulty in finding him and i saw her at his side apparently in conversation with opportunity and her brother seneca as soon as i moved down the road after securing the horses the injins themselves kept a little aloof having my uncle in their very centre not as a prisoner for it was clear no one suspected his character but as a pedler the watches were out again and near half of the whole gang seemed busy in trading though i thought that some among them were anxious and distrustful  it was a singular spectacle to see men who were raising the cry of aristocracy against those who happened to be richer than themselves while they did not possess a single privilege or power that substantially was not equally shared by every other man in the country thus openly arrayed in defiance of law and thus violently trampling the law under their feet what made the spectacle more painful was the certainty that was obtained by their very actions on the ground that no small portion of these injins were mere boys led on by artful and knavish men and who considered the whole thing as a joke when the laws fall so much into disrepute as to be the subjects of jokes of this sort it is time to inquire into their mode of administration does any one believe that fifty landlords could have thus flown into the face of a recent enactment and committed felony openly and under circumstances that had rendered their intentions no secret for a time long enough to enable the authorities to collect a force sufficient to repress them my own opinion is that had mr stephen rensselaer and mr william rensselaer and mr harry livingston and mr john hunter and mr daniel livingston and mr hugh littlepage and fifty more that i could name been caught armed and disguised in order to defend the rights of property that are solemnly guaranteed in these institutions of which it would seem to be the notion of some that it is the spirit to dispossess them we should all of us have been the inmates of states prisons without legislators troubling themselves to pass laws for our liberation this is another of the extraordinary features of american aristocracy which almost deprives the noble of the everyday use and benefit of the law it would be worth our while to lose a moment in inquiring into the process by which such strange results are brought about but it is fortunately rendered unnecessary by the circumstance that the principle will be amply developed in the course of the narrative  a stranger could hardly have felt the real character of this meeting by noting the air and manner of those who had come to attend it the armed and disguised kept themselves in a body it is true and maintained in a slight degree the appearance of distinctness from the people but many of the latter stopped to speak to these men and were apparently on good terms with them not a few of the gentler sex even appeared to have acquaintances in the gang and it would have struck a political philosopher from the other hemisphere with some surprise to have seen the people thus tolerating fellows who were openly trampling on a law that the people themselves had just enacted a political philosopher from among ourselves however might have explained the seeming contradiction by referring it to the spirit of the institutions if one were to ask hugh littlepage to solve the difficulty he would have been very apt to answer that the people of ravensnest wanted to compel him to sell lands which he did not wish to sell and that not a few of them were anxious to add to the compulsory bargains conditions as to price that would rob him of about onehalf of his estate and that what the albany philosophers called the spirit of the institutions was in fact a spirit of the devil which the institutions were expressly designed to hold in subjection  there was a good deal of outdoor management going on as might be seen by the private discussions that were held between pairs under what is called the horseshedding process this horseshedding process i understand is well known among us and extends not only to politics but to the administration of justice your regular horseshedder is employed to frequent taverns where jurors stay and drop hints before them touching the merits of causes known to be on the calendars possibly contrives to get into a room with six or eight beds in which there may accidentally be a juror or even two in a bed when he drops into a natural conversation on the merits of some matter at issue praises one of the parties while he drops dark hints to the prejudice of the other and makes his own representations of the facts in a way to scatter the seed where he is morally certain it will take root and grow all this time he is not conversing with a juror not he he is only assuming the office of the judge by anticipation and dissecting evidence before it has been given in the ear of a particular friend it is true there is a law against doing anything of the sort it is true there is law to punish the editor of a newspaper who shall publish anything to prejudice the interests of litigants it is true the horseshedding process is flagrantly wicked and intended to destroy most of the benefits of the jury system but notwithstanding all this the spirit of the institutions carries everything before it and men regard all these laws and provisions as well as the eternal principles of right precisely as if they had no existence at all or as if a freeman were above the law he makes the law and why should he not break it here is another effect of the spirit of the institutions  at length the bell rang and the crowd began to move toward the meetinus this building was not that which had been originally constructed and at the raising of which i have heard it said my dear old grandmother then a lovely and spirited girl of nineteen had been conspicuous for her coolness and judgment but a far more pretending successor the old building had been constructed on the true model of the highest dissenting spirita spirit that induced its advocates to quarrel with good taste as well as religious dogmas in order to make the chasm as wide as possiblewhile in this some concessions had been made to the temper of the times i very well remember the old meetinus at the little nest for it was pulled down to give place to its more pretending successor after i had attained my sixteenth year a description of both may let the reader into the secret of our rural church architecture  the old neest meetinus like its successor was of a hemlock frame covered with pine clapboards and painted white of late years the paint had been of a most fleeting quality the oil seeming to evaporate instead of striking in and setting leaving the coloring matter in a somewhat decomposed condition to rub off by friction and wash away in the rains the house was a stiff formal parallelogram resembling a man with high shoulders appearing to be stuck up it had two rows of formal short and ungraceful windows that being a point in orthodoxy at the period of its erection it had a tower uncouth and in some respects too large and others too small if one can reconcile the contradiction but there are anomalies of this sort in art as well as in nature on top of this tower stood a longlegged belfry which had got a very dangerous though a very common propensity in ecclesiastical matters in other words it had begun to cant it was this diversion from the perpendicular which had suggested the necessity of erecting a new edifice and the building in which the lecture on feudal tenures and aristocracy was now to be delivered  the new meetinghouse at little nest was a much more pretending edifice than its predecessor it was also of wood but a bold diverging from first principles had been ventured on not only in the physical but in the moral church the last was newschool as indeed was the first what newschool means in a spiritual sense i do not exactly know but i suppose it to be some improvement on some other improvement of the more ancient and venerable dogmas of the sect to which it belongs these improvements on improvements are rather common among us and are favorably viewed by a great number under the name of progress though he who stands at a little distance can half the time discover that the parties in progress very often come out at the precise spot from which they started  for my part i find so much wisdom in the bibleso profound a knowledge of human nature and of its tendenciescounsel so comprehensive and so safe and this solely in reference to the things of this life that i do not believe everything is progress in the right direction because it sets us in motion on paths that are not two thousand years old i believe that we have quite as much that ought to be kept as of that which ought to be thrown away and while i admit the vast number of abuses that have grown up in the old world under the spirit of their institutions as our philosophers would say i can see a goodly number that are also growing up here certainly not under the same spirit unless we refer them both as a truly wise man would to our common and miserable nature  the main departure from first principles in the sense of material things was in the fact that the new meetinghouse had only one row of windows and that the windows of that row had the pointed arch the time has been when this circumstance would have created a schism in the theological world and i hope that my youth and inexperience will be pardoned if i respectfully suggest that a pointed arch or any other arch in wood ought to create another in the world of taste  but in we went men women and children uncle ro mr warren mary seneca opportunity and all the injins excepted for some reason connected with their policy those savages remained outside until the whole audience had assembled in grave silence the orator was in or on a sort of stage which was made under the newlight system in architecture to supersede the old inconvenient and ugly pulpit supported on each side by two divines of what denomination i shall not take on myself to say it will be sufficient if i add mr warren was not one of them he and mary had taken their seats quite near the door and under the gallery i saw that the rector was uneasy the moment the lecturer and his two supporters entered the pulpit and appeared on the stage and at length he arose and followed by mary he suddenly left the building in an instant i was at their side for it struck me indisposition was the cause of so strange a movement fortunately at this moment the whole audience rose in a body and one of the ministers commenced an extempore prayer  at that instant the injins had drawn themselves up around the building close to its sides and under the open windows in a position that enabled them to hear all that passed as i afterward learned this arrangement was made with an understanding with those within one of the ministers having positively refused to address the throne of grace so long as any of the tribe were present well has it been said that man often strains at a gnat and swallows a camel     chapter xv       i tell thee jack cade the clothier means to dress the      commonwealth and turn it and put a new nap upon itking      henry vi   as i knew mary must have communicated to her father my real name i did not hesitate as i ought to have done in my actual dress and in my assumed character about following them in order to inquire if i could be of any service i never saw distress more strongly painted in any mans countenance than it was in that of mr warren when i approached so very obvious indeed was his emotion that i did not venture to obtrude myself on him but followed in silence and he and mary slowly walked side by side across the street to the stoop of a house of which all the usual inmates had probably gone in the other direction here mr warren took a seat mary still at his side while i drew near standing before him  i thank you mr littlepage the divine at length said with a smile so painful it was almost haggard for so mary tells me you should be calledi thank you for this attention sirbut it will be over in another minutei feel better now and shall be able to command myself  no more was then said concerning the reason of this distress but mary has since explained to me its cause when her father went into the meetinghouse he had not the smallest idea that anything like a religious service would be dragged into the ceremonies of such a day the two ministers on the stage first gave him the alarm when a most painful struggle occurred in his mind whether or not he should remain and be a party to the mockery of addressing god in prayer in an assembly collected to set at naught one of the plainest of his lawsnay with banded felons drawn up around the building as principal actors in the whole mummery the alternative was for him a minister of the altar to seem to quit those who were about to join in prayer and to do this moreover under circumstances which might appear to others as if he rejected all worship but that which was in accordance with his own views of right a notion that would be certain to spread far and near greatly to the prejudice of his own people but the first as he viewed the matter involved a species of blasphemy and yielding to his feelings he took the decided step he had intending to remain out of the building until the more regular business of the day commenced  it is certain mr warren who acted under the best impulse of christian feeling a reverence for god and a profound wish not to be a party in offending him with the mockery of worship under such circumstances has lost much influence and made many enemies by the step he then took the very same feeling which has raised the cry of aristocracy against every gentleman who dwells in sufficiently near contact with the masses to distinguish his habits from those around him which induces the eastern emigrant who comes from a state of society where there are no landlords to fancy those he finds here ought to be pulled down because he is not a landlord himself which enables the legislator to stand up in his place and unblushingly talk about feudal usages at the very instant he is demonstrating that equal rights are denied to those he would fain stigmatize as feudal lords has extended to religion and the church of which mr warren was a minister is very generally accused of being aristocratic too this charge is brought because it has claims which other churches affect to renounce and reject as forming no part of the faith but the last cannot remain easy under their own decision and while they shout and sing that they have found a church without a bishop they hate the church that has a bishop because it has something they do not possess themselves instead of pitying its deluded members if they believe them wrong this will not be admitted generally but it is nevertheless true and betrays itself in a hundred ways it is seen in the attempt to call their own priests bishops in the feeling so manifest whenever a cry can be raised against their existence and in the general character of these theological rallies whenever they do occur  for one i see a close analogy between my own church as it exists in this country and comparing it with that from which it sprung and to those which surround it and the true political circumstances of the two hemispheres in discarding a vast amount of surplusage in reducing the orders of the ministry in practice as well as in theory to their primitive number three and in rejecting all connection with the state the american branch of the episcopal church has assumed the position it was desirous to fill restoring as near as may be the simplicity of the apostolical ages while it does not disregard the precepts and practices of the apostles themselves it has not set itself above antiquity and authority but merely endeavored to sustain them without the encumbrances of more modern abuses thus too has it been in political things no attempt has been made to create new organic social distinctions in this country but solely to disencumber those that are inseparable from the existence of all civilized society of the clumsy machinery with which the expedients of military oppressors had invested them the real sages of this country in founding its institutions no more thought of getting rid of the landlords of the country than the church thought of getting rid of its bishops the first knew that the gradations of property were an inevitable incident of civilization that it would not be wise if it were possible to prevent the affluent from making large investments in the soil and that this could not be done in practice without leaving the relation of landlord and tenant because landlords in other parts of the world possessed privileges that were not necessary to the natural or simple existence of the character was no reason for destroying the character itself any more than the fact that the bishops of england possess an authority the apostles knew nothing of rendered it proper for the american branch of the church to do away with an office that came from the apostles but envy and jealousy do not pause to reflect on such things it is enough for them in the one case that you and yours have estates and occupy social positions that i and mine do not and cannot easily occupy and possess therefore i will oppose you and join my voice to the cry of those who wish to get their farms for nothing and in the other that you have bishops when we can have none without abandoning our present organization and doctrines  i dwell on these points at some little length because the movement of mr warren and myself at that moment had a direct influence on the circumstances that will soon be related it is probable that fully onehalf of those collected in the little nest meetinghouse that morning as they stood up and lent a sort of onesided and listless attention to the prayer were thinking of the scandalous and aristocratical conduct of mr warren in goin out o meetin just as meetin went to prayers few indeed were they who would be likely to ascribe any charitable motive for the act and probably not one of those present thought of the true and conscientious feeling that had induced it so the world wags it is certain that a malignant and bitter feeling was got up against the worthy rector on that occasion and for that act which has not yet abated and which will not abate in many hundreds until the near approach of death shall lay bare to them the true character of so many of their own feelings  it was some minutes before mr warren entirely regained his composure at length he spoke to me in his usual benevolent and mild way saying a few words that were complimentary on the subject of my return while he expressed his fears that my uncle ro and myself had been imprudent in thus placing ourselves as it might be in the lions jaws  you have certainly made your disguises so complete he added smiling as to have escaped wonderfully well so far that you should deceive mary and myself is no great matter since neither of us ever saw you before but the manner in which your nearest relatives have been misled is surprising nevertheless you have every inducement to be cautious for hatred and jealousy have a penetration that does not belong even to love  we think we are safe sir i answered for we are certainly within the statute we are too well aware of our miserable aristocratical condition to place ourselves within the grasp of the law for such are our eminent privileges as a landed nobility that we are morally certain either of us would not only be sent to the states prison were he to be guilty of the felony those injins are committing and will commit with a perfect impunity but that he would be kept there as long as a single tear of anguish could be wrung from one of those who are classed with the aristocracy democracy alone finds any sympathy in the ordinary administration of american justice  i am afraid that your irony has only too much truth in it but the movement around the building would seem to say that the real business of the day is about to commence and we had better return to the church  those men in disguise are watching us in a most unpleasant and alarming manner said mary warren delighting me far more by the vigilance she thus manifested in my behalf than alarming me by the fact  that we were watched however became obviously apparent as we walked toward the building by the actions of some of the injins they had left the side of the church where they had posted themselves during the prayer and head was going to head among those nearest to us or it would be nearer to appearances were i to say bunch of calico was going to bunch of calico for nothing in the form of a head was visible among them nothing was said to mr warren and mary however who were permitted to go into the meetinghouse unmolested but two of these disguised gentry placed themselves before me laying their rifles across my path and completely intercepting my advance  who you abruptly demanded one of the twowhere gowhere come from  the answer was ready and i trust was sufficiently steady  i coomes from charmany und i goes into der kerch as dey say in mine coontry what might be callet a meetinus here  what might have followed it is not easy to say had not the loud declamatory voice of the lecturer just then been heard as he commenced his address this appeared to be a signal for the tribe to make some movement for the two fellows who had stopped me walked silently away though bag of calico went to bag of calico as they trotted off together seemingly communicating to each other their suspicions i took advantage of the opening and passed into the church where i worked my way through the throng and got a seat at my uncles side  i have neither time room nor inclination to give anything like an analysis of the lecture the speaker was fluent inflated and anything but logical not only did he contradict himself but he contradicted the laws of nature the intelligent reader will not require to be reminded of the general character of a speech that was addressed to the passions and interests of such an audience rather than to their reason he commented at first on the particular covenants of the leases on the old estates of the colony alluding to the quartersales chickens days work and durable tenures in the customary way the reservation of the mines too was mentioned as a tyrannical covenant precisely as if a landlord were obliged to convey any more of the rights that were vested in him than he saw fit or the tenant could justly claim more than he had hired this man treated all these branches of the subject as if the tenants had acquired certain mysterious interests by time and occupation overlooking the fact that the one party got just as good a title as the other by this process the lease being the instrument between them that was getting to be venerable if one party grew old as a tenant so did the other as a landlord i thought that this lecturer would have been glad to confine himself to the manor leases that being the particular branch of the subject he had been accustomed to treat but such was not the precise nature of the job he was now employed to execute at ravensnest he could not flourish the feudal grievance of the quartersales the four fat fowls the days works and the length of the leases here it was clearly his cue to say nothing of the three first and to complain of the shortness of the leases as mine were about to fall in in considerable numbers finding it was necessary to take new ground he determined it should be bold ground and such as would give him the least trouble to get along with  as soon as the lecturer had got through with his general heads and felt the necessity of coming down to particulars he opened upon the family of littlepage in a very declamatory way what had they ever done for the country he demanded that they should be lords in the land by some process known to himself he had converted landlords into lords in the land and was now aiming to make the tenants occupy the latter stationnay both stations of course some services of a public character of which the littlepages might boast were not touched upon at all everything of that nature being compressed into what the lecturer and his audience deemed serving the people by helping to indulge them in all their desires however rapacious or wicked as everybody who knows anything of the actual state of matters among us must be aware how rarely the people hear the truth when their own power and interests are in question it is not surprising that a very shallow reasoner was enabled to draw wool over the eyes of the audience of ravensnest on that particular subject  but my interest was most awakened when this man came to speak of myself it is not often that a man enjoys the same opportunity as that i then possessed to hear his own character delineated and his most private motives analyzed in the first place the audience were told that this young hugh littlepage had never done anything for the land that he proudly and like a great european noble calls his estate most of you fellowcitizens can show your hard hands and recall the burning suns under which you have opened the swath through those then lovely meadows yonder as your titles to these farms but hugh littlepage never did a days work in his lifeten minutes before he had been complaining of the days work in the manor leases as indignities that a freeman ought not to submit tono fellowcitizens he never had that honor and never will have it until by a just division of his property or what he now calls his property you reduce him to the necessity of laboring to raise the crops he wants to consume  where is this hugh littlepage at this very moment in paris squandering your hard earnings in riotous living according to the best standards of aristocracy he lives in the midst of abundance dresses richly and fares richly while you and yours are eating the sweat of your brows he is no man for a pewter spoon and twopronged fork no my countrymen he must have a gold spoon for some of his dishes and you will find it hard to believeplain unpretending republican farmers as you are but it is not the less truehe must have forks of silver fellowcitizens hugh littlepage would not put his knife into his mouth as you and i do in eatingas all plain unpretending republicans dofor the world it would choke him no he keeps silver forks to touch his anointed lips here there was an attempt to get up something like applause but it totally failed the men of ravensnest had been accustomed all their lives to see the littlepages in the social station they occupied and after all it did not seem so very extraordinary that we should have silver forks any more than that others should have silver spoons the lecturer had the tact to see that he had failed on this point and he turned to another  the next onset was made against our title whence did it come demanded the lecturer from the king of england and the people had conquered the country from that sovereign and put themselves in his place now is it not a good principle in politics that to the victors belong the spoils he believed it was and that in conquering america he was of opinion that the people of america had conquered the land and that they had a right to take the land and to keep it titles from kings he did not respect much and he believed the american people generally did not think much of them if hugh littlepage wished an estate as he called it let him come to the people and starve them and see what sort of an estate they would give him  but there was one portion of his speech which was so remarkable that i must attempt to give it as it was uttered it was while the lecturer was expatiating on this subject of titles that he broke out in the following languagedont talk to me he bellowedfor by this time his voice had risen to the pitch of a methodists in a campmeetingdont talk to me of antiquity and time and length of possession as things to be respected theyre nawthinjest nawthin at all possessions good in law ill admit and i contind thats jest what the tenants has theyve got the lawful possession of this very property that layeth not eggs but up and down far and near and all around a rich and goodly heritage when divided up among hardworking and honest folks but too much by tens of thousands of acres for a young chap who is wasting his substance in foreign lands to hold i contind that the tenants has this very precise lawful possession at this blessed moment only the law wont let em enjy it its all owing to that accursed law that the tenant cant set up a title agin his landlord you see by this one fact fellowcitizens that they are a privileged class and ought to be brought down to the level of ginral humanity you can set up title agin anybody else but you shant set up title agin a landlord i know what is said in the primisis shaking his head in derision of any arguments on the other side of this particular point i know that circumstances alter cases i can see the hardship of one neighbors coming to another and asking to borrow or hire his horse for a day and then pretendin to hold him on some other ketch but horses isnt land you must all allow that no if horses was land the case would be altered land is an element and so is fire and so is water and so is air now who will say that a freeman hasnt a right to air hasnt a right to water and on the same process hasnt a right to land he has fellowcitizenshe has these are what are called in philosophy elementary rights which is the same thing as a right to the elements of which land is one and a principal one i say a principal one for if there was no land to stand on we should drop away from air and couldnt enjy that we should lose all our water in vapor and couldnt put it to millin and manafacterin purposes and where could we build our fires no land is the first elementary right and connected with it comes the first and most sacred right to the elements  i do not altogether disregard antiquity neither no i respect and revere preemption rights for they fortify and sustain the right to the elements now i do not condemn squattin as some does its actin accordin to natur and natur is right i respect and venerate a squatters possession for its held under the sacred principle of usefulness it says go and make the wilderness blossom as the rose and means progress thats an antiquity i respect i respect the antiquity of your possessions here as tenants for it is a hardworking and useful antiquityan antiquity that increases and multiplies if it be said that hugh littlepages ancestorsyour noble has his ancestors while us common folks are satisfied with forefathersthis hit took with a great many present raising a very general laughbut if this hughs ancestors did pay anything for the land if i was you fellowcitizens id be ginrous and let him have it back agin perhaps his forefathers gave a cent an acre to the kingmay be two or say sixpence if you will id let him have his sixpence an acre back again by way of shutting his mouth no im for nawthin thats unginrous  fellowcitizens i profess to be what is called a democrat i know that many of you be what is called whigs but i apprehend there isnt much difference between us on the subject of this system of leasing land we are all republicans and leasing farms is antirepublican then i wish to be liberal even to them i commonly oppose at elections and i will freely admit then on the whull the whigs have rather outdone us democrats on the subject of this antirentism i am sorry to be obliged to own in it but it must be confessed that while in the way of governors there hasnt been much differenceyes put em in a bag and shake em up and youd hardly know which would come out firstwhich has done himself the most immortal honor which has shown himself the most comprehensive profound and safe statesman i know that some of our people complain of the governors for ordering out troops agin the injins but they could not help thatthey wouldnt have done it in my judgment had there been any way of getting round it but the law was too strong for them so they druv in the injins and now they join us in putting down aristocracy and in raising up ginral humanity no i dont go agin the governors though many does  but i profess to be a democrat and ill give an outline of my principles that all may see why they cant and dont and never will agree with aristocracy or nobility in any form or shape i believe one man is as good as another in all things neither birth nor law nor edication nor riches nor poverty nor anything else can ever make any difference in this principle which is sacred and fundamental and is the chief stone of the corner in true democracy one man is as good as another i say and has just the same right to the enjyment of arth and its privileges as any other man i think the majority ought to rule in all things and that it is the duty of the minority to submit now ive had this here sentiment thrown back upon me in some places where i have spoken and been asked how is thisthe majority must rule and the minority must submitin that case the minority isnt as good as the majority in practice and hasnt the same right they are made to own what they think ought not to be done the answer to this is so plain i wonder a sensible man can ask the question for all the minority has to do is to join the majority to have things as they want em the road is free and it is this open road that makes true liberty any man can fall in with the majority and sensible folks commonly do when they can find it and that makes a person not only a man as the saying is but a freeman a still more honorable title  fellowcitizens a great movement is in progress go ahead is the cry and the march is onward our thoughts already fly about on the wings of the lightning and our bodies move but little slower on the vapor of steamsoon our principles will rush ahead of all and let in the radiance of a glorious day of universal reform and loveliness and virtue and charity when the odious sound of rent will never be heard when every man will sit down under his own apple or cherry tree if not under his own figtree  i am a democratyes a democrat glorious appellation i delight in it it is my pride my boast my very virtue let but the people truly rule and all must come well the people has no temptation to do wrong if they hurt the state they hurt themselves for they are the state is a man likely to hurt himself equality is my axiom nor by equality do i mean your narrow pitiful equality before the law as it is sometimes tarmed for that may be no equality at all but i mean an equality that is substantial and which must be restored when the working of the law has deranged it fellowcitizens do you know what leapyear means i dare say some of you dont the ladies in particlar not giving much attention to astronomy well i have inquired and it is this the arth revolves around the sun in a year as we all know and we count three hundred and sixtyfive days in a year we all know but the arth is a few hours longer than three hundred and sixtyfive days in making its circuitnearly six hours longer now everybody knows that four times six makes twentyfour and so a twentyninth day is put into february every fourth year to restore the lost time another change being to be made a long distance ahead to settle the fractions thus will it be with democracy human natur cant devise laws yet that will keep all things on an exactly equal footing and political leapyears must be introduced into the political calendar to restore the equilibrium in astronomy we must divide up anew the hours and minutes in humanity we must from time to time divide up the land  but i cannot follow this inflated fool any longer for he was quite as much of fool as of knave though partaking largely of the latter character it was plain that he carried many of his notions much further than a good portion of his audience carried theirs though whenever he touched upon antirentism he hit a chord that vibrated through the whole assembly that the tenants ought to own their farms and pay no more rents and pocket all the benefits of their own previous labors though these labors had been considered in the earlier rents and were indeed still considered in the low rates at which the lands were let was a doctrine all could understand and few were they i am sorry to say who did not betray how much selflove and selfinterest had obscured the sense of right  the lecture such as it was lasted more than two hours and when it was done an individual rose in the character of a chairmanwhen did three americans ever get together to discuss anything that they had not a chairman and secretary and all the parliamentary formsand invited any one present who might entertain views different from the speaker to give his opinion never before did i feel so tempted to speak in public my first impulse was to throw away the wig and come out in my own person and expose the shallow trash that had just been uttered i believe even i unaccustomed as i was to public speaking could easily have done this and i whispered as much to my uncle who was actually on his feet to perform the office for me when the sound of mr chairman from a different part of the church anticipated him looking round i recognized at once the face of the intelligent mechanic named hall whom we had met at mooseridge on our way to the nest i took my seat at once perfectly satisfied that the subject was in good hands  this speaker commenced with great moderation both of manner and tone and indeed he preserved them throughout his utterance accent and language of course were all tinctured by his habits and associations but his good sense and his good principles were equally gifts from above more of the true image of his maker was to be found in that one individual than existed in fifty common men he saw clearly spoke clearly and demonstrated effectively as he was well known in that vicinity and generally respected he was listened to with profound attention and spoke like a man who stood in no dread of tar and feathers had the same sentiments been delivered by one in a fine coat and a stranger or even by myself who had so much at stake very many of them would have been incontinently set down as aristocratic and not to be tolerated the most sublimated lover of equality occasionally falling into these little contradictions  hall commenced by reminding the audience that they all knew him and knew he was no landlord he was a mechanic and a laboring man like most of themselves and had no interest that could be separated from the general good of society this opening was a little homage to prejudice since reason is reason and right right let them come whence they will i too am a democrat he went on to say but i do not understand democracy to mean anything like that which has been described by the last speaker i tell that gentleman plainly that if he is a democrat i am none and if i am a democrat he is none by democracy i understand a government in which the sovereign power resides in the body of the nation and not in a few or in one but this principle no more gives the body of the people authority to act wrong than in a monarchy in which the sovereign power resides in one man that one man has a right to act wrong by equality i do not understand anything more than equality before the lawnow if the law had said that when the late malbone littlepage died his farms should go not to his next of kin or to his devisee but to his neighbors then that would have been the law to be obeyed although it would be a law destructive of civilization since men would never accumulate property to go to the public something nearer home is necessary to make men work and deny themselves what they like  the gentleman has told us of a sort of a political leapyear that is to regulate the social calendar i understand him to mean that when property has got to be unequal it must be divided up in order that men may make a new start i fear he will have to dispense with leapyears and come to leapmonths or leapweeks ay or even to leapdays for was the property of this township divided up this very morning and in this meetinus it would get to be unequal before night some folks cant keep money when they have it and others cant keep their hands off it  then again if hugh littlepages property is to be divided the property of all of hugh littlepages neighbors ought to be divided too to make even an appearance of equality though it would be but an appearance of equality admitting that were done since hugh littlepage has more than all the rest of the town put together yes fellowcitizens hugh littlepage pays at this moment onetwentieth of the taxes of this whole county that is about the proportion of ravensnest and that tax in reality comes out of his pockets as much as the greater part of the taxes of rensselaer and albany counties if you will except the cities they contain are paid by the rensselaers it wunt do to tell me the tenants pay the taxes for i know better we all know that the probable amount of the taxes is estimated in the original bargain and is so much deducted from the rent and comes out of the landlord if it comes out of anybody there is a good reason why the tenant should pay it and a reason that is altogether in his interest because the law would make his oxen and horses and carts liable for the taxes should the landlord neglect to pay the taxes the collector always sells personals for a tax if he can find them on the property and by deducting it from the rent and paying it himself the tenant makes himself secure against that loss to say that a tenant dont take any account of the taxes he will be likely to pay in making his bargain is as if one should say he is non com and not fit to be trusted with his own affairs there are men in this community i am sorry to say who wish a law passed to tax the rents on durable leases or on all leases in order to choke the landlords off from their claims but such men are true friends to neither justice nor their country such a law would be a tax on the incomes of a particular class of society and on no other it is a law that would justify the aggrieved parties in taking up arms to resist it unless the law would give em relief as i rather think it would by removing into another state however they would escape the tax completely laugh at those who framed it who would incur the odium of doing an impotent wrong and get laughed at as well as despised besides injuring the state by drawing away its money to be spent out of its limits think for one moment of the impression that would be made of new york justice if a hundred citizens of note and standing were to be found living in philadelphia or paris and circulating to the world the report that they were exiles to escape a special taxation the more the matter was inquired into the worse it must appear for men may say what they please to be ready agin election time as there is but one piece or parcel of property to tax it is an income tax and nothing else what makes the matter still worse is that every man of sense will know that it is taxing the same person twice substantially for the same thing since the landlord has the direct landtax deducted from the rent in the original bargain  as for all this cry about aristocracy i dont understand it hugh littlepage has just as good a right to his ways as i have to mine the gentleman says he needs gold spoons and silver forks to eat with well what of that i dare say the gentleman himself finds a steel knife and fork useful and has no objection to silver or at least to a pewter spoon now there are folks that use wooden forks or no forks and who are glad to get horn spoons and they might call that gentleman himself an aristocrat this setting of ourselves up as the standard in all things is anything but liberty if i dont like to eat my dinner with a man who uses a silver fork no man in this country can compel me on the other hand if young mr littlepage dont like a companion who chews tobacco as i do he ought to be left to follow his own inclination  then this doctrine that one mans as good as another has got two sides to it one man ought to have the same general rights as another i am ready to allow but if one man is as good as another why do we have the trouble and cost of elections we might draw lots as we do for jurors and save a good deal of time and money we all know there is chice in men and i think that so long as the people have their chice in sayin who shall and who shall not be their agents theyve got all they have any right to so long as this is done the rest of the world may be left to follow their own ways provided they obey the laws  then i am no great admirer of them that are always telling the people theyre parfect i know this county pretty well as well as most in it and if there be a parfect man in washington county i have not yet fallen in with him ten millions of imparfect men wont make one parfect man and so i dont look for parfection in the people any more than i do in princes all i look for in democracy is to keep the reins in so many hands as to prevent a few from turning everything to their own account still we mustnt forget that when a great many do go wrong it is much worse than when a few go wrong  if my son didnt inherit the property of malbone littlepage neither will malbone littlepages son inherit mine we are on a footing in that respect as to paying rent which some persons think so hard what would they do if they had no house to live in or farm to work if folks wish to purchase houses and farms no one can prevent them if they have money to do it with and if they have not is it expected other people have to provide them with such things out of their own  here the speaker was interrupted by a sudden whooping and the injins came pressing into the house in a way to drive all in the aisles before them men women and children leaped from the windows the distance being trifling while others made their escape by the two sidedoors the injins coming in only by the main entrance in less time than it takes to record the fact the audience had nearly all dispersed     chapter xvi       and yet it is saidlabor in thy vocation which is as much as      to saylet the magistrates be laboring men and therefore      should we be magistratesking henry vi   in a minute or two the tumult ceased and a singular scene presented itself the church had four separate groups or parties left in it beside the injins who crowded the main aisle the chairman secretary two ministers and lecturer remained perfectly tranquil in their seats probably understanding quite well they had nothing to fear from the intruders mr warren and mary were in another corner under the gallery he having disdained flight and prudently kept his daughter at his side my uncle and myself were the pendants of the two last named occupying the opposite corner also under the gallery mr hall and two or three friends who stuck by him were in a pew near the wall but about halfway down the church the former erect on a seat where he had placed himself to speak  proceed with your remarks sir coolly observed the chairman who was one of those paradoxical antirenters who had nothing to do with the injins though he knew all about them and as i have been told was actually foremost in collecting and disbursing their pay at this instant seneca newcome sneaked in at the side door keeping as far as possible from the disguised and armed but curious to ascertain what would come next  as for hall he behaved with admirable selfpossession he probably knew that his former auditors were collecting under the windows and by raising his voice he would be easily heard at all events he did elevate his voice and went on as if nothing had happened  i was about to say a word mr chairman on the natur of the two qualities that have to me at least seemed uppermost in the lecturers argoomentyes this sensible wellprincipled man actually used that detestable sound just as i have written it calling argument argoomentwhat a pity it is that so little attention is paid to the very first principles of speaking the language well in this country the common schools probably doing more harm than they do good in this respectthat have to me at least seemed uppermost in the lecturers argooment and they are both those that god himself has viewed as of so great importance to our nature as to give his express commandments about them he has commanded us not to steal and he has commanded us not to covet our neighbors goods proof sufficient that the possession of property is sanctioned by divine authority and that it is endowed with a certain sanctity of privilege now for the application  you can do nothing as to leases in existence because the state cant impair a contract a great deal is said about this governments being one of the people and that the people ought to do as they please now im a plain man and am talking to plain men and mean to talk plainly that this is a government of the people being a democracy or because the sovereign power in the last resort resides in the body of the people is true but that this is a government of the people in the common signification or as too many of the people themselves understand it is not true this very interest about which there is so much commotion or the right to interfere with contracts is put beyond the people of the state by a clause in the constitution of the united states now the constitution of the united states might be altered making another provision saying that no state shall ever pass any law to do away with the existence of durable leases and every man woman and child in new york be opposed to such a change but they would have to swallow it come let us see what figures will do there are twentyseven states in actual existence and soon will be thirty i dont care on which number you calculate say thirty if you please as that is likely to be the number before the constitution could be altered well twentythree of these states can put a clause into the constitution saying you shant meddle with leases this might leave the seven most populous states with every voter opposed to the change ive made a calculation and find what the seven most populous states had in 1840 and i find that more than half of all the population of the country is contained in them seven states which can be made to submit to a minority nor is this all the alteration may be carried by only one vote in each of the twentythree states and deducting these from the electors in the seven dissenting states you might have a constitutional change made in the country against a majority of say two millions it follows that the people in the common meaning are not as omnipotent as some suppose theres something stronger than the people after all and thats principles and if we go to work to tear to pieces our own  it was impossible to hear another word that the speaker said the idea that the people are not omnipotent was one little likely to find favor among any portion of the population that fancy themselves to be peculiarly the people so much accustomed to consider themselves invested with the exercise of a power which in any case can be rightfully exercised by only the whole people have local assemblages got to be that they often run into illegal excesses fancying even their little fragment of the body politic infallible as well as omnipotent in such matters at least to have it openly denied therefore that the popular fabric of american institutions is so put together as to leave it in the power of a decided minority to change the organic law as is unquestionably the fact in theory however little likely to occur in practice sounded in the ears of mr halls auditors like political blasphemy those under the windows groaned while the gang in the aisle whooped and yelled and that in a fashion that had all the exaggeration of a caricature it was very apparent that there was an end of all the deliberative part of the proceedings of the day  hall seemed neither surprised nor uneasy he wiped his face very coolly and then took his seat leaving the injins to dance about the church flourishing their rifles and knives in a way that might have frightened one less steady as for mr warren he led mary out though there was a movement that threatened to stop him my uncle and myself followed the whooping and screaming being really unpleasant to the ear as to the chairman the secretary and the two ministers of the gospel they kept their stations on the stage entirely selfpossessed and unmolested no one went near them a forbearance that must have been owing to the often alleged fact that the real antirenters the oppressed tenantry of new york and these vile masqueraders had nothing to do with each other  one of the astounding circumstances of the times is the general prevalence of falsehood among us and the almost total suppression of truth no matter what amount of evidence there may be to contradict a statement or how often it has been disproved it is reaffirmed with just as much assurance as if the matter had never been investigated ay and believed as if its substance were uncontradicted i am persuaded there is no part of the world in which it is more difficult to get a truth into the public mind when there is a motive to suppress it than among ourselves this may seem singular when it is remembered how many journals there are which are uttered with the avowed purpose to circulate information alas the machinery which can be used to give currency to truth is equally efficient in giving currency to falsehood there are so many modes too of diluting truth in addition to the downright lies which are told that i greatly question if one alleged fact out of twenty that goes the rounds of the public prints those of the commoner sort excepted is true in all its essentials it requires so much integrity of purpose so much discrimination such a sensitiveness of conscience and often so large a degree of selfsacrifice in men to speak nothing but truth that one is not to expect that their more vulgar and irresponsible agents are to possess a quality that is so very rare among the very best of the principals  if i was glad to get out of the church myself the reader may depend on it i was rejoiced when i saw mr warren leading mary toward the place where i had left his wagon as if about to quit a scene that now promised nothing but clamor and wrangling if not something more serious uncle ro desired me to bring out the wagon in which we had left the farm and in the midst of a species of general panic in which the women in particular went flying about in all directions i proceeded to comply it was at this moment that a general pause to all movements was produced by the gang of injins pouring out of the church bringing in their centre the late speaker mr hall as the chairman secretary lecturer and the two ministers of the gospel followed it was conclusive as to the termination of anything like further discussion  my uncle called me back and i thought was disposed to assist hall who manfully supported by the two or three friends that had stood by him the whole day was now moving toward us surrounded by a cluster of wrangling and menacing injins the whole party bearing no little resemblance to a pack of village curs that set upon the strange dog that has ventured in among them  oaths and threats filled the air and poor halls ears were offended by an imputation that i dare say they then heard for the first time he was called a dd aristocrat and a hireling is the pay of dd aristocrats to all this however the sturdy and rightthinking blacksmith was very indifferent well knowing there was not a fact connected with his existence or a sentiment of his moral being that would justify any such charge it was in answer to this deadly imputation that i first heard him speak again after he had been interrupted in the church  call me what you please he cried in his clear full voice i dont mind hard names there isnt a man among you who thinks im an aristocrat or the hireling of any one but i hope i am not yet so great a knave as to wish to rob a neighbor because he happens to be richer than i am myself  who gave hugh littlepage his land demanded one in the midst of the gang speaking without the affectation of mimicry though the covering to his head sufficiently changed his voice you know yourself it came from the king  he never worked for an acre of it bawled another if he was a hardworking honest man like yourself tim hall we might bear it but you know he is not hes a spendthrift and an aristocrat  i know that hard hands dont make a man honest any more than soft hands make him a rogue answered tim hall with spirit as for the littlepages they are gentlemen in every sense of the word and always have been their word will pass even now when the bond of many a man who sets himself up agin them wouldnt be looked at  i was grateful and touched with this proof that a character which i fully believed to be merited was not lost on one of the most intelligent men of his class in that part of the country envy and covetousness and malignancy may lie as they will but the upright recognize the upright the truly poor know who most assuage their sorrows and relieve their wants and the real lover of liberty understands that its privileges are not to be interpreted altogether in his own favor i did not like the idea of such a mans being illtreated by a gang of disguised blackguardsfellows who added to the crime of violating a positive law the high moral offence of prostituting the sacred principles of liberty by professing to drag them into the service of a cause which wanted very little in its range to include all the pickpockets and thieves in the land  they will do that noble fellow some injury i fear i whispered to my uncle  if it were not for the mortification of admitting our disguise i would go forward at once and attempt to bring him out of the crowd was the answer but that will not do under the circumstances let us be patient and observe what is to follow  tar and feathers shouted some one among the injins tar and feather him crop him and send him home answered others tim hall has gone over to the enemy added the injin who asked whence i had my lands  i fancied i knew that voice and when its tones had been repeated two or three times it struck me it was that of seneca newcome that seneca was an antirenter was no secret but that he a lawyer would be guilty of the great indiscretion of committing felony was a matter about which one might well entertain a doubt to urge others to be guilty was a different matter but to commit himself seemed unlikely with a view to keep an eye on the figure i distrusted i looked out for some mode by which he might be known a patch or rather gore in the calico answered admirably for on looking at others i saw that this gore was accidental and peculiar to that particular dress most probably owing to a deficiency in the material originally supplied  all this time which indeed was but a minute or two the tumult continued the injins seemed undetermined what to do equally afraid to carry out their menaces against hall and unwilling to let him go at the very instant when we were looking for something serious the storm abated and an unexpected calm settled on the scene how this was effected i never knew though it is reasonable to suppose an order had been communicated to the injins by some signal that was known only to themselves of the result there was no doubt the crowd around hall opened and that sturdy and uncompromising freeman came out of it wiping his face looking heated and a little angry he did not yield however remaining near the spot still supported by the two or three friends who had accompanied him from mooseridge  my uncle ro on reflection conceived it wisest not to seem in a hurry to quit the village and as soon as i had ascertained that mr warren had come to a similar decision and had actually taken refuge in the house of a parishioner i was agreeable as the english say while the pedler therefore made a new display of his watches i strolled round among the crowd injins and others intermixed to see what could be seen and to glean intelligence in the course of my wanderings chance brought me close to the side of the masker in the dress with the gore tickling him gently on the elbow i induced him to step a little aside with me where our conversation would not be overheard  why might you be injingentleman as you be i asked with as much of an air of simplicity as i could assume  the start with which this question was met convinced me i was right and i scarce needed farther confirmation of the justice of my suspicion if i had however it was afforded  why ask injin dat returned the man with the gore  vell dat might do and it might not do squire newcome but it might not do wid one as knows you as vell as i know you so dell me vy might you be injin  harkee said seneca in his natural speech and evidently much disturbed by my discovery you must on no account let it be known who i am you see this injin business is ticklish work and the law mightthat isyou could get nothing by mentioning what you know but as you have said as im a gentleman and an attorney at law it wouldnt sound well to have it said that i was caught dressed up in this manner playing injin  jajai oonderstantsgentlemans might not do sich dings und not be laughed atdats all  yeeesthats all as you say so be careful what you say or hint about it well since you have found me out its my treat what shallt be  this was not very elegant for a gentleman and an attorney at law certainly but as it belonged to the school of mr newcome it struck me it might not be prudent for me to betray that i belonged to one of a different sort affecting contentment therefore i told him what he pleased and he led me to a store of all business that was kept by his brother and in which as i afterward found he himself was a partner here he generously treated me to a glass of fiery whiskey which i managed to spill in a way that prevented my being choked this was adroitly enough effected as a refusal to drink would have been taken as a most suspicious circumstance in a german as respects americans of my assumed class i am happy to say it is now more possible for one to refuse a glass than to accept it it says a good deal in favor of the population of a country when even the coachman declines his whet nevertheless a nation may become perfectly sober and fall away with fearful rapidity on other great essentials on the subject of sobriety i agree altogether with my uncle in thinking that the americans drink much less than most if not less than any european nation the common notion that long prevailed to the contrary in the country being no more than the fruits of the general disposition in other people to decry democracy aided somewhat perhaps by the exaggerations that are so common in all the published statistics of morals  i remarked that very few even of the injins drank though they now began to circulate freely among the crowd and in the stores seneca left me as soon as he fancied he had clinched my discretion with a treat and i stood looking round at the manner in which the armed and disguised conducted themselves one fellow in particular attracted my attention and his deportment may be taken as a specimen of that of many of his comrades  i was soon struck by the fact that orson newcome senecas brother and partner was obviously desirous of having as little to do with any of the injins as possible as soon as one entered his store he appeared uneasy and whenever one left it he seemed glad at first i was inclined to think that orsonwhat names will not the great eastern family adopt before they have got through with their cataloguereally they seem to select their appellations as they do so many other things or to prove that theyll do as they please but orson i fancied at first was influenced by principle and did not care to conceal the disgust he felt at such audacious and illegal proceedings but i soon discovered my mistake by ascertaining the true cause of his distaste for the presence of an injin  injin want calico for shirtsaid one of these worthies significantly to orson who at first affected not to hear him  the demand was repeated however with additional significance when the cloth was reluctantly thrown on the counter  good said the injin after examining the quality cut injin twenty yardgood measure hear  the calico was cut with a sort of desperate submission the twenty yards were folded enveloped and handed to the customer who coolly put the bundle under his arm saying as he turned to leave the storecharge it to down rent  the mystery of orsons sullenness was now explained as invariably follows the abandonment of principle the fomenters of wrong were suffering smartly through the encroachments of their own agents i ascertained afterward that these very injins who had been embodied in hundreds with a view to look down law and right and the sacred character of contracts had begun to carry out their main principle and were making all sorts of demands on the pockets and property of their very employers under one pretence or another but with very obvious tendencies toward their own benefit the spirit of antirentism was beginning to develop itself in this form under the system of violence as under that of legislative usurpation and legislative truckling to numbers which is most to be feared from the character of our representatives it will as certainly be developed unless suppressed in the bud by such further demands on its complaisant ministers as will either compel them to repent of their first false step will drive the state to civil war or will drive all the honest men out of it  i did not remain long in the store after quitting it i went in quest of mr warren and mary anxious to know if i could be of any service to them the father thanked me for this attention and let me know that he was now about to quit the village as he saw others beginning to go away among whom was hall who was an old and much valued acquaintance of his and whom he had invited to stop at the rectory to dine he advised us to imitate the example as there were strangers among the injins who might be addicted to drinking  on this information i hunted up my uncle who had actually sold most of his trinkets and all his watches but one the secret of his great success being the smallness of his prices he sold for what he had bought and in some instances for even less quitting the place with the reputation of being the most reasonable jewelpedler who had ever appeared in it  the road was beginning to be lined with vehicles carrying home the people who had collected to hear the lecture as this was the first occasion which offered for witnessing such an exhibition since my return i examined the different parties we passed with a view to comparison there is a certain air of rusticity even in the large towns of america which one does not meet with in the capitals of the old world but the american country is less rustic than any part of the world with which i am acquainted england alone excepted of course in making such a remark no allusion is intended to the immediate environs of very large towns though i am far from certain that the population of st ouen the runnymede of france and which stands within a league of the walls of paris would not have offered a more decidedly rustic spectacle than that which we then saw as respects females this was very strikingly true scarce one being visible who had that air of coarseness and ignorance and vulgarity which denotes a degraded condition and a life of hardships there was little apparent that marked a peasantry in the moral sense of the word but the whole population seemed to be at their ease using neat and wellkept vehicles solid active horses and being themselves reasonably well though not very tastefully clad yet all this was on a leased estate under the dire oppression of a landlord and beneath the shadow of aristocracy a short dialogue which took place between my uncle and two sturdy weatherbeaten husbandmen who drove their horses to a short distance on a walk at the side of ours made the impression produced by such facts deeper than it might otherwise have been i will relate it  you are jarmans i blieve commenced the oldest of the two men a grayheaded tenant of my own of the name of holmes who was well known to us bothjarmans from the old countries i hear  jawe bees from der olt coontries und dat is a great vay off  yeees i spose it isive heern tell of them coontries often does the landlord system exist there  jadere ist lantlordts all ofer dis worlt i do dinks und tenants doo  well and how is the plan liked there or be folks thinking of getting red rid ont  neinhow might dey gets red of it it ist der law you might see and vhat ist der law moost be done  this answer puzzled old holmes a good deal he passed a hand over his face and turned to his companion one tubbs also a tenant on my estate as if to ask assistance tubbs was one of the new school a school that makes more laws than it respects and belongs to the movement he is a man that fancies the world never knew anything of principles facts or tendencies until the commencement of this century  what sort of a goverment had you in your own country demanded tubbs  bretty goot mein coontry was preussen und dat might be tought a bretty goot gofernment  yes but its a kingly government i take itit seems to me i have heern tell of kings in that land  ja jadere ist ein koenigone king de last might be der goot koenig vilhelm und now dere ist his son who ist a goot koenig too as i might dink ja jadere ist a king  that explains it all cried tubbs with a sort of triumph you see they have a king and so they have tenants but here we have no king and we have no need of landlords every man in a free country should be his own landlord thats my doctrine and to that ill stick  there is some reason in that frind isnt that your idee asked holmes  vell i might not oonderstandt dost der shentlemans object to landlordts in his coontry because dere might be landlordts in dem coontries as might haf kings  thats it thats just the reason ont and the true principle answered tubbs kings and liberty cant go together and landlords and liberty cant go together  but might not der law in this coontry be to haf landlordts too i hear dat it ist so  yes that is the law as it stands but we mean to alter it all we have got so many votes now as to be sure to have both parties with us at the ginral election and give us the governor on our side with the sartainty of votes enough to turn an election and were pretty confident of success votes is all that is wanting in a truly free country for men to have things pretty much in their own way  und dost you mean to haf notin dat might be in de coontries ast haf kings  to be sure not what do we want of any of your lordly contrivances to make the rich richer and the poor poorer  vell you moost alter de law of nature if de rich vilt not get riches und de poor vill not feel dey be poor de piple dells us dat de misery of de poor ist deir poverty  ay ay bible talk dont go for much in politics sabba days are set aside for the bible and weekdays for public and private matters now here is hugh littlepage of the same flesh and blood as my neighbor holmes and myself beno better and no worse yes im willing to allow hes no worse in the main though in some things i do think we might claim the preference but ill allow hes no worse for the sake of argooment each on us rents a farm of this littlepage of a hundred acres good waal this land we till and crop and labor with our own hands and the hands of our sons and hired help perhaps and yet we have to pay fifty dollars apiece annually to that youngster hugh littlepage for rent which money he takes and squanders where he pleases in riotous livin fort we know now is that right i ask and isnt it an onsuitable state of things for a republican country  und you dinks yoong littlebage might spend his money in riotous lifin in foreign landts  sartainthats the tale hereabouts and i have seen a man who knows another that has an acquaintance who has been in paris and who tells the people of his neighborhood that he stood at the door of the kings palace one day and actually saw both the littlepages going in to pay tribute unto cæsar as it is calledi suppose you know and they tell me that all that goes to see a king has to kneel and kiss his handsome say his toe do you happen to know how it is in the old countries  it ist not so i haf seen more kings as half a dozen und dey dost not kneel down and kiss deir hants except on sartain business dey might not allvays hear what is true in dis country  waal i dont know i never was there to see answered tubbs in that peculiar manner which whenever it is used by an american may safely be interpreted to mean ill not contradict you but ill believe what i please that is what ive heern say but why should we pay rent to young littlepage to spend in riotous living  i might not know oonless you haf hiret his landt und agreet to pay him rent in which case you might do as you agreet  but when the bargains of a kingly natur i say no every country has its natur and every government has its natur and all things should be in conformity with natur now its agin natur to pay rent in a republican country we want nothing here thats in common with lords and kings  vell den you most alter your whole coontry you might not haf wifes und children you might not lif in houses and plough de landt you might not eat und drink and you might not wear any shirt  tubbs looked a little astonished like the bourgeois gentilhomme he was amazed to find he had been talking prose all his life without knowing it there is no question that laws unsuitable to the institutions of a republic might exist in a kingdom but it is equally certain that the law which compels the tenant to pay for the use of his house or farm is not one of the number tubbs however had been so thoroughly persuaded by dint of talking there was something exceedingly antirepublican in one mans paying rent to another that he was not disposed to give the matter up so easily  ay ay he answered we have many things in common with kingdoms as men i must allow but why should we have anything in common of this aristocratic natur a free country should contain freemen and how can a man be free if he doesnt own the land out of which he makes his living  und if he makes his lifin out of anoder mans land he might be honest enough to pay for its use i dinks  but we hold it ought not to be another mans land but the land of him who works it  dell me disdost you efer let out a field to a poor neighbor on shares  sartain we will do that both to accommodate folks and to get crops when we are crowded with work ourselves  und why might not all dat crop pelong to him dat works de field  oh thats doin business on a small scale and cant do anybody harm but the american institutions never intended that there should be a great privileged class among us like the lords in europe  did you efer haf any difficulty in getting your hire for a field dat might be so let out  sartain theres miserable neighbors as well as them that isnt i had to sue the very last chap i had such dealins with  und dit das law let you haf your money  to be sure it did what would law be good for if it didnt help a body to his rights  und dost den tenants of dis broperty let hugh littlebage haf his rents as might be due  thats a different thing i tell you hugh littlepage has more than he wants and spends his money in riotous livin in foreign parts  vell und sooppose your neighpors might vants to ask you what you do wit your tollars after you shall sell your pork and beef to see you mate goot use of itmight dat be liperty  that why who do you think would trouble himself about my arnins its the big fish only that folks talk about and care about in such matters  den folks make hugh littlebage a big fish by dair own mettlin und enfy und cofetousnessis it not so  harkee frind i some think youre leanin yourself to kingly ways and to the idees in which you was brought up take my advice and abandon all these notions as soon as you can for theyll never be popular in this part of the world  popular how broad has the signification of this word got to be in the eyes of twothirds of the population it already means what is right vox populi vox dei to what an extent is this little word made to entwine itself around all the interests of life when it is deemed expedient to inculcate certain notions in the minds of the people the first argument used is to endeavor to persuade the inhabitants of new york that the inhabitants of pennsylvania are already of that mind a simulated public opinion is the strongest argument used indeed on every occasion of the public discussion of any disputed point he that can count the most voices is a better man than he who can give the most reasons numbers carrying more weight with them than facts or law it is evident that while in some things such a system may work well there are others and those of overshadowing importance in which its tendency is direct and fearful toward corruption  as soon as tubbs had given his admonition he applied the whip to his horse and trotted on leaving us to follow at the best gait we could extort from tom millers hack     chapter xvii      if he were with me king of tuscarora       gazing as i upon thy portrait now     in all its medalled fringed and bearded glory       its eyes dark beauty and its thoughtful brow      its brow half martial half diplomatic       its eye upsoaring like an eagles wings     well might he boast that we the democratic       outrival europeeven in our kingsred jacket   my uncle ro said nothing when the two tenants left us though i saw by his countenance that he felt all the absurdity of the stuff we had just been listening to we had got within half a mile of the woods when eight injins came galloping up to a wagon that was directly behind us which contained another of my tenants with his eldest son a lad of sixteen whom he had brought with him as a scholar in having his sense of right unsettled by the selfish mystification that was going on in the land a species of fatherly care that was of very questionable merit i said there were eight of these injins but there were only four horses each beast carrying double no sooner did the leaders of the party reach the wagon i have mentioned than it was stopped and its owner was commanded to alight the man was a decided downrenter but he obeyed the order with a very illgrace and did not obey at all indeed until he was helped out of the wagon by a little gentle violence of this fragment of his own corps darmée the boy was soon put into the highway when two of the disguised and armed leaped into the vacant places and drove on passing us at a furious pace making a parting nod to the owner of the vehicle and consoling him for its temporary loss by calling out injin want himinjin good fellow you know  whether the discomfited farmer knew or not we could not tell but he looked as if he wished the injins anywhere but in their happy hunting grounds we drove on laughing for it was in human nature to be amused at such an exhibition of the compulsory system or of liberty and equality carried out and more particularly so when i was certain that the honest hardworking hornyhanded tiller of the soil wanted to cheat me out of a farm or to put his case in the most favorable point of view wanted to compel me to sell him one at his own price nor did our amusement stop here before we reached the woods we found holmes and tubbs in the highway too the other two worthies who had been mounted en croupe having dispossessed them of their wagon also and told them to charge it to injin we afterward learned that this practice was very general the owner recovering his horse and team in the course of a few days by hearing it had been left secretly at some tavern within a few miles of his residence as for old holmes he was in an honest indignation when we came up with him while even tubbs looked soured and discontented or as if he thought friends were entitled to better treatment  vhat ist der matter cried out uncle ro who could hardly keep from laughing the whole time vhat ist der matter now vhere might be your hantsome vaggin and your gay horse  its too badyes its eeny most too bad grunted holmes here am i past threescoreandten which is the full time of man the bible saysand what the bible says must be true you knowhere have they trundled me into the highway as they would a sack of potatoes and left me to walk every step of four miles to reach my own door its too badits eeny most too bad  oh dat might be a trifle compared to vhat it vould be to haf peen drundelled out of your farm  i knowti knowti

vanting to haf your neighpors goots  it cries that down dreadfully yes theres plenty of that in the good book i know from havin heard it readay and havin read it myself these threescore years it doos cry it down the most awfully i shall tell the injins this the next time they want my wagon theres bible agin all sich practices  der piple ist a good pook  that it isthat it isand great is the consolation and hope that i have known drawn from its pages im glad to find that they set store by the bible in jarmany i was pretty much of the notion we had most of the religion thats goin in ameriky and its pleasant to find there is some in jarmany  all this time old holmes was puffing along on foot my uncle ro walking his horse in order to enjoy his discourse  oh jaja jadere might be some religion left in der olt worltde puritans as you might call dem did not pring it all away  desprate good people them we got all our best sarcumstances from our puritan forefathers some folks say that all america has got is owing to them very saints  jaund if it bees not so nefer mind for dey will be sartain to get all ameriky  holmes was mystified but he kept tugging on casting wistful glances at our wagon as he endeavored to keep up with it fearful we might trot on and leave him the old man continued the discourse yes he said our authority for everything must come from the bible ater all it tells us we hadnt ought to bear malice and thats a rule i endivor to act up to for an old man you see cant indulge his sinful natur if he would now ive been down to little neest to attend a downrent meetinbut i bear no more malice agin hugh littlepage not i no more than if he werent a bit of my landlord all i want of him is my farm on such a lay as i can live by and the bys ater me i look on it as dreadful hard and oppressive that the littlepages should refuse to let us have the place seein that i have worked it now for the tarm of three whull lives  und dey agreet dat dey might sell you de farm when dem dree lifes wast up  no not in downright language they didnt as i must allow in the way of bargain i must own the advantage is altogether on the side of littlepage that was his grandthers act and if you wunt drive quite so fast as im getting a little out of wind ill tell you all about it that is just what we complain on the bargain being so much in his favor now my lives have hung on desprately havent they shabbakuk appealing to tubbs its every hour of fortyfive years sin i tuck that lease and one life that of my old woman is still in bein as they call it though its a sort of bein that a body might as well not have as have she cant stand it a great while longer and then that farm that i set so much store by out of which ive made my livelihood most of my life and on which ive brought up fourteen children will go out of my hands to enrich hugh littlepage whos got so much now he cant spend it at hum like honest folks but must go abroad to waste it in riotous living as they tell us yes onless the governor and the legislature helps me out of my difficulty i dont see but hugh littlepage must get it all making the rich richer and the poor poorer  und vhy must dis cruel ding come to pass vhy might not mans keep his own in ameriky  thats jest it you see it isnt my own in law only by natur like and the speret of the institutions as they call it im sure i dont kear much how i get it so it only comes if the governor can only make the landlords sell or even give away he may sartainly count on my support providin they dont put the prices too high i hate high prices which is onsuitable to a free country  fery drue i sooppose your lease might gif you dat farm quite reasonaple as it might be mate so long ago  only two shillings the acre answered the old fellow with a knowing look which as much as boasted of the capital bargain he had in the affair or twentyfive dollars a year for a hundred acres thats no great matter im ready to allow but my lives havin held on so desprately until lands got up to forty dollars an acre about here i cant no more expect sich another lay than i can expect to go to congress i can rent that place tomorrow mornin for 150 of as good money as any man can pay  und how much might you expect squire littlepage woult ask on a new lease  some think as much as 6250 though other some think he would let it go to me for 50 for three lives longer the old ginral told me when he signed the lease that i was gettin a bargain but niver mind said he if i give you good tarms youll make the better tenant and i look to posterity and their benefit as much as i do to my own if i dont get the advantage i might says he my children or my childrens children will a man musnt altogether live for himself in this world especially if he has children them was good idees wasnt they  you might not dink differently und how moch woult you love to bay for a deet of de farm  waal theres differences of opinion on that subject the most approved notion is that hugh littlepage ought to be made to give warrantees with full covenants as its called and covenants is all in all in a deed you know  but might not be in a lease put in uncle ro somewhat dryly  that depindsbut some say them deeds ought to be given if the tenants allow the landlords the worth of the land when the patentee got it and interest down to the present day it does not seem a desprate price to pay for land to give principal and interest and to throw in all that has been paid beside  haf you made a calculation to see vhat it might come to  shabbakuk has tell the gentleman shabbakuk how much you made it come to the acre  shabbakuk was a far deeper rogue than his neighbor holmes the last was merely a man of selfish and narrow views who from passing a long life with no other object before him than that of scraping together property had got his mind completely ensnared in the meshes of this worlds net whereas his companion took the initiative as the french have it in knavery and not only carried out but invented the schemes of the wicked he clearly did not like this appeal to his arithmetic but having no suspicion to whom he was talking and fancying every man in the lower conditions of life must be an ally in a plan to make the rich poorer and the poor richer he was a little more communicative than might otherwise have been the case after reflecting a moment he gave us his answer reading from a paper in his hand on which the whole sum had been elaborately worked for the occasion of the late meeting  the land was worth ten cents an acre maybe when the first littlepage got it and that is a liberal price now that was eighty years since for we dont count old herman mordaunts time as anything seeing that the land was worth next to nothin in his time the interest on ten cents at seven per cent is seven mills a year or five hundred and sixty mills for eighty years this is without compound compound being unlawful and nothin agin law should be taken into the account add the ten cents to the five hundred and sixty mills and you get six hundred and sixty mills or sixtysix cents now this sum or a sum calculated on the same principles all the tenants are willing to pay for their farms27 and if justice prevails they will get em  footnote 27 in order that the reader may understand mr hugh littlepage is not inventing i will add that propositions still more extravagant than these have been openly circulated among the antirenters up and down the countryeditor  dat seems but little to bay for landt dat might now rent for a dollar an acre each year  you forgit that the littlepages have had the rent these eighty years the whull time  und de denants haf hat de farms dese eighty years de whole time too  oh we put the land agin the work if my neighbor holmes here has had his farm fortyfive years so the farm has had his work fortyfive years as an offset you may depind ont the governor and the legislature understand all that  if dey does answered uncle ro whipping his horse into a trot dey must be fit for deir high stations it is goot for a country to haf great governors and great legisladors guten tag  away he went leaving neighbor holmes shabbakuk tubbs the governor and legislature with their joint morals wisdom logic and philosophy in the highway together my uncle ro shook his head and then he laughed as the absurdity of what had just passed forced itself on his imagination  i dare say many may be found who have openly professed principles and opinions identical in substance with what has just been related here who will be disposed to deny them when they are thrown into their faces there is nothing unusual in mens refusing to recognize their own children when they are ashamed of the circumstances that brought them into being but in the course of this controversy i have often heard arguments in discourse and have often read them in the journals as they have been put into the mouths of men in authority and that too in their public communications which stripped of their very thin coverings are pretty much on the level with those of holmes and tubbs i am aware that no governor has as yet alluded to the hardships of the tenants under the limited leases but it would be idle to deny that the door has been opened to principles or want of principles that must sweep away all such property in the current of reckless popular clamor unless the evil be soon arrested i say evil for it must prove a curse to any community to break down the securities of property as it is held in what has hitherto been thought its most secure form and what is of still more importance in a moral point of view all to appease the cravings of cupidity as they are exhibited in the masses  we were soon out of sight of holmes and tubbs and in the woods i confess that i expected each instant to overtake hall in the hands of the injins for the movement among that class of persons had appeared to me as one directed particularly against him we saw nothing of the sort however and had nearly reached the northern limits of the bit of forest when we came in sight of the two wagons which had been so cavalierly taken possession of and of the two horses ridden by the mounted men the whole were drawn up on one side of the highway under the charge of a single injin in a manner to announce that we were approaching a point of some interest  my uncle and myself fully expected to be again stopped as we drove up to the place just mentioned not only was the track of the road left clear however but we were suffered to pass without a question all the horses had been in a lather as if driven very hard though otherwise there was nothing to indicate trouble if we except the presence of the solitary sentinel from this fellow neither signs nor order molested us but on we went at tom millers horses favorite amble until we were so near the verge of the wood as to get a view into the open fields beyond here indeed we obtained a sight of certain movements that i confess gave me some little concern  among the bushes that lined the highway and which have been already mentioned i got a glimpse of several of the disguised and armed who were evidently lying in ambush their number might have been twenty in all and it was now sufficiently apparent that those who had pressed the wagons had been hurrying forward to reenforce their party at this point i felt quite certain we should be stopped but we were not we were suffered to pass without question as we had just passed the wagons and horses though it must have been known to the party that we were fully aware of their presence at that particular spot but on we went and were soon unmolested in the open country  it was not long however before the mystery was explained a road descended from the higher ground which lay to the westward of us a little on our left and a party of men was coming down it at a quick walk which at the first glance i mistook for a detachment of the injins but which at a second look i ascertained to be composed of indians or real red men the difference between the two is very great as every american will at once admit though many who read this manuscript will be obliged to me for an explanation there is indian and injin the injin is a white man who bent on an unworthy and illegal purpose is obliged to hide his face and to perform his task in disguise the indian is a red man who is neither afraid nor ashamed to show his countenance equally to friend or enemy the first is the agent of designing demagogues the hireling of a discontented and grasping spirit who mocks at truth and right by calling himself one who labors to carry out the spirit of those institutions which he dishonors and is afraid to trust while the other serves himself only and is afraid of nothing one is skulking from and shirking the duties of civilization while the other though a savage is at least true to his own professions  there they were sure enough a party of some sixteen or eighteen of the real aborigines it is not an uncommon thing to meet with an indian or two strolling about the country selling basketsformerly it was brooms of birch but the march of improvement has nearly banished so rude a manufacture from the countrywith a squaw or two in company but it is now very unusual to meet a true indian warrior in the heart of the state carrying his rifle and tomahawk as was the case with all those who were so swiftly descending the road my uncle ro was quite as much astonished as i was myself and he pulled up at the junction of the two highways in order to await the arrival of the strangers  these are real redskins hughand of a noble tribe cried my uncle as a still nearer approach gave him a better and better view warriors of the west out of all question with one white man in attendancewhat can such a party possibly want at ravensnest  perhaps the antirenters intend to enlarge their plans and have a scheme to come out upon us with an alliance formed with the true sons of the forestmay they not intend intimidation  whom could they thus intimidate but their own wives and children but here they come in a noble body and we can speak to them  there they did come indeed seventeen of the finer specimens of the redskins as they are now sometimes seen passing among us in bodies moving to or from their distant prairies for the white man has already forced the indian with the bears and the elk and the moose out of the forests of america upon those vast plains  what is to be the end of the increase of this nation is one of the mysteries of divine providence if faithful to the right if just not in the sense of yielding to the clamors of the many but in the sense of good laws if true to themselves the people of this republic may laugh at european interference and european power when brought to bear on their home interests as so much of the lumbering policy of ages no longer suited to the facts and feelings of our own times and push on to the fulfilment of a destiny which if carried out on the apparent designs of the ruler of the earth will leave that of all other states which have preceded us as much in the shade as the mountain leaves the valley but it must not be forgotten that the brightest dawns often usher in the darkest days that the most brilliant youths frequently precede manhoods of disappointment and baffled wishes that even the professed man of god can fall away from his vows and his faith and finish a career that was commenced in virtue and hope in profligacy and sin nations are no more safe from the influence of temptation than individuals and this has a weakness peculiarly its own instead of falling back on its popular principle in extremities as its infallible safeguard it is precisely in the irresponsible and grasping character of that principle that its danger is to be apprehended that principle which kept within the limits of right is so admirably adapted to restraining the ordinary workings of cupidity and selfishness as they are familiarly seen in narrow governments when permitted to overrun the boundaries placed for its control becomes a torrent that has broken out of its icy bed in the spring and completely defaces all that is beneficial or lovely in either nature or art that may happen to lie in its course as yet the experience of two centuries has offered nothing so menacing to the future prosperity of this country as the social fermentation which is at this moment at work in the state of new york on the result of this depends the solution of the allimportant question whether principles are to rule this republic or men and these last too viewed in their most vulgar and repulsive qualities or as the mere creatures of self instead of being the guardians and agents of that which ought to be it is owing to this state of things that we have already seen a legislature occupied with discussing the modes of evading the provisions of its own laws and men who ought to stand before the world stern and uncompromising in their public morals manifesting a most pernicious ingenuity in endeavoring to master and overreach each other in wielding the arts of the demagogue  as the indians entered the north and south road or that in which we had stopped the whole party came to a halt with characteristic courtesy as if to meet our wish to speak to them the foremost of the band who was also the oldest being a man of sixty if not older nodded his head and uttered the usual conventional salutation of sago sago  sago said my uncle and sago put in i  how do continued the indian who we now discovered spoke english what call this country  this is ravensnest the village of little nest is about a mile and a half on the other side of that wood  the indian now turned and in his deep guttural tones communicated this intelligence to his fellows the information obviously was well received which was as much as saying that they had reached the end of their journey some conversation next succeeded delivered in brief sententious remarks when the old chief again turned to us i call him chief though it was evident that the whole party was composed of chiefs this was apparent by their medals their fine appearance generally and by their quiet dignified not so say lofty bearing each of them was in a light summer attire wearing the moccason and leggings etc the calico shirt or a thin blanket that was cast around the upper part of the person much as the roman may be supposed to have worn his toga all carrying the rifle the bright wellscoured tomahawk and the sheathed knife each too had his horn and his bulletpouch and some of the more youthful were a little elaborate in their ornaments in the way of feathers and such presents as they had received on their long journey not one of them all however was painted  this ravennest eh continued the old chief speaking directly but with sufficient courtesy  as i have said the village lies on the other side of that wood the house from which the name is taken is a mile and a half in the other direction  this too was translated and a low but general expression of pleasure was given  any injins bout here eh demanded the chief looking so earnestly at the same time as to surprise us both  yes answered my uncle there are injinsa party is in the edge of the woods there within thirty rods of you at this moment  with great rapidity this fact was communicated to the eager listeners and there was a sensation in the party though it was a sensation betrayed as such feelings are only betrayed among the aborigines of this part of the world quietly reservedly and with a coldness amounting nearly to indifference we were amused however at noting how much more interest this news awakened than would probably have been excited had these redmen been told a town like london was on the other side of the wood as children are known to feel most interest in children so did these children of the forest seem to be most alive to an interest in these unexpected neighbors brethren of the same habits and race as they unquestionably imagined after some earnest discourse among themselves the old chief whose named turned out to be prairiefire once more addressed himself to us  what tribe eh know tribe  they are called anti rent injinsa new tribe in this part of the country and are not much esteemed  bad injin eh  i am afraid so they are not honest enough to go in paint but wear shirts over their faces  another long and wondering conference succeeded it is to be supposed that such a tribe as that of the antirenters was hitherto unknown among the american savages the first intelligence of the existence of such a people would naturally awaken great interest and we were soon requested to show them the way to the spot where this unheard of tribe might be found this was going somewhat further than my uncle had anticipated but he was not a man to beat a retreat when he had once undertaken an enterprise after a short deliberation with himself he signified his assent and alighting from our wagon we fastened tom millers horse to a stake of one of the fences and set off on foot as guides to our new brethren in seeking the great tribe of the antirenters we had not gone half the distance to the woods before we met holmes and tubbs who getting a cast in another wagon until they reached the place where their own vehicle was stationed had recovered that and were now on their way home apprehensive that some new freak of their great allies might throw them out into the highway again this wagon our own excepted was the only one that had yet emerged from the wood the owners of some twenty others preferring to remain in the background until the development of the meeting between the tribes should occur  what in natur does all this mean exclaimed old holmes as we approached him reining in his horse for the purposes of a conference is the governor sending out raal injins agin us in order to favor the landlords  this was taking a harsh and most uncharitable view of the course of the governor for an antirenter but that functionary having made the capital blunder of serving altogether neither god nor mammon in this great question must expect to take it right and left as neither god nor mammon will be very likely to approve of his course  vell i dont know was my uncles answer dese ist raal redmen und dem younder ist raal injins dats all vhat might bring dese warriors here joost now you must ask of demselves if you wants to larn  there can be no harm in asking im no way skeary about redskins having seen em often and my father fit em in his day as ive heern him tell sago sago  sago answered prairiefire with his customary courtesy  where in natur do you redmen all come from and where can ye be goin  it was apparent that holmes belonged to a school that never hesitated about putting any question and that would have an answer if an answer was to be got the old chief had probably met with such palefaces before the untrained american being certainly among the most diligent of all the human beings of that class but on the other hand the redman regards the indulgence of a too eager curiosity as womanish and unworthy of the selfcommand and dignity of a warrior the betraying of surprise and the indulgence of a curiosity fit only for squaws were two things that prairiefire had doubtless been early told were unworthy of his sex for to some such inandin breeding alone could be referred the explanation of the circumstance that neither holmess manner address nor language caused in him the least expression of emotion he answered the questions however and that with a coldness that seemed of proof  come from setting sunbeen to see great father at washingtongo home was the sententious reply  but how come ye to pass by ravensnestim afeared the governor and them chaps at albany must have a hand in this shabbakuk  what shabbakuk thought of the governor and them chaps at albany is not known as he did not see fit to make any reply his ordinary propensity to meddle was probably awed by the appearance of these real redskins  i say why do ye come thisaway holmes continued repeating his question if youve been to washington and found him to hum anglice at home why didnt ye go back by the way ye come  come here to find injin got no injin here eh  injin why of one sort weve got more of the critturs than a body can very well git along with of what color be the injins you want to find be they of the paleface natur or be they red like yourselves  want to find redman he ole now like top of dead hemlock wind blow trough his branches till leaf all fall off  by george hugh whispered my uncle these redskins are in search of old susquesus then entirely forgetting the necessity of maintaining his broken english in the presence of his two ravensnest listeners shabbakuk tubbs in particular he turned somewhat inconsiderately for one of his years to the prairiefire and hastily remarked  i can help you in your search you are looking for a warrior of the onondagoes one who left his tribe a hundred summers ago a redman of great renown for finding his path in the forest and who would never taste firewater his name is susquesus  until this moment the only white man who was in company with this strange partystrange at least in our portion of the state of new york though common enough perhaps on the great thoroughfares of the countrybroke silence this man was an ordinary interpreter who had been sent with the party in case of necessity but being little more acquainted with the ways of civilization than those whom he was to guide he had prudently held his tongue until he saw that he might be of some use we afterward learned that the subagent who had accompanied the chiefs to washington had profited by the wish of the indians to pay their passing homage to the withered hemlock that still stands as they poetically called susquesus in their own dialectsfor indians of several tribes were presentto pay a visit to his own relatives in massachusetts his presence not being deemed necessary in such a purely pious pilgrimage  youre right observed the interpreter these chiefs have not come to look up any tribe but there are two of the ancient onondagoes among them and their traditions tell of a chief called susquesus that has outlived everything but tradition who left his own people long long ago and who left a great name behind him for vartue and that is a thing a redskin never forgets  and all these warriors have come fifty miles out of their way to pay this homage to susquesus  such has been their wish and i asked permission of the bureau at washington to permit them to come it costs uncle sam 50 or a 100 more than it otherwise might but such a visit will do all the warriors of the west a million of dollars of good no men honor right and justice more than redskins though its in their own fashion  i am sure uncle sam has acted no more than righteously as i hope he always may act as respects these people susquesus is an old friend of mine and i will lead you to him  and who in natur be you demanded holmes his curiosity starting off on a new track  who am iyou shall know who i am answered uncle ro removing his wig an action that i imitated on the spoti am roger littlepage the late trustee of this estate and this is hugh littlepage its owner old holmes was good pluck in most matters of far better stuff at the bottom than the sneaking snivelling prating demagogue at his side but by this discovery he was dumfounded he looked at my uncle then he looked at me after which he fastened a distressed and inquiring gaze on shabbakuk as for the indians notwithstanding their habitual selfcommand a common hugh was uttered among them when they saw two men as it might be thus scalping themselves uncle ro was excited and his manner was in the last degree theatrical as with one hand he removed his cap and with the other his wig holding the last with an extended arm in the direction of the indians as a redman is rarely guilty of any act of rudeness unless he means to play the brute in good earnest it is possible that the chippewa toward whom the hand which held the wig was extended mistook the attitude for an invitation to examine that curious article for himself it is certain he gently forced it from my uncles grasp and in the twinkling of an eye all the savages were gathered round it uttering many but low and guarded expressions of surprise those men were all chiefs and they restrained their astonishment at this point had there been any of the ignoble vulgar among them there is little doubt that the wig would have passed from hand to hand and been fitted to a dozen heads already shaved to receive it     chapter xviii      the gordon is gude in a hurry       an campbell is steel to the bane     an grant an mackenzie an murray       an cameron will truckle to namehogg   the interruption of this scene came from old holmes who cried to his companion on the high key in which it was usual for him to speak  this is downright bad shabbakukwell never get our leases ater this  nobody can sayanswered tubbs giving a loud hem as if determined to brazen the matter out maybe the gentleman will be glad to compromise the matter its agin law i believe for anyone to appear on the highway disguisedand both the squire littlepages youll notice neighbor holmes be in the very middle of the road and both was disguised only a minute ago  thats true dye think anything can be got out o that i want profitable proceedins  shabbakuk gave another hem looked behind him as if to ascertain what had become of the injins for he clearly did not fancy the real article before him and then he answered  we may get our farms neighbor holmes if youll agree as im willin to do to be reasonable about this matter so long as squire littlepage wishes to hearken to his own interests  my uncle did not deign to make any answer but knowing we had done nothing to bring us within the view of the late statute he turned toward the indians renewing his offer to them to be their guide  the chiefs want very much to know who you are and how you two came by double scalps said the interpreter smiling like one who understood for his own part the nature of a wig very well  tell them that this young gentleman is hugh littlepage and that i am his uncle hugh littlepage is the owner of the land that you see on every side of you  the answer was communicated and we waited for its effect on the indians to our surprise several of them soon gathered around evidently regarding us both with interest and respect  the claims of a landlord seem to be better understood among these untutored savages than among your own tenants hugh said my uncle but there goes old holmes the inbred rogue and his friend shabbakuk back to the woods we may have an affair on hand with his injins  i think not sir it does not appear to me that there is valor enough in that tribe to face this in general the white man is fully a match for the redskin but it may be doubted whether chiefs like these would not prove too much for twice their number of varlets of the breed of yonder skulking scoundrels  why do the chiefs manifest so much interest in us asked my uncle of the interpreter is it possible that they pay so much respect to us on account of our connection with this estate  not at allnot at all they know the difference between a chief and a common man well enough it is true was the answer and twenty times as we have come down through the country have they expressed their surprise to me that so many common men should be chiefs among the palefaces but they care nothing for riches he is the greatest man among them who is best on a warpath and at a councilfire though they do honor them that has had great and useful ancestors  but they seem to betray some unusual and extraordinary interest in us too perhaps they are surprised at seeing gentlemen in such dresses  lord sir what do men care for dresses that are used to see the heads of factories and forts half the time dressed in skins they know that there be holidays and workindays times for everyday wear and times for feathers and paint nonothey look at you both with so much interest on account of their traditions  their traditions what can these have to do with us we have never had anything to do with indians  thats true of you and may be true of your fathers but its not true of some of your ancestors yesterday after we had got to our nights stoppingplace two of the chiefs this smallish man with the double plate on his breast and that elderly warrior who has been once scalped as you can see by his crown began to tell of some of the treacheries of their own tribe which was once a canada people the elderly chief related the adventures of a warpath that led out of canada across the large waters down to a settlement where they expected to get a great many scalps but where in the end they lost more scalps than they found and where they met susquesus the upright onondago as they call him in that tongue as well as the yengeese owner of the land at this very spot whom they called by a name something like your own who was a warrior of great courage and skill by their traditions they suppose you to be the descendants of the last and honor you accordingly thats all  and is it possible that these untutored beings have traditions as reliable as this  lord if you could hear what they say among themselves about the lies that are read to them out of the paleface prints you would larn how much store they set by truth in my day i have travelled through a hundred miles of wilderness by a path that was no better nor any worse than an indian tradition of its manner of running and a tradition that must have been at least a hundred summers old they know all about your forefathers and they know something about you too if you be the gentleman that finds the upright onondago or the withered hemlock in his old age with a wigwam and keeps it filled with food and fuel  is this possible and all this is spoken of and known among the savages of the far west  if you call these chiefs savages returned the interpreter a little offended at hearing such a term applied to his best friends and constant associates to be sure they have their ways and so have the palefaces but injin ways be not so very savage when a body gets a little used to them now i remember it was a long time before i could get reconciled to seeing a warrior scalp his enemy but as i reasoned on it and entered into the spirit of the practice i began to feel it was all right  i was walking just in front of my uncle for we were in motion again on our way to the wood but could not help turning and saying to him with a smile  so it would seem that this matter of the spirit is to be found in other places beside the legislature there is the spirit of scalping as well as the spirit of the institutions  ay hugh and the spirit of fleecing as a consequence of what is profanely termed the last but it may be well to go no nearer to the wood than this spot the injins i have told you of are in these bushes in front and they are armed i leave you to communicate with them in any manner you please they are about twenty in number  the interpreter informed his chiefs of what had been said who spoke together in earnest consultation for a moment then prairiefire himself plucked a branch off the nearest bush and holding it up he advanced close to the cover and called out aloud in some one or in many of the different dialects with which he was acquainted i saw by the moving of the branches that men were in the bushes but no answer of any sort was made there was one savage in our band who betrayed manifest impatience at these proceedings he was a large athletic iowa chief called in english flintyheart and as we subsequently learned of great renown for martial exploits it was always difficult to hold him in when there was a prospect of scalps and he was now less restrained than common from the circumstance of his having no superior of his own particular tribe present after prairiefire had called two or three times in vain to the party in the cover flintyheart stepped out spoke a few words with energy and spirit terminating his appeal by a most effective not to say appalling whoop that sound was echoed back by most of the band when they all broke off right and left stealing more like snakes than bipeds to the fences under cover of which they glanced forward to the wood in which every man of them buried himself in the twinkling of an eye in vain had the interpreter called to them to remind them where they were and to tell them that they might displease their great father at washington and prairiefire stood his ground exposed to any shot the supposed foe might send at him on they went like so many hounds that have struck a scent too strong to be held in restraint by any whipperin  they expect to find injins said the interpreter in a sort of despair and theres no holdin em back there can be no enemies of theirn down hereaway and the agent will be awfully angry if blood is drawn though i shouldnt mind it a bit if the party was some of them scoundrels the sacs and foxes whom its often a marcy to kill its different down here however and i must say i wish this hadnt happened  my uncle and myself just waited long enough to hear this when we rushed forward along the highway and entered the wood joined by prairiefire who fancying by our movement that all was right now raised such a whoop himself as to demonstrate it was not for want of knowing how that he had hitherto been silent the road made a curve at the very point where it penetrated the forest and being fringed with the bushes already mentioned the two circumstances shut out the view of what was passing behind the scenes until we reached the turn where a common halt of the wagons had been made when the whole view burst upon us at once in all its magnificence  a rout of a grand army could scarcely have been more picturesque the road was lined with vehicles in full retreat to use a military term or to speak in the more common parlance scampering off every whip was in active use every horse was on the run while half the faces were turned behind their owners the women sending back screams to the whoops of the savages as for the injins they had instinctively abandoned the woods and poured down into the highwayspeed like theirs demanding open ground for its finest display some had leaped into wagons piling themselves up among those virtuous wives and daughters of that portion of the honest yeomanry who had collected to devise the means of cheating me out of my property but why dwell on this scene since the exploits of these indians for the last six years have amply proved that the only thing in which they excel is in running away they are heroes when a dozen can get round a single man to tar and feather him valiant as a hundred against five or six and occasionally murderers when each victim can be destroyed by five or six bullets to make sure of him the very cowardice of the scoundrels should render them loathsome to the whole community the dog that has spirit only to hunt in packs being cur at the bottom  i must add one other object to the view however holmes and shabbakuk brought up the rear and both were flogging their devoted beast as if his employersi dare not call them masters as i might be accused of aristocracy for using so offensive a term in this age of commonsense liberty while employers is a very significant expression for the particular occasionas if his employers then had left something behind them at little neest and were hurrying back to obtain it before it fell into other hands old holmes kept looking behind as if chased by the covenants of forty leases while the spirit of the institutions headed by two governors and the honorable gentleman from albany was in full pursuit if the spirit of the institutions was really there it was quite alone for i looked in vain for the exhibition of any other spirit in much less time than it has taken me to write this account the road was cleared leaving my uncle myself and prairiefire in quiet possession the latter uttering a very significant hugh as the last wagon went out of sight in a cloud of dust  it was but a moment however before our own tribe or tribes would be more accurate came down upon us collecting in the road at the very spot where we stood the victory had been bloodless but it was complete not only had the savage indians completely routed the virtuous and muchoppressedbyaristocracy injins but they had captured two specimens of virtue and depression in the persons of as many of the band so very significant and expressive was the manner of the captives that flintyheart into whose hands they had fallen not only seemed to hold their scalps in contempt but actually had disdained to disarm them there they stood bundles of calico resembling children in swaddlingclothes with nothing partaking of that natural freedom of which their party love to boast but their legs which were left at perfect liberty by way of a dernier resort my uncle now assumed a little authority and commanded these fellows to take off their disguises he might as well have ordered one of the oaks or maples to lay down its leaves before the season came round for neither would obey  the interpreter however whose name was manytongues rendered into english from the indian dialects was a man of surprisingly few words considering his calling on an occasion like this walking up to one of the prisoners he first disarmed him and then removed his calico hood exposing the discomfited countenance of brigham tom millers envious laborer the hughs that escaped the indians were very expressive on finding that not only did a paleface countenance appear from beneath the covering but one that might be said to be somewhat paler than common manytongues had a good deal of frontier waggery about him and by this time he began to comprehend how the land lay passing his hand over joshs head he coolly remarked  that scalp would be thought more of in iowa than its raally worth im thinking if truth was said but let us see who we have here  suiting the action to the words as it is termed the interpreter laid hold of the hood of the other captive but did not succeed in removing it without a sharp struggle he effected his purpose assisted by two of the younger chiefs who stepped forward to aid him i anticipated the result for i had early recognized the gore but great was the surprise of my uncle when he saw seneca newcomes wellknown face developed by the change  senecaor it might be better now to use his own favorite orthoepy and call him seneky at once for he had a particularly sneaking look as he emerged from under the calico and this would be suiting the sound to appearancesseneky then was in a mingled tumult as it is called of rage and shame the first predominated however and as is only too common in cases of military disasters instead of attributing his capture to circumstances the prowess of his enemies or any fault of his own he sought to mitigate his own disgrace by heaping disgrace on his comrade indeed the manner in which these men went at each other as soon as unsacked reminded me of two gamecocks that are let out of their bags within three feet of each other with this exceptionneither crowed  this is all your fault you cowardly dog said seneky almost fiercely for shame had filled his face with blood had you kept on your feet and not run me down in your haste to get off i might have retreated and got clear with the rest of them  this assault was too much for joshua who gained spirit to answer by its rudeness and violence not to say injustice for as we afterward ascertained newcome had actually fallen in his eagerness to retreat and brigham so far from being the cause of his coming down had only prevented his getting up by falling on top of him in this prostrate condition they had further fallen into the hands of their enemies  i want nothin from you squire newcome answered joshua quite decidedly as to tone and manner your character is well known all up and down the country  what of my character what have you got to say agin me or my character demanded the attorneyatlaw in a tone of high defiance i want to see the man who can say anything agin my character  this was pretty well considering that the fellow had actually been detected in the commission of a felony though i suppose that difficulty would have been gotten over in a moral sense by the claim of being taken while struggling in defence of human rights and the spirit of the institutions the defiance was too much for brighams patience and being fully assured by this time that he was not in much danger of being scalped he turned upon seneca and cried with something more than spirit with downright rancor  youre a pretty frind of the poor man and of the people if truth must be said ant you everybody in the county thats in want of money knows what you be you dd shaver  as the last words came out senekys fist went in upon brighams nose causing the blood to flow freely my uncle ro now thought it time to interfere and he rebuked the irritated lawyer with dignity  why did he call me a dd shaver then retorted seneky still angry and red ill stand that from no man  why what harm can there be in such a charge mr newcome you are a member of the bar and ought to understand the laws of your country and cannot stand in need of being told that it has been decided by the highest tribunal of your state that it is no reproach to be called a shaver some of the honorable members of that learned body indeed seem to think on the contrary that it is matter of commendation and congratulation i am ashamed of you mr newcomeim quite ashamed of you  seneky muttered something in which i fancied i understood the words the court of errors be dd or the court of errors might go to some very bad place which i will not name but i will not take on myself that any man of decency could really use such irreverent language about a body so truly eminent though a person in a passion is sometimes disposed to forget propriety my uncle now thought it time to put an end to this scene and without deigning to enter into any explanation he signified to manytongues his readiness to lead his chiefs to the point where they desired to go  as to these two injins he added their capture will do us no honor and now we know who they are they can be taken at any time by the deputy sheriffs or constables it is hardly worth while to encumber your march with such fellows  the chiefs assented to this proposal too and we quitted the woods in a body leaving seneky and joshua on the ground as we subsequently learned our backs were no sooner turned than the last pitched into the first and pounded him not only until he owned he was a shaver but that he was a dd shaver in the bargain such was the man and such the class that the deluded antirenters of new york wish to substitute in a social sense for the ancient landlords of the country a pretty topsheaf they would make to the stack of the community and admirably would the grain be kept that was protected by their covering one would like to see fellows of this moral calibre interpreting their covenants and it would be a useful though a painful lesson to see the change effected for a twelvemonth in order to ascertain after things had got back into the old natural channel how many would then wish to return like the dog to his vomit or the sow to her wallowing in the mire  after giving some directions to manytongues my uncle and i got into our wagon and drove up the road leaving the indians to follow the rendezvous was at the nest whither we had now determined to proceed at once and assume our proper characters in passing the rectory we found time to stop and run in to inquire after the welfare of mr and miss warren great was my joy at learning they had gone on to the nest where they were all to dine this intelligence did not tend to lessen the speed of millers horse or my horse it would be better to say for i am the real owner of everything on the nest farm and shall probably so remain unless the spirit of the institutions gets at my property there as well as in other places in the course of half an hour we drove on the lawn and stopped at the door it will be recollected that the indians had our wigs which had been left by my uncle and myself in their hands as things of no further use to us notwithstanding our dresses the instant we presented ourselves without these instruments of disguise we were recognized and the cry went through the house and grounds that mr hugh had come home i confess i was touched with some signs of interest and feeling that escaped the domestics as well as those who belonged out of doors when they saw me again standing before them in health if not in good looks my uncle too was welcome and there were a few minutes during which i forgot all my grounds for vexation and was truly happy  although my grandmother and sister and mary warren all knew what the cry of mr hugh has got home meant it brought everybody out upon the piazza mr warren had related the events of the day as far as he was acquainted with them but even those who were in the secret were surprised at our thus returning unwigged and in our proper characters as for myself i could not but note the manner in which the four girls came out to meet me martha flew into my embrace cast her arms around my neck kissing me six or eight times without stopping then miss colebrooke came next with ann marston leaning on her arm both smiling though greatly surprised and both bright and pretty and ladylike they were glad to see me and met my salutations frankly and like old friends though i could see they did not fancy my dress in the least mary warren was behind them all smiling blushing and shy but it did not require two looks from me to make certain that her welcome was as sincere as that of my older friends mr warren was glad to have it in his power to greet us openly and to form an acquaintance with those to whose return he had now been looking with anxiety and hope for three or four years  a few minutes sufficed for the necessary explanations a part of which indeed had already been made by those who were previously in the secret when my dear grandmother and patt insisted on our going up to our old room and of dressing ourselves in attire more suitable to our stations a plenty of summer clothes had been left behind us and our wardrobes had been examined that morning in anticipation of our soon having need of them so that no great time was necessary to make the change i was a little fuller than when i left home but the clothes being loose there was no difficulty in equipping myself i found a handsome blue dresscoat that did very well and vests and pantaloons ad libitum clothing is so much cheaper in europe than at home that americans who are well supplied do not often carry much with them when they go abroad and this had been a rule with my uncle all his life each of us moreover habitually kept a supply of country attire at the nest which we did not think of removing in consequence of these little domestic circumstances as has been said there was no want of the means of putting my uncle and myself on a level with others of our class as respects outward appearance in that retired part of the country at least  the apartments of my uncle and myself were quite near each other in the north wing of the house or that which looked in the direction of a part of the meadows under the cliff the wooded ravine and the wigwam or cabin of the upright onondago the last was very plainly in view from the window of my dressingroom and i was standing at the latter contemplating the figures of the two old fellows as they sat basking in the sun as was their practice of an afternoon when a tap at the door proved to be the announcement of the entrance of john  well john my good fellow i said laughingly i find a wig makes a great difference with your means of recognizing an old friend i must thank you nevertheless for the good treatment you gave me in my character of a musicgrinder  i am sure mr hugh you are heartily welcome to my services come as you may to ask them it was a most surprisingest deception sir as i shall ever hadmit but i thought the whole time you wasnt exactly what you seemed to be as i told kitty as soon as i went down stairs kitty says i them two pedlers is just the two genteelest pedlers as hever i see in this country and i shouldnt wonder if they had known better days but now you have been to see the hantirenters with your own eyes mr hugh what do you think of them if i may be so bold as to ask the question  very much as i thought before i had been to see them they are a set of fellows who are canting about liberty at the very moment when they are doing all they can to discredit its laws and who mistake selfishness for patriotism just as their backers in the state government are doing by using the same cant when their object is nothing but votes if no tenant had a vote this question would never have been raised or dreamt ofbut i see those two old fellows jaaf and sus seem to enjoy themselves still  indeed they do sir in the most surprisingest manner they was both antiquities as we says in hengland when i came to this country sirand that was before you was born mr hughan age agone but there they sits sir day in and day out looking like monumentals of past times the niggerjohn had been long enough in the country to catch the vernacularthe nigger grows uglier and uglier every year and that is most of a change i can see in him while i do think sir that the indian grows andsomer and andsomer hes the andsomest old gentleman sir as i know of far and near  old gentleman what an expressive term that was in this case no human being would ever think of calling jaaf an old gentleman even in these aristrocratic days when gentlemen are plentier than blackberries while any one might feel disposed thus to describe susquesus the onondago was a gentleman in the best meaning of the word though he may and certainly did want a great deal in the way of mere conventional usages as for john he never would have used the word to me except in a case in which he felt the party had a claim to the appellation  susquesus is a magnificent sight with his gray or white head fiery eyes composed features and impressive air i answered and jaaf is no beauty how do the old men get on together  why sir they quarrel a good dealthat is the nigger quarrels though the indian is too much above him to mind what he says nor will i say that yop actually quarrels sir for he has the greatest possible regard for his friend but he aggravates in the most surprisingest mannerjust like a nigger howsever i do suppose  they have wanted for nothing i trust during my absence their table and other comforts have been seen to carefully i hope  no fear of that sir so long as mrs littlepage lives she has the affection of a child for the old men and has everything provided for them that they can possibly want betty smith siryou remember betty the widow of the old coachman that died when you was at college sirwell betty has done nothing these four years but look after them two old men she keeps everything tidy in their hut and washes it out twice a week and washes their clothes for them and darns and sews and cooks and looks after all their comforts she lives hard by in the other cottage sir and has everything handy  i am glad of that does either of the old men ever stray over as far as the nest house now john before i went abroad we had a visit from each daily  that custom has fallen away a little sir though the nigger comes much the oftenest he is sure to be here once or twice a week in good weather then he walks into the kitchen where he will sit sometimes for a whole morning telling the hardest stories sirha ha hayes sir just the hardest stories one ever heard  why what can he have to say of that nature that it seems to amuse you so  according to his notion sir everything in the country is falling away and is inferior like to what it may have been in his young days the turkeys arnt so large sir and the fowls is poorer sir and the mutton isnt so fat sir and sich sort of enormities  here john laughed very heartily though it was plain enough he did not much fancy the comparisons  and susquesus i said he does not share in his friends criticism  sus never enters the kitchen sir at all he knows that all the quality and upper class come to the great door of the house and is too much of a gentleman to come in at any other entrance no sir i never saw sus in the kitchen or hoffices at all nor does mrs littlepage ave his table set anywhere but in the hupper rooms or on the piazza when she wishes to treat him to anything nice the old gentleman has what he calls his traditions sir and can tell a great many stories of old times but they arnt about turkeys and orses and gardenstuff and such things as yop dwells on so much and so uncomfortably  i now dismissed john after again thanking him for his civilities to one of my late appearance and joined my uncle when we entered the little drawingroom where the whole party was waiting to meet us previously to going to the table a common exclamation of pleasure escaped them all martha again kissed me declaring i was now hugh that i looked as she had expected to see hugh that she would now know me for hugh and many other similar things while my dear grandmother stood and parted my hair and gazed into my face with tears in her eyes for i reminded her of her firstborn who had died so young as for the other ladies the two heiresswards of uncle ro seemed smiling and friendly and willing to renew our ancient amicable relations but mary warren still kept herself in the background though i thought by her modest and halfaverted eye and flushed cheeks that she sympathized as deeply in her friend patts present happiness as any of the others possibly more deeply  before we went to the table i sent a servant to the top of the house with orders to look down the road in order to ascertain when my red friends might be expected this man reported that they were advancing along the highway and would probably reach the door in the course of half an hour they had stopped and he thought that he could perceive by means of his glass that they were painting their faces and otherwise arranging their toilets in preparation for the anticipated interview on receiving this information we took our seats at table expecting to be ready to receive the chiefs as soon as they should arrive  ours was a happy dinner for the moment the condition of the country and the schemes of my tenants were forgotten and we chatted of those nearer interests and feelings that naturally presented themselves to our minds at such a time at length dear grandmother pleasantly remarkedyou must have an instinct for the discovery of discretion hugh for no one could have made a better choice of a confidant than you did while going to the village this morning  mary blushed like an italian sky at eventide and looked down to conceal her confusion  i do not know whether it was discretion or vanity grandmother was my answer for i am conscious of feeling an unconquerable reluctance to passing for a common musicgrinder in miss warrens eyes  nay hugh put in the saucy patt i had told you before that you passed for a very uncommon musicgrinder in her eyes as for the grinding she said but little for it was of the flute and of the manner in which it was played that miss warren spoke the most eloquently  the martha of mary warren lowly but half reproachfully uttered showed that the charming girl was beginning to be really distressed and my observant parent changed the discourse by a gentle and adroit expedient such as a woman alone knows thoroughly how to put in practice it was simply handing mr warren a plate of greengages but the act was so performed as to change the discourse  during the whole of that meal i felt certain there was a secret mysterious communication between me and mary warren which while it probably did escape the notice of others was perfectly evident to ourselves this fact i felt to be true while there was a consciousness betrayed in marys blushes and even in her averted eyes that i found extremely eloquent on the same subject     chapter xix      with look like patient jobs eschewing evil       with motions graceful as a birds in air     thou art in sober truth the veriest devil       that eer clinched fingers in a captives hair                                                   red jacket   although an immense progress has been made in liberating this country from the domination of england in the way of opinion and usages a good deal remains to be done yet still he who can look back forty years must see the great changes that have occurred in very many things and it is to be hoped that he who lives forty years hence will find very few remaining that have no better reasons for their existence among ourselves than the example of a people so remote with a different climate different social organization and different wants i am for no more condemning a usage however simply because it is english than i am for approving it simply because it is english i wish everything to stand on its own merits and feel certain that no nation ever can become great in the higher signification of the term until it ceases to imitate because it is imitation of a certain fixed model one of the very greatest evils of this imitative spirit is even now developing itself in what is called the progress of the country which is assailing principles that are as old as the existence of man and which may almost be said to be eternal as social truths at the very moment that notions derived from our ancestors are submitted to in the highest places the senate of the united states for example that are founded in facts which not only have no existence among ourselves but which are positively antagonistic to such as have so much easier is it to join in the hurrah of a progress than to ascertain whether it is making in the right direction or whether it be progress at all but to return from things of moment to those of less concern  among other customs to be condemned that we have derived from england is the practice of the men sitting at table after the women have left it much as i may wish to see this everyway offensive custom done away with and the more polished and humanizing usage of all the rest of christendom adopted in its stead i should feel ashamed at finding as i make no doubt i should find it that our custom would be abandoned within a twelvemonth after it might be understood it was abandoned in england my uncle had long endeavored to introduce into our own immediate circle the practice of retaining the ladies at table for a reasonable time and of then quitting it with them at the expiration of that time but it is hard to kick against the pricks men who fancy it society to meet at each others houses to drink wine and taste wine and talk about wine and to outdo each other in giving their guests the most costly wines are not to be diverted easily from their objects the harddrinking days are past but the hard talking days are in their vigor if it could be understood generally that even in england it is deemed vulgar to descant on the liquor that is put upon the table perhaps we might get rid of the practice too vulgar in england it is even deemed vulgar here by the right sort as i am ready to maintain and indeed know of my own observation that one or two friends who are participating in the benefits of some particularly benevolent bottle should say a word in commendation of its merits is natural enough and well enough no one can reasonably find any fault with such a sign of grateful feeling but i know of nothing more revolting than to see twenty grave faces arrayed around a table employed as so many tasters at a rhenish wine sale while the cheeks of their host look like those of boreas owing to the process of sucking syphons  when my dear grandmother rose imitated by the four brightfaced girls who did as she set the example and said as was customary with the old school well gentlemen i leave you to your wine but you will recollect that you will be most welcome guests in the drawingroom my uncle caught her hand and insisted she should not quit us there was something exceedingly touching to my eyes in the sort of intercourse and in the affection which existed between my uncle ro and his mother a bachelor himself while she was a widow they were particularly fond of each other and many is the time that i have seen him go up to her when we were alone and pat her cheeks and then kiss them as one might do to a muchbeloved sister my grandmother always received these little liberties with perfect good humor and with evident affection in her turn i have frequently known her to approach roger as she always called him and kiss his bald head in a way that denoted she vividly remembered the time when he was an infant in her arms on this occasion she yielded to his request and resumed her seat the girls imitating her nothing loath as they had done in rising the conversation then naturally enough reverted to the state of the country  it has much surprised me that the men in authority among us have confined all their remarks and statements to the facts of the rensselaer and livingston estates observed my grandmother when there are difficulties existing in so many others  the explanation is very simple my good mother answered uncle ro the rensselaer estates have the quartersales and chickens and days works and there is much of the ad captandum argument about such things that does very well to work up for political effect whereas on the other estates these great auxiliaries must be laid aside it is just as certain as it is that the sun has risen this day that an extensive and concerted plan exists to transfer the freehold rights of the landlords on nearly every property in the state to the tenants and that too on conditions unjustly favorable to the last but you will find nothing of the sort in the messages of governors or speeches of legislators who seem to think all is said when they have dwelt on the expediency of appeasing the complaints of the tenants as a high political duty without stopping to inquire whether those complaints are founded in right or not the injury that will be done to the republic by showing men how much can be effected by clamor is of itself incalculable it would take a generation to do away the evil consequences of the example were the antirent combination to be utterly defeated tomorrow  i find that the general argument against the landlords is a want of title in those cases in which nothing better can be found observed mr warren the lecturer today seemed to condemn any title that was derived from the king as defeated by the conquest over that monarch by the war of the revolution  a most charming consummation that would have been for the heroic deeds of the littlepages there were my father grandfather and greatgrandfather all in arms in that war the two first as general officers and the last as a major and the result of all their hardships and dangers is to be to rob themselves of their own property i am aware that this silly pretence has been urged even in a court of justice but folly and wrong and madness are not yet quite ripe enough among us to carry such a doctrine down as coming events cast their shadows before it is possible we are to take this very movement however as the dawn of the approaching day of american reason and not as a twilight left by the departed rays of a sun of a period of mental darkness  you surely do not apprehend uncle ro that these people can really get hughs lands away from him exclaimed patt reddening with anxiety and anger  no one can say my dear for certainly no one is safe when opinions and acts like those which have been circulated and attempted among us of late years can be acted on without awakening very general indignation look to the moneyed classes at this very moment agonized and excited on the subject of a war about oregona thing very little likely to occur though certainly possible while they manifest the utmost indifference to this antirentism though the positive existence of everything connected with just social organization is directly involved in its fate one is a bare possibility but it convulses the class i have named while the other is connected with the existence of civilized society itself yet it has ceased to attract attention and is nearly forgotten every man in the community whose means raise him at all above the common level has a direct interest in facing this danger and in endeavoring to put it down but scarcely any one appears to be conscious of the importance of the crisis we have only one or two more steps to make in order to become like turkey a country in which the wealthy are obliged to conceal their means in order to protect it from the grasp of the government but no one seems to care at all about it  some recent travellers among us have said that we have nearly reached that pass already as our rich affect great simplicity and plainness in public while they fill their houses in private with all the usual evidences of wealth and luxury i think de tocqueville among others makes that remark  ay that is merely one of the ordinarily sagacious remarks of the europeans who by not understanding the american history confound causes and make mistakes the plainness of things in public is no more than an ancient habit of the country while the elegance and luxury in private are a very simple and natural consequence of the tastes of women who live in a state of society in which they are limited to the very minimum of refined habits and intellectual pleasures the writer who made this mistake is a very clever man and has exceeding merit considering his means of ascertaining truth but he has made very many similar blunders  nevertheless mr littlepage resumed the rector who was a gentleman in all the senses of the word and knew the world and the best part of it too even while he had preserved an admirable simplicity of character changes have certainly taken place among us of the nature alluded to by m de tocqueville  that is quite true sir but they have also taken place elsewhere when i was a boy i can well remember to have seen coachesandsix in this country and almost every man of fortune drove his coachandfour whereas now such a thing is of the rarest occurrence possible but the same is true all over christendom for when i first went to europe coachesandsix with outriders and all that sort of state was an everyday thing whereas it is now never or at least very seldom seen improved roads steamboats and railroads can produce such changes without having recourse to the oppression of the masses  i am sure put in patt laughing if publicity be what mons de tocqueville requires there is publicity enough in new york all the newfashioned houses are so constructed with their low balconies and lower windows that anybody can see in at their windows if what i have read and heard of a paris house be true standing between cour et jardin there is infinitely more of privacy there than here and one might just as well say that the parisians bury themselves behind porte cochères and among trees to escape the attacks of the faubourg st antoine as to say we retreat into our houses to be fine lest the mobocracy would not tolerate us  the girl has profited by your letters i see hugh said my uncle nodding his head in approbation and what is more she makes a suitable application of her tuition or rather of yours no no all that is a mistake and as martha says no houses are so much in the street as those of the new style in our own towns it would be far more just to say that instead of retiring within doors to be fine as patt calls it unseen by envious neighbors the manhattanese in particular turn their dwellings wrong side out lest their neighbors should take offence at not being permitted to see all that is going on within but neither is true the house is the more showy because it is most under womans control and it would be just as near the truth to say that the reason why the american men appear abroad in plain blue and black and brown clothes while their wives and daughters are at home in silks and satinsay even in modern brocadesis an apprehension of the masses as to ascribe the plainness of street life compared to that within doors to the same cause there is a good deal of difference between a salon in the faubourg or the chaussée dantin and even on the boulevard des italiens but john is craning with his neck out there on the piazza as if our red brethren were at hand  so it was in point of fact and everybody now rose from table without ceremony and went forth to meet our guests we had barely time to reach the lawn the ladies having run for their hats in the meantime before prairiefire flintyheart manytongues and all the rest of them came up on the sort of halftrot that distinguishes an indians march  notwithstanding the change in our dresses my uncle and myself were instantly recognized and courteously saluted by the principal chiefs then our wigs were gravely offered to us by two of the younger men but we declined receiving them begging the gentlemen who had them in keeping to do us the honor to accept them as tokens of our particular regard this was done with great goodwill and with a pleasure that was much too obvious to be concealed half an hour later i observed that each of the young forest dandies had a wig on his otherwise naked head with a peacocks feather stuck quite knowingly in the lank hair the effect was somewhat ludicrous particularly on the young ladies but i saw that each of the warriors himself looked round as if to ask for the admiration that he felt his appearance ought to awaken  no sooner were the salutations exchanged than the redmen began to examine the housethe cliff on which it stoodthe meadows beneath and the surrounding ground at first we supposed that they were struck with the extent and solidity of the buildings together with a certain air of finish and neatness that is not everywhere seen in america even in the vicinity of its betterclass houses but manytongues soon undeceived us my uncle asked him why all the redmen had broken off and scattered themselves around the buildings some looking here others pointing there and all manifestly earnest and much engaged with something though it was not easy to understand what that something was intimating his supposition that they might be struck with the buildings  lord bless ye no sir answered the interpreter they dont care a straw about the house or any house theres flintyheart in particular hes a chief that you can no more move with riches and large housen and sichlike matters than you can make the mississippi run up stream when we went to uncle sams house at washington he scarce condescended to look at it and the capital had no more effect on any on em than if it had been a better sort of wigwam not so much for that matter as injins be curious in wigwams whats put em up on a trail like just now is the knowledge that this is the spot where a battle was fit something like ninety seasons ago in which the upright onondago was consarned as well as some of their own people on tother sidethats whats put em in commotion  and why does flintyheart talk to those around him with so much energy and point to the flats and the cliff and the ravine yonder that lies beyond the wigwam of susquesus  ah is that then the wigwam of the upright onondago exclaimed the interpreter betraying some such interest as one might manifest on unexpectedly being told that he saw mount vernon or monticello for the first time in his life well its something to have seen that though it will be more to see the man himself for all the tribes on the upper prairies are full of his story and his behavior no injin since the time of tamenund himself has made as much talk of late years as susquesus the upright onondago unless it might be tecumthe perhaps but what occupies flintyheart just at this moment is an account of the battle in which his fathers grandfather lost his life though he did not lose his scalp that disgrace he is now telling on em he escaped and glad enough is his descendant that it was so its no great matter to an injin to be killed but hed rather escape losing his scalp or being struck at all by the inimy if it can possibly made to turn out so now hes talking of some young paleface that was killed whom he calls lover of funand now hes got on some nigger who he says fit like a devil  all these persons are known to us by our traditions also exclaimed my uncle with more interest than i had known him to manifest for many a day but im amazed to find that the indians retain so accurate an account of such small matters for so long a time  it isnt a small matter to them their battles is seldom on a very great scale and they make great account of any skrimmage in which noted warriors have fallen here manytongues paused for a minute and listened attentively to the discourse of the chiefs after which he resumed his explanations they have met with a great difficulty in the house he continued while everything else is right they understand the cliff of rocks the position of the buildings themselves that ravine thereaway and all the rest of the things hereabouts except the house  what may be the difficulty with the house does it not stand in the place it ought to occupy  thats just their difficulty it does stand where it ought to stand but it isnt the right sort of house though they say the shape agrees well enoughone side out to the fields like two sides running back to the cliff and the cliff itself for the other but their traditions say that their warriors indivord to burn out your forefathers and that they built a fire agin the side of the buildin which they never would have done had it been built of stone as this house is built thats what particlarly puzzles them  then their traditions are surprisingly minute and accurate the house which then stood on or near this spot and which did resemble the present building in the ground plan was of squared logs and might have been set on fire and an attempt was actually made to do so but was successfully resisted your chiefs have had a true account but changes have been made here the house of logs stood near fifty years when it was replaced by this dwelling which was originally erected about sixty years ago and has been added to since on the old design no nothe traditions are surprisingly accurate  this gave the indians great satisfaction as soon as the fact was communicated to them and from that instant all their doubts and uncertainty were ended their own knowledge of the progress of things in a settlement gave them the means of comprehending any other changes though the shape of this building having so nearly corresponded with that of which their traditions spoke they had become embarrassed by the difference in the material while they were still continuing their examinations and ascertaining localities to their own satisfaction my uncle and myself continued the discourse with manytongues  i am curious to know said my uncle what may be the history of susquesus that a party of chiefs like these should travel so far out of their way to pay him the homage of a visit is his great age the cause  that is one reason sartainly though there is another that is of more account but which is known only to themselves i have often tried to get the history out of them but never could succeed as long as i can remember the onondagoes and tuscaroras and the injins of the old new york tribes that have found their way up to the prairies have talked of the upright onondago who must have been an old man when i was born of late years they have talked more and more of him and so good an opportunity offering to come and see him there would have been great disappointment out west had it been neglected his age is no doubt one principal cause but there is another though i have never been able to discover what it is  this indian has been in communication and connected with my immediate family now near if not quite ninety years he was with my grandfather cornelius littlepage in the attack on ty that was made by abercrombie in 1758 and here we are within twelve or thirteen years of a century from that event i believe my greatgrandfather herman mordaunt had even some previous knowledge of him as long as i can remember he has been a grayheaded old man and we suppose both he and the negro who lives with him to have seen fully a hundred and twenty years if not more  something of importance happened to susquesus or the trackless as he was then called about ninetythree winters ago that much ive gathered from what has fallen from the chiefs at different times but what that something was it has exceeded my means to discover at any rate it has quite as much to do with this visit as the withered hemlocks great age injins respect years and they respect wisdom highly but they respect courage and justice most of all the tarm upright has its meaning depend ont  we were greatly interested by all this as indeed were my grandmother and her sweet companions mary warren in particular manifested a lively interest in susquesuss history as was betrayed in a brief dialogue i now had with her walking to and fro in front of the piazza while the rest of the party were curiously watching the movements of the still excited savages  my father and i have often visited the two old men and have been deeply interested in them observed this intelligent yet simpleminded girlwith the indian in particular we have felt a strong sympathy for nothing is plainer than the keenness with which he still feels on the subject of his own people we have been told that he is often visited by redmenor at least as often as any come near him and they are said ever to exhibit a great reverence for his years and respect for his character  this i know to be true for i have frequently seen those who have come to pay him visits but they have usually been merely your basketmaking halfandhalf sort of savages who have possessed the characteristics of neither race entirely this is the first instance in which i have heard of so marked a demonstration of respecthow is that dear grandmother can you recall any other instance of susquesuss receiving such a decided mark of homage from his own people as this  this is the third within my recollection hugh shortly after my marriage which was not long after the revolution as you may know there was a party here on a visit to susquesus it remained ten days the chiefs it contained were said to be onondagoes altogether or warriors of his own particular people and something like a misunderstanding was reported to have been made up though what it was i confess i was too thoughtless then to inquire both my fatherinlaw and my uncle chainbearer it was always believed knew the whole of the tracklesss story though neither ever related it to me i do not believe your grandfather knew it added the venerable speaker with a sort of tender regret or i think i should have heard it but that first visit was soon after susquesus and jaaf took possession of their house and it was reported at the time that the strangers remained so long in the hope of inducing sus to rejoin his tribe if such was their wish however it failed for there he is now and there he has ever been since he first went to the hut  and the second visit grandmotheryou mentioned that there were three  oh tell us of them all mrs littlepage added mary earnestly blushing up to the eyes the moment after at her own eagerness my dear grandmother smiled benevolently on both and i thought she looked a little archly at us as old ladies sometimes will when the images of their own youth recur to their minds  you appear to have a common sympathy in these redmen my children she answered mary fairly blushing scarlet at hearing herself thus coupled with me in the term childrenand i have great pleasure in gratifying your curiosity the second great visit that susquesus received from indians occurred the very year you were born hugh and then we really felt afraid we might lose the old man so earnest were his own people in their entreaties that he would go away with them but he would not here he has remained ever since and a few weeks ago he told me that here he should die if these indians hope to prevail any better i am sure they will be disappointed  so he told my father also added mary warren who has often spoken to him of death and has hoped to open his eyes to the truths of the gospel  with what success miss warren that is a consummation which would terminate the old mans career most worthily  with little i fear answered the charming girl in a low melancholy tone at least i know that my father has been disappointed sus listens to him attentively but he manifests no feeling beyond respect for the speaker attempts have been made to induce him to enter the church before but  you were about to add something miss warren which still remains to be said  i can add it for her resumed my grandmother for certain i am that mary warren will never add it herself the fact is as you must know hugh from your own observation that mr warrens predecessor was an unfaithful and selfish servant of the churchone who did little good to any not even himself in this country it takes a good deal in a clergyman to wear out the patience of a people but it can be done and when they once get to look at him through the same medium as that with which other men are viewed a reaction follows under which he is certain to suffer we could all wish to throw a veil over the conduct of the late incumbent of st andrews but it requires one so much thicker and larger than common that the task is not easy mary has merely meant that better instruction and a closer attention to duty might have done more for trackless twenty years ago than they can do today  how much injury after all faithless ministers can do to the church of god one such bad example unsettles more minds than twenty good examples keep steady  i do not know that hugh but of one thing i am certainthat more evil is done by pretending to struggle for the honor of the church by attempting to sustain its unworthy ministers than could be done by at once admitting their offences in cases that are clear we all know that the ministers of the altar are but men and as such are to be expected to fallcertain to do so without divine aidbut if we cannot make its ministers pure we ought to do all we can to keep the altar itself from contamination  yes yes grandmotherbut the day has gone by for ex officio religion in the american branch of the churchhere mary warren joined the other girlsat least and it is so best suspicions may be base and unworthy but a blind credulity is contemptible if i see a chestnut forming on yonder branch it would be an act of exceeding folly in me to suppose that the tree was a walnut though all the nurserymen in the country were ready to swear to it  my grandmother smiled but she also walked away when i joined my uncle again  the interpreter tells me hugh said the last that the chiefs wish to pay their first visit to the hut this evening luckily the old farmhouse is empty just now since miller has taken possession of the new one and i have directed mr manytongues to establish himself there while he and his party remain here there is a kitchen all ready for their use and it is only to send over a few cooking utensils that is to say a pot or two and fifty bundles of straw to set them up in housekeeping for all this i have just given orders not wishing to disturb you or possibly unwilling to lay down a guardians authority and there is the straw already loading up in yonder barnyard in half an hour they may rank themselves among the potwallopers of ravensnest  shall we go with them to the house before or after they have paid their visit to susquesus  before certainly john has volunteered to go over and let the onondago know the honor that is intended him and to assist him in making his toilet for the redman would not like to be taken in undress any more than another while this is doing we can install our guests in their new abode and see the preparations commenced for their supper as for the injins there is little to apprehend from them i fancy so long as we have a strong party of the real simon pures within call  after this we invited the interpreter to lead his chiefs toward the dwelling they were to occupy preceding the party ourselves and leaving the ladies on the lawn at that season the days were at the longest and it would be pleasanter to pay the visit to the hut in the cool of the evening than to go at an earlier hour my grandmother ordered her covered wagon before we left her intending to be present at an interview which everybody felt must be most interesting  the empty building which was thus appropriated to the use of the indians was quite a century old having been erected by my ancestor herman mordaunt as the original farmhouse on his own particular farm for a long time it had been used in its original character and when it was found convenient to erect another in a more eligible spot and of more convenient form this old structure had been preserved as a relic and from year to year its removal had been talked of but not effected it remained therefore for me to decide on its fate unless indeed the spirit of the institutions should happen to get hold of it and take its control out of my hands along with that of the rest of my property by way of demonstrating to mankind how thoroughly the great state of new york is imbued with a love of rational liberty  as we walked toward the old farmhouse miller came from the other building to meet us he had learned that his friends the pedlers were hiswhat i shall call myself master would be the legal term and it would be good english but it would give the honorable gentleman and his friends mortal offence and i am not now to learn that there are those among us who deny facts that are as plain as the noses on their faces and who fly right into the face of the law whenever it is convenient i shall not however call myself a boss to please even these eminent statesmen and therefore must be content with using a term that if the moving spirits of the day can prevail will soon be sufficiently close in its signification and call myself tom millersnothing  it was enough to see that miller was a good deal embarrassed with the dilemma in which he was placed for a great many years he and his family had been in the employment of me and mine receiving ample pay as all such men ever dowhen they are so unfortunate as to serve a malignant aristocratmuch higher pay than they would get in the service of your newcomes your holmeses and tubbses besides far better treatment in all essentials and now he had only to carry out the principles of the antirenters to claim the farm he and they had so long worked as of right yes the same principles would just as soon give this hireling my home and farm as it would give any tenant on my estate that which he worked it is true one party received wages while the other paid rent but these facts do not affect the principle at all since he who received the wages got no other benefit from his toil while he who paid the rent was master of all the cropsi beg pardon the boss of all the crops the common title of bothif any title at all existis the circumstance that each had expended his labor on a particular farm and consequently had a right to own it for all future time  miller made some awkward apologies for not recognizing me and endeavored to explain away one or two little things that he must have felt put him in rather an awkward position but to which neither my uncle nor myself attached any moment we knew that poor tom was human and that the easiest of all transgressions for a man to fall into were those connected with his selflove and that the temptation to a man who has the consciousness of not being anywhere near the summit of the social ladder is a strong inducement to err when he thinks there is a chance of getting up a round or two failing of success in which it requires higher feelings and perhaps a higher station than that of tom millers not to leave him open to a certain demoniacal gratification which so many experience at the prospect of beholding others dragged down to their own level we heard toms excuses kindly but did not commit ourselves by promises or declarations of any sort     chapter xx      two hundred years two hundred years       how much of human power and pride     what glorious hopes what gloomy fears       have sunk beneath their noiseless tidepierpont   it wanted about an hour to sunsetor sundown to use our common americanismwhen we all left the new quarters of our red brethren in order to visit the huts as the moment approached it was easy to trace in the indians the evidence of strong interest mingled as we fancied with a little awe several of the chiefs had improved the intervening time to retouch the wild conceits that they had previously painted on their visages rendering their countenances still more appalling flintyheart in particular was conspicuous in his grim embellishments though prairiefire had not laid any veil between the eye and his natural hue  as the course of my narrative will now render it necessary to relate conversations that occurred in languages and dialects of which i know literally nothing it may be well to say here once for all that i got as close a translation of everything that passed as it was possible to obtain from manytongues and wrote it all down either on the spot or immediately after returning to the nest this explanation may be necessary in order to prevent some of those who may read this manuscript from fancying that i am inventing  the carriage of my grandmother had left the door filled with its smiling freight several minutes before we took up our line of march this last however was not done without a little ceremony and some attention to order as indians rarely march except in what is called indian file or singly each man following in the footsteps of his leader such was the mode of advancing adopted on the present occasion the prairiefire led the line as the oldest chief and the one most distinguished in council flintyheart was second while the others were arranged by some rule of precedency that was known to themselves as soon as the line had formed it commenced its march my uncle the interpreter and myself walking at the side of prairiefire while miller followed by halfadozen of the curious from the nest house and the farm followed in the rear  it will be remembered that john had been sent to the hut to announce the intended visit his stay had been much longer than was anticipated but when the procession had gone about half the distance it was to march it was met by this faithful domestic on his return the worthy fellow wheeled into line on my flank and communicated what he had to say while keeping up with the column  to own the truth mr hugh he said the old man was more moved by hearing that about fifty indians had come a long distance to see him  seventeenyou should have said seventeen john that being the exact number  is it sir well i declared that i thought there might be fiftyi once thought of calling em forty sir but it then occurred to me that it might not be enough all this time john was looking over his shoulder to count the gravelooking warriors who followed in a line and satisfied of his mistake one of the commonest in the world for men of his class that of exaggeration he resumed his report well sir i do believe you are right and i have been a little hout but old sus was quite moved sir when i told him of the intended visit and so i stayed to help the old gentleman to dress and paint for that nigger yop is of no more use now you know sir than if he had never lived in a gentlemans family at all it must have been hawful times sir when the gentry of york had nothing but niggers to serve em sir  we did pretty well john notwithstanding answered my uncle who had a strong attachment to the old black race that once so generally filled all the menial stations of the country as is apt to be the case with all gentlemen of fifty we did pretty well notwithstanding jaaf however never acted strictly as a bodyservant though he was my grandfathers own man  well sir if there had been nobody but yop at the hut sus would never have been decently dressed and painted for this occasion as it is i hope that you will be satisfied sir for the old gentleman looks remarkably wellindian fashion you know sir  did the onondago ask any questions  why you know how it is with him in that particular mr hugh hes a very silent person is susquesus most remarkable so when he as any one has can entertain him with conversation i talked most of the time myself sir has i commonly does when i pays him a visit indians is remarkably silent in general i believe sir  and whose idea was it to paint and dressyours or the onondagos  why sir i supposes the hidear to be indian by origin though in this case it was my suggestion yes sir i suggested the thought though i will not take it on myself to say sus had not some hinclination that way even before i inted my hopinion  did you think of the paint put in uncle ro i do not remember to have seen the trackless in his paint these thirty years i once asked him to paint and dress on a fourth of july it was about the time you were born hughand i remember the old fellows answer as well as if it were given yesterday when the tree ceases to bear fruit was the substance of his reply blossoms only remind the observer of its uselessness  i have heard that susquesus was once considered very eloquent even for an indian  i remember him to have had some such reputation though i will not answer for its justice occasionally i have heard strong expressions in his brief clipping manner of speaking englishbut in common he has been content to be simple and taciturn i remember to have heard my father say that when he first made the acquaintance of susquesus and that must have been quite sixty years since the old man had great apprehension of being reduced to mortifying necessity of making baskets and brooms but his dread on that subject once removed he had ever after seemed satisfied and without care  without care is the condition of those who have least i believe sir it would not be an easy matter for the government of new york to devise ways and means to deprive sus of his farms either by instituting suits for title destroying quartersales laying taxes or resorting to any other of the ingenious expedients known to the albany politics  my uncle did not answer for quite a minute when he did it was thoughtfully and with great deliberation of manner  your term of albany politics has recalled to my mind he said a consideration that has often forced itself upon my reflections there is doubtless an advantagenay there may be a necessity for cutting up the local affairs of this country by intrusting their management to so many local governments but there is out of all question one great evil consequent on it when legislators have the great affairs of state on their hands the making of war and peace the maintaining of armies and the control of all those interests which connect one country with another the mind gets to be enlarged and with it the character and disposition of the man but bring men together who must act or appear incapable of acting and set them at work upon the smaller concerns of legislation and its ten to one but they betray the narrowness of their education by the narrowness of their views this is the reason of the vast difference that every intelligent man knows to exist between albany and washington  do you then think our legislators so much inferior to those of europe  only as they are provincial which nine in ten necessarily are since nine americans in ten even among the educated classes are decidedly provincial this term provincial covers quite onehalf of the distinctive sins of the country though many laugh at a deficiency of which in the nature of things they can have no notion as purely a matter of the imagination the active communications of the americans certainly render them surprisingly little obnoxious to such a charge for their age and geographical position these last disadvantages produce effects nevertheless that are perhaps unavoidable when you have had an opportunity of seeing something of the society of the towns for instance after your intercourse with the world of europe you will understand what i mean for it is a difference much more readily felt than described provincialism however may be defined as a general tendency to the narrow views which mark a contracted association and an ignorance of the great worldnot in the sense of station solely but in the sense of liberality intelligence and a knowledge of all the varied interests of life but here we are at the hut  there we were sure enough the evening was delightful susquesus had seated himself on a stool on the green sward that extended for some distance around the door of his habitation and where he was a little in shade protected from the strong rays of a setting but june sun a tree cast its shadow over his person jaaf was posted on one side as no doubt he himself thought best became his color and character it is another trait of human nature that while the negro affects a great contempt and aversion for the redman the indian feels his own mental superiority to the domestic slave i had never seen susquesus in so grand costume as that in which he appeared this evening habitually he wore his indian vestments the leggings moccason breechpiece blanket or calico shirt according to the season but i had never before seen him in his ornaments and paint the first consisted of two medals which bore the images the one of george iii the other of his grandfatherof two more bestowed by the agents of the republic of large rings in his ears that dropped nearly to his shoulders and of bracelets formed of the teeth of some animal that at first i was afraid was a man a tomahawk that was kept as bright as friction could make it and a sheathed knife were in his girdle while his welltried rifle stood leaning against a tree weapons that were now exhibited as emblems of the past since their owner could scarcely render either very effective the old man had used the paint with unusual judgment for an indian merely tingeing his cheeks with a color that served to give brightness to eyes that had once been keen as intense expression could render them but which were now somewhat dimmed by age in other respects nothing was changed in the customary neat simplicity that reigned in and around the cabin though jaaf had brought out as if to sun an old livery coat of his own that he had formerly worn and a cocked hat in which i have been told he was wont actually to exhibit himself of sundays and holidays reminders of the superiority of a nigger over an injin  three or four rude benches which belonged to the establishment of the hut were placed at a short distance in front of susquesus in a sort of semicircle for the reception of his guests toward these benches then prairiefire led the way followed by all the chiefs although they soon ranged themselves in the circle not one took his seat for fully a minute that time they all stood gazing intently but reverently toward the aged man before them who returned their look as steadily and intently as it was given then at a signal from their leader who on this occasion was prairiefire every man seated himself this change of position however did not cause the silence to be broken but there they all sat for quite ten minutes gazing at the upright onondago who in his turn kept his look steadily fastened on his visitors it was during this interval of silence that the carriage of my grandmother drove up and stopped just without the circle of grave attentive indians not one of whom even turned his head to ascertain who or what caused the interruption no one spoke my dear grandmother being a profoundly attentive observer of the scene while all the bright faces around her were so many eloquent pictures of curiosity blended with some gentler and better feelings exhibited in the most pleasing form of which humanity is susceptible  at length susquesus himself arose which he did with great dignity of manner and without any visible bodily effort and spoke his voice was a little tremulous i thought though more through feeling than age but on the whole he was calm and surprisingly connected and clear considering his great age of course i was indebted to manytongues for the interpretation of all that passed  brethren commenced susquesus you are welcome you have travelled on a long and crooked and thorny path to find an old chief whose tribe ought ninety summers ago to have looked upon him as among the departed i am sorry no better sight will meet your eyes at the end of so long a journey i would make the path back toward the setting sun broader and straighter if i knew how but i do not know how i am old the pine in the woods is scarce older the villages of the palefaces through so many of which you have journeyed are not half so old i was born when the white race were like the moose on the hills here and there one now they are like the pigeons after they have hatched their young when i was a boy my young legs could never run out of the woods into a clearing now my old legs cannot carry me into the woods they are so far off everything is changed in the land but the redmans heart that is like the rock which never alters my children you are welcome  that speech pronounced in the deep husky tones of extreme old age yet relieved by the fire of a spirit that was smothered rather than extinct produced a profound impression a low murmur of admiration passed among the guests though neither rose to answer until a sufficient time had seemed to pass in which the wisdom that they had just been listeners to might make its proper impression when this pause was thought to be sufficiently long to have produced its effect prairiefire a chief more celebrated in council even than in the field arose to answer his speech freely translated was in the following words  father your words are always wisethey are always true the path between your wigwam and our village is a long oneit is a crooked path and many thorns and stones have been found on it but all difficulties may be overcome two moons ago we were at one end of it now we are at the other end we have come with two notches on our sticks one notch told us to go to the great council house of the paleface to see our great paleface fatherthe other notch told us to come here to see our great red father we have been to the great council house of the palefaces we have seen uncle sam his arm is very long it reaches from the salt lake the water of which we tried to drink but it is too salt to our own lakes near the setting sun of which the water is sweet we never tasted water that was salt before and we do not find it pleasant we shall never taste it again it is not worth while to come so far to drink water that is salt  uncle sam is a wise chief he has many counsellors the council at his councilfire must be a great councilit has much to say its words ought to have some good in them they are so many we thought of our red father while listening to them and wanted to come here we have come here we are glad to find our red father still alive and well the great spirit loves a just indian and takes care of him a hundred winters in his eyes are like a single winter we are thankful to him for having led us by the crooked and long path at the end of which we have found the tracklessthe upright of the onondagoes i have spoken  a gleam of happiness shot into the swarthy lineaments of susquesus as he heard in his own language a wellmerited appellation that had not greeted his ears for a period as long as the ordinary life of man it was a title a cognomen that told the story of his connection with his tribe and neither years nor distance nor new scenes nor new ties nor wars nor strifes had caused him to forget the smallest incident connected with that tale i gazed at the old man with awe as his countenance became illuminated by the flood of recollections that was rushing into it through the channel of his memory and the expressive glance my uncle threw at me said how much he was impressed also one of the faculties of manytongues was to be able to interpret pari passu with the speaker and standing between us and the carriage he kept up sentence by sentence a low accompaniment of each speech so that none of us lost a syllable of what was said  as soon as prairiefire resumed his seat another silence succeeded it lasted several minutes during which the only audible sounds were various discontented grunts accompanied by suppressed mutterings on the part of old jaaf who never could tolerate any indian but his companion that the negro was dissatisfied with this extraordinary visit was sufficiently apparent to us but not one of all the redmen took heed of his deportment sus who was nearest to him must have heard his low grumbling but it did not induce him to change his look from the countenances of those in his front for a single moment on the other hand the visitors themselves seemed totally unconscious of the negros presence though in fact they were not as subsequently appeared in a word the upright onondago was the centre of attraction for them all other things being apparently forgotten for the time  at length there was a slight movement among the redskins and another arose this man was positively the least welllooking of the whole party his stature was lower than that of the rest of the indians his form was meagre and ungracefulthe last at least while his mind was in a state of rest and his appearance generally was wanting in that nobleness of exterior which so singularly marked that of every one of his companions as i afterward learned the name of this indian was eaglesflight being so called from the soaring character of the eloquence in which he had been known to indulge on the present occasion though his manner was serious and his countenance interested the spirit within was not heaving with any of its extraordinary throes still such a man could not rise to speak and avoid creating some slight sensation among his expectant auditors guarded as are the redmen in general on the subject of betraying their emotions we could detect something like a suppressed movement among his friends when eaglesflight stood erect the orator commenced in a low but solemn manner his tones changing from the deep impressive guttural to the gentle and pathetic in a way to constitute eloquence of itself as i listened i fancied that never before did the human voice seem to possess so much winning power the utterance was slow and impressive as is usually the case with true orators  the great spirit makes men differently commenced eaglesflight some are like willows that bend with the breeze and are broken in the storm some are pines with slender trunks few branches and a soft wood now and then there is an oak among them which grows on the prairie stretching its branches a great way and making a pleasant shade this wood is hard it lasts a long time why has the great spirit made this difference in treeswhy does the great spirit make this difference in men there is a reason for it he knows it though we may not what he does is always right  i have heard orators at our councilfires complain that things should be as they are they say that the land and the lakes and the rivers and the huntinggrounds belong to the redman only and that no other color ought ever to be seen there the great spirit has thought otherwise and what he thinks happens men are of many colors some are red which is the color of my father some are pale which is the color of my friends some are black which is the color of my fathers friend he is black though old age is changing his skin all this is right it comes from the great spirit and we must not complain  my father says he is very oldthat the pine in the woods is scarce older we know it that is one reason why we have come so far to see him though there is another reason my father knows what that other reason is so do we for a hundred winters and summers that reason has not gone out of our minds the old men have told it to the young men and the young men when they have grown older have told it to their sons in this way it has reached our ears how may bad indians have lived in that time have died and are forgotten it is the good indian that lives longest in our memories we wish to forget that the wicked ever were in our tribes we never forget the good  i have seen many changes i am but a child compared with my father but i feel the cold of sixty winters in my bones during all that time the redmen have been travelling toward the setting sun i sometimes think i shall live to reach it it must be a great way off but the man who never stops goes far let us go there palefaces will follow why all this is i do not know my father is wiser than his son and he may be able to tell us i sit down to hear his answer  although eaglesflight had spoken so quietly and concluded in a manner so different from what i had expected there was a deep interest in what was now going on the particular reason why these redmen had come so far out of their way to visit susquesus had not yet been revealed as we all hoped would be the case but the profound reverence that these strangers from the wilds of the far west manifested for our aged friend gave every assurance that when we did learn it there would be no reason for disappointment as usual a pause succeeded the brief address of the last speaker after which susquesus once more arose and spoke  my children he said i am very old fifty autumns ago when the leaves fell i thought it was time for me to pass on to the happy huntinggrounds of my people and be a redskin again but my name was not called i have been left alone here in the midst of the paleface fields and houses and villages without a single being of my own color and race to speak to my head was almost grown white still as years came on my head the spirit turned more toward my youth i began to forget the battles and hunts and journeys of middle life and to think of the things seen when a young chief among the onondagoes my day is now a dream in which i dream of the past why is the eye of susquesus so farseeing after a hundred winters and more can any one tell i think not we do not understand the great spirit and we do not understand his doings here i am where i have been for half my days that big wigwam is the wigwam of my best friends though their faces are pale and mine is red our hearts have the same color i never forget themno not one of them i see them all from the oldest to the youngest they seem to be of my blood this comes from friendship and many kindnesses these are all the palefaces i now see redmen stand before my eyes in all other places my mind is with them  my children you are young seventy winters are a great many for one of you it is not so with me why i have been left standing alone here near the huntinggrounds of our fathers is more than i can say so it is and it is right a withered hemlock is sometimes seen standing by itself in the fields of the palefaces i am such a tree it is not cut down because the wood is of no use and even the squaws do not like it to cook by when the winds blow they seem to blow around it it is tired of standing there alone but it cannot fall that tree wishes for the axe but no man puts the axe to its root its time has not come so it is with memy time has not come  children my days now are dreams of my tribe i see the wigwam of my father it was the best in the village he was a chief and venison was never scarce in his lodge i see him come off the warpath with many scalps on his pole he had plenty of wampum and wore many medals the scalps on his pole were sometimes from redmen sometimes from palefaces he took them all himself i see my mother too she loved me as the shebear loves her cubs i had brothers and sisters and i see them too they laugh and play and seem happy there is the spring where we dipped up water in our gourds and here is the hill where we lay waiting for the warriors to come in from the warpaths and the hunt everything looks pleasant to me that was a village of the onondagoes my own people and i loved them a hundred and twenty winters ago i love them now as if the time were but one winter and one summer the mind does not feel time for fifty seasons i thought but little of my own people my thoughts were on the hunt and the warpath and on the quarrels of the palefaces with whom i lived now i say again i think most of the past and of my young days it is a great mystery why we can see things that are so far off so plainly and cannot see things that are so near by still it is so  children you ask why the redmen keep moving toward the setting sun and why the palefaces follow you ask if the place where the sun sets will ever be reached and if palemen will go there to plough and to build and to cut down the trees he that has seen what has happened ought to know what will happen again i am very old but i see nothing new one day is like another the same fruits come each summer and the winters are alike the bird builds in the same tree many times  my children i have lived long among the palefaces still my heart is of the same color as my face i have never forgotten that i am a redman never forgotten the onondagoes when i was young beautiful woods covered these fields far and near the buck and the moose leaped among the trees nothing but the hunter stopped them it is all changed the plough has frightened away the deer the moose will not stay near the sound of the churchbell he does not know what it means the deer goes first the redman keeps on his trail and the paleface is never far behind so it has been since the big canoes of the stranger first came into our waters so it will be until another salt lake is reached beneath the setting sun when that other lake is seen the redman must stop and die in the open fields where rum and tobacco and bread are plenty or march on into the great salt lake of the west and be drowned why this is so i cannot tell that it has been so i know that it will be so i believe there is a reason for it none can tell what that reason is but the great spirit  susquesus had spoken calmly and clearly and manytongues translated as he proceeded sentence by sentence so profound was the attention of the savage listeners that i heard their suppressed breathings we white men are so occupied with ourselves and our own passing concerns look on all other races of human beings as so much our inferiors that it is seldom we have time or inclination to reflect on the consequences of our own acts like the wheel that rolls along the highway however many is the inferior creature that we heedlessly crush in our path thus has it been with the redman and as the trackless had said thus will it continue to be he will be driven to the salt lake of the far west where he must plunge in and be drowned or turn and die in the midst of abundance  my uncle ro knew more of the indians and of their habits than any one else of our party unless it might be my grandmother she indeed had seen a good deal of them in early life and when quite a young girl dwelling with that uncle of her own who went by the sobriquet of the chainbearer she had even dwelt in the woods near the tribe of susquesus and had often heard him named there as an indian in high repute although he was even at that distant day an exile from his people when our old friend resumed his seat she beckoned her son and myself to the side of the carriage and spoke to us on the subject of what had just been been uttered the translation of manytongues having been loud enough to let the whole party hear what he said  this is not a visit of business but one of ceremony only she said tomorrow probably the real object of the strangers will be made known all that has passed as yet has been complimentary mixed with a little desire to hear the wisdom of the sage the redman is never in a hurry impatience being a failing that he is apt to impute to us women well though we are females we can wait in the meantime some of us can weep as you see is particularly the case with miss mary warren  this was true enough the fine eyes of all four of the girls glistening with tears while the cheeks of the person named were quite wet with those that had streamed down them at this allusion to such an excess of sympathy the young lady dried her eyes and the color heightened so much in her face that i thought it best to avert my looks while this byplay was going on prairiefire arose again and concluded the proceedings of that preliminary visit by making another short speech  father he said we thank you what we have heard will not be forgotten all redmen are afraid of that great salt lake under the setting sun and in which some say it dips every night what you have told us will make us think more of it we have come a great distance and are tired we will now go to our wigwam and eat and sleep tomorrow when the sun is up here pointing to a part of the heavens that would indicate something like nine oclock we will come again and open our ears the great spirit who has spared you so long will spare you until then and we shall not forget to come it is too pleasant to us to be near you for us to forget farewell  the indians now rose in a body and stood regarding susquesus fully a minute in profound silence when they filed off at a quick pace and followed their leader toward their quarters for the night as the train noiselessly wound its way from before him a shade passed athwart the dark countenance of the trackless and he smiled no more that day  all this time the negro the contemporary of the indian kept muttering his discontent at seeing so many redskins in his presence unheeded and indeed unheard by his friend  what you do wid dem injin he growled as the party disappeared no good ebber come of sich as dem how many time dey work debbletry in a wood and you and i not werry far off sus how ole you got redskin and forgetful nobody can hold out wid color man gosh i do blieve i lib for ebber sometime it wonerful to think of how long i stay on dis werry arth  such exclamations were not uncommon with the aged jaaf and no one noted them he did not seem to expect any answer himself nor did any one appear to deem it at all necessary to make one as for the trackless he arose with a saddened countenance and moved into his hut like one who wished to be left alone with his thoughts my grandmother ordered the carriage to move on and the rest of us returned to the house on foot     chapter xxi      with all thy rural echoes come       sweet comrade of the rosy day     wafting the wild bees gentle hum       or cuckoos plaintive roundelaycampbell   that night was passed under my own roof in the family circle although my presence on the estate was now generally known to all who were interested in it i cannot say that i thought much of the antirenters or of any risks incurred by the discovery the craven spirit manifested by the injins in presence of the indians the assumed before the real had not a tendency to awaken much respect for the disaffected and quite likely disposed me to be more indifferent to their proceedings than i might otherwise have been at all events i was happy with patt and mary and my uncles wards and did not give the disorganizers a thought until quite at the close of the evening the manner in which john went about to barricade the doors and windows after the ladies had retired struck me unpleasantly however and it did not fail to produce the same effect on my uncle this seemingly important duty was done when my faithful maîtredhôtel for such in a measure was the englishmans station came to me and my uncle who were waiting for his appearance in the library armed like robinson crusoe he brought us each a revolving pistol and a rifle with a proper allowance of ammunition  missus so john persevered in calling my grandmother though it was very unlike an english servant to do so after he had been in the country three monthsmissus as hordered harms to be laid in in quantities mr hugh and hall of us has our rifles and pistols just like these she keeps some for herself and miss martha in her own room still but as she supposes you can make better use of these than the maids i had her orders to bring them down out of the maids room and hoffer them to yourselves gentlemen they are hall loaded and smart weapons be they  surely there has been no occasion as yet for using such things as these exclaimed my uncle  one doesnt know mr roger when the hinimy may come we have had only three alarms since the ladies arrived and most luckily no blood was shed though we fired at the hinimy and the hinimy fired at us when i says no blood was spilt i should add on our side for there was no way to know how much the antis suffered and they hadnt good stone walls to cover them as we ad on our side  gracious providence i had no notion of this hugh the country is in a worse state than i had supposed and we ought not to leave the ladies here an hour after tomorrow  as the ladies who came within my uncles category did not include mary warren i did not take exactly the same view of the subject as he did himself nothing further was said on the subject however and shortly after each shouldered his rifle and retired to his own room  it was past midnight when i reached my apartment but i felt no inclination for sleep that had been an important day to me one full of excitement and i was still too much under the influence of its circumstances to think of my bed there was soon a profound silence in the house the closing of doors and the sound of footsteps having ceased and i went to a window to gaze on the scene without there was a threequarters moon which gave light enough to render all the nearer objects of the landscape distinctly visible the view had nothing remarkable in it but it was always rural and pretty the little river and the broad meadows were not to be seen from my side of the house which commanded the carriage road that wound through the lawnthe farmhousethe distant churchthe neat and pretty rectorythe dwelling of mary and a long reach of farms that lay along the valley and on the broad breast of the rising ground to the westward  everything far and near seemed buried in the quiet of deep night even the cattle in the fields had lain down to sleep for like men they love to follow the law of nature and divide the hours by light and darkness john had placed the candles in my dressingroom and closed the inner shutters but i had taken a seat by a window of the bedroom and sat in no other light but that which came from the moon which was now near setting i might have been ruminating on the events of the day half an hour or more when i fancied some object was in motion on a path that led toward the village but which was quite distinct from the ordinary highway this path was private indeed running fully a mile through my own farm and grounds bounded for a considerable distance by high fences on each side of it and running among the copses and thickets of the lawn as soon as it emerged from the fields it had been made in order to enable my grandfather to ride to his fields uninterrupted by gates or bars and issuing into the bit of forest already described it passed through that by a short cut and enabled us to reach the hamlet by a road that saved nearly a mile in the whole distance this path was often used by those who left the nest or who came to it in the saddle but rarely by any but those who belonged to the family though old as the place itself it was little known by others not suiting the general taste for publicity there not being a solitary dwelling on it between the nest house itself and the point where it emerged into the highway beyond the wood which was quite near to the village  i could see the whole line of this private path with the exception here and there of intervals that were hid by trees and thickets from the point where it terminated until it entered the wood there could be no mistake late as was the hour some one mounted was galloping along that path winding his or her way among the rails of the fences now plainly visible then lost to view i had caught a glimpse of this phantom for at that unusual hour and by that delusive light it required no great effort of the imagination thus to fancy the equestrian just as it emerged from the wood and could not well be mistaken as to the accuracy of my discovery the path led through a pretty wooded ravine in the lawn and no sooner did i lose sight of this strange object than i turned my eyes eagerly to the spot where it ought to reappear on emerging from its cover  the path lay in shadow for twenty rods on quitting the ravine after which it wound across the lawn to the door for about twice that distance in full moonlight at the termination of the shadow there was a noble oak which stood alone and beneath its wide branches was a seat much frequented by the ladies in the heats of summer my eye kept moving from this point where the light became strong to that where the path issued from the ravine at the latter it was just possible to distinguish a moving object and sure enough there i got my next view of the person i was watching the horse came up the ascent on a gallopa pace that was continued until its rider drew the rein beneath the oak here to my surprise a female sprang from the saddle with great alacrity and secured her steed within the shadow of the tree this was no sooner done than she moved on toward the house in much apparent haste fearful of disturbing the family i now left my room on tiptoe and without a candle the light of the moon penetrating the passages in sufficient quantity to serve my purpose descending as fast as possible to the lower floor swift and prompt as had been my own movement it had been anticipated by another to my great surprise on reaching the little side door to which the path led and where the ladies had long been accustomed to get into the saddle when they used it i found a female figure with her hand on the massive lock as if ready to turn its key at some expected summons to my great astonishment on drawing nearer i recognized by the faint light that penetrated through a little window over the door the person of mary warren  i certainly started at this unexpected discovery but if she who caused that start in me submitted to any similar emotion i did not discover it she may have heard my step however descending the stairs and have been prepared for the meeting  you have seen her too have you mr littlepage exclaimed mary though she used the precaution to speak in a suppressed tone what can have brought her here at this late hour  you know who it is then miss warren i answered feeling an indescribable pleasure succeed my surprise as i remembered the dear girl who was fully dressed just as she had left the drawingroom an hour before must have been gazing out upon the moonlight view as well as myself a species of romance that proved something like a similiarity of tastes if not a secret sympathy between us  certainly returned mary steadily i cannot well be mistaken in the person i think it is opportunity newcome  my hand was on the key and i turned it in the lock a bar remained and this i also removed when we opened the door sure enough there came the person just named within ten feet of the steps which she doubtless intended to ascend she manifested surprise on ascertaining who were her porters but hastened into the house looking anxiously behind her as if distrustful of pursuit or observation i led the way to the library lighted its lamp and then returned to my two silent companions looking a request for explanation  opportunity was a young woman in her twentysixth year and was not without considerable personal charms the exercise and excitement through which she had just gone had heightened the color in her cheeks and rendered her appearance unusually pleasing nevertheless opportunity was not a woman to awaken anything like the passion of love in me though i had long been aware such was her purpose i suspected that her present business was connected with this scheme i will own and was prepared to listen to her communication with distrust as for opportunity herself she hesitated about making her disclosures and the very first words she uttered were anything but delicate or feminine  well i declare exclaimed opportunity i did not expect to find you two alone at this time of night  i could have given her tongue a twitch to cure it of its propensity to speak evil but concern for mary warren induced me to turn anxiously toward her never did the steady selfpossession of perfect innocence better assert itself than in the dear girl at this rude assault the innocence which can leave no latent intention or wish to alarm the feelings  we had all retired answered the pureminded girl and everybody on my side of the house is in bed and asleep i believe but i did not feel any drowsiness and was sitting at a window looking out upon the view by this lovely moonlight when i saw you ride out of the woods and follow the lane as you came up to the oak i knew who it was opportunity and ran down to admit you for i was certain something extraordinary must bring you here at this late hour  oh nothing extraordinary at all cried miss opportunity in a careless way i love moonlight as well as yourself mary and am a desperate horsewoman as you know i thought it would be romantic to gallop over to the nest and go back between one and two in the morning nothing more i can assure you  the coolness with which this was said amazed me not a little though i was not so silly as to believe a syllable of it opportunity had a great deal of vulgar sentimentalism about her it is truesuch as some girls are apt to mistake for refinement but she was not quite so bad as to travel that lane at midnight and alone without some special object it occurred to me that this object might be connected with her brother and that she would naturally wish to make her communications privately we had all taken seats at a table which occupied the centre of the room mary and myself quite near each other and opportunity at a distant angle i wrote on a slip of paper a short request for mary to leave me alone with our visitor and laid it under her eyes without exciting opportunitys suspicion talking to her the whole time about the night and the weather and her ride while we were thus engaged miss warren rose and quietly glided out of the room so silently was this done that i do not believe my remaining companion was conscious of it at the moment  you have driven mary warren away miss opportunity i remarked by the hint about our being alone together  lord theres no great harm in that i am used to being alone with gentlemen and think nothing of it but are we really alone mr hugh and quite by ourselves  quite as you see our two selves and mary warren i believe to be the only persons in the house out of our beds she has left us a little hurt perhaps and we are quite alone  oh as for mary warrens feelings i dont mind them much mr hugh shes a good critteryes this elegant young lady actually used that extraordinary wordand as forgiving as religion besides shes only the episcopal clergymans daughter and take your family away thats a denomination that would not stand long at ravensnest i can tell you  i am very glad then my family is not away for it is a denomination i both honor and love so long as the grasping and innovating spirit of the times leaves the littlepages anything a fair portion of their means shall be given to support that congregation as for miss warren i am pleased to hear that her temperament is so forgiving  i know that well and did not speak in the hope of making any change in your views mr hugh mary warren however will not think much of my remark tomorrow i do not believe she thought half as much about it tonight as i should have done had it been made to me  i fancy this was quite true mary warren having listened to the insinuation as the guileless and innocent hear innuendos that bring no consciousness with them while opportunitys spirit would have been very apt to buckle on the armor which practice had rendered wellfitting  you have not taken this long ride merely to admire the moon miss opportunity i now carelessly remarked willing to bring things to a head if you would favor me with its real object i should be pleased to learn it  what if mary should be standing at the keyhole listening said this elegant critter with the suspicion of a vulgar mind i wouldnt have her hear what ive got to tell you for a mint of money  i do not think there is much danger of that i answered rising notwithstanding and throwing open the door you perceive there is no one here and we can converse in safety  opportunity was not so easily satisfied of a gossiping craving disposition herself in all things that pertain to curiosity it was not easy for her to imagine another could be less guided by that feeling than herself rising therefore she went on tiptoe to the passage and examined it for herself satisfied at length that we were not watched she returned to the room closed the door softly motioned for me to be seated placed herself quite near me and then appeared disposed to proceed to business  this has been a dreadful day mr hugh the young woman now commenced actually looking sorrowful as i make little doubt she really felt who could have thought that the streetmusician was you and that old german pedler of watches mr roger i declare the world seems to be getting upsidedown and folks dont know when theyre in their right places  it was a foolish adventure perhaps but it has let us into some most important secrets  thats just the difficulty i defend you all i can and tell my brothers that youve not done anything they wouldnt do in a minute if only half a farm depended on it while in your case it may be more than a hundred  your brothers then complain of my having appeared among the antirenters in disguise  they do desperately mr hugh and seem quite put out about it they say it was ungenerous to come in that way into your own country and steal their secrets from them i say all i can in your favor but words wont pass for much with men in such a taking you know mr hugh ive always been your friend even from our childish days having got myself into more than one scrape to get you out of them  as opportunity made this declaration one a little loose as to facts by the way she sighed gently dropped her eyes and looked as conscious and confused as i believe it was at all in her nature to appear it was not my cue to betray undue bashfulness at such a moment and as for any scruples on the subject of misleading a confiding heart i should as soon have thought of feeding an anaconda or a boa constrictor with angleworms i took the young ladys hand therefore squeezed it with as sentimental a pressure as i knew now to use and looked green enough about the eyes i dare say  you are only too good opportunity i answered yes i have ever relied on you as a friend and have never doubted you would defend me when i was not present to defend myself  here i released the hand a little apprehensive i might have the young lady sobbing on my shoulder unless some little moderation were observed opportunity manifested a reluctance to let go her hold but what could a young woman do when the gentleman himself exhibited so much discretion  yes seneky in particular is in a dreadful taking she resumed and to pacify him i consented to ride over myself at this time of night to let you know what is threatened  that is most kind of you opportunity and as it is so late had you not better tell your story at once and then go to a room and rest yourself after so sharp a ride  tell my tale i will for its high time you heard it but as for rest i must jump on my horse and gallop back the moment the moon sets sleep i must in my own bed this night of course you and mary warren will both be silent as to my visit since it has been made for your good  i promised for myself and mary and then pressed my companion to delay no longer in imparting the information she had ridden so far to bring the story was soon told and proved to be sufficiently alarming one portion of the facts i got directly from opportunity herself while another has been subsequently gleaned from various sources all being certain the particular circumstances were these  when seneca followed the band of injins and his coantirenters in their precipitate retreat on the hamlet his revelations produced a general consternation it then became known that the young paris spendthrift was on his own estate that he had actually been among the disaffected that day had learned many of their secrets and had probably made black marks against certain of the tenants whose leases were nearly expired bad as this was of itself it was not the worst of the matter nothing was more certain than the fact that this young landlord knew a few of those who had committed felony and might have sundry highly probable suspicions as to others the guilty lay at his mercy as a matter of course and there was a sufficiency of common sense left among these conspirators to understand that a man who must feel that attempts were making to rob him of his estate would be very likely to turn the tables on his assailants did an occasion offer when men embark in an undertaking as innately nefarious as that of antirentism certainly is when it is stripped of its pretentions and stands in its naked deformity they are not apt to stop at trifles to this desperate character of its mischief the country owes the general depression of truth that has accompanied its career its false and dangerous principles its confusion between right and wrong and finally its murders it has been the miserable prerogative of demagogues alone to defend its career and its demoralization thus has it happened that the country has seen the same quasi legislatorslegislators by the vote of a party and the courtesy of the country if by no other tenuresupporting with an air of high pretension the very doubtful policy of attempting to make men moral by statute law on the one side while they go the full length of these property depredators on the other in such a state of society it is not surprising that any expedient should be adopted to intimidate and bully me into silence it was consequently determined in a conclave of the chiefs that a complaint should be made against my uncle and myself before an antirent justice of the peace for felony under the recent statute in appearing disguised and armed as a means of preventing our complaints against real offenders it is true we were not in masks but our disguises nevertheless were so effectual as possibly to meet the contingency contemplated by the law had we been armed as to weapons however we had been totally and intentionally without anything of the sort but oaths cost villains like those engaged in this plot very little those oaths had been taken and warrants were actually signed by the magistrate of which the service was suspended at senecas solicitation merely to enable the last to effect a compromise it was not thought sufficient however to menace my uncle and myself with a prosecution of this nature intimidation of another sort was to be put in requisition to enforce the dread of the legal proceedings a measure which should let us see that our assailants were in downright earnest opportunity had ascertained that something serious was to be attempted and she believed that very night though what it was precisely was more than she knew or knowing was willing to communicate  the object of this late visit then was to make terms for her brother or brothers to apprise me of some unknown but pressing danger and to obtain all that influence in my breast that might fairly be anticipated from services so material beyond a question i was fortunate in having such a friend in the enemys camp though past experience had taught me to be wary how i trusted my miserable and sensitive heart within the meshes of a net that had been so often cast  i am very sensible of the importance of your services miss opportunity i said when the voluble young lady had told her tale and shall not fail to bear it in mind as for making any direct arrangement with your brother seneca that is out of the question since it would be compromising felony and subject me to punishment but i can be passive if i see fit and your wishes will have great weight with me the attempt to arrest my uncle and myself should it ever be made will only subject its instigators to action for malicious prosecutions and gives me no concern it is very doubtful how far we were disguised in the sense of the statute and it is certain we were not armed in any sense without perjury therefore such a prosecution must fail  folks take desperate oaths in antirent times interrupted opportunity with a significant look  i am quite aware of that human testimony at the best is very frail and often to be distrusted but in seasons of excitement and passion and cupidity it is common to find it corrupt the most material thing at present is to know precisely the nature of the evil they meditate against us  opportunitys eye did not turn away as mine was fastened on her while she answered this question but retained all the steadiness of sincerity  i wish i could tell you mr hugh she said but i can say no more than i have some injury will be attempted this night i feel certain but what that injury will be is more than i know myself i must now go home for the moon will be nearly down and it will never do for me to be seen by any of the antis the little i have said in favor of the littlepages has made me enemies as it is but i never should be forgiven was this ride to be known  opportunity now rose and smiling on me as any other rover might be supposed to fire a parting broadside in order to render the recollection of her presence as memorable as possible she hurried away i accompanied her to the oak as a matter of course and assisted her into her saddle sundry little passages of country coquetry occurred during these movements and the young lady manifested a reluctance to depart even when all was ready though she was in so great a hurry her game was certainly as desperate as that of the antirenters themselves but it was a game she was determined to play out the moon was not yet quite down and that circumstance served as a pretence for delay while i fancied that she might still have something in reserve to communicate  this has been so kind in you dear opportunity i said laying my hand gently on the one of hers which held the bridleso like old timesso like yourself indeedthat i scarce know how to thank you but we shall live to have oldfashioned times again when the former communications can be opened among us those were happy days when we all went galloping over the hills together mere boys and girls it is true but delighted boys and girls i hope you will allow  that they wasopportunitys education and graces did not extend to good grammar in her ordinary discourse which many persons among us seem to fancy is antirepublicanthat they was and i should like to live em over again never mind hugh youll live to put down these people and then youll settle and marry you mean to marry of course  this was a pretty plain demonstration but i was used to it as what young man of fortune is notand a danger known is a danger avoided i pressed the hand i held gently relinquished it and then observed in a somewhat disappointed tone  well i ought not to ask again what is the particular injury i am to expect tonight a brother is nearer than a friend i know and i can appreciate your difficulties  opportunity had actually given the spirited beast she rode the rein and was on the point of galloping off when these last words touched her heart leaning forward and bending her head down so as to bring our faces within a foot of each other she said in a low voice  fire is a good servant but a hard master a teakettle of water thrown on it at first would have put out the last great conflagration in york  these words were no sooner uttered than the bold young woman struck her horse a smart blow and away she went galloping over the turf with an almost noiseless hoof i watched her for a moment and saw her descend into the ravine when left quite alone there was abundant opportunity for reflection though no longer any opportunity to look at  firethat was an ominous word it is the instrument of the low villain and is an injury against which it is difficult indeed to guard it had been used in these antirent troubles though less perhaps than would have been the case in almost any other country the institutions of this even if they have introduced so many false and exaggerated notions of liberty having had a most beneficial effect in lessening some of the other evils of humanity still fire had been resorted to and the term of barnburner had got to be common among us far more common i rejoice to say than the practice which gave it birth nevertheless it was clearly of the last importance to certain persons at ravensnest to frighten me from complaining since their crimes could only lead them to the states prison were justice done i determined therefore not to lay my head on a pillow that night until assured that the danger was past  the moon had now set but the stars shed their twinkling rays on the dusky landscape i was not sorry for the change as it enabled me to move about with less risk of being seen the first thing was to seek some auxiliaries to aid me in watching and i at once decided to look for them among my guests the indians if fire will fight fire indian ought to be a match for injin any day there is just the difference between these two classes of men that their names would imply the one is natural dignified polished in his waynay gentlemanlike while the other is a sneaking scoundrel and as vulgar as his own appellation no one would think of calling these last masquerading rogues indians by common consent even the most particular purist in language terms them injins il y a chapeau et chapeau and there are indian and injin  without returning to the house i took my way at once toward the quarters of my red guests familiar with every object around me i kept so much within the shadows and moved across the lawn and fields by a route so hidden that there was not much risk of my being seen even had there been enemies on the lookout the distance was not great and i soon stood at the foot of the little knoll on which the old farmhouse stood sheltered in a manner by a dark row of aged currants which lined the bottom of an old and halfdeserted garden here i paused to look about me and to reflect a moment before i proceeded any further  there stood the good old substantial residence of my fathers in shadowy outline looming large and massive in its form and aspect it might be fired certainly but not with much facility on its exterior with the exception of its roof its piazza and its outside doors little wood was exposed to an incendiary without and a slight degree of watchfulness might suffice against such a danger then the law punished arson of an inhabited dwelling with death as it should do and your sneaking scoundrels seldom brave such a penalty in this country much is said about the impotency of the punishment of the gallows but no man can tell how many thousand times it has stayed the hand and caused the heart to quail until some one can appear among us who is able to reveal this important secret it is idle to talk about the few cases in which it is known that the risk of death has been insufficient to prevent crime one thing we all know other punishments exist and crime is perpetrated directly in their face daily and hourly and i cannot see why such a circumstance should not be just as much of an argument against the punishment of the penitentiary as against punishment by the gallows for one i am clearly for keeping in existence the knowledge that there is a power in the country potent to sweep away the offender when cases of sufficient gravity occur to render the warning wholesome     chapter xxii      o time and death with certain pace     though still unequal hurrying on     oerturning in your awful race     the cot the palace and the throne      not always in the storm of war     nor by the pestilence that sweeps     from the plaguesmitten realms afar     beyond the old and solemn deepssands   besides the house with its walls of stone however there were numerous outbuildings the carriagehouse stables and homebarn were all of stone also but a brand thrown into a haymow would easily produce a conflagration the barns hayricks etc on the flats and near the dwelling of miller were all of wood according to the custom of the country and it was not death to set fire to a barn the disguised and armed who should commit this last offence would incur no other risk than that which had already been incurred in carrying out his desperate plans i thought of these things for a moment when i opened a passage through the currant bushes intending to pass by a breach in the decayed fence into the garden and thus by a private way to the house to my astonishment and in a slight degree to my alarm a man stood before me the instant i emerged from the thicket  who bewhere gowhat want demanded one of the real redskins significantly this being a sentinal of the party whose vigilance even my guarded approach had not eluded  i told him who i was and that i came to seek the interpreter manytongues no sooner was i recognized than my red friend offered me his hand to shake american fashion and seemed satisfied he asked no question manifested no curiosity at this visit at an hour so unusual and took it all as one in ordinary life would receive a call in a morning between the permitted hours of twelve and three something had brought me there he must have known but what that something was appeared to give him no concern this man accompanied me to the house and pointed to the spot where i should find the person i sought snoring on his wellshaken bundles of straw  at the first touch of my finger manytongues awoke and stood erect he recognized me in an instant dark as was the room and touching my arm as a signal to follow led the way into the open air after moving out of earshot he stopped and proceeded to business himself like one accustomed to such interruptions  anything stirring tonight demanded this frontierman with the coolness of one who was ever ready am i to call my redskins or is it only a notice that is to be given  of that you shall judge for yourself you doubtless know the condition of this part of the country and the troubles that exist on the subject of the rents paid for the use of the farms what you saw today is a specimen of the scenes that are now constantly acted among us  colonel i cant say i do rightly understand the state of things down hereaway drawled out the interpreter after yawning like a hound and giving me the most favorite title of the frontiers it seems to be neither one thing nor tother nuther tomahawk nor law i can understand both of them but this halfandhalf sort of thing bothers me and puts me out you ought to have law or you hadnt ought but what you have should be stuck to  you mean that you do not find this part of the country either civilized or savage not submitting to the laws nor yet permitting the natural appeal to force  something of that sort the agent told me when i came on with this party of redskins that i was comin down into a quarter of the country where there was justices of the peace and that no man red or pale could or should right himself so weve all on us indivord to go by that rule and i can qualify that not a critter has been shot or scalped since we crossed the mississippi some sich law was necessary among us as we came from different and hostile tribes and nothing would be easier than to breed a quarrel among ourselves if a body was so disposed but i must say that im not only disappinted myself but most of my chiefs be dreadfully disappinted likewise  in what particular have you been most disappointed  in many matters the first thing that set me athinkin was to hear folks read them newspapers the way men talk of each other in them things is wonderful and to me its a surprise anys left at the end of the year to begin the same game the next why colonel littlepage  i am no colonelnot even an ensignyou must be confounding me with some other of my family  you ought to be sir and i shall not do you the injustice to call you by any lower title ive known gentlemen of not onequarter your pretensions tarmed ginrals out west ive hunted on the preries these twentyfive years and have now crossed the upper lakes six times and know what is due to a gentleman as well as any man and so as i was sayin colonel littlepage was men to talk of each other out on the preries as they print of each other down here among the meetinuses scalps would be so plenty as to fall considerable in valie im not at all spiteful but my feelins has been riled at only just hearin em things read for as for reading myself thats a thing i never condescended to this somewhat prepared me for findin things different as i got deeper into the settlement and ive not been disappinted so far as them expectations wentits the old idee thats been crossed  i am not astonished to hear this and agree with you entirely in thinking that the nations which can withstand a press of which the general character is as degraded as that of this country must be composed of beings of a higher order than man but to come to business you must have some notions of these mock savages and of the people called antirenters  sort o and sort o not i cant understand when a man has agreed to pay rent why he should not pay it a bargain is a bargain and the word of a gentleman is as good as his bond  these opinions would surprise some among us a few legislators included they appear to think that the moral test of every engagement is whether the parties like it or not  one word if you please colonel do they give in as much to complaints of the owners of the sile as to the complaints of them that hire the land in order to work it  not at all the complaints of the landlords would not find a single sympathetic chord in the breast of the softesthearted politician in america let them be ever so wellfounded surely you who are a rover on the prairies can have no great respect for land titles  the prerie is the prerie colonel and men live and act by prerie law on prerie ground but right is right too colonel as well as prerie is prerie and i like to see it prevail i do not think you will find a redskin among all the chiefs who are asleep under that roof who will not give his voice again flying from the tarms of a solemn bargain a man must be well steeped in the ways of the law i should judge to bring his mind to such an act  do these redmen then know anything of the nature of the difficulties that exist here  they have heard on em and have talked a good deal together on the subject its opposyte to the very natur of an indian like to agree to one thing and to do another but here is a chippewa who is on the lookout i will ask him a question and you shall hear his answer  manytongues now spoke to the sentinel who was sauntering near after a brief exchange of questions and answers in the tongue of the latter the interpreter communicated what had passed  this chippewa has heard somewhere he said that there are folks in this part of the world who get into wigwams by agreeing to pay rent for them and when once in possession they want to fly from their agreements and make the man they got it from prove his right to it is that true colonel  it is true out of all question and not only do the tenants wish to enact this treachery but they have found others that call themselves legislators who are willing to sustain them in the fraud it is much as if you should borrow or hire a rifle for a days sporting and when the man who let you have it came to claim it at night you should tell him to prove he was the right owner  whats that to me i got the rifle of him have no right but such as he had and am bound to stand by my bargain no no colonel not a redskin on the preries but would revolutionize at that but what may have brought you here at this time o night them that sleep in beds dont like to quit them till mornin comes to tell em to rise  i then gave manytongues an account of the visit i had received without mentioning the name of opportunity however and related the nature of the warning i had heard the interpreter was in nowise disturbed at this prospect of a collision with the injins against whom he had a grudge not only on account of the little affair of the preceding day but mainly in consequence of their having brought real savages into discredit by the craven and clumsy manner in which they had carried out their imitation  nothin better is to be expected from such critturs he observed after we had discussed the matter together at some little length though fire is held to be lawful warfare even on the preries for my part im not at all sorry there is something to do nor will my chiefs be melancholy on this account for it is dull work to be doing nothing for months and months at a time but smoking at councils making speeches to folks who live by talking and eating and drinking activity is the natur of a prerie man and hes always glad to pick his flint after a spell of considerable quiet ill tell the chippewa to step in and bring out the redskins ater which you can give your orders  i could wish watchfulness rather than violence the men can lie in watch near the principal buildings and it might be well to have some water ready to extinguish any flames that may be lighted before they get too far ahead  just as you say colonel for you are my captaingeneral but i can tell you how i did once out on the preries when i caught a rascal of a sioux blowing a fire he had kindled at one of my own lodges i just laid him on the flames and let him put them out himself by bleeding on them  we must have no violence unless it become indispensable to save the buildings the law will not justify us in using our arms except in the least extremity prisoners i wish you to take for they may serve as hostages besides furnishing examples to intimidate other offenders i rely on you to give due warning to our red friends on this subject  the interpreter gave a sort of grunt but he said nothing the conversation went no farther however just then for by this time the indians came stealing out of the house every man of them armed looking dusky prepared and full of wariness manytongues did not keep them long but soon told his story after this his authority appeared in a great measure to cease flintyheart was now the most prominent of the party though prairiefire and another warrior were also connected with the orders given to the rest i observed that eaglesflight had no part in these arrangements which were peculiarly military though he appeared armed and ready and went forth on the sudden call like the rest in five minutes the indians were all off principally in pairs leaving the interpreter and myself still standing together in front of the deserted house  it was by this time past one oclock and i thought it probable my enemies would soon appear if they came that night accompanied by the interpreter i took the way toward the nest house it occurring to me that arms might be wanted in the course of the morning on quitting my room the rifle and pistol provided by john had been left there and i thought of stealing into the house again obtaining those weapons extinguish my light and rejoin my present companion without giving alarm to any of the sleepers  this plan was successfully executed so far as ascending to my room and descending to the door were concerned but there it met with an interruption while in the very act of closing the little postern as we used to call it by way of pleasantry i felt a small soft hand laid on the one of my own which was drawingto the door after me in an instant i had turned and was at the side of mary warren i expressed my surprise at finding her still up and concern lest she might suffer in health in consequence of so much unusual watchfulness  i could not sleep after what has passed tonight she answered without knowing the meaning of all these movements i have been looking from my window and saw you assist opportunity to get on her horse and afterward walk toward the old farmhouse where the indians are lodged tell me frankly mr littlepage is there any danger to be apprehended  i shall be frank with you maryhow easy and pleasant it was to me to use this gentle familiarity which might now be assumed without appearing to be presumptuous under all the circumstances of our intercourse i shall be frank with you mary for i know that your prudence and selfcommand will prevent any unnecessary alarm while your watchfulness may be of use there is some reason to fear the brand  the brand  so opportunity has given me reason to suppose and i do not think she would have ridden the distance she did at such an hour unless her business were serious the brand is the proper instrument of the antirenter and renders his disguise convenient i have got all the redmen on the lookout however and i do not think that mischief can be done tonight without its being detected tomorrow we can appeal to the authorities for protection  i will not sleep this night exclaimed mary drawing the light shawl she wore as a protection against the air of that summernight more closely around her person as a sterner being might be supposed to gird on his armor in a moment of peril i care not for rest they ought not they shall not mr littlepage do you this wrong have you apprehensions for this house  one never knows this house is not easily set fire to from without and i scarcely think there can be any enemy within the domestics are old and tried and i do not believe that either of them could be bought i feel little apprehension therefore from any within while i confess to a good deal from those without fire is such a dreadful foe and one is usually so helpless against its ravages in the country i will not ask you to retire for i know you will notnay cannot sleep but by passing from window to window for the next hour or until i rejoin you your mind will be occupied and possibly some injury might be prevented an unseen observer from a window might detect an attempt that would escape those on the watch without  i will do so said mary eagerly and should i discover anything i will open a leaf of the shutter of my own room you can then see the light of the candle within and by coming at once to this door you will find me here ready to let you know my discovery  with this understanding they parted but not until i had shaken hands affectionately with this gentlelooking but really resolute and clearheaded girl i rejoined manytongues who stood in the shadows of the piazza where there was no possibility of his being seen except by one quite near his person after a brief explanation we parted one taking the north side of the buildings and the other the south in order to make certain no incendiary was at work on either of the wings  the nest house was much less exposed to attempts like those we apprehended than most american dwellings the structure being of stone left but little inflammable material accessible and the doors on the exterior were only twothose already mentioned there was a great gate it is true one large enough to admit a cart into the inner court on the southern face of the wing beneath the arch of which an incendiary might indeed make his attempt though a practised rogue would at once see the difficulties little wood was even there beyond that of the massive gate itself which once burnt would leave no further fuel for flames i examined the place notwithstanding and finding all safe on my side of the building i went to rejoin the interpreter who was to meet me at the foot of a fine beech which spread its broad arms over the lawn at the distance of about a hundred yards from the house and so nearly in its front as to afford us in all respects the most eligible position for sentinels on duty like ours far or near  at the foot of that beech i found manytongues and the deep obscurity in which his form was embedded was of itself a high recommendation of the position i did not see him until almost near enough to touch him he was seated on a bench and seemed entirely at his ease like one accustomed to ambushes vigilance and midnight assaults we exchanged reports ascertained all was well and then i took my seat at the interpreters side willing to beguile the time by such discourse as occurred to my mind  that was a most interesting scene last evening i remarked the interview between old trackless and your red companions i own a lively curiosity to know what particular claim our aged friend has on those distant tribes that chiefs of note have come so far to see him  they have not come all the way from the preries to this spot on any such arnd though i do not question their readiness to do so in the first place old age when accompanied by wisdom and sobriety and a good character goes a great way with savages in ginral but there is something particlar about the acts of susquesus that i do not know which raises him higher than common in redskin eyes i intend to larn what it is before we quit this country  a pause succeeded then i spoke of the preries as almost all western men pronounce the word i drew such an outline of the life as i supposed my companion passed there thinking it might be agreeable to hear his own habits and enjoyments extolled  ill tell you how it is colonel returned the interpreter with a little show of feeling much more than he had previously manifested on any occasion during our short acquaintance yes ill jist tell you how it is prerie life is delightsome to them that loves freedom and justice  freedom i can understand said i interrupting him in my surprisebut as for justice i should think that laws are absolutely necessary  ay thats a settlement idee i know but its not as true as some supposes there is no court and jury like this colonel slapping the breech of his rifle with energy and eastern powder conspired with galena lead makes the best of attorneys ive tried both and speak on sartainty law druv me out on the preries and love for them keeps me there down thisaway youre neither one thing nor tutherlaw nor rifle for if you had law as law ought to be you and i wouldnt be sitting here at this time of night to prevent your mock injins from setting fire to your houses and barns  there was only too much truth in this last position of the straightforward interpreter to be gainsaid after making some proper allowances for the difficulties of the case and the unexpected circumstances no impartial man could deny that the laws had been trifled with or things never would have reached the pass they had as manytongues affirmed we had neither the protection of the law nor the use of the rifle it ought to be written in letters of brass in all the highways and places of resort in the country that a state of society which pretends to the protection that belongs to civilization and fails to give it only makes the condition of the honest portion of the community so much the worse by depriving it of the protection conferred by nature without supplying the substitute i dare say the interpreter and i sat an hour under that tree conversing in low voices on such matters and things as came uppermost in our minds there was a good deal of true prerie philosophy in the opinions of my companion which is much as if one should say his notions were a mixture of clear natural justice and strong local prejudices the last sentiment he uttered was so very characteristic as to merit particular notice  ill tell you how it is colonel he said right is right and nonsense is nonsense if so be we should happen to catch one of these mocking rascals firing your house or barn it would be a smart chance at justice to settle things on the spot if i had my way i should just tie the fellow hands and feet and toss him into the flames to help him along with his own work a rascal makes the best of kindling wood  just at that instant i saw an upper leaf of the inside shutter of mary warrens room open for my eye was resting on the window at that very moment the light had been brought so near the opening as plainly to show the change leaving no doubt that my fair sentinel within had made some important discovery at such a summons i could not hesitate but telling manytongues to continue his watchfulness i went across the lawn with the steps of youth and haste in two minutes my hand was on the latch of the little door and in two seconds more it was open and i found myself standing in front of mary warren a gesture from her hand induced me to be cautious and closing the door silently i asked an explanation  speak not too loud whispered the anxious girl preserving a wonderful selfcommand nevertheless for the extraordinary circumstances in which she was placed i have discovered them they are here  herenot in the house surely  in the house itselfin the kitchen where they are kindling a fire on the floor at this instant come quicklythere is not a moment to lose  it may be well to explain here the arrangement of the kitchen and offices in order to render what is to follow the more intelligible the gateway mentioned cut the southern wing of the house into two equal parts the chambers however extending the whole length and of course passing over it on the western side of this gateway were certain offices connected with the eatingrooms and those eatingrooms themselves on the eastern side were the kitchen servants hall scullery etc and a flight of narrow stairs that led to the chambers occupied by the domestics the outside door to this latter portion of the building was beneath the arch of the gateway one corresponding to it opening on its opposite side and by means of which the service was ordinarily made there was a court environed on three of its sides by the main edifice and by two long low wings that have been so often mentioned while it was open on the fourth to the cliff this cliff was low land while it was nearly perpendicular it was possible for an active man to ascend or even to descend it by clinging to the rocks which were sufficiently ragged to admit of such an adventure when a boy i had done both fifty times and it was a somewhat common experiment among the male domestics and hirelings of the household it occurred to me at once that the incendiaries had most probably entered the house by ascending the cliff the kitchen of itself furnishing all the materials to light a conflagration  the reader will be assured that after receiving the startling communication of mary warren i did not stop to discuss all these matters with her my first impulse was to desire her to run to the beech and bid manytongues join me but she refused to quit my side  nonono you must not go to the kitchen alone she said hurriedly there are two of them and desperate looking wretches are they with their faces blackened and they have muskets nonono come i will accompany you  i hesitated no longer but moved forward mary keeping close at my side fortunately i had brought the rifle with me and the revolving pistol was in my pocket we went by the eatingrooms and offices the course taken by mary herself on her watch and who in looking through a small window of one of the last that opened beneath the gateway had discovered what was going on by means of a similar window in the kitchen as we went the noble girl told me that she had kept moving through the lower rooms of the whole house during the time i had been on watch out of doors and attracted by the light that gleamed through these windows she had distinctly seen two men with blackened faces kindling a fire in a corner of the kitchen where the flames must soon communicate with the stairs by means of which they would speedily reach the attics and the woodwork of the roof fortunately the floors of all that part of the house were made of bricks that of the servants hall excepted which was a room beyond the narrow passage that contained the stairs as soon as apprised of the danger mary warren had flown to the window of her own room to make the signal to me and then to the door to meet me but three or four minutes had elapsed between the time when she became apprised of the danger and that when we were walking hurriedly to the window beneath the gateway  a bright light which shone through the opposite window announced the progress made by the incendiaries requesting mary to remain where she was i passed through the door and descended to the pavement of the gateway the little window beneath the arch was too high for my purposes when on that level but there was a row of low windows that opened on the court to one of these i moved swiftly and got a clear view of all that was passing within  there they are exclaimed mary who neglectful of my request still kept close at my side two men with blackened faces and the wood of which they have made their fire is blazing brightly  the fire now i saw it did not confirm the dread i felt when i had it before me only in imagination the stairway had an open place beneath it and on the brick floor below had the incendiaries built their pile it was constructed at the bottom of some of the common wood that was found there in readiness for the wants of the cook in the morning lighted by coals taken from the fireplace a considerable pile had been made with the wood which was now burning pretty freely and the two rascals were busy piling on the chairs when i first saw them they had made a good beginning and in ten or fifteen minutes longer there is no doubt that all that portion of the house would have been in flames  you said they had muskets i whispered to mary do you see them now  no when i saw them each held his musket in one hand and worked with the other  i could have shot the villains without difficulty or risk to myself but felt deeply averse to taking human life still there was the prospect of a serious struggle before me and i saw the necessity of obtaining assistance  will you go to my uncles room mary and tell him to rise immediately then to the front door of the house and call out manytongues come here as fast as possible it will take but two minutes to do both and i will watch these rascals in the meantime  i dread leaving you here alone with the wretches mr littlepage whispered mary gently  an earnest entreaty on my part however induced her to comply and no sooner did the dear girl set about the accomplishment of the task then she flew rather than ran it did not seem to me a minute ere i heard her call to the interpreter the night was so still that sweet as were those tones and busy as were the incendiaries they heard them too or fancied they heard something which alarmed them they spoke to each other looked intently at their infernal work for a single instant sought their arms which were standing in the corner of the kitchen and were evidently preparing to depart  the crisis was near there was not time to receive assistance before the two fellows would be out and i must either meet them in conflict or suffer them to escape my first impression was to shoot down the leading man and grapple with the other ere he had time to prepare his arms but a timely thought prevented this hazardous step the incendiaries were retiring and i had a doubt of the legality of killing a retreating felon i believed that my chances before a jury would be far less than those of an ordinary pickpocket or highway robber and had heard and read enough to be certain there were thousands around me who would fancy it a sufficient moral provocation for all which had passed that i held the fee of farms that other men desired to possess  a majority of my countrymen will scout this idea as forced and improbable but majorities are far from being infallible in their judgments let any discreet and observant man take a near view of that which is daily going on around him if he do not find in men this disposition to distort principles to pervert justice and to attain their ends regardless of the means then will i admit i do not understand human nature as human nature exhibits its deformity in this blessed republic of ours  there was no time to lose however and the course i actually decided to take will be soonest told by relating things as they occurred i heard the door open and was ready for action whether the incendiaries intended to retreat by the cliff or to open the gate which was barred within i could not tell but i was ready for either alternative  no sooner did i hear a step on the pavement of the gateway than i discharged my rifle in the air this was done as an alarmsignal clubbing the piece i sprang forward and felled the foremost of the two with a sharp blow on his hat the fellow came down on the pavement like an ox under the axe of the slaughterhouse dropping the rifle i bounded over his body and grappled with his companion all this was done so rapidly as to take the rascals completely by surprise so sudden indeed was my assault on the fellow who stood erect that he was under the necessity of dropping his rifle and at it we went clinched like bears in the deathhug i was young and active but my antagonist was the stronger man of the two he had also the advantage of being practised in wrestling and i soon went down my enemy falling on top of me luckily i fell on the body of the other incendiary who was just beginning to discover signs of consciousness after the crushing blow he had received my chance would now have been small but for assistance the incendiary had caught my neckhandkerchief and was twisting it to choke me when i felt a sudden relief the light of the fire shone through the kitchen doors rendering everything distinct beneath the arch mary came flying back just in time to rescue me with a resolution that did her honor she caught up the rifle i had dropped and passed its small end between the bent arms of my antagonist and his own back raising it at the same time like a lever in the brief interval of breathing this ready expedient gave me i rallied my force caught my enemy by the throat made a desperate effort threw him off and over on his side and was on my feet in an instant drawing the pistol i ordered the rascal to yield or to take the consequences the sight of this weapon secured the victory the blackfaced villain shrinking back into a corner begging piteously not to be shot at the next moment the interpreter appeared under the arch followed by a stream of redskins which had been turned in this direction by the alarm given by my rifle     chapter xxiii       ye say they all have passed away that noble race and brave      that their light canoes have vanished from off the crested      wave that mid the forests where they roamed there rings no      hunters shout but their name is on your waters ye may not      wash it outmrs sigourney   directing manytongues to secure the two incendiaries i sprang into the kitchen to extinguish the flames it was high time though mary warren had already anticipated me here too she had actually thrown several dippers of water upon the fire which was beginning to crackle through the pile of chairs and had already succeeded in lessening the flames i knew that a hydrant stood in the kitchen itself which gave a full stream of water filling a pail i threw the contents on the flames and repeating the application in half a minute the room was filled with vapor and to the bright light succeeded a darkness that was so deep as to suggest the necessity of finding lamps and candles  the tumult produced by the scene just described soon brought all in the house to the spot the domestics male and female came tumbling down the stairs under which the fire had been lighted and presently candles were seen glancing about the house in all directions  i declare mr hugh cried john the moment he had taken a survey of the state of the kitchen this is worse than hireland sir the hamericans affect to laugh at the poor hirish and calls their country savage and hunfit to be inabited but nothing worse passes in it than is beginning to pass ere them stairs would have been all in flames in a few minutes and them stairs once on fire not one of hus up in the hattics could ave escaped death dont talk of hireland after this  poor john his prejudices are those of an englishman of his class and that is saying as much in favor of their strength as can be well said of any prejudices but how much truth was there in his remark the quiet manner in which we assume superiority in morals order justice and virtue over all other nations really contains an instructive lesson if one will only regard things as they really are i have no wish to exaggerate the faults of my own country but certainly i shall not remorselessly conceal them when the most dangerous consequences are connected with such a mistake as a whole the disorders disturbances and convulsions of america have certainly been much fewer than those of most perhaps of all other christian nations comparing numbers and including the time since the great experiment commenced but such ought to have been the result of our facts quite independently of national character the institutions leave nothing for the masses to struggle for and famine is unknown among us but what does the other side of the picture exhibit can any man point to a country in europe in which a great political movement has commenced on a principle as barefacedly knavish as that of transferring property from one class of men to another that such a project does exist here is beyond all just contradiction and it is equally certain that it has carried its devices into legislation and is fast corrupting the government in its most efficient agents john was right in saying we ought not to turn up our noses at the ebullitions of abused and troddenon hireland while our own skirts are to be cleared of such sins against the plainest dictates of right  the fire was extinguished and the house was safe the kitchen was soon cleared of the steam and smoke and in their places appeared a cloud of redskins prairiefire eaglesflight and flintyheart were all there examining the effects of the fire with stern and interesting countenances i looked round for mary warren but that gentle and singularly feminine girl after manifesting a presence of mind and decision that would have done honor to a young man of her own age had shrunk back with sensitive consciousness and now concealed herself among the others of her sex her duty so eminently useful and protective had been performed and she was only anxious to have it all forgotten this i discovered only next day however  manytongues had secured the incendiaries and they were now in the kitchen also with their hands tied together and arms bound behind their backs at the elbows  as their faces remained black it was out of my power to recognize either the rascal who had been felled by the blow of the rifle was yet confused in manner and i ordered the domestics to wash him in the double expectation of bringing him more completely to his senses and of ascertaining who he might be  the work was soon done and both objects were attained the cook used a dishcloth with so much dexterity that the blackamoor came out a white man at the first application and he was soon as clean as a child that is about to be sent to school fresh from the hands of its nurse the removal of the disguise brought out the abashed and frightened physiognomy of joshua brigham millers hired manor my hired man in effect as i paid him his wages  yes such was one of the effects of the pernicious opinions that had been so widely circulated in the land during the profound moral mania that was working its ravages among us with a fatality and danger that greatly exceed those which accompanied the cholera a fellow who was almost an inmate of my family had not only conspired with others to rob me of my property on a large scale but he had actually carried his plot so far as to resort to the brand and the rifle as two of the agents to be employed in carrying out his virtuous objects nor was this the result of the vulgar disposition to steal it was purely a consequence of a widelyextended system that is fast becoming incorporated with the politics of the land and which men relying on the efficacy of majorities are bold enough to stand up in legislative halls to defend28  footnote 28 in order that the reader who is not familiar with what is passing in new york may not suppose that exaggerated terms are here used the writer will state a single expedient of the antirenters in the legislature to obtain their ends it is generally known that the constitution of the united states prevents the separate states from passing laws impairing the obligations of contracts but for this provision of the federal constitution it is probable numbers would have succeeded long ago in obtaining the property of the few on their own terms amid shouts in honor of liberty this provision however has proved a stubborn obstacle until the world near the middle of the nineteenth century has been favored with the following notable scheme to effect the ends of those who want farms and must have them the state can regulate by statute the laws of descents it has accordingly been solemnly proposed in the legislature of new york that the statute of descents should be so far altered that when a landlord holding lands subject to certain leasehold tenures dies or a descent is cast that it shall be lawful for the tenants on application to the chancellor to convert these leasehold tenures into mortgages and to obtain the feesimple of the estates in payment of the debt in other words a leases a farm to b forever reserving a groundrent with covenants of reentry etc etc b wishes a deed but will not pay as price the united states says the contract shall not be impaired and the legislature of new york is illustrated by the expedient we have named to get over the provision of the constitution  since writing the foregoing this law has actually passed the assembly though it has not been adopted by the senate the provision included all leased property when the leases were for more than twentyone years or were on liveseditor  i confess that the discovery of the person of joshua brigham rendered me a little curious to ascertain that of his companion hester the cook was directed to take the other child in hand as soon as she had well wiped the countenance of the one first unmasked nothing loath the good housewife set about her task and the first dab of water she applied revealed the astounding fact that i had again captured seneca newcome it will be remembered that the last time i saw these two men together i left them fighting in the highway  i admit that this discovery shocked me there never had been a being of the newcome tribe from the grandfather who was its root at ravensnest down to opportunity who had ever been esteemed or respected among us tricktricktricklow cunning and overreaching management had been the family trait from the day jason of that name had rented the mill lot down to the present hour this i had heard from my grandfather my grandmother my own father my uncle my aunts and all older than myself who belonged to me still there they had been and habit had created a sort of feeling for them there had also been a species of pretension about the family which brought them more before us than most of the families of the tenantry the grandfather had received a sort of an education and this practice had been continued after a manner down to the unfortunate wretch who now stood a prisoner taken flagrante delictu and for a capital crime seneca could never have made a gentleman as the term is understood among gentlemen but he belonged to a profession which ought to raise a man materially above the level of the vulgar opportunity too had received her quasi education a far more pretending one than that of my own patt but nothing had been well taught to her not even reading inasmuch as she had a decided provincial pronunciation which sometimes grated on my nerves but opportunity had feelings and could not have anticipated her own brothers intentions when she communicated the important information she had opportunity moreover had more refinement than seneca in consequence of having a more limited association and she might fall into despair at this unexpected result of her own acts  i was still reflecting on these things when summoned to my grandmother she was in her own dressingroom surrounded by the four girls just so many pictures of alarm interest and female loveliness mary warren alone was in regular toilette but the others with instinctive coquetry had contrived to wrap themselves up in a way to render them handsomer than ever as for my dear grandmother herself she had been told that the house was safe but felt that vague desire to see me that was perhaps natural to the circumstances  the state of the country is frightful she said when i had answered a few of her questions and had told her who the prisoners really were and we can hardly remain here in safety think of one of the newcomesand of seneca in particular with his profession and education being engaged in such a crime  nay grandmother put in patt a little archly i never yet heard you speak well of the newcomes you barely tolerated opportunity in the hope of improving her  it is true that the race is a bad one and the circumstances show what injury a set of false notions transmitted from father to son for generations may do in a family we cannot think of keeping these dear girls here one hour after tomorrow hugh tomorrow or today for it is now past two oclock i seetoday is sunday and we can go to church tonight we will be watchful and monday morning your uncle shall start for satanstoe with all three of the girls  i shall not leave my dear grandmother rejoined pattnor do i think it would be very kind to leave mary warren behind us in a place like this  i cannot quit my father said mary herself quietly but very firmly it is his duty to remain with his parishioners and more so now that so many of them are misguided than at any other time and it is always my duty and my pleasure to remain with him  was that acting was that pharisaical or was it genuine nature pure filial affection and filial piety beyond all question it was the last and had not the simple tone the earnest manner and the almost alarmed eagerness with which the dear girl spoke proclaimed as much no one could have looked in at that serene and guileless eye and doubted my grandmother smiled on the lovely earnest speaker in her kindest manner took her hand and charmingly observed  mary and i will remain together her father is in no danger for even antirenters will respect a minister of the gospel and can be made to understand it is his duty to rebuke even their sins as for the other girls i think it is our duty to insist that your uncles wards at least should no longer be exposed to dangers like those we have gone through tonight  the two young ladies however protested in the prettiest manner possible their determination not to quit grandmamma as they affectionately termed their guardians mother and while they were thus employed my uncle ro entered the room having just paid a visit to the kitchen  heres a charming affair exclaimed the old bachelor as soon as in our midst arson antirentism attempts at murder and all sorts of enormities going hand in hand in the very heart of the wisest and best community that earth ever knew and the laws as profoundly asleep the whole time as if such gentle acts were considered meritorious this outdoes repudiation twentyfold hugh  ay my dear sir but it will not make a tithe of the talk look at the newspapers that will be put into your hands tomorrow morning fresh from wall and pine and ann streets they will be in convulsions if some unfortunate wight of a senator speak of adding an extra corporal to a regiment of foot as an alarming wardemonstration or quote the fall of a fancy stock that has not one cent of intrinsic value as if it betokened the downfall of a nation while they doze over this volcano which is raging and gathering strength beneath the whole community menacing destruction to the nation itself which is the father of stocks  the intense selfishness that is uppermost is a bad symptom certainly and no one can say to what it will lead one thing is sure it causes men to limit all their calculations to the present moment and to abate a nuisance that presses on our existing interests they will jeopard everything that belongs to the future but what are we to do with seneca newcome and his corascal the other incendiary  i had thought of referring that to your discretion sir they have been guilty of arson i suppose and must take their chances like everyday criminals  their chances will be very good ones hugh had you been caught in seneca newcomes kitchen setting fire to his house condign and merciless punishment would have been your lot beyond all controversy but their cases will be very different ill bet you a hundred that theyll not be convicted and a thousand that they are pardoned if convicted  acquitted sir will be out of the questionmiss warren and i saw them both in the very act of building their fire and there is plenty of testimony as to their identity  this indiscreet speech drew every eye on my late companion all the ladies old and young repeating the name of mary in the pretty manner in which the sex express surprise as for mary herself the poor blushing girl shrunk back abashed ashamed of she knew not what unless it might be in connection with some secret consciousness at finding herself so strangely associated with me  miss warren is indeed in her evening dress said my grandmother a little gravely and cannot have been in bed this night how has this happened my dear  thus called on mary warren was of too guileless and pure a mind to hesitate in telling her tale every incident with which she had been connected was simply and clearly related though she suppressed the name of our midnight visitor out of tenderness to opportunity all present were too discreet to ask the name and i may add all present heard the narrative with a marked and approving interest when mary had done my grandmother kissed her and patt the generous creature encircled her waist with the tenderness and affection of a sister who felt for all the trials the other had endured  it seems then we owe our safety to mary after all exclaimed my good grandmother without her care and watchfulness hugh might most probably would have remained on the lawn until it was too late to save the house or us  that is not all added uncle ro any one could have cried fire or given a senseless alarm but it is evident from miss warrens account unpremeditated and artless as it is that but for the cool and discreet manner in which she played her part not onehalf of that which has been done would have been effected and that the house might have been lost nay had these fellows surprised hugh instead of hughs surprising them we might have been called on to deplore his loss  i saw a common shudder in patt and mary as they stood encircling each other with their arms but the last was evidently so pained that i interfered for her relief  i do not see any possibility of escape for these incendiaries  i said turning to my uncle under the testimony that can be offered and am surprised to hear you suggest a doubt of the result of the trial  you feel and reason like a very young man hugh one who fancies things are much nearer what they ought to be than facts will sustain justice is blind nowadays not as a proof of impartiality but as a proof that she too often sees only one side of a question how will they escape perhaps the jury may fancy setting fire to a pile of wood and certain chairs is not setting fire to a house let the animus be as plain as the noses on their faces mark me hugh littlepage one month will not go by before the events of this very night will be tortured into an argument in favor of antirentism  a common exclamation in which even my grandmother joined expressed the general dissent from this opinion  it is all very well ladies answered my uncle ro coollyall well enough master hugh but let the issue tell its own story i have heard already other abuses of the antirenters urged as a reason why the laws should be changed in order that men may not be tempted beyond their strength and why not use the same reasoning in favor of this crime when it has been used already in cases of murder the leasehold tenures make men commit murder it is said and they ought to be destroyed themselves the leasehold tenures make men commit arson it will now be said and who desires to retain laws that induce men to commit arson  on the same principle it might be pretended there should be no such thing as personals as they tempt men beyond what they can bear to commit petty larceny  no doubt it could and no doubt it would if political supremacy were to be the reward there is nothingno fallacy no moral sophism that would not be used to attain such an end but it is late and we ought to bethink us of disposing of the prisoners for the nightwhat means this light the house is not on fire after all  sure enough notwithstanding the close shutters and drawn curtains of my grandmothers dressingroom an unusual light had penetrated to the place filling us with sudden and intense alarm i opened the door and found the passages illuminated though all within appeared tranquil and safe there was a clamor in the court however and presently the fearful warwhoop of the savages rose on the night air the cries came from without as i fancied and rushing to the little door i was on the lawn in a moment when the mystery was solved an extensive haybarn one well filled with the remainder of the last years crops was on fire sending its forged and waving tongues of flame at least a hundred feet into the air it was merely a new argument against the leasehold tenures and in favor of the spirit of the institutions a little vividly pressed on the human senses next year it may figure in the message of a governor or the philanthropical efforts of some albany orator if the same spirit prevail in the institutions as would seem to prevail this is a contract to be tolerated which induces freemen to set barns on fire  the barn that had been set on fire stood on the flats below the cliff and fully half a mile away from the nest the conflagration made a most brilliant blaze and as a matter of course produced an intense light the loss to myself did not exceed a few hundred dollars and while this particular argument in favor of antirentism was not entirely agreeable it was not so grave as it might have been had it been urged on other buildings and in the same mode in other words i was not so much distressed with my loss as not to be able to see the beauty of the scene particularly as my uncle ro whispered that dunning had caused an insurance to be effected in the saratoga mutual assurance which would probably place a considerable portion of the tenants in the unlookedfor category of those who were to pay for their own frolic  as it was too late to think of saving the barn and ricks and miller with his people had already descended to the spot to look after the fences and any other object that might be endangered by the flying embers there was nothing for us to do but to remain passive spectators truly the scene was one worthy of being viewed and is not altogether unfit for description  the light of that burning barn extended for a great distance shining like what it was an evil deed in a naughty world for notwithstanding the high authority of shakespeare it is your evil deeds after all that produce the brightest blazes and which throw their beams the farthest in this state of probation in which we live  the most remarkable objects in that remarkable scene were the true and the false redskinsthe indians and the injinsboth of whom were in motion on the meadows and both of whom were distinctly visible to us where we stood on the cliffs the ladies being at their chamber windows though i dare say they were not quite so obvious to each other  the indians had formed themselves into a very open order and were advancing toward the other party in a stealthy manner by creeping on allfours or crouching like catamounts to the earth and availing themselves of everything like a cover that offered the burning barn was between the two parties and was a principal reason that the injins were not sooner aware of the risk they ran the last were a whooping shouting dancing leaping band of some forty or fifty of the disguised and armed who were quite near enough to the conflagration to enjoy it without being so near as to be necessarily connected with it we understood their presence and antics to be intended as so many intimations of the secret agency they had had in the depredations of the night and as so many warnings how i withstood the spirit of the institutions  manytongues who had certain vague notions of the necessity of his keeping on the windy side of the law did not accompany his red brethren but came through the gateway and joined my uncle and myself as we stood beneath the cover of a noble chestnut on the verge of the cliff watching the course of things on the meadow i expressed my surprise at seeing him there and inquired if his presence might not be needed by flintyheart or prairiefire  not at all not at all colonel he answered with perfect coolness the savages have no great need of an intarpreter in the business they are on and if harm comes of the meetin its perhaps best that the two parties should not understand each other in which case it might all be looked on as an accident i hope theyll not be particular about scalpsfor i told flintyheart as he was leaving us the people of this part of the world did not like to be scalped  this was the only encouragement we received from the interpreter who appeared to think that matters were now in the right train and that every difficulty would soon be disposed of secundum artem the injins however viewed the affair differently having no wish for a serious brush with any one much less with enemies of the known character of redskins how they ascertained the presence of their foe i cannot say though it is probable some one saw them stealing along the meadows in spite of all their care and gave the alarm alarm it was sure enough the party of the previous day scarce retreating through the woods with greater haste than the disguised and armed now vanished  such has been the fact as respects these men in every instance in which they have been brought in contact with armed bodies though much inferior to their own in numbers fierce enough and even brutal on a variety of occasions in which individuals have become subject to their power in all cases in which armed parties however small have been sent against them they have betrayed timidity and a dread of making that very appeal to force which by their own previous acts they had insolently invited is it then true that these soidisant injins have not the ordinary courage of their race and that they are less than americans with arms in their hands and below the level of all around them in spirit such is not the case the consciousness of guilt has made them cowards they have found that the kings name is a tower of strength and have shrunk from conflicts in which the secret warnings that come from on high have told them that they were embodied in a wicked cause and contending for the attainment of wrong ends by unjustifiable means their conduct proves how easy it would have been to suppress their depredations at the earliest day by a judicious application of the power of the state and how much they have to answer for who have neglected their duty in this particular  as soon as flintyheart and his followers ascertained that the disguised and armed were actually off again and that they were not to pass the morning in a skirmish as no doubt each man among them had hoped would be the case they set up such whoops and cries as had not been heard on those meadows during the last eighty years the period went beyond the memory of man since indian warfare had existed at ravensnest a few false alarms in the revolution excepted the effect of these yells was to hasten the retreat as was quite apparent to us on the cliffs but the sagacious warriors of the prairies knew too much to expose their persons by approaching nearer to the blazing barn than might be prudent on the contrary seemingly satisfied that nothing was to be done and disdaining a parade of service where no service was to be effected they slowly retired from the meadows regaining the cliffs by means known to themselves  this military demonstration on the part of our red brethren was not without its useful consequences it gave the injins an intimation of watchfulness and of a readiness to meet them that prevented any new alarm that night and satisfied everybody at the nest that our immediate danger had come to an end not only was this the feeling of my uncle and myself but it was also the feeling of the females as we found on returning to the house who had witnessed all that passed from the upper windows after a short interview with my grandmother she consented to retire and preparations were made for setting a lookout and dismissing everybody to their beds again manytongues took charge of the watch though he laughed at the probability of there being any further disturbance that night  as for the redskins he said they would as soon sleep out under the trees at this season of the year as sleep under a roof and as for wakingcats ant their equals nonocolonel leave it all to me and ill carry you through the night as quietly as if we were on the preries and living under good wholesome prerie law  as quietly as if we were on the prairies we had then reached that pass in new york that after one burning a citizen might really hope to pass the remainder of his night as quietly as if he were on the prairies and there was that frothy lumbering useless machine called a government at albany within fifty miles of us as placid as selfsatisfied as much convinced that this was the greatest people on earth and itself their illustrious representatives as if the disturbed counties were so many gardens of eden before sin and transgression had become known to it if it was doing anything in the premises it was probably calculating the minimum the tenant should pay for the landlords land when the latter might be sufficiently worried to part with his estate perhaps it was illustrating its notions of liberty by naming the precise sum that one citizen ought to accept in order that the covetous longings of another should be satisfied  i was about to retire to my bed for the first time that night when my uncle ro remarked it might be well to see one of our prisoners at least orders had been given to unbind the wretched men and to keep them in an empty storeroom which had no available outlet but the door thither we then repaired and of course were admitted by the sentinels without a question seneca newcome was startled at my appearance and i confess i was myself embarrassed how to address him from a wish to say nothing that might appear like exultation on one side or concession on the other my uncle however had no such scruples probably from better knowing his man accordingly he came to the point at once  the evil spirit must have got great ascendency in the country seneca newcome when men of your knowledge dip so deeply into his designs said mr littlepage sternly what has my nephew ever done to incite you to come into his house as an incendiary like a thief in the night  ask me no questions mr littlepage surlily replied the attorney for i shall answer none  and this miserable misguided creature who has been your companion the last we saw of these two men hugh they were quarrelling in the highway like cat and dog and there are signs about their faces that the interview became still more hostile than it had been after we left them  and here we find them together companions in an enterprise of life and death  it is ever thus with rogues they will push their quarrels to extremities and make them up in an hour when the demon of rapine points to an object for common plunder you see the same spirit in politics ay and even in religion men that have lived in hostility for half their lives contending for selfish objects will suddenly combine their powers to attain a common end and work together like the most truehearted friends so long as they see a chance of effecting their wishes if honesty were only onehalf as active as roguery it would fare better than it does but the honest man has his scruples his selfrespect his consistency and most of all his principles to mark out his course and he cannot turn aside at each new impulse like your pure knave to convert enemies into friends and friends into enemies and you turning to josh brigham who was looking surlily onwho have actually been eating hugh littlepages bread what has he done that you should come at midnight to burn him up like a caterpillar in the spring  he has had his farm long enoughmuttered the fellowits time that poor folks had some chance  my uncle shrugged his shoulders then as if he suddenly recollected himself he lifted his hat bowed like a thoroughbred gentleman as he was when he chose to be wished seneca goodnight and walked away as we retired he expressed his conviction of the uselessness of remonstrance in this case and of the necessity of suffering the law to take its own course it might be unpleasant to see a newcome actually hanged but nothing short of that operation he felt persuaded would ever fetch up the breed in its evil courses wearied with all that had passed i now went to bed and slept soundly for the succeeding seven hours as the house was kept quiet by orders everybody repaired the lost time the nest being as quiet as in those days in which the law ruled in the republic     chapter xxiv      well may we sing her beauties       this pleasant land of ours     her sunny smiles her golden fruits       and all her world of flowers     and well would they persuade us now       in moments all too dear     that sinful though our hearts may be       we have our eden heresimms   the following day was sunday i did not rise until nine and when i withdrew the curtains and opened the shutters of my window and looked out upon the lawn and the fields beyond it and the blue void that canopied all i thought a lovelier day or one more in harmony with the tranquil character of the whole scene never shone from the heavens i threw up the sash and breathed the morning air which filled my dressingroom pregnant with the balms and odors of the hundred sweetsmelling flowers and plants that embellished the shrubberies the repose of the sabbath seemed to rest on man and beast the bees and hummingbirds that buzzed about the flowers even at their usual pursuits seemed as if conscious of the sanctity of the day i think no one can be insensible to the difference there is between a sabbath in the country and any other day of the week most of this doubtless is the simple consequence of abstaining from labor but connected with the history of the festival its usual observances and the holy calm that appears to reign around it is so very obvious and impressive that a sunday in a mild day in june is to me ever a delicious restingplace as a mere poetical pause in the bustling and turmoil of this worlds time such a day was that which succeeded the night through which we had just passed and it came most opportunely to soothe the spirits tranquillize the apprehensions and afford a moment for sober reflection  there lay the smouldering ruins of the barn it is true a blackened monument of a wicked deed but the mood which had produced this waste and wrong appeared to have passed away and in all other respects far and near the farms of ravensnest had never spread themselves before the eye in colors more in consonance with the general benevolence of a bountiful nature for a moment as i gazed on the broad view i felt all my earlier interests in it revive and am not ashamed to own that a profound feeling of gratitude to god came over me when i recollected it was by his providence i was born the heir to such a scene instead of having my lot cast among the serfs and dependents of other regions  after standing at the window a minute in contemplation of that pleasing view i drew back suddenly and painfully conscious of the character and extent of the combination that existed to rob me of my rights in it america no longer seemed america to my eyes but in place of its ancient submission to the law its quick distinction between right and wrong its sober and discriminating liberty which equally avoided submission to the injustice of power and the excesses of popular delusions there had been substituted the rapacity of the plunderer rendered formidable by the insidious manner in which it was interwoven with political machinery and the truckling of the wretches intrusted with authority men who were playing into the hands of demagogues solely in order to secure majorities to perpetuate their own influence was then the state really so corrupt as to lend itself to projects as base as those openly maintained by the antirenters far from it four men out of five if not a larger proportion must be and indeed are sensible of the ills that their success would entail on the community and would lift up heart and hand tomorrow to put them down totally and without pity but they have made themselves slaves of the lamp have enlisted in the ranks of party and dare not oppose their leaders who wield them as napoleon wielded his masses to further private views apostrophizing and affecting an homage to liberty all the while such is the history of man  when the family met in the breakfastroom a singular tranquillity prevailed among us as for my grandmother i knew her spirit and early experience and was not so much surprised to find her calm and reasonable but these qualities seemed imparted to her four young companions also patt could laugh and yield to her buoyant spirits just the same as if nothing had occurred while my uncles other wards maintained a ladylike quiet that denoted anything but apprehension mary warren however surprised me by her air and deportment there she sat in her place at the table looking if possible the most feminine gentle and timid of the four i could scarcely believe that the blushing retiring modest pretty daughter of the rector could be the prompt decided and clearheaded young girl who had been of so much service to me the past night and to whose coolness and discretion indeed we were all indebted for the roof that was over our heads and some of us most probably for our lives  notwithstanding this air of tranquillity the breakfast was a silent and thoughtful meal most of the conversation was between my uncle and grandmother and a portion of it related to the disposal of the prisoners there was no magistrate within several miles of the nest but those who were tainted with antirentism and to carry seneca and his companion before a justice of the peace of this character would be in effect to let them go at large nominal bail would be taken and it is more than probable the constable employed would have suffered a rescue did they even deem it necessary to go through this parade of performing their duties my uncle consequently adopted the following plan he had caused the two incendiaries to be transferred to the old farmhouse which happened to contain a perfectly dry and empty cellar and which had much of the security of a dungeon without the usual defects of obscurity and dampness the redmen had assumed the office of sentinels one having his station at the door while another watched near a window which admitted the light while it was scarcely large enough to permit the human body to squeeze through it the interpreter had received instructions from the agent to respect the christian sabbath and no movement being contemplated for the day this little duty just suited their lounging idle habits when in a state of rest food and water of course had not been forgotten and there my uncle ro had left that portion of the business intending to have the delinquents carried to a distant magistrate one of the judges of the county early on monday morning as for the disturbers of the past night no signs of them were any longer visible and there being little extensive cover near the nest no apprehension was felt of any surprise  we were still at breakfast when the tone of st andrews bell came floating plaintively through the air as a summons to prepare ourselves for the services of the day it was little more than a mile to the church and the younger ladies expressed a desire to walk my grandmother attended by her son therefore alone used the carriage while we young people went off in a body on foot half an hour before the ringing of the second bell considering the state of the country and the history of the past night i was astonished at my own indifference on this occasion no less than at that of my charming companions nor was it long before i gave utterance to the feeling  this america of ours is a queer place it must be admitted i cried as we crossed the lawn to take a footpath that would lead us by pleasant pastures quite to the churchdoor without entering the highway except to cross it once here we have the whole neighborhood as tranquil as if crime never disturbed it though it is not yet a dozen hours since riot arson and perhaps murder were in the contemplation of hundreds of those who live on every side of us the change is wonderful  but you will remember it is sunday hugh put in patt all summer when sunday has come we have had a respite from disturbances and fears in this part of the country the people are too religious to think of desecrating the sabbath by violence and armed bands the antirenters would lose more than they would gain by pursuing a different course  i had little or no difficulty in believing this it being no unusual thing among us to find observances of this nature clinging to the habits of thousands long after the devout feeling which had first instilled it into the race has become extinct something very like it prevails in other countries and among even higher and more intellectual classes where it is no unusual thing to find the most profound outward respect manifested toward the altar and its rites by men who live in the hourly neglect of the first and plainest commands of the decalogue we are not alone therefore in this pharisaical spirit which exists in some mode or other wherever man himself is to be found  but this equivocal piety was certainly manifested to a striking degree that day at ravensnest the very men who were almost desperate in their covetous longings appeared at church and went through the service with as much seeming devotion as if conscious of no evil and a general truce appeared to prevail in the country notwithstanding there must have been much bitterness of feeling among the discomfited nevertheless i could detect in the countenances of many of the old tenants of the family an altered expression and a coldness of the eye which bespoke anything but the ancient friendly feeling which had so long existed between us the solution was very simple demagogues had stirred up the spiritnot of the institutions butof covetousness in their breasts and so long as that evil tendency predominated there was little room for better feelings  now i shall have another look at the canopied pew i cried as we entered the last field on our way to the church that offensive but unoffending object had almost gone out of my minds eye until my uncle recollected it by intimating that jack dunning as he calls his friend and council had written him it must come down  i agree with mr dunning altogether answered martha quickly i wish with all my heart hugh you would order that hideouslooking thing to be taken away this very week  why this earnestness my dear patt there has the hideous thing been ever since the church was built which is now these threescore years and no harm has come of it as i know  it is harm to be so ugly it disfigures the church and then i do not think distinctions of that sort are proper for the house of god i know this ever has been my grandmothers opinion but finding her fatherinlaw and husband desirous of such an ornament she consented in silence during their lives  what do you say to all this miss warren i asked turning to my companion for by some secret influence i was walking at her side are you up canopy or down canopy  down canopy answered mary firmly i am of mrs littlepages opinion that churches ought to contain as little as possible to mark worldly distinctions such distinctions are inseparable from life i know but it is to prepare for death that we enter such buildings  and your father miss warrenhave you ever heard him speak of my unfortunate pew  mary hesitated an instant changed color then looked up into my face with a countenance so ingenuous and lovely that i would have forgiven her even a severe comment on some act of folly of my own  my father is an advocate for doing away with pews altogether she answered and of course can have no particular wish to preserve yours he tells me that in the churches of the romanists the congregation sit stand or kneel promiscuously before the altar or crowd around the pulpit without any distinction of rank or persons surely that is better than bringing into the very temple the most pitiful of all worldly classifications that of mere money  it is better miss warren and i wish with all my heart the custom could be adopted here but the church that might best dispense with the support obtained from pews and which by its size and architecture is best fitted to set the example of a new mode has gone on in the old way i understand and has its pews as well as another  do we get our custom from england hugh demanded martha  assuredly as we do most others good bad and indifferent the propertynotion would be very likely to prevail in a country like england and then it is not absolutely true that everybody sits in common even in the churches of the continent of the old world the seigneur under the old regime in france had his pew usually and high dignitaries of the state in no country are found mingling with the mass of worshippers unless it be in good company it is true a duchesse will kneel in the crowd in most romish churches in the towns for there are too many such persons to accommodate all with privileged seats and such honors are reserved for the very great but in the country there are commonly pews in byplaces for the great personages of the neighborhood we are not quite so bad as we fancy ourselves in this particular though we might be better  but you will allow that a canopied pew is unsuited to this country brother  not more to this than to any other i agree that it is unsuited to all places of worship where the petty differences between men which are created by their own usages should sink into insignificance in the direct presence as it might be of the power of god but in this country i find a spirit rising which some persons would call the spirit of the institutions that is forever denying men rewards and honors and credit exactly in the degree in which they deserve them the moment a citizens head is seen above the crowd of faces around him it becomes the mark of rotten eggs as if he were raised in the pillory and his fellowcreatures would not tolerate any difference in moral stature  how do you reconcile that with the great number of catos and brutuses not to say of the gracchi that are to be found among us asked mary warren slyly  oh these are the mere creatures of partygreat men for the nonce they are used to serve the purposes of factions and are begreated for the occasion thus it is that ninetenths of the catos you mention are forgotten even by name every political lustrum but let a man rise independently of the people by his own merit and see how the people will tolerate him thus it is with my pewit is a great pew and become great without any agency of the folks and the folks dont like it  the girls laughed at this sally as lighthearted happy girls will laugh at anything of the sort and patt put in her retort in her own direct spirited manner  it is a great ugly thing if that concession will flatter your vanity she said and i do entreat it may come down greatly this present week really you can have no notion hugh how much talk it has made of late  i do not doubt it my dear the talk is all aimed at the leases everything that can be thought of being dragged into the account against us poor landlords in order to render our cause unpopular and thus increase the chances of robbing us with impunity the good people of this state little imagine that the very evils that the enemies of the institutions have long predicted and which their friends have as warmly repudiated are now actively at work among us and that the great experiment is in imminent danger of failing at the very moment the people are loudly exulting in its success let this attempt on property succeed ever so indirectly and it will be followed up by others which will as inevitably drive us into despotism as a refuge against anarchy as effect succeeds to cause the danger exists now in its very worst formthat of political demagogueismand must be met face to face and put down manfully and on true principles or in my poor judgment we are gone cant is a prevailing vice of the nation more especially political and religious cant and cant can never be appeased by concessions my canopy shall stand so long as antirentism exists at ravensnest or be torn down by violence when men return to their senses and begin to see the just distinctions between meum and tuum the cook may have it for ovenwood any day in the week  as we were now about to cross the stile that communicated with the highway directly in front of the church the conversation ceased as unsuited to the place and the occasion the congregation of st andrews was small as is usually the case with country congregations of its sect which are commonly regarded with distrust by the descendants of the puritans in particular and not unfrequently with strong aversion the rowdy religionhalfcant halfblasphemythat cromwell and his associates entailed on so many englishmen but which was not without a degree of ferocious narrowminded sincerity about it after all has probably been transmitted to this country with more of its original peculiarities than exist at the present day in any other part of the world much of the narrowmindedness remains but unhappily when liberality does begin to show itself in these sects it is apt to take the character of latitudinarianism in a word the exaggerations and false principles that were so common among the religious fanatics of the american colonies in the seventeenth century which burnt witches hanged quakers and denounced all but the elect few are now running their natural race with the goal of infidelity in open view before them thus will it be also with the abuses of political liberty which must as certainly terminate in despotism unless checked in season such being not the spirit of the institutions but the tendency of human nature as connected with everything in which the right is abandoned to sustain the wrong  mr warren i found was a popular preacher notwithstanding the disfavor with which his sect was generally regarded a prejudiced and provincial people were naturally disposed to look at everything that differed from their own opinions and habits with dislike and the simple circumstance that he belonged to a church that possessed bishops was of itself tortured into a proof that his sect favored aristocracy and privileged classes it is true that nearly every other sect in the country had orders in the church under the names of ministers elders and deacons and was just as liable to the same criticism but then they did not possess bishops and having that which we do not happen to have ourselves usually constitutes the gist of an offence in cases of this sort notwithstanding these obstacles to popularity mr warren commanded the respect of all around him and strange as it may seem none the less because of all the clergy in that vicinity he alone had dared to rebuke the spirit of covetousness that was abroad and which it suits the morals of some among us to style the spirit of the institutions a duty he had discharged on more than one occasion and with great distinctness and force though temperately and under the full influence of a profound feeling of christian charity this conscientious course had given rise to menaces and anonymous letters the usual recourse of the mean and cowardly but it had also increased the weight of his character and extorted the secret deference of many who would gladly have entertained a different feeling toward him had it been in their power  my grandmother and uncle were already seated in the canopied pew when we pedestrians entered the church mary warren turned into another aisle and proceeded to the pew reserved for the rector accompanied by my sister while the other two ladies passed up to the chancel and took their customary places i followed and for the first time in my life was seated beneath the offensive canopy vested with all the rights of ownership by the term canopy however the reader is not to imagine anything like festooned draperycrimson colors and gilded laces our ambition had never soared so high the amount of the distinction between this pew and any other in the church was simply this it was larger and more convenient than those around it an advantage which any other might have equally enjoyed who saw fit to pay for it as had been the case with us and it was canopied with a heavy clumsy illshaped sort of a roof that was a perfect caricature of the celebrated baldachino of st peters in rome the first of these advantages probably excited no particular envy for it came within the common rule of the country of play and pay but as for the canopy that was aristocratic and was not to be tolerated like the leasehold tenure it was opposed to the spirit of the institutions it is true it did no real harm as an existing thing it is true it had a certain use as a memorial of past opinions and customs it is true it was property and could not be touched without interfering with its privileges it is true that every person who saw it secretly felt there was nothing after all so very inappropriate in such a pews belonging to a littlepage and most of all it was true that they who sat in it never fancied for a moment that it made them any better or any worse than the rest of their fellowcreatures there it was however and next to the feudal character of a lease it was the most offensive object then existing in ravensnest it may be questioned if the cross which occupied the place that according to provincial orthodoxy a weathercock should have adorned or mr warrens surplice was onehalf as offensive  when i raised my head after the private devotions which are customary with us semipapishes on entering a place of worship and looking around me i found that the building was crowded nearly to overflowing a second glance told me that nearly every eye was fastened on myself at first the canopy having been uppermost so lately in my mind i fancied that the looks were directed at that but i soon became satisfied that i in my own unworthy person was their object i shall not stop to relate most of the idle and silly reports that had got abroad in connection with the manner and reason of my disguised appearance in the hamlet the preceding day or in connection with anything else though one of those reports was so very characteristic and so entirely peculiar to the subject in hand that i cannot omit it that report was simply a rumor that i had caused one of my own barns to be set on fire the second night of my arrival in order to throw the odium of the act on those virtuous and hardworking husbandmen who only maintained an illegal and armed body on foot just to bully and worry me out of my property yes there i sat altogether unconscious of the honor done me regarded by quite half that congregation as the respected and justminded youth who had devised and carried out precisely such a rascally scheme now no one who has not had the opportunity to compare can form any idea how much more potent and formidable is the american folks say than the vulgar reports of any other state of society the french on dit is a poor pitiful report placed by the side of this vast lever which like that of archimedes only wants a stand for its fulcrum to move the world the american folks say has a certain omnipotence so long as it lasts which arises from not the spirit but the character of the institutions themselves in a country in which the people rule folks are resolved that their say shall not pass for nothing so few doubt the justice of the popular decision that holy writ itself has not in practical effect onehalf the power that really belongs to one of these reports so long as it suits the common mind to entertain it few dare resist it fewer still call in question its accuracy though in sober truth it is hardly ever right it makes and unmakes reputation for the time being bien entendu it even makes and unmakes patriots themselves in short though never quite truth and not often very much like the truth paradoxical as it may appear it is truth and nothing but the truth pro hac vice everybody knows nevertheless that there is no permanency to what folks say about anything and that folks frequently nay almost invariably unsay what has been said six months before yet all submit to the authority of its dicta so long as folks choose to say the only exception to this rule and it merely proves it is in the case of political parties when there are always two folks say which flatly contradict each other and sometimes there are halfadozen no two of which are ever precisely alike  there i sat as i afterward learned the observed of all observers merely because it suited the purposes of those who wished to get away my estate to raise various reports to my prejudicenot one of which i am happy to have it in my power to say was in any manner true the first good look that i took at the congregation satisfied me that very much the larger part of it consisted of those who did not belong to st andrews church curiosity or some worse feeling had trebled the number of mr warrens hearers that dayor it might be more correct to say of my observers  there was no other interruption to the services than that which was produced by the awkwardness of so many who were strangers to the ritual the habitual respect paid to religious rites kept every one in order and in the midst of a feeling that was as malignant and selfish as well could exist under circumstances of so little provocation i was safe from violence and even from insult as for myself little was or could be known of my character and propensities at ravensnest school college and travelling with winter residences in town had made me a sort of stranger in my own domain and i was regarded through the covenants of my leases rather than through any known facts the same was true though in a less degree with my uncle who had lived so much abroad as to be considered a sort of half foreigner and one who preferred other countries to his own this is an offence that is rarely forgiven by the masses in america though it is probably the most venial sin that one who has had the opportunities of comparing can commit old nations offer so many more inducements than young nations to tempt men of leisure and cultivation to reside in them that it is not surprising the travelled american should prefer europe to his own quarter of the world but the jealousy of a provincial people is not apt to forgive this preference for myself i have heard it said and i believe it to be true to a certain extent that countries on the decline supposing them to have been once at the summit of civilization make pleasanter abodes for the idler than nations on the advance this is one of the reasons why italy attracts so many more visitors than england though climate must pass for something in such a comparison but these long absences and supposed preferences for foreign life had made my uncle ro in one sense unpopular with the mass which has been taught to believe by means of interested and fulsome eulogies on their own state of society that it implies something more than a want of taste almost a want of principle to prefer any other this want of popularity however was a good deal relieved by a wide and deep conviction of my uncles probity as well as of his liberality his purse having no more string to it than general harrisons door was thought to have a latch but the case was very different with my grandmother the early part of her life had been spent at the nest and it was impossible so excellent a woman could be anything but respected she had in truth been a sore impediment with the antirenters more especially in carrying out that part of their schemes which is connected with traduction and its legitimate offspring prejudice it would hardly do to traduce this nobleminded charitable spirited and just woman yet hazardous as the experiment must and did seem it was attempted and not altogether without success she was accused of an aristocratic preference of her own family to the families of other people patt and i it was urged were only her grandchildren and had ample provision made for us in other estates besides thisand a woman of mrs littlepages time of life it was said who had one foot in the grave ought to have too much general philanthropy to give a preference to the interests of mere grandchildren over the interests of the children of men who had paid her husband and sons rent now for quite sixty years this attack had come from the pulpit too or the top of a molasses hogshead which was made a substitute for a pulpit by an itinerant preacher who had taken a bit of jobwork in which the promulgation of the tenets of the gospel and those of antirentism was the great end in view  as i have said my good grandmother suffered somewhat in public estimation in consequence of this assault it is true had any one openly charged the circulators of this silly calumny with their offence they would have stoutly denied it but it was none the less certain that this charge among a hundred others varying from it only in degree and not at all in character was industriously circulated in order to render the littlepages unpopular unpopularity being among us the sin that is apt to entail all the evil consequences of every other offence  the reader who is not acquainted with the interior of our social habits must not suppose that i am coloring for effect so far from this i am quite conscious of having kept the tone of the picture down it being an undeniable truth that nothing of much interest nowadays is left to the simple decision of principles and laws in this part of the country at least the supremacy of numbers is so great that scarce a private suit of magnitude is committed to a jury without attempts more or less direct to influence the common mind in favor of one side or the other in the hope that the jurors will be induced to think as the majority thinks in europe it is known that judges were nay are visited and solicited by the parties but here it is the public that must be treated in the same way i am far from wishing to blazon the defects of my own country and i know from observation that corresponding evils differing in their exterior aspects and in their mode of acting exist elsewhere but these are the forms in which some of our defects present themselves and he is neither a friend to his country nor an honest man who wishes them to be bundled up and cloaked instead of being exposed understood and corrected this notion of nil nisi bene has done an infinite degree of harm to the country and through the country to freedom  i do not think the worship of the temple amounted to any great matter that day in st andrews church ravensnest quite half the congregation was blundering through the liturgy and every man who lost his place in the prayerbook or who could not find it at all seemed to fancy it was quite sufficient for the ritual of us semipapists if he kept his eye on me and my canopied pew how many pharisees were present who actually believed that i had caused my own barn to be burned in order to throw opprobrium on the virtuous honest and hardworking tenants and who gave credit to the stories affecting my title and all the rest of the stuff that calculating cupidity had set afloat in the country i have no way of knowing but subsequent circumstances have given me reason to suppose they were not a few a great many men left the house of god that morning i make no doubt whose whole souls were wrapped up in effecting an act of the grossest injustice professing to themselves to thank god that they were not as wicked as the being whom they desired to injure  i stopped to say a word to mr warren in the vestryroom after the people were dismissed for he had not passed the night with us at the nest though his daughter had after we had said a word about the occurrence of the morning the good rector having heard a rumor of the arrest of certain incendiaries without knowing who they were i made a more general remark or two previously to quitting the place  your congregation was unusually large this morning sir i said smiling though not altogether as attentive as it might have been  i owe it to your return mr littlepage aided by the events of the past day or two at one moment i was afraid that some secret project was on foot and that the day and place might be desecrated by some scene of disgraceful violence all has gone off well in that respect however and i trust that no harm will come of this crowd we americans have a respect for sacred things which will ordinarily protect the temple  did you then think st andrews ran any risk today sir  mr warren colored a little and he hesitated an instant before he answered  you doubtless know young sir he said the nature of the feeling that is now abroad in the country with a view to obtain its ends antirentism drags every auxiliary it can find into its ranks and among other things it has assailed your canopied pew i own that at first i apprehended some assault might be contemplated on that  let it come sir the pew shall be altered on a general and right principle but not until it is let alone by envy malice and covetousness it would be worse to make a concession to these than to let the pew stand another half century  with these words in my mouth i took my leave hastening on to overtake the girls in the fields     chapter xxv      there is a pure republicwild yet strong       a fierce democracie where all are true     to what themselves have votedright or wrong       and to their laws denominated blue     if red they might to dracos code belonghalleck   such was my haste in quitting the church that i did not turn to the right or the left i saw the light but wellrounded form of mary warren loitering along with the rest of the party seemingly in waiting for me to join them and crossing the road i sprang upon the stile and thence to the ground coming up with the girls at the next instant  what is the meaning of the crowd hugh asked my sister pointing down the road with the stick of her parasol as she put the question  crowd i have seen no crowd everybody had left the church before i quitted it and all has gone off peaceably ha sure enough that does look like a crowd yonder in the highway it seems an organized meeting by george yes there is the chairman seated on the upper rail of the fence and the fellow with a bit of paper in his hand is doubtless the secretary very american and regular all that some vile project is hatching ill answer for it under the aspect of an expression of public opinion see there is a chap speaking and gesticulating manfully  we all stopped for a moment and stood looking at the crowd which really had all the signs of a public meeting about it there it had been the girls told me ever since they had quitted the church and seemingly engaged much as it was at that moment the spectacle was curious and the day being fine while time did not press we lingered in the fields occasionally stopping to look behind us and note what was passing on in the highway  in this manner we might have walked half the distance to the nest when on turning to take another look we perceived that the crowd had dispersed some driving off in the everrecurring onehorse wagon some on horseback and others on foot three men however were walking fast in our direction as if desirous of overtaking us they had already crossed the stile and were on the path in the field a route rarely or never taken by any but those who desired to come to the house under the circumstances i determined at once to stop and wait for them first feeling in my pocket and making sure of the revolver which is getting to be an important weapon now that private battles are fought not only yardarm and yardarm but by regular broadsides starboard and larboard i intimated my intention to the girls  as these men are evidently coming in quest of me i remarked it may be as well ladies for you to continue your walk toward home while i wait for them on this stile  very true answered patt they can have little to say that we shall wish to hear and you will soon overtake us remember we dine at two on sundays hugh the evening service commencing at four in this month  no no said mary warren hurriedly we ought not cannot quit mr littlepage these men may do him some harm  i was delighted with this simple natural manifestation of interest as well as with the air of decision with which it was made mary herself colored at her own interest but did not the less maintain the ground she had taken  why of what use can we be to hugh dear even admitting what you say to be true answered patt it were better for us to hurry on to the house and send those here who can assist him in such a case than stand by idle and useless  as if profiting by this hint miss coldbrooke and miss marston who were already some little distance in advance went off almost on a run doubtless intending to put my sisters project into execution but mary warren stood firm and patt would not desert her friend whatever might have been her disposition to treat me with less consideration  it is true we may not be able to assist mr littlepage should violence be attempted the first remarked but violence is perhaps what is least to be apprehended these wretched people so little regard truth and they will be three to one if your brother be left alone that it is better we stay and hear what is said in order that we may assert what the facts really were should these persons see fit to pervert them as too often happens  both patt and myself were struck with the prudence and sagacity of this suggestion and the former now came quite near to the stile on which i was still standing with an air as steady and resolute as that of mary warren herself just then the three men approached two of them i knew by name though scarcely in person while the third was a total stranger the two of whom i had some knowledge were named bunce and mowatt and were both tenants of my own and as i have since learned warm antirenters the stranger was a travelling demagogue who had been at the bottom of the whole affair connected with the late meeting and who had made his two companions his tools the three came up to the stile with an air of great importance nor could the dignity of their demeanor have been greater had they been ambassadors extraordinary from the emperor of china  mr littlepage commenced mr bunce with a particularly important physiognomy there has been a meeting of the public this morning at which these resolutions was passed we have been appointed a committee to deliver a copy of them to you and our duty is now performed by handing you this paper  not unless i see fit to accept it i presume sir was my answer  i should think no man in a free country would refuse to receive a set of resolutions that has been passed by a meeting of his fellowcitizens  that might depend on circumstances the character of the resolutions in particular the freedom of the country it is precisely which gives one man the same right to say he cares nothing about your resolutions as it does you to pass them  but you have not looked at the resolutions sir and until you do you cannot know how you may like them  that is very true but i have looked at their bearers have seen their manner and do not quite like the assumption of power which says any body of men can send me resolutions whether i like to receive them or not  this declaration seemed to strike the committee aghast the idea that one man should hesitate to submit himself to a yoke imposed by a hundred was so new and inconceivable to those who deem majorities all in all that they hardly knew how to take it29 at first there was an obvious disposition to resent the insult then came reflection which probably told them that such a course might not prove so well the whole terminating in the more philosophical determination of getting along easily  footnote 29 the prevalence of the notion of the omnipotence of majorities in america is so widespread and deep among the people in general as to form a distinctive trait in the national character it is doing an infinity of mischief by being mistaken for the governing principle of the institutions when in fact it is merely a necessary expedient to decide certain questions which must be decided by somebody and in some mode or other kept in its proper sphere the use of majorities is replete with justice so far as justice can be exercised among men abused it opens the highway to the most intolerable tyranny as a matter of course the errors connected with this subject vary through all the gradations of intellect and selfishness the following anecdote will give the reader some notion how the feeling impressed a stranger shortly after his arrival in this country  a year or two since the writer had in his service an irishman who had been only two years in the country it was a part of this mans duty to look after the welfare of certain pigs of which one occupied the position of a runt has your honor looked at the pigs lately said the honest fellow one day no not lately pat is there any change that there is indeed sir and a great change the little fellow is getting the majority of the rest and will make the best hog of em alleditor  am i to understand mr littlepage that you refuse to accept the resolutions of a public meeting  yes of half a dozen public meetings put together if those resolutions are offensive or are offered offensively  as to the resolutions you can know nothing having never seen them of the right of any number of the people to pass such resolutions as they may think proper i presume there can be no question  of that right sir there is a very great question as has been settled within the last few years in our own courts but even if the right existed and in as broad a way as you seem to think it would not form a right to force these resolutions on me  i am then to tell the people you refuse even to read their resolutions squire littlepage  you can tell them what you please sir i know of no people except in a legal sense and under the limited powers that they exercise by law as for this new power which is rising up in the country and has the impudence to call itself the people though composed of little knots of men got together by management and practised on by falsehood it has neither my respect nor dread and as i hold it in contempt i shall treat it with contempt whenever it comes in my way  i am then to tell the people of ravensnest you hold them in contempt sir  i authorize you tell the people of ravensnest nothing as coming from me for i do not know that the people of ravensnest have employed you if you will ask me respectfully as if you were soliciting a favor instead of demanding a right to read the contents of the paper you hold in your hand i may be willing to comply what i object to is a handful of men getting together setting themselves up as the people pretending to authority in that capacity and claiming a right to force their notions on other folks  the three committeemen now drew back a few paces and consulted together apart for two or three minutes while they were thus employed i heard the sweet gentle voice of mary warren say at my elbowtake their resolutions mr littlepage and get rid of them i dare say they are very silly but you will get rid of them all the sooner by receiving the paper this was womans advice which is a little apt to err on the side of concession when her apprehensions are aroused but i was spared the pain of not complying with it by the altered tone of the trio who now came up to the stile again having apparently come to a final decision in the premises  mr hugh roger littlepage junior said bunce in a solemn voice and in a manner as precise as if he were making some legal tender that was of the last importance and which required set phrases i now ask you in a most respectful manner if you will consent to receive this paper it contains certain resolutions passed with great unanimity by the people of ravensnest and which may be found to affect you i am directed respectfully to ask you if you will accept this copy of the said resolutions  i cut the rest of the speech short by receiving the proffered paper and i thought all three of the worthy ambassadors looked disappointed at my having done so this gave a new turn to my ideas and had they now demanded their resolutions back again they should not have had them so long as the revolvers could do their duty for a moment i do believe bunce was for trying the experiment he and his companions would have been delighted to have it in their power to run up and down the country crying out that the aristocratlandlord young littlepage held the people in contempt and had refused even to accept the resolutions they had deigned in their majesty to pass as it was however i had sufficiently rebuked the presumption of these pretenders to liberty avoided all the consequences of their clamor in that behalf and had an opportunity to gratify a curiosity to know what the leaders of the meeting had been about and to read their resolutions i say the leaders of the meeting for it is very certain the meetings themselves on all such occasions have no more to do with the forming or entertaining the opinions that are thus expressed than if they had been in kamtschatka the whole time folding the paper therefore and putting it in my pocket i bowed to the committee saying as i descended the stile on the other side of the fence  it is well gentlemen if the resolutions require any notice theyll be sure to receive it public meetings held of a sunday are so unusual in this part of the world that this may have interest with that small portion of the state which does not dwell at ravensnest  i thought the committee was a little abashed but the stranger or the travelling demagogue caught at my words and answered as i walked away in company with patt and mary warren  the better day the better deed the matter related to the sabbath and no time so suitable as the sabbath to act on it  i will own i was dying of curiosity to read the resolutions but dignity prevented any such thing until we had reached a spot where the path led through a copse that concealed us from observation once under that cover however i eagerly drew out the paper the two girls drawing near to listen with as lively an interest as that i felt myself in the result  here you may see at a glance i cried shaking open the folds of the paper the manner in which the people so often pass their resolutions all this writing has a very schoolmaster air and has been done with care and a deliberation whereas there was certainly no opportunity to make a copy as fair as this of anything out in the highway where the meeting was actually held this proves that matters had been cut and dried for the sovereign people who like other monarchs are saved a great deal of trouble by their confidential servants  i dare say said patt two or three men down at the village prepared everything and then brought their work up to the meeting to be read and approved and to go forth as public sentiment  if it were only honesty approved by even those who heard it read it would be another matter but twothirds of every meeting are nothing but doughfaces that are moulded to look whichever way the skilful manager may choose but let us see what these notable resolutions are we may like them possibly after having read them  it is so extraordinary to have a public meeting of a sunday in this part of the world  i now set about reading the contents of the paper which at a glance i saw had been very carefully prepared for publication and no doubt would soon figure in some of the journals fortunately this business has been so much overdone and so many meetings are held that flatly contradict each other though all represent public sentiment fire is made so effectually to fight fire that the whole procedure is falling into contempt and the public is actually losing the great advantage which under a more temperate use of its power it might possess by making known from time to time as serious occasions offered its true opinions and wishes as things actually are every man of intelligence is fully aware that simulated public opinions are much the most noisy and active in the country and he regards nothing of the sort of which he hears or reads unless he happen to know something of the authority it is the same with the newspaper press generally into such deep discredit has it fallen that not only is its power to do evil much curtailed but it has nearly lost all power to do good for by indulging in licentiousness and running into the habit of crying wolf nobody is disposed to believe were the beast actually committing its ravages in the flocks of the nation there are but two ways for a man to regain a position from which he has departed the one is by manfully retracing his steps and the other is by making a circuit so complete that all who choose to watch him may see and understand all sides of him and estimate him accordingly the last is likely to be the career of demagogueism and the press both of which have already gone so far as to render retreat next to impossible and who can only regain any portion of public confidence by being satisfied with completing their circuit and falling in the rear of the nation content to follow those whom it has been their craving ambition to lead  at a meeting of the citizens of ravensnest i began to read aloud spontaneously convened june 22d 1845 in the public highway after attending divine service in the episcopal meetinghouse according to the forms of the established denomination of england on the church and state system onesiphoras hayden esquire was called to the chair and pulaski todd esquire was appointed secretary after a luminous and eloquent exposition of the objects of the meeting and some most pungent strictures on aristocracy and the rights of man from demosthenes hewlett and john smith esquires the following expression of public sentiment was sustained by an undivided unanimityresolved that a temperate expression of public opinion is useful to the rights of freemen and is one of the most precious privileges of freedom as the last has been transmitted to us in a free country by our ancestors who fought and bled for free and equal institutions on free and equal grounds  resolved that we prize this privilege and shall ever watch over its exercise with vigilance the price of liberty  resolved that as all men are equal in the eyes of the law so are they much more so in the eyes of god  resolved that meetinghouses are places constructed for the convenience of the people and that nothing ought to be admitted into them that is opposed to public sentiment or which can possibly offend it  resolved that in our judgment the seat that is good enough for one man is good enough for another that we know no differences in families and races and that pews ought to be constructed on the principles of equality as well as laws  resolved that canopies are royal distinctions and quite unsuited to republicans and most of all to republican meetinghouses  resolved that religion should be adapted to the institutions of a country and that a republican form of government is entitled to a republican form of religion and that we do not see the principles of freedom in privileged seats in the house of god  that resolution has been got up as a commentary on what has been circulated so much of late in the newspapers cried mary warren quickly in which it has been advanced as a recommendation of certain sects that their dogmas and churchgovernment are more in harmony with republicanism than certain others our own church included  one would think i answered if this conformity be a recommendation that it would be the duty of men to make their institutions conform to the church instead of the churchs conforming to the institutions  yes but it is not the fashion to reason in this way nowadays prejudice is just as much appealed to in matters connected with religion as with anything else  resolved i continued to read that in placing a canopy over his pew in st andrews meetinghouse ravensnest general cornelius littlepage conformed to the spirit of a past age rather than to the spirit of the present time and that we regard its continuance there as an aristocratical assumption of a superiority that is opposed to the character of the government offensive to liberty and dangerous as an example  really that is too bad exclaimed patt vexed at heart even while she laughed at the outrageous silliness of the resolutions and all connected with them dear liberalminded grandpapa who fought and bled for that very liberty about which these people cant so much and who was actively concerned in framing the very institutions that they do not understand and are constantly violating is accused to being false to what were notoriously his own principles  never mind that my dear there only remain three more resolutions let us hear them resolved that we see an obvious connection between crowned heads patents of nobility canopied pews personal distinctions leasehold tenures landlords days works fat fowls quartersales threelives leases and rent  resolved that we are of opinion that when the owners of barns wish them destroyed for any purpose whatever there is a mode less alarming to a neighborhood than by setting them on fire and thus giving rise to a thousand reports and accusations that are wanting in the great merit of truth  resolved that a fair draft be made of these resolutions and a copy of them delivered to one hugh roger littlepage a citizen of ravensnest in the county of washington and that peter bunce esq john mowatt esq and hezekiah trott esq be a commitee to see that this act be performed  whereupon the meeting adjourned sine die onesiphoras hayden chairman pulaski todd secretary  wheeew i whistled heres gunpowder enough for another waterloo  what means that last resolution mr littlepage asked mary warren anxiously that about the barn  sure enough there is a latent meaning there which has its sting can the scoundrels intend to insinuate that i caused that barn to be set on fire  if they should it is scarcely more than they have attempted to do with every landlord they have endeavored to rob said patt with spirit calumny seems a natural weapon of those who get their power by appealing to numbers  that is natural enough my dear sister since prejudice and passion are quite as active agents as reasons and facts in the common mind but this is a slander that shall be looked to if i find that these men really wish to circulate a report that i caused my own barn to be set on firepshaw nonsense after all have we not newcome and that other rascal in confinement at this moment for attempting to set fire to my house  be not too confident mr littlepage said mary with an anxiety so pointed that i could not but feel its flatterymy dear father tells me he has lost most of his confidence in innocence except as one above all weaknesses shall be the judge this very story may be got up expressly to throw distrust on your accusations against the two incendiaries you have taken in the act remember how much of the facts will depend on your own testimony  i shall have you to sustain me miss warren and the juror is not living who would hesitate to believe that to which you will testify but here we are approaching the house we will talk no more on the subject lest it distress my grandmother  we found all quiet at the nest no report of any sort having come from the redmen sunday was like any other day to them with the exception that they so far deferred to our habits as to respect it to a certain extent while in our presence some writers have imagined that the aborigines of america are of the lost tribes of israel but it seems to me that such a people could never have existed apart uninfluenced by foreign association and preserved no tradition no memorial of the jewish sabbath let this be as it may john who met us at the door which we reached just after my uncle and grandmother reported all quiet so far as he knew anything of the state of the farmbuildings  they got enough last night ise thinking mr hugh and has found out by this time that its better to light a fire in one of their own cookstoves than come to light it on the floor of a gentlemans kitchen i never heard it said sir that the hamericans was as much hirish as they be henglish but to me they seems to grow every day more like the wild hirishers of whom we used to hear so much in lunun your honored father sir would never have believed that his own dwelling would be entered at night by men who are his very neighbors and who act like burglariouses as if they were so many newgate birdsno why mr hugh this squire newcome as they call him is an hattorney and has often dined here at the nest i have anded him his soup and fish and wine fifty times just as if he was a gentleman and to his sister miss hopportunity too and they to come to set fire to the house at midnight  you do miss opportunity injustice john for she has not had the least connection with the matter  well sir nobody knows anything nowadayi declare my eyes be getting weak or there is the young lady at this very instant  young lady whereyou do not mean opportunity newcome surely  i does though sir and its she sure enough if that isnt miss hopportunity the prisoner that the savages has got up in the cellar of the old farmhouse isnt her brother  john was quite right there was opportunity standing in the very path and at the very spot where i had last seen her disappear from my sight the past night that spot was just where the path plunged into the wooded ravine and so far was her person concealed by the descent that we could only perceive the head and the upper part of the body the girl had shown herself just that much in order to attract my attention in which she had no sooner succeeded than by moving downward a few paces she was entirely hid from sight cautioning john to say nothing of what had passed i sprang down the steps and walked in the direction of the ravine perfectly satisfied i was expected and far from certain that this visit did not portend further evil  the distance was so short that i was soon at the verge of the ravine but when i reached it opportunity had disappeared owing to the thicket her concealment was easily obtained while she might be within a few yards from me and i plunged downward bent only on ascertaining her object one gleam of distrust shot across my mind i will own as i strided down the declivity but it was soon lost in the expectation and curiosity that were awakened by the appearance of the girl  i believe it has already been explained that in this part of the lawn a deep narrow ravine had been left in wood and that the bridlepath that leads to the hamlet had been carried directly through it for effect this patch of wood may be three or four acres in extent following the course of the ravine until it reaches the meadows and it contains three or four rustic seats intended to be used in the warmer months as opportunity was accustomed to all the windings and turnings of the place she had posted herself near one of these seats which stood in a dense thicket but so near the main path as to enable her to let me know where she was to be found by a low utterance of my name as my tread announced my approach springing up the bypath i was at her side in an instant i do believe that now she had so far succeeded the girl sunk upon the seat from inability to stand  oh mr hugh she exclaimed looking at me with a degree of nature and concern in her countenance that it was not usual to see theresenmy poor brother senwhat have i donewhat have i done  will you answer me one or two questions miss opportunity with frankness under the pledge that the replies never shall be used to injure you or yours this is a very serious affair and should be treated with perfect frankness  i will answer anything to youany question you can put me though i might blush to do sobut laying her hand familiarly not to say tenderly on my armwhy should we be mr hugh and miss opportunity to each other when we were so long hugh and op call me op again and i shall feel that the credit of my family and the happiness of my poor sen are after all in the keeping of a true friend  no one can be more willing to do this than myself my dear op and i am willing to be hugh again but you know all that has passed  i doyes the dreadful news has reached us and mother wouldnt leave me a moments peace till i stole out again to see you  again was your mother then acquainted with the visit of last night  yes yesshe knew it all and advised it all  your mother is a most thoughtful and prudent parent i answered biting my lip and i shall know hereafter how much i am indebted to her to you opportunity i owe the preservation of my house and possibly the lives of all who are most dear to me  well thats something any how theres no grief that hasnt its relief but you must know hugh that i never could or did suppose that sen himself would be so weak as to come in his own person on such an errand i didnt want telling to understand that in antirent times fire and sword are the lawbut take him in general sen is altogether prudent and cautious id a bit my tongue off before id got my own brother into so cruel a scrape no nodont think so ill of me as to suppose i came to tell of sen  it is enough for me that i know how much trouble you took to warn me of danger it is unnecessary for me to think of you in any other light than that of a friend  ah hugh how happy and merry we all of us used to be a few years since that was before your miss coldbrookes and miss marstons and mary warrens ever saw the country then we did enjoy ourselves and i hope such times will return if miss martha would only stick to old friends instead of running after new ones ravensnest would be ravensnest again  you are not to censure my sister for loving her own closest associates best she is several years our junior you will remember and was scarcely of an age to be our companion six years ago  opportunity had the grace to color a little for she had only used patt as a cloak to make her assaults on me and she knew as well as i did that my sister was good seven years younger than herself this feeling however was but momentary and she next turned to the real object of this visit  what am i to tell mother hugh you will let sen off i know  i reflected for the first time on the hardships of the case but felt a strong reluctance to allow incendiaries to escape  the facts must be known soon all over the town i remarked  no fear of that they are pretty much known already news does fly fast at ravensnest all must admit  ay if it would only fly true but your brother can hardly remain here after such an occurrence  lord how you talk if the law will only let him alone whod trouble him for this you havent been home long enough to learn that folks dont think half as much of setting fire to a house in antirent times as theyd think of a trespass under the oldfashioned law antirent alters the whole spirit  how true was this and we have lads among us who have passed from their tenth to their eighteenth and twentieth years in a condition of society that is almost hopelessly abandoned to the most corrupting influence of all the temptations that beset human beings it is not surprising that men begin to regard arson as a venial offence when the moral feeling of the community is thus unhinged and boys are suffered to grow into manhood in the midst of notions so fatal to everything that is just and safe  but the law itself will not be quite as complaisant as the folks it will scarcely allow incendiaries to escape and your brother would be compelled to flee the land  what of that how many go off and stay off for a time and thats better than going up north to work at the new prison im not a bit afraid of sens being hanged for these ant hanging times in this country but it is some disgrace to a family to have a member in the states prison as for any punishment that is lasting you can see how it is as well as i thereve been men murdered about antirentism but lord the senators and assemblymen will raise such a rumpus if you go to punish them that it wont be long if things go on as they have before it will be thought more honorable to be put in jail for shooting a peaceofficer than to stay out of it for not having done it talks all and if folks have a mind to make anything honorable theyve only to say so often enough to make it out  such were the notions of miss opportunity newcome on the subject of modern morals and how far was she from the truth i could not but smile at the manner in which she treated things though there was a homely and practical common sense in her way of thinking that was probably of more efficiency than would have been the case with a more refined and nicer code she looked at things as they are and that is always something toward success  as for myself i was well enough disposed to consider opportunity in this unfortunate affair of the fire for it would have been a cruel thing to suffer the girl to imagine she had been an instrument in destroying her brother it is true there is no great danger of a rogues being hanged nowadays and seneca was not sufficiently a gentleman though very tenacious of the title to endanger his neck had he been a landlord and caught lighting a fire on the kitchenfloor of one of the tenants the state would not grow hemp enough for his execution but it was a very different thing to catch a tenant at that work i could not but ask myself how many of the honorable gentlemen at albany would interfere in my behalf had matters been reversed for this is the true mode of arriving at the spirit of the institutions or rather i have just as good a right to affirm such is their spirit as any one has to assert that the leasehold tenure is opposed to them the laws and institutions themselves being equally antagonist to both  the results of the interview i had with opportunity were firstly i kept my heart just where it was at its commencement though i am not certain that it was in my own custody secondly the young lady left me much encouraged on the subject of the credit of the newcomes though i took very good care not to put myself in her power by promising to compromise felony thirdly i invited the sister to come openly to the nest that evening as one of the means to be employed in attaining her endsas respects seneca be it remembered not as respects me and lastly we parted just as good friends as we ever had been and entertaining exactly the same views as regards each other what those views were it may not be modest in me to record     chapter xxvi       if men desire the rights of property they must take their      consequences distinction in social classes without the rights      of property civilization can hardly exist while the highest      class of improvements is probably the result of the very social      distinctions that so many decry the great political problem to      be solved is to ascertain if the social distinctions that are      inseparable from civilization can really exist with perfect      equality in political rights we are of opinion they can and      as much condemn him who vainly contends for a visionary and      impracticable social equality as we do him who would deny to      men equal opportunities for advancementpolitical essay   my interview with opportunity newcome remained a secret between those who first knew of it the evening service in st andrews was attended only by the usual congregation all the curiosity of the multitude seeming to have been allayed by the visit in the morning the remainder of the day passed as usual and after enjoying a pleasant eventide and the earlier hours of the night in the company of the girls i retired early to bed and slept profoundly until morning my uncle ro partook of my own philosophical temper and we encouraged each other in it by a short conversation that occurred in his room before we respectively retired to rest  i agree with you hugh said my uncle in reply to a remark of my own there is little use in making ourselves unhappy about evils that we cannot help if we are to be burnt up and stripped of our property we shall be burnt up and stripped of our property i have a competency secured in europe and we can all live on that with economy should the worst come to the worst  it is a strange thing to hear an american talk of seeking a refuge of any sort in the old world  if matters proceed in the lively manner they have for the last ten years youll hear of it often hitherto the rich of europe have been in the habit of laying by a penny in america against an evil day but the time will soon come unless there is a great change when the rich of america will return the compliment in kind we are worse off than if we were in a state of nature in many respects having our hands tied by the responsibility that belongs to our position and means while those who choose to assail us are under a mere nominal restraint they make the magistrates who are altogether in their interests and they elect the sheriffs who are to see the laws executed the theory is that the people are sufficiently virtuous to perform all these duties well but no provision has been made for the case in which the people themselves happen to go astray en masse  we have our governors and masters at albany sir  yes we have our governors and servants at albany and there they are there has not been the time probably since this infernal spirit first had its rise among us that a clear manly energetic and wellprincipled proclamation alone issued by the governor of this state would not have aroused all the better feelings of the community and put this thing down but small as would have been that tribute to the right it has never been paid and until we drop doubledistilled patriots and have recourse again to the oldfashioned highprincipled gentlemen for offices of mark it never will be done heaven preserve me from extravirtuous patriotic and enlightened citizens no good ever comes of them  i believe the wisest way sir is to make up our minds that we have reached the point of reaction in the institutions and be ready to submit to the worst i keep the revolver well primed and hope to escape being burnt up at least  after a little more such discourse we parted and sought our pillows and i can say that i never slept more soundly in my life if i did lose my estate it was what other men had suffered and survived and why might not i as well as another it is true those other men were in the main the victims of what are called tyrants but others again had certainly been wronged by the masses thousands have been impoverished in france for instance by the political confiscations of the multitude and thousands enriched by illgotten gains profiting by the calamities of those around them and what has happened there might happen here big words ought to pass for nothing no man was ever a whit more free because he was the whole time boasting of his liberty and i was not now to learn that when numbers did inflict a wrong it was always of the most intolerable character ordinarily they were not much disposed to this species of crime but men in masses were no more infallible than individuals in this philosophic mood i slept  i was awoke next morning by johns appearing at my bedside after having opened the shutter of my window  i declare to you mr hugh began this wellmeaning but sometimes officious servant i dont know what will come next at ravensnest now the evil spirit has got uppermost among the inhabitants  tut tut johnwhat you call the evil spirit is only the spirit of the institutions and is to be honored instead of disliked  well sir i dont know what they calls it for they talks so much about the hinstitutions in this country i never can find out what they would be at there was a hinstitution near where i lived in my last place at the west end in lunon and there they taught young masters to speak and write latin and greek but hinstitutions in hamerica must mean something for them as doesnt know any more latin than i do seems to be quite hintimate with these hamerican hinstitutions but mr hugh would you could you believe the people committed parricide last night  i am not at all surprised at it for to me they have seemed to be bent on matricide for some time calling the country their mother  its hawful sirits truly hawful when a whole people commits such a crime as parricide i knowd you would be shocked to hear it mr hugh and so i just came in to let you know it  i am infinitely obliged to you for this attention my good fellow and shall be still more so when you tell me all about it  yes sir most willingly and most unwillingly too but theres no use in iding the fact its gone mr hugh  what is gone john speak out my good fellow i can bear it  the pew siror rather that beautiful canopy that covered it and made it look so much like the lord mayors seat in guildhall i ave hadmired and honored that canopy sir as the most helegant hobject in this country sir  so they have destroyed it at last have they encouraged and sustained by an expression of public sentiment as proclaimed in a meeting that had a chairman and secretary they have actually cut it down i suppose  they have sir and a pretty job theyve made of it there it stands up at millers hover his pigpen  this was not a very heroic termination of the career of the obnoxious canopy but it was one that made me laugh heartily john was a little offended at this levity and he soon left me to finish my toilet myself i dare say many of the honest folk of ravensnest would have been as much surprised as john himself at the indifference i manifested at the fate of this dignified pew but certainly so far as my own social elevation or social depression was concerned i cared nothing about it it left me just where i wasneither greater nor otherwise and as for any monuments to let the world know who my predecessors had been or who i was at that moment the country itself or the part of it in which we dwelt was sufficient its history must be forgotten or changed before our position could be mistaken though i dare say the time will come when some extremely sublimated friend of equality will wish to extinguish all the lights of the past in order that there may not exist that very offensive distinction of one mans name being illustrated while another mans name is not the pride of family is justly deemed the most offensive of all pride since a man may value himself on a possession to which he has not the smallest claim in the way of personal merit while those of the highest personal claims are altogether deprived of an advantage to the enjoyment of which ancestors alone have created the right now the institutions both in their letter and their spirit do favor justice in this particular as far as they can though even they are obliged to sustain one of the most potent agents to such distinctions by declaring through the laws that the child shall succeed to the estate of the father when we shall get everything straight and as it ought to be in this progressive country heaven only knows for i find my tenants laying stress on the fact that their fathers have leased my lands for generations while they are quite willing to forget that my fathers were the lessors all the while  i found all four of the girls on the piazza breathing the air of as balmy a summer morning as a bountiful nature ever bestowed they had heard of the fate of the canopy which affected them differently and somewhat according to temperament henrietta coldbrooke laughed at it violently and in a way i did not like your laughing young lady rarely having much beyond merriment in her i make all allowance for youthful spirits and a natural disposition to turn things into fun but it was too much to laugh at this exploit of the antirenters for quite half an hour together i liked anne marstons manner of regarding it better she smiled a good deal and laughed just enough to show that she was not insensible to the effect of an absurdity and then she looked as if she felt that a wrong had been done as for patt she was quite indignant at the insult nor was she very backward in letting her opinions be known but mary warrens manner of viewing the affair pleased me best as indeed was fast getting to be the fact with most of her notions and conceits she manifested neither levity nor resentment once or twice when a droll remark escaped henrietta she laughed a little a very little and involuntarily as it might bejust enough to prove that there was fun in herwhen she would make some sensible observation to the effect that the evil temper that was up in the country was the true part of the transaction that deserved attention and that she felt this as well as saw it nobody seemed to care for the canopynot even my excellent grandmother in whose youth the church had been built when distinctions of this sort were more in accordance with the temper and habits of the times than they are today i had been on the piazza just long enough to note this difference in the manner of the girls when my grandmother joined us  oh grandmother have you heard what those wretches of injins as they are rightly named have been doing with the canopy of the pew cried patt who had been at the bedside of our venerable parent and kissed her an hour before they have torn it down and placed it over the pen of the pigs  a common laugh in which patt herself now joined interrupted the answer for a moment old mrs littlepage herself manifesting a slight disposition to make one of the amused  i have heard it all my dear returned my grandmother and on the whole think the thing is well enough gotten rid of i do not believe it would have done for hugh to have had it taken down under a menace while it is perhaps better that it should no longer stand  were such things common in your youth mrs littlepage asked mary warren  far from uncommon though less so in country than in town churches you will remember that we were but recently separated from england when st andrews was built and that most of the old colonial ideas prevailed among us people in that day had very different notions of social station from those which now exist and new york was in a certain sense one of the most perhaps the most aristocratic colony in the country it was somewhat so under the dutch republicans as they were with its patroons but when the colony was transferred to the english it became a royal colony at once and english notions were introduced as a matter of course in no other colony were there as many manors perhaps the slavery of the south introducing quite a different system there while the policy of penn and new england generally was more democratic i apprehend roger that we owe this antirent struggle and particularly the feebleness with which it is resisted to the difference of opinion that prevails among the people of new england who have sent so many immigrants among us and our own purely new york notions  you are quite right my dear mother answered my uncle though new yorkers by descent are not wanting among the tenants to sustain the innovation the last act either from direct cupidity or to gain popularity with a set whereas as i view the matter the first are influenced by the notions of the state of society from which either they themselves or their parents were directly derived a very large proportion of the present population of new york is of new england origin perhaps onethird have this extraction either as born there or as the sons or grandsons of those who were now in new england generally great equality of condition exists more especially when you rise above the lower classes there being very few out of the large trading towns who would be deemed rich in new york and scarcely such a thing as a large landholder at all the relation of landlord and tenant as connected with what we should term estates is virtually unknown to new england though maine may afford some exceptions this circumstance is owing to the peculiar origin of the people and to the fact that emigration has so long carried off the surplus population the bulk of those who remain being able to possess freeholds there is a natural antipathy in men who have been educated in such a state of society to anything that seems to place others in positions they do not and cannot occupy themselves now while the population of new york may be onethird perhaps of new england descent and consequently more or less of new england notions a much larger proportion of the lawyers editors of newspapers physicians and active politicians are of that class we think little and talk little of these circumstances for no nation inquires into its moral influences and what i may call its political statistics less than the americans but they produce large consequences  am i to understand you sir to say that antirentism is of new england origin  perhaps not its origin was probably more directly derived from the devil who has tempted the tenants as he is known once to have tempted the saviour the outbreak was originally among the descendants of the dutch for they happened to be the tenants and as for the theories that have been broached they savor more of the reaction of european abuses than of anything american at all and least of all of anything from new england where there is generally a great respect for the rights of property and unusual reverence for the law still i think we owe our greatest danger to the opinions and habits of those of new england descent among us  this seems a little paradoxical uncle ro and i confess i should like to hear it explained  i will endeavor so to do and in as few words as possible the real danger is among those who influence legislation now you will find hundreds of men among us who feel the vast importance of respecting contracts who perceive much of the danger of antirentism and who wish to see it defeated in its violent and most offensive forms but who lean against the great landlords on account of those secret jealousies which cause most men to dislike advantages in which they do not share and who would gladly enough see all leases abolished if it could be done without a too violent conflict with justice when you talk with these men they will make you the commonplace but unmeaning profession of wishing to see every husbandman the owner in fee of his farm instead of a tenant and that it is a hardship to pay rent and quantities of such twaddle henry the fourth in a much better spirit is said to have wished that each of his subjects had une poule dans son pôt but that wish did not put it there so it is with this idle profession of wishing to see every american husbandman a freeholder we all know such a state of society never did exist and probably never will and it is merely placing a vapid pretension to philanthropy in the foreground of a picture that should rigidly represent things as they are for my part i am one of those who do not believe that this or any other country would be any the better for dispensing with landlords and tenants  mr littlepage exclaimed mary warren you surely do not mean that competency widely diffused is not better than wealth in a few hands and poverty in a great many  no i shall not go as far as that but i do say that what this country most wants just now is precisely the class that is connected with the independence of character and station the leisure with its attendant cultivation and refinement and the principles as well as taste that are connected with all  principles mr littlepage added my uncles sweet interlocutor my father would hardly uphold that though he agrees with you in so much of what you say  i do not know that i repeat the word principles for when you have a class of men who are removed from a large range of temptations without being placed above public opinion you get precisely those who are most likely to uphold that sort of secondary but highly useful morals which are not directly derived from purely religious duties against the last i shall not say one word as it comes from the grace which is of the power of god and is happily as accessible to the poor as to the rich and more too but of men as they are not one in a hundred regulates his life by a standard created under such impulses and even when they do the standard itself is in some degree qualified by the ordinary notions i apprehend the christian morality of an east indian is not identical with that of a puritan or that of a man of highly cultivated mind with that of one who has enjoyed fewer advantages there is one class of principles embracing all those that are adverse to the littlenesses of daily practice which is much the more extended among the liberalminded and educated and it is to that set of principles i refer now we want a due proportion of that class of men as our society is getting to be organized of those who are superior to meannesses  all this would be deemed atrociously aristocratic were it told in gath exclaimed patt laughing  it is atrociously common sense notwithstanding answered my uncle who was not to be laughed out of anything he felt to be true and the facts will show it new england early established a system of common schools and no part of the world perhaps has a population that is better grounded in intelligence this has been the case so long as to put the people of connecticut and massachusetts for instance as a whole materially in advance of the people of any other state new york included although by taking the system from our eastern brethren we are now doing pretty well notwithstanding who will say that new england is as far advanced in many material things as the middle states to begin with the kitchenher best cookery is much below that of even the humbler classes of the true middle states families take her language for another test it is provincial and vulgar and there is no exaggeration in saying that the laboring classes of the middle states if not of new england origin use better english than thousands of educated men in new england itself both of these peculiarities as i conceive come from the fact that in one part of the country there has been a class to give a tone that does not exist in the other the gentlemen of the larger towns in the east have an influence where they live no doubt but in the interior as no one leads all these matters are left to the common mind to get along with as well as it can  aristocratic sirrank aristocracy  if it be has aristocracy as you call it which in this instance must only mean decided social position no advantages is not even a wealthy idler of some use in a nation he contributes his full share to the higher civilization that is connected with the tastes and refinements and in fact he forms it in europe they will tell you that a court is necessary to such civilization but facts contradict the theory social classes no doubt are but they can exist independently of courts as they can have do and ever will in the face of democracy now connect this class with the landed interest and see how much your chances for material improvement are increased coke of norfolk probably conferred more benefit on the husbandry of england than all the mere operatives that existed in his time it is from such men indeed from their enterprise and their means that nearly all the greater benefits come the fine wool of america is mainly owing to livingstons connection with land and if you drive such men out of existence you must drive the benefits they confer with them a body of intelligent welleducated liberalized landlords scattered through new york would have more effect in advancing the highest interests of the community than all the small potato lawyers and governors you can name in a twelvemonth what is more this is just the state of society in which to reap all the benefits of such a class without the evils of a real aristocracy they are and would be without any particular political power and there is no danger of cornlaws and exclusive legislation for their benefit rich and poor we must have and let any fairminded man say whether he wish a state of things in which the first shall have no inducement to take an extended interest in real estate and the last no chance to become agriculturists except as hired laborers  you do not mince matters uncle ro put in patt and will never go to congress  that may be my dear but i shall retain my own selfrespect by fair dealing what i say i mean while many who take the other side do not i say that in a country like this in which land is so abundant as to render the evils of a general monopoly impossible a landed gentry is precisely what is most needed for the higher order of civilization including manners tastes and the minor principles and is the very class which if reasonably maintained and properly regarded would do the most good at the least risk of any social caste known they have always existed in new york though with a lessening influence and are the reason in my judgment why we are so much before new england in particular things while certainly behind that quarter of the country in many others that are dependent on ordinary schooling  i like to hear a person maintain his opinion frankly and manfully said my grandmother and this have you done roger from boyhood my own family on my fathers side was from new england and i subscribe to a great deal that you say and particularly to the part that relates to the apathy of the public to this great wrong it is now time however to go to the breakfasttable as john has been bowing in the door yonder for the last minute or two  to breakfast we went and notwithstanding incendiaries antirentism and canopies of pigpens a merry time we had of it henrietta coldbrooke and anne marston never came out with more spirit though in their several ways than each did that morning i believe i looked a little surprised for i observed that my uncle stole occasional glances at me that seemed to say there my fine fellow what do you think of that now whenever either of his wards uttered anything that he fancied cleverer than common  have you heard maam asked my uncle ro of my grandmother that we are to have old sus and jaaf here at the nest shortly and both in grand costume it seems the red men are about to depart and there is to be smoking of pipes and a great council which the trackless fancies will be more dignified if held in front of the house of his paleface friends than if held at his own hut  how did you ascertain that roger  i have been at the wigwam this morning and have the fact directly from the onondago as well as from the interpreter whom i met there by the way hugh we must shortly decide what is to be done with the prisoners or we shall have writs of habeas corpus served on us to know why we detain them  is it possible uncle ro for so his wards called him habituallyto rescue a gentleman from the gallows by marrying him asked henrietta coldbrooke demurely  that is so strange a question that as a guardian i feel curious to hear its meaning  telltell at once henrietta said the other ward urging her companion to speak i will save your blushes and act as your interpreter miss coldbrooke was honored by mr seneca newcome with this letter within the last twentyfour hours and it being a family matter i think it ought to be referred to a family council  nay anne said the blushing henrietta this is hardly fairnor am i sure that it would be quite ladylike in me to suffer that letter to be generally knownparticularly known to you it certainly is already  perhaps your reluctance to have it read does not extend to me henrietta said my uncle  certainly not sir nor to my dear mrs littlepage nor to marthathough i confess that i cannot see what interest mr hugh can have in the subject here it is take it and read it when you please  my uncle was pleased to read it on the spot as he proceeded a frown collected on his brow and he bit his lip like one provoked as well as vexed then he laughed and threw the letter on the table where no one presumed to molest it as henrietta coldbrooke was blushing all this time though she laughed and seemed provoked our curiosity was so great and manifest that my grandmother felt an inclination to interfere  may not that letter be read aloud for the benefit of all she asked  there can be no particular reason for concealing it answered uncle ro spitefully the more it is known the more the fellow will be laughed at as he deserves to be  will that be right uncle ro exclaimed miss coldbrooke hastily will it be treating a gentleman as he  pshawit will not be treating a gentleman at all the fellow is at this moment a prisoner for attempting to set an inhabited house on fire in the middle of the night  henrietta said no more and my grandmother took the letter and read it for the common benefit i shall not copy the effusion of seneca which was more cunning than philosophical but it contained a strong profession of love urged in a somewhat business manner and a generous offer of his hand to the heiress of eight thousand a year and this proposal was made only a day or two before the fellow was taken in the act and at the very time he was the most deeply engaged in his schemes of antirentism  there is a class of men among us said my uncle after everybody had laughed at this magnificent offer who do not seem to entertain a single idea of the proprieties how is it possible or where could the chap have been bred to fancy for an instant that a young woman of fortune and station would marry him and that too almost without an acquaintance i dare say henrietta never spoke to him ten times in her life  not five sir and scarcely anything was said at either of those five  and you answered the letter my dear asked my grandmother an answer ought not to have been forgotten though it might have properly come in this case from your guardian  i answered it myself mam not wishing to be laughed at for my part of the affair i declined the honor of mr seneca newcomes hand  well if the truth must be said put in patt dryly i did the same thing only three weeks since  and i so lately as last week added anne marston demurely  i do not know that i ever saw my uncle ro so strangely affected while everybody around him was laughing heartily he looked grave not to say fierce then he turned suddenly to me and said  we must let him be hanged hugh were he to live a thousand years he would never learn the fitness of things  youll think better of this sir and become more merciful the man has only nobly dared but i confess a strong desire to ascertain if miss warren alone has escaped his assaults  marypretty maryshe blushed scarlet but shook her head and refused to give any answer we all saw that her feelings were not enlisted in the affair in any way but there was evidently something of a more serious nature connected with senecas addresses to her than in connection with his addresses to either of the others as i have since ascertained he really had a sort of affection for mary and i have been ready to pardon him the unprincipled and impudent manner in which he cast his flies toward the other fish in consideration of his taste in this particular but mary herself would tell us nothing  you are not to think so much of this mr littlepage she cried so soon as a little recovered from her confusion since it is only acting on the great antirent principle after all in the one case it is only a wish to get good farms cheapand in the other good wives  in the one case other mens farmsand in the other other mens wives  other mens wives certainly if wives at all said patt pointedly there is no mr seneky newcome there  we must let the law have its way and the fellow be hanged rejoined my uncle i could overlook the attempt to burn the nest house but i cannot overlook this fellows of this class get everything dessus dessous and i do not wonder there is antirentism in the land such a matrimonial experiment could never have been attempted as between such parties in any region but one tainted with antirentism or deluded by the devil  an irishman would have included my grandmother in his cast of the net thats the only difference sir  sure enough why have you escaped my dearest mother you who have a fair widows portion too  because the suitor was not an irishman as hugh intimatedi know no other reason hodge but a person so devoted to the ladies must not suffer in the cruel way you speak of the wretch must be permitted to get off  all the girls now joined with my grandmother in prefering this to them very natural petition and for a few minutes we heard of nothing but regrets and solicitations that seneca might not be given up to the law tender mercies of the law might not be an unapt way to express the idea as it is now almost certain that the bigger the rogue the greater is the chance of escape  all this is very well ladies mighty humane and feminine and quite in character answered my uncle but in the first place there is such a thing as compounding felony and its consequences are not altogether agreeable then one is bound to consider the effect on society in general here is a fellow who first endeavors to raise a flame in the hearts of no less than four young ladies failing of which he takes refuge in lighting a fire in hughs kitchen do you know i am almost as much disposed to punish him for the first of these offences as for the last  theres a grand movement as is making among all the redskins maam said john standing in the door of the breakfast parlor and i didnt know but the ladies and mr littlepage and mr hugh would like to see it old sus is on his way here followed by yop who comes grumbling along after him as if he didnt like the amusement any way at all  have any arrangements been made for the proper reception of our guests this morning roger  yes maam at least i gave orders to have benches brought and placed under the trees and plenty of tobacco provided smoking is a great part of a council i believe and we shall be ready to commence at that as soon as they meet  yes sir all is ready for em resumed john miller has sent an orse cart to bring the benches and weve provided as much baccy as they can use the servants opes maam they can have permission to witness the ceremony it isnt often that civilized people can get a sight at real savages  my grandmother gave an assent and there was a general movement preparatory to going on the lawn to witness the parting interview between the trackless and his visitors  you have been very considerate miss warren i whispered mary as i helped her to put on her shawl in not betraying what i fancy is the most important of all senecas love secrets  i confess these letters have surprised me the dear girl said thoughtfully and with a look that seemed perplexed no one would be apt to think very favorably of mr newcome yet it was by no means necessary to complete his character that one should think as ill as this  i said no morebut these few words which appeared to escape mary unconsciously and involuntarily satisfied me that seneca had been seriously endeavoring to obtain an interest in her heart notwithstanding her poverty     chapter xxvii      and underneath that face like summers dreams     its lips as moveless and its cheek as clear     slumbers a whirlwind of the hearts emotions     love hatred pride hope sorrowall save fear                                                 halleck   the only singularity connected with the great age of the indian and the negro was the fact that they should have been associates for near a century and so long intimately united in adventures and friendship i say friendship for the term was not at all unsuited to the feeling that connected these old men together though they had so little in common in the way of character while the indian possessed all the manly and high qualities of a warrior of the woods of a chief and of one who had never acknowledged a superior the other was necessarily distinguished by many of the wickednesses of a state of servitude the bitter consequences of a degraded caste fortunately both were temperate by no means an everyday virtue among the redmen who dwelt with the whites though much more so with the blacks but susquesus was born at onondago a tribe remarkable for its sobriety and at no period of his long life would he taste any intoxicating drink while jaaf was essentially a sober man though he had a thorough nigger relish for hard cider there can be little doubt that these two aged memorials of past ages and almost forgotten generations owed their health and strength to their temperance fortifying natural predispositions to tenacity of life  it was always thought that jaaf was a little the senior of the indian though the difference in their ages could not be great it is certain that the redman retained much the most of his bodily powers though for fifty years he had taxed them the least susquesus never worked never would work in the ordinary meaning of the term he deemed it to be beneath his dignity as a warrior and i have heard it said that nothing but necessity could have induced him to plant or hoe even when in his prime so long as the boundless forest furnished the deer the moose the beaver the bear and the other animals that it is usual for the redman to convert into food he had cared little for the fruits of the earth beyond those that were found growing in their native state his hunts were the last regular occupation that the old man abandoned he carried the rifle and threaded the woods with considerable vigor after he had seen a hundred winters but the game deserted him under the neverdying process of clearing acre after acre until little of the native forest was left with the exception of the reservation of my own already named and the pieces of woodland that are almost invariably attached to every american farm lending to the landscape a relief and beauty that are usually wanting to the views of older countries it is this peculiarity which gives to so many of the views of the republic nay it may be said to all of them so much of the character of parkscenery when seen at a distance that excludes the blemishes of a want of finish and the coarser appliances of husbandry  with jaaf though he had imbibed a strong relish for the forest and for forestlife it was different in many respects accustomed to labor from childhood he could not be kept from work even by his extreme old age he had the hoe or the axe or the spade in his hand daily many years after he could wield either to any material advantage the little he did in this way now was not done to kill thought for he never had any to kill it was purely the effect of habit and of a craving desire to be jaaf still and to act his life over again  i am sorry to say that neither of these men had any essential knowledge or any visible feeling for the truths of christianity a hundred years ago little spiritual care was extended to the black and the difficulty of making an impression in this way on the indian has become matter of history perhaps success best attends such efforts when the pious missionary can penetrate to the retired village and disseminate his doctrines far from the miserable illustration of their effects that is to be hourly traced by the most casual observer amid the haunts of civilized men that christianity does produce a deep and benign influence on our social condition cannot be doubted but he who is only superficially acquainted with christian nations as they are called and sets about tracing the effects of this influence meets with so many proofs of a contrary nature as to feel a strong disposition to doubt the truth of dogmas that seem so impotent it is quite likely such was the case with susquesus who had passed all the earlier years of his exclusive association with the palefaces on the flanks of armies or among hunters surveyors runners and scouts situations that were not very likely to produce any high notions of moral culture nevertheless many earnest and longcontinued efforts had been made to awaken in this aged indian some notions of the future state of a paleface and to persuade him to be baptized my grandmother in particular had kept this end in view for quite half a century but with no success the different clergy of all denominations had paid more or less attention to this indian with the same object though no visible results had followed their efforts among others mr warren had not overlooked this part of his duty but he had met with no more success than those who had been before him singular as it seemed to some though i saw nothing strange in it mary warren had joined in this benevolent project with a gentle zeal and affectionate and tender interest that promised to achieve more than had been even hoped for these many years by her predecessors in the same kind office her visits to the hut had been frequent and i learned that morning from patt that though mary herself never spoke on the subject enough has been seen by others to leave no doubt that her gentle offices and prayers had at last touched in some slight degree the marblelike heart of the trackless  as for jaaf it is possible that it was his misfortune to be a slave in a family that belonged to the episcopal church a sect that is so tempered and chastened in its religious rites and so far removed from exaggeration as often to seem cold to those who seek excitement and fancy quiet and selfcontrol incompatible with a lively faith your priests are unsuited to make converts among the people said an enthusiastic clergyman of another denomination to me quite lately they cannot go among the brambles and thorns without tearing their gowns and surplices there may be a certain degree of truth in this though the obstacle exists rather with the convert than with the missionary the vulgar love coarse excitement and fancy that a profound spiritual sensibility must needs awaken a powerful physical sympathy to such groans and sighs and lamentations must be not only audible to exist at all but audible in a dramatic and striking form with men in order to be groans and sighs and lamentations acceptable with god it is certain at any rate that the practices which reason education a good taste and a sound comprehension of christian obligations condemn are if not most effective still effective with the ignorant and coarseminded thus may it have been with jaaf who had not fallen into the hands of the exaggerated during that period of life when he was most likely to be aroused by their practices and who now really seemed to have lived beyond everything but the recollections connected with the persons and things he loved in youth  as men in the higher meaning of the term the reader will remember that susquesus was ever vastly the superior of the black jaafs intellect had suffered under the blight which seems to have so generally caused the african mind to wither as we know that mind among ourselves while that of his associate had ever possessed much of the loftiness of a grand nature left to its native workings by the impetus of an unrestrained though savage liberty  such were the characters of the two extraordinary men whom we now went forth to meet by the time we reached the lawn they were walking slowly toward the piazza having got within the range of the shrubbery that immediately surrounds and sheds its perfume on the house the indian led as seemed to become his character and rank but jaaf had never presumed on his years and indulgences so far as to forget his condition a slave he had been born a slave had he lived and a slave he would die this too in spite of the law of emancipation which had in fact liberated him long ere he had reached his hundredth year i have been told that when my father announced to jaaf the fact that he and all his progeny the latter of which was very numerous were free and at liberty to go and do as they pleased the old black was greatly dissatisfied what good dat all do masser malbone he growled why ey wont let well alone nigger be nigger and white gentleem be white gentleem i speck now nuttin but disgrace and poverty come on my breed we always hab been gentleems nigger and why cant ey let us be gentleems nigger as long as we like ole sus hab liberty all he life and what good he get nuttin but poor red sabbage for all dat and never be anyting more if he could be gentleems sabbage i tell him dat war someting but no he too proud for dat gosh so he only he own sabbage  the onondago was in high costume much higher even than when he first received the visit of the prairie indians the paint he used gave new fire to eyes that age had certainly dimmed though they had not extinguished their light and fierce and savage as was the conceit it unquestionably relieved the furrows of time that red should be as much the favorite color of the redskin is perhaps as natural as that our ladies should use cosmetics to imitate the lilies and roses that are wanting a grim fierceness however was the aim of the onondago it being his ambition at that moment to stand before his guests in the colors of a warrior of the medals and wampum and feathers and blankets and moccasons gay with the quills of the porcupine tinged half a dozen hues and the tomahawk polished to the brightness of silver it is not necessary to say anything so much has been said and written and seen of late on such subjects that almost every one now knows how the north american warrior appears when he comes forth in his robes  nor had jaaf neglected to do honor to a festival that was so peculiarly in honor of his friend grumble he would and did throughout the whole of that day but he was not the less mindful of the credit and honor of susquesus it is the fashion of the times to lament the disappearance of the redmen from among us but for my part i feel much more disposed to mourn over the disappearance of the nigger i use the doric in place of the more modern and mincing term of colored man for the doric alone will convey to the american the meaning in which i wish to be understood i regret the nigger the oldfashioned careless lighthearted laborious idle roguish honest faithful fraudulent grumbling dogmatical slave who was at times good for nothing and again the stay and support of many a family but him i regret in particular is the domestic slave who identified himself with the interests and most of all with the credit of those he served and who always played the part of an humble privy counsellor and sometimes that of a prime minister it is true i had never seen jaaf acting in the latter capacity among us nor is it probable he ever did exactly discharge such functions with any of his old masters but he was a much indulged servant always and had become so completely associated with us by not only long services but by playing his part well and manfully in divers of the wild adventures that are apt to characterize the settlement of a new country that we all of us thought of him rather as an humble and distant relative than as a slave slave indeed he had not been for more than fourscore years his manumissionpapers having been signed and regularly recorded as far back as that though they remained a perfect dead letter so far as the negro himself was concerned  the costume of yop littlepage as this black was familiarly called by all who knew anything of his existence and his great age as well as that of susquesus had gotten into more than one newspaper was of what might be termed the old school of the nigger the coat was scarlet with buttons of motherofpearl each as large as a halfdollar his breeches were sky blue the vest was green the stockings striped blue and white and the legs had no other peculiarities about them than the facts that all that remained of the calves was on the shins and that they were stepped nearer than is quite common to the centre of the foot the heelpart of the latter being about half as long as the part connected with the toes the shoes indeed were somewhat conspicuous portions of the dress having a length and breadth and proportions that might almost justify a naturalist in supposing that they were never intended for a human being but the head and hat according to jaafs own notion contained the real glories of his toilet and person as for the last it was actually laced having formed a part of my grandfather general cornelius littlepages uniform in the field and the wool beneath it was as white as the snow of the hills this style of dress has long disappeared from among the black race as well as from among the whites but vestiges of it were to be traced my uncle tells me in his boyhood particularly at the pinkster holidays that peculiar festival of the negro notwithstanding the incongruities of his attire yop littlepage made a very respectable figure on this occasion the great age of both him and the onondago being the circumstances that accorded least with their magnificence  notwithstanding the habitual grumbling of the negro the indian always led when they made a movement he had led in the forest on the early hunts and on the warpaths he had led in their later excursions on the neighboring hills he always led when it was their wont to stroll to the hamlet together to witness the militia musters and other similar striking events he even was foremost when they paid their daily visits to the nest and now he came a little in advance slow in movement quiet with lips compressed eye roving and watchful and far from dim and his whole features wonderfully composed and noble considering the great number of years he had seen jaaf followed at the same gait but a very different man in demeanor and aspect his face scarce seemed human even the color of his skin once so glistening and black having changed to a dirty gray all its gloss having disappeared while his lips were perhaps the most prominent feature these too were in incessant motion the old man working his jaws in a sort of second childhood or as the infant bites its gums to feel its nearly developed teeth even when he was not keeping up the almost unceasing accompaniment of his grumbles  as the old man walked toward us and the men of the prairies had not yet shown themselves we all advanced to meet the former every one of our party the girls included shook hands with susquesus and wished him a good morning he knew my grandmother and betrayed some strong feeling when he shook her hand he knew patt and nodded kindly in answer to her good wishes he knew mary warren too and held her hand a little time in his own gazing at her wistfully the while my uncle ro and i were also recognized his look at me being earnest and long the two other girls were courteously received but his feelings were little interested in them a chair was placed for susquesus on the lawn and he took his seat as for jaaf he walked slowly up to the party took off his fine cocked hat but respectfully refused the seat he too was offered happening thus to be the last saluted he was the first with whom my grandmother opened the discourse  it is a pleasant sight jaaf to see you and our old friend susquesus once more on the lawn of the old house  not so berry ole house miss duss ater all answered the negro in his grumbling way rememer him well nough only built tudder day  it has been built threescore years if you call that the other day i was then young myself a bridehappy and blessed far beyond my deserts alas how changed have things become since that time  yes you wonerful changedmust say dat for you miss duss i sometime surprise myself so young a lady get change so berry soon  ah jaaf though it may seem a short time to you who are so much my senior fourscore years are a heavy load to carry i enjoy excellent health and spirits for my years but age will assert its power  rememer you miss duss like dat young lady dere pointing at pattnow you do seem wonerful change ole sus too berry much alter of latecant hole out much longer i do tink but injin nebber hab much raal grit in em  and you my friend continued my grandmother turning to susquesus who had sat motionless while she was speaking to jaafdo you also see this great change in me i have known you much longer than i have known jaaf and your recollection of me must go back nearly to childhoodto the time when i first lived in the woods as a companion of my dear excellent old uncle chainbearer  why should susquesus forget little wren hear song now in his ear no change at all in little wren in susquesuss eye  this is at least gallant and worthy of an onondago chief but my worthy friend age will make its mark even on the trees and we cannot hope to escape it forever  no bark smooth on young treerough on ole tree nebber forget chainbearer hes same age as susquesuslittle oleer too brave warriorgood man know him when young hunterhe dere when dat happen  when what happened susquesus i have long wished to know what drove you from your people and why you a red man in your heart and habits to the last should have so long lived among us palefaces away from your own tribe i can understand why you like us and wish to pass the remainder of your days with this family for i know all that we have gone through together and your early connection with my fatherinlaw and his fatherinlaw too but the reason why you left your own people so young and have now lived near a hundred years away from them is what i could wish to hear before the angel of death summons one of us away  while my grandmother was thus coming to the point for the first time in her life on this subject as she afterward told me the onondagos eye was never off her own i thought he seemed surprised then his look changed to sadness and bowing his head a little he sat a long time apparently musing on the past the subject had evidently aroused the strongest of the remaining feelings of the old man and the allusion to it had brought back images of things long gone by that were probably reviewed not altogether without pain i think his head must have been bowed and his face riveted on the ground for quite a minute  chainbearer nebber say why the old man suddenly asked raising his face again to look at my grandmother ole chief toohe know nebber talk of it eh  never i have heard both my uncle and my fatherinlaw say that they knew the reason why you left your people so many long long years ago and that it did you credit but neither ever said more it is reported here that these redmen who have come so far to see you also know it and that it is one reason of their coming so much out of their way to pay you a visit  susquesus listened attentively though no portion of his person manifested emotion but his eyes all the rest of the man seemed to be made of some material that was totally without sensibility but those restless keen still penetrating eyes opened a communication with the being within and proved that the spirit was far younger than the tenement in which it dwelt still he made no revelation and our curiosity which was getting to be intense was completely baffled it was even some little time before the indian said anything more at all when he did speak it was merely to say  good chainbearer wise chiefginral wise too good in campgood at councilfire know when to talkknow what to talk  how much further my dear grandmother might have been disposed to push the subject i cannot say for just then we saw the redskins coming out of their quarters evidently about to cross from the old farm to the lawn this being their last visit to the trackless preparatory to departing on their long journey to the prairies aware of all this she fell back and my uncle led susquesus to the tree where the benches were placed for the guests i carrying the chair in the rear everybody followed even to all the domestics who could be spared from the ordinary occupations of the household  the indian and the negro were both seated and chairs having been brought out for the members of the family we took our places near by though so much in the back ground as not to appear obtrusive  the indians of the prairies arrived in their customary marching order or in single files manytongues led followed by prairiefire flintyheart and eaglesflight came next and the rest succeeded in a nameless but perfect order to our surprise however they brought the two prisoners with them secured with savage ingenuity and in a way to render escape nearly impossible  it is unnecessary to dwell on the deportment of these strangers as they took their allotted places on the benches it being essentially the same as that described in their first visit the same interest however was betrayed in their manner nor did their curiosity or veneration appear to be in the least appeased by having passed a day or two in the immediate vicinity of their subject that this curiosity and veneration proceeded in some measure from the great age and the extended experience of the trackless was probable enough but i could not divest myself of the idea that there lay something unusual behind all which tradition had made familiar to these sons of the soil but which had become lost to us  the american savage enjoys one great advantage over the civilized man of the same quarter of the world his traditions ordinarily are true whereas the multipled means of imparting intelligence among ourselves has induced so many pretenders to throw themselves into the ranks of the wise and learned that blessed thrice blessed is he whose mind escapes the contamination of falsehood and prejudice well would it be for men if they oftener remembered that the very facilities that exist to circulate the truth are just so many facilities for circulating falsehood and that he who believes even onehalf of that which meets his eyes in his daily inquiries into passing events is most apt to throw away quite a moiety of even that much credulity on facts that either never had an existence at all or which have been so mutilated in the relation that their eyewitnesses would be the last to recognize them  the customary silence succeeded the arrival of the visitors then eaglesflight struck fire with a flint touched the tobacco with the flame and puffed at a very curiously carved pipe made of some soft stone of the interior until he had lighted it beyond any risk of its soon becoming extinguished this done he rose advanced with profound reverence in his air and presented it to susquesus who took it and smoked for a few seconds after which he returned it to him from whom it had been received this was a signal for other pipes to be lighted and one was offered to my uncle and myself each of us making a puff or two and even john and the other male domestics were not neglected prairiefire himself paid the compliment to jaaf the negro had noted what was passing and was much disgusted with the niggardliness which required the pipe to be so soon returned this he did not care to conceal as was obvious by the crusty observation he made when the pipe was offered to him cider and tobacco had from time immemorial been the two great blessings of this blacks existence and he felt at seeing one standing to receive his pipe after a puff or two much as he might have felt had one pulled the mug from his mouth after the second or third swallow  no need wait heregrumbled old jaafwhen i done gib you de pipe agin nebber fear masser corny or masser malborne or masser hughdear me i nebber knows which be libbin and which be dead i get so ole nowaday but nebber mind if he be ole can smoke yet and dont lub injin fashion of gibbin tings and dat is gib him and den take away agin nigger is nigger and injin is injin and nigger best lord how many years i do seei do seemost get tire of libbin so long dont wait injin when i done you get pipe again i say best not make ole jaaf too mad or he dreadful  although it is probable that prairiefire did not understand onehalf of the negros words he comprehended his wish to finish the tobacco before he relinquished the pipe this was against all rule and a species of slight on indian usages but the redman overlooked all with a courtesy of one trained in high society and walked away as composedly as if everything were right in these particulars the highbreeding of an indian is always made apparent no one ever sees in his deportment a shrug or a halfconcealed smile or a look of intelligence a wink or a nod or any other of that class of signs or communications which it is usually deemed underbred to resort to in company in all things he is dignified and quiet whether it be the effect of coldness or the result of character  the smoking now became general but only as a ceremony no one but jaaf setting to with regularity to finish his pipe as for the black his opinion of the superiority of his own race over that of the redman was as fixed as his consciousness of his inferiority to the white and he would have thought the circumstance that the present mode of using tobacco was an indian custom a sufficient reason why he himself should not adopt it the smoking did not last long but was succeeded by a silent pause then prairiefire arose and spoke  father he commenced we are about to quit you our squaws and pappooses on the prairies wish to see us it is time for us to go they are looking toward the great salt lake for us we are looking toward the great freshwater lakes for them there the sun setshere it rises the distance is great and many strange tribes of palefaces live along the path our journey has been one of peace we have not hunted we have taken no scalps but we have seen our great father uncle sam and we have seen our great father susquesus we shall travel toward the setting sun satisfied father our traditions are true they never lie a lying tradition is worse than a lying indian what a lying indian says deceives his friends his wife his children what a lying tradition says deceives a tribe our traditions are true they speak of the upright onondago all the tribes on the prairies have heard this tradition and are very glad it is good to hear of justice it is bad to hear of injustice without justice an indian is no better than a wolf no there is not a tongue spoken on the prairies which does not tell of that pleasant tradition we could not pass the wigwam of our father without turning aside to look at him our squaws and pappooses wish to see us but they would have told us to come back and turn aside to look upon our father had we forgotten to do so why has my father seen so many winters it is the will of the manitou the great spirit wants to keep him here a little longer he is like stones piled together to tell the hunters where the pleasant path is to be found all the redmen who see him think of what is right no the great spirit cannot yet spare my father from the earth lest redmen forget what is right he is stones piled together  here prairiefire ceased sitting down amid a low murmur of applause he had expressed the common feeling and met with the success usual to such efforts susquesus had heard and understood all that was said and i could perceive that he felt it though he betrayed less emotion on this occasion than he had done on the occasion of the previous interview then the novelty of the scene no doubt contributed to influence his feelings a pause followed this opening speech and we were anxiously waiting for the renowned orator eaglesflight to rise when a singular and somewhat ludicrous interruption of the solemn dignity of the scene occurred in the place of eaglesflight whom manytongues had given us reason to expect would now come forth with energy and power a much younger warrior arose and spoke commanding the attention of his listeners in a way to show that he possessed their respect we were told that the young warriors name rendered into english was deersfoot an appellation obtained on account of his speed and which we were assured he well merited much to our surprise however he addressed himself to jaaf indian courtesy requiring that something should be said to the constant friend and tried associate of the trackless the reader may be certain we were all much amused at this bit of homage though every one of us felt some little concern on the subject of the answer it might elicit deersfoot delivered himself substantially as follows  the great spirit sees all things he makes all things in his eyes color is nothing although he made children that he loved of a red color he made children that he loved with pale faces too he did not stop there no he said i wish to see warriors and men with faces darker than the skin of the bear i will have warriors who shall frighten their enemies by their countenances he made black men my father is black his skin is neither red like the skin of susquesus nor white like the skin of the young chief of ravensnest it is now gray with having had the sun shine on it so many summers but it was once the color of the crow then it must have been pleasant to look at my black father is very old they tell me he is even older than the upright onondago the manitou must be well pleased with him not to have called him away sooner he has left him in his wigwam that all the black men may see whom their great spirit loves this is the tradition told to us by our fathers the pale men come from the rising sun and were born before the heat burned their skins the black men came from under the sun at noonday and their faces were darkened by looking up above their heads to admire the warmth that ripened their fruits the red men were born under the setting sun and their faces were colored by the hues of the evening skies the red man was born here the pale man was born across the salt lake the black man came from a country of his own where the sun is always above his head what of that we are brothers the thicklips this was the name by which the strangers designated jaaf as we afterward learned is the friend of susquesus they have lived in the same wigwam now so many winters that their venison and bearsmeat have the same taste they love one another whomsoever susquesus loves and honors all just indians love and honor i have no more to say  it is very certain that jaaf would not have understood a syllable that was uttered in this address had not manytongues first given him to understand that deersfoot was talking to him in particular and then translated the speakers language word for word and with great deliberation as each sentence was finished even this care might not have sufficed to make the negro sensible of what was going on had not patt gone to him and told him in a manner and voice to which he was accustomed to attend to what was said and to endeavor as soon as deersfoot sat down to say something in reply jaaf was so accustomed to my sister and was so deeply impressed with the necessity of obeying her as one of his many yung missuseswhich he scarcely knew himselfthat she succeeded in perfectly arousing him and he astonished us all with the intelligence of his very characteristic answer which he did not fail to deliver exactly as he had been directed to do previously to beginning to speak the negro champed his toothless gums together like a vexed swine but yung missus had told him he must answer and answer he did it is probable also that the old fellow had some sort of recollection of such scenes having been present in his younger days at various councils held by the different tribes of new york among whom my grandfather general mordaunt littlepage had more than once been a commissioner  well jaaf began in a short snappish manner spose nigger must say sometin no berry great talker cause i no injin nigger had too much work to do to talk all e time what you say

come dem debbils of injins agin and dis time we must clean em out get your rifle sus get your rifle boy and mind dat ole jaaf be at your elbow  sure enough there the injins did come but i must reserve an account of what followed for the commencement of the next chapter     chapter xxviii      hopethat thy wrongs will be by the great spirit     remembered and revenged when thou art gone     sorrowthat none are left thee to inherit     thy name thy fame thy passions and thy throne                                                   red jacket   it was a little remarkable that one as old and bleareyed as the negro should be the first among us to discover the approach of a large body of the injins who could not be less than two hundred in number the circumstance was probably owing to the fact that while every other eye was riveted on the speaker his eyes were fastened on nothing there the injins did come however in force and this time apparently without fear the white american meets the redman with much confidence when he is prepared for the struggle and the result has shown that when thrown upon his resources in the wilderness and after he has been allowed time to gain a little experience he is usually the most formidable enemy but a dozen indians of the stamp of those who had here come to visit us armed and painted and placed in the centre of one of our largest peopled counties would be sufficient to throw that county into a paroxysm of fear until time were given for thought and the opinions of the judicious superseded the effects of rumor nothing but panic would prevail mothers would clasp their children to their bosoms fathers would hold back their sons from the slaughter and even the heroes of the militia would momentarily forget their ardor in the suggestions of prudence and forethought  such in fact had been the state of things in and about ravensnest when flintyheart so unexpectedly led his companions into the forest and dispersed the virtuous and oppressed tenants of my estate on their return from a meeting held with but one virtuous object viz that of transferring the fee of the farms they occupied from me to themselves no one doubted at the moment that in addition to the other enormities committed by me and mine i had obtained a body of savages from the far west to meet the forces already levied by the tenants on a principle that it would not do to examine very clearly if i had done so i am far from certain that i should not have been perfectly justified in morals for an evil of that nature that might at any time be put down in a month and which is suffered to exist for years through the selfish indifference of the community restores to every man his natural rights of selfdefence though i make no doubt had i resorted to such means i should have been hanged without benefit of philanthropists the clergy in this country not being included in the class so far as suspension by the neck is concerned  but the panic had disappeared as soon as the truth became known concerning the true object of the visit of the redskins the courage of the virtuous and honest revived and one of the first exhibitions of this renewed spirit was the attempt to set fire to my house and barns so serious a demonstration it was thought would convince me of the real power of the people and satisfy us all that their wishes are not to be resisted with impunity as no one likes to have his house and barns burned it must be a singular being who could withstand the influence of such a manifestation of the spirit of the institutions for it is just as reasonable to suppose that the attempts of the incendiaries came within their political category as it is to suppose that the attempt of the tenants to get a title beyond what was bestowed in their leases was owing to this cause  that habit of deferring to externals which is so general in a certain class of our citizens and which endures in matters of religion long after the vital principle is forgotten prevented any serious outbreak on the next day which was the sunday mentioned though the occasion was improved to coerce by intimidation the meeting and resolutions having been regularly digested in secret conclave among the local leaders of antirentism and carried out as has been described then followed the destruction of the canopy another demonstration of the spirit of the institutions and as good an argument as any that has yet been offered in favor of the dogmas of the new political faith public opinion is entitled to some relief surely when it betrays so much excitement as to desecrate churches and to destroy private property this circumstance of the canopy had been much dwelt on as a favorable antirent argument and it might now be considered that the subject was carried out to demonstration  by the time all this was effected so completely had the injins got over their dread of the indians that it was with difficulty the leaders of the former could prevent the most heroic portion of their corps from following their blow at the canopy by a coup de main against the old farmhouse and its occupants had not the discretion of the leaders been greater than that of their subordinates it is very probable blood would have been shed between these quasi belligerents but the warriors of the prairies were the guests of uncle sam and the old gentleman after all has a long arm and can extend it from washington to ravensnest without much effort he was not to be offended heedlessly therefore for his power was especially to be dreaded in this matter of the covenants without which injins and agitation would be altogether unnecessary to attaining the great object the albany politicians being so well disposed to do all they can for the virtuous and honest uncle sams indians consequently were held a good deal more in respect than the laws of the state and they consequently escaped being murdered in their sleep  when jaaf first drew our attention to the injins they were advancing in a long line by the highway and at a moderate pace leaving us time to shift our own position did we deem it necessary my uncle was of opinion it would never do to remain out on the lawn exposed to so great a superiority of force and he took his measures accordingly in the first place the females mistresses and maidsand there were eight or ten of the lastwere requested to retire at once to the house the latter with john at their head were directed to close all the lower outside shutters of the building and secure them within this done and the gate and two outer doors fastened it would not be altogether without hazard to make an assault on our fortress as no one required a second request to move this part of the precaution was soon effected and the house placed in a species of temporary security  while the foregoing was in the course of execution susquesus and jaaf were induced to change their positions by transferring themselves to the piazza that change was made and the two old fellows were comfortably seated in their chairs again before a single man of the redskins moved a foot there they all remained motionless as so many statues with the exception that flintyheart seemed to be reconnoitring with his eyes the thicket that fringed the neighboring ravine and which formed a bit of dense cover as already described of some considerable extent  do you wish the redskins in the house colonel asked the interpreter coolly when matters had reached to this pass if you do its time to speak or theyll soon be off like a flock of pigeons into that cover therell be a fight as sartain as they move for theres no more joke and making of faces about them critturs than there is about a milestone so its best to speak in time  no delay occurred after this hint was given the request of my uncle ro that the chiefs would follow the upright onondago was just in time to prevent a flight in the sense of manytongues i mean for it was not very likely these warriors would literally run away it is probable that they would have preferred the cover of the woods as more natural and familiar to thembut i remarked as the whole party came on the piazza that flintyheart in particular cast a quick scrutinizing glance at the house which said in pretty plain language that he was examining its capabilities as a work of defence the movement however was made with perfect steadiness and what most surprised us all was the fact that not one of the chiefs appeared to pay the slightest attention to their advancing foes or men whom it was reasonable for them to suppose so considered themselves to be we imputed this extraordinary reserve to force of character and a desire to maintain a calm and dignified deportment in the presence of susquesus if it were really the latter motive that so completely restrained every exhibition of impatience apprehension or disquietude they had every reason to congratulate themselves on the entire success of their characteristic restraint on their feelings  the injins were just appearing on the lawn as our arrangements were completed john had come to report every shutter secure and the gate and little door barred he also informed us that all the men and boys who could be mustered including gardeners laborers and stable people to the number of five or six were in the little passage armed where rifles were ready also for ourselves in short the preparations that had been made by my grandmother immediately after her arrival were now of use and enabled us to make much more formidable resistance sustained as we were by the party from the prairies than i could have ever hoped for on so sudden an emergency  our arrangement was very simple the ladies were seated near the great door in order that they might be placed under cover the first in the event of necessity susquesus and jaaf had their chairs a little on one side but quite near this group and the men from the far west occupied the opposite end of the piazza whither the benches had been removed for their accommodation manytongues stood between the two divisions of our company ready to interpret for either while my uncle myself john and two or three of the other servants took position behind our aged friends seneca and his fellowincendiary were in the midst of the chiefs  it was just as the injins had got fairly on the lawn that we heard the clattering of hoofs and every eye was turned in the direction whence the sound proceeded this was on the side of the ravine and to me it seemed from the first that some one was approaching us through that dell so it proved truly for soon opportunity came galloping up the path and appeared in sight she did not check her horse until under the tree where she alighted by a single bound and hitching the animal to a hook in the tree she moved swiftly toward the house my sister patt advanced to the steps of the piazza to receive this unexpected guest and i was just behind her to make my bow but the salutations of opportunity were hasty and far from being very composed she glanced around her ascertained the precise condition of her brotherand taking my arm she led me into the library with very little or indeed with no ceremony for to give this young woman her due she was a person of great energy when there was anything serious to be done the only sign of deviating in the slightest degree from the object in view was pausing one instant in passing to make her compliments to my grandmother  what in the name of wonder do you mean to do with sen demanded this active young lady looking at me intently with an expression halfhostile halftender you are standing over an earthquake mr hugh if you did but know it  opportunity had confounded the effect with the cause but that was of little moment on an occasion so interesting she was much in earnest and i had learned by experience that her hints and advice might be of great service to us at the nest  to what particular danger do you allude my dear opportunity  ah hugh if things was only as they used to be how happy might we all be together here at ravensnest but there is no time to talk of such things for as sarah soothings says the heart is most monopolized when grief is the profoundest and it is only when our sentiments rise freely to the surface of the imagination that the mind escapes the shackles of thraldom but i havent a minute for sarah soothings even just now dont you see the injins  quite plainly and they probably see my indians  oh they dont regard them now the least in the world at first when they thought you might have hired a set of desperate wretches to scalp the folks there was some misgivings but the whole story is now known and nobody cares a straw about them if anybodys scalp is taken twill be their own why the whole country is up and the report has gone forth far and near that you have brought in with you a set of bloodthirsty savages from the prairies to cut the throats of women and children and drive off the tenants that you may get all the farms into your own hands before the lives fall in some folks say these savages have had a list of all the lives named in your leases given to them and that they are to make way with all such people first that you may have the law as much as possible on your side you stand on an earthquake mr hugh you do indeed  my dear opportunity i answered laughing i am infinitely obliged to you for all this attention to my interests and freely own that on saturday night you were of great service to me but i must now think that you magnify the dangerthat you color the picture too high  not in the least i do protest you stand on an earthquake and as your friend i have ridden over here to tell you as much while there is yet time  to get off it i suppose you mean but how can all these evil and bloodthirsty reports be abroad when the characters of the western indians are as you own yourself understood and the dread of them that did exist in the town has entirely vanished there is a contradiction in this  why you know how it is in antirent times when an excitement is needed folks dont stick at facts very closely but repeat things and make things just as it happens to be convenient  true i can understand this and have no difficulty in believing you now but have you come here this morning simply to let me know the danger which besets me from this quarter  i believe im always only too ready to gallop over to the nest but everybody has some weakness or other and i suppose i am to be no exception to the rule returned opportunity who doubtless fancied the moment propitious to throw in a volley toward achieving her great conquest and who reinforced that volley of words with such a glance of the eye as none but a most practised picaroon on the sea of flirtation could have thrown but hughi call you hugh mr littlepage for you seem more like hugh to me than like the proud evilminded aristocrat and hardhearted landlord that folks want to make you out to bebut i never could have told you what i did last night had i supposed it would bring sen into this difficulty  i can very well understand how unpleasantly you are situated as respects your brother opportunity and your friendly services will not be forgotten in the management of his affairs  if you are of this mind why wont you suffer these injins to get him out of the hands of your real savages returned opportunity coaxingly ill promise for him that sen will go off and stay off for some months if you insist ont when all is forgotten he can come back again  is the release of your brother then the object of this visit from the injins  partly sotheyre bent on having him hes in all the secrets of the antirenters and theyre afraid for their very lives so long as hes in your hands should he get a little scared and give up only onequarter of what he knows thered be no peace in the county for a twelvemonth  at this instant and before there was time to make an answer i was summoned to the piazza the injins approaching so near as to induce my uncle to step to the door and call my name in a loud voice i was compelled to quit opportunity who did not deem it prudent to show herself among us though her presence in the house as an intercessor for her brother could excite neither surprise nor resentment  when i reached the piazza the injins had advanced as far as the tree where we had first been posted and there they had halted seemingly for a conference in their rear mr warren was walking hurriedly toward us keeping the direct line regardless of those whom we well knew to be inimical to him and intent only on reaching the house before it could be gained by the disguised and armed this little circumstance gave rise to an incident of touching interest and which i cannot refrain from relating though it may interrupt the narration of matters that others may possibly think of more moment  mr warren did not pass directly through the crowd of riotersfor such those people were in effect unless the epithet should be changed to the still more serious one of rebelsbut he made a little detour in order to prevent a collision that was unnecessary when about halfway between the tree and the piazza however the injins gave a discordant yell and many of them sprang forward as if in haste to overtake and probably to arrest him just as we all involuntarily arose under a common feeling of interest in the fate of the good rector mary darted from the piazza was at her fathers side and in his arms so quickly as to seem to have flown there clinging to his side she appeared to urge him toward us but mr warren adopted a course much wiser than that of flight would have been conscious of having said or done no more than his duty he stopped and faced his pursuers the act of mary warren had produced a check to the intended proceedings of these lawless men and the calm dignified aspect of the divine completed his conquest the leaders of the injins paused conferred together when all who had issued from the main body returned to their companions beneath the tree leaving mr warren and his charming daughter at liberty to join us unmolested and with decorum  the instant mary warren left the piazza on her pious errand i sprang forward to follow her with an impulse i could not control although my own power over this impulsive movement was so small that of my uncle and grandmother was greater the former seized the skirt of my frock and held me back by main strength while the light touch of the latter had even greater power both remonstrated and with so much obvious justice that i saw the folly of what i was about in an instant and abandoned my design had i fallen into the hands of the antirenters their momentary triumph at least would have been complete  mr warren ascended the steps of the piazza with a mien as unaltered and an air as undisturbed as if about to enter his own church the good old gentleman had so schooled his feelings and was so much accustomed to view himself as especially protected or as so ready to suffer when in the discharge of any serious duty that i have had occasions to ascertain fear was unknown to him as for mary never had she appeared so truly lovely as she ascended the steps still clinging fondly and confidingly to his arm the excitement of such a scene had brought more than the usual quantity of blood into her face and the brilliancy of her eyes was augmented by that circumstance perhaps but i fancied that a more charming picture of feminine softness blended with the selfdevotion of the child could not have been imagined by the mind of man  patt dear generous girl sprang forward to embrace her friend which she did with warmth and honest fervor and my venerable grandmother kissed her on both cheeks while the other two girls were not backward in giving the customary signs of the sympathy of their sex my uncle ro even went so far as gallantly to kiss her hand causing the poor girls face to be suffused with blushes while poor hugh was obliged to keep in the background and content himself with looking his admiration i got one glance however from the sweet creature that was replete with consolation since it assured me that my forbearance was understood and attributed to its right motive  in that singular scene the men of the prairies alone appeared to be unmoved even the domestics and workmen had betrayed a powerful interest in this generous act of mary warrens the females all screaming in chorus very much as a matter of course but not an indian moved scarce one turned his eyes from the countenance of susquesus though all must have been conscious that something of interest was going on so near them by the concern we betrayed and all certainly knew that their enemies were hard by as respects the last i have supposed the unconcern or seeming unconcern of these western warriors ought to be ascribed to the circumstance of the presence of the ladies and an impression that there could be no very imminent risk of hostilities while the company then present remained together the apathy of the chiefs seemed to be extended to the interpreter who was coolly lighting his pipe at the very moment when the whole affair of the warren episode occurred an occupation that was not interrupted by the clamor and confusion among ourselves  as there was a delay in the nearer approach of the injins there was leisure to confer together for a moment mr warren told us therefore that he had seen the disguised and armed pass the rectory and had followed in order to act as a mediator between us and any contemplated harm  the destruction of the canopy of hughs pew must have given you a serious intimation that things were coming to a head observed my grandmother  mr warren had not heard of the affair of the canopy at all although living quite within sound of a hammer used in the church everything had been conducted with so much management that the canopy had been taken down and removed bodily without any one in the rectorys knowing the fact the latter had become known at the nest solely by the circumstance that the object which had so lately canopied aristocracy in st andrews ravensrest was now canopying pigs up at the farm house the good divine expressed his surprise a little strongly and as i thought his regrets a little indifferently he was not one to countenance illegality and violence and least of all that peculiarly american vice envy but on the other hand he was not one to look with favor on the empty distinctions as set up between men equally sinners and in need of grace to redeem them from a common condemnation in the house of god as the grave is known to be the great leveller of the human race so ought the church to be used as a preparatory step in descending to the plain all must occupy in spirit at least before they can hope to be elevated to any even of the meanest places among the many mansions of our fathers bosom  there was but a short breathing time given us however before the injins again advanced it was soon evident they did not mean to remain mere idle spectators of the scene that was in the course of enactment on the piazza but that it was their intention to become actors in some mode or other forming themselves into a line that savored a great deal more of the militia of this great republic than of the warriors of the west they came on tramping with the design of striking terror into our souls our arrangements were made however and on our part everything was conducted just as one could have wished the ladies influenced by my grandmother retained their seats near the door the men of the household were standing but continued stationary while not an indian stirred as for susquesus he had lived far beyond surprises and all emotions of the lower class and the men of the prairies appeared to take their cues from him so long as he continued immovable they seemed disposed to remain immovable also  the distance between the tree and the piazza did not much exceed a hundred yards and little time was necessary to march across it i remarked however that contrary to the laws of attraction the nearer the injins line got to its goal the slower and more unsteady its movement became it also lost its formation bending into curves though its tramps became louder and louder as if those who were in it wished to keep alive their own courage by noise when within fifty feet of the steps they ceased to advance at all merely stamping with their feet as if hoping to frighten us into flight i thought this a favorable moment to do that which it had been decided between my uncle and myself ought to be done by me as owner of the property these lawless men had thus invaded stepping to the front of the piazza i made a sign for attention the tramping ceased all at once and i had a profound silence for my speech  you know me all of you i said quietly i know and i trust firmly and you know therefore that i am the owner of this house and these lands as such owner i order every man among you to quit the place and to go into the highway or upon the property of some other person whoever remains after this notice will be a trespasser and the evil done by a trespasser is doubly serious in the eyes of the law  i uttered these words loud enough to be heard by everybody present but i cannot pretend that they were attended by much success the calico bundles turned toward each other and there was an appearance of a sort of commotion but the leaders composed the people the omnipotent people in this instance as they do in most others the sovereignty of the mass is a capital thing as a principle and once in a long while it evinces a great good in practice in a certain sense it is always working good by holding a particular class of most odious and intolerable abuses in check but as for the practice of everyday political management their imperial majesties the sovereigns of america of whom i happen to be one have quite as little connection with the measures they are made to seem to demand and to sustain as the nawab of oude if the english who are so disinterested as to feel a generous concern for the rights of mankind whenever the great republic adds a few acres to the small paternal homestead have left any such potentate in existence  so it was with the decision of the disguised and armed on the occasion i am describing they decided that no other notice should be taken of my summons to quit than a contemptuous yell though they had to ascertain from their leaders what they had decided before they knew themselves the shout was pretty general notwithstanding and it had one good effect that of satisfying the injins themselves that they had made a clear demonstration of their contempt of my authority which they fancied victory sufficient for the moment nevertheless the demonstration did not end exactly here certain cries and a brief dialogue succeeded which it may be well to record  king littlepage called out one from among the disguised and armed what has become of your throne st andrews meetingus has lost its monarchs throne  his pigs have set up for great aristocrats of late presently theyll want to be patroons  hugh littlepage be a man come down to a level with your fellowcitizens and dont think yourself any better than other folks youre but flesh and blood ater all  why dont you invite me to come and dine with you as well as priest warren i can eat as well as any man in the country and as much  yes and hell drink too hugh littlepage so provide your best liquor the day hes to be invited  all this passed for wit among the injins and among that portion of the virtuous and honest and hardworking who not only kept them on foot but on this occasion kept them company also it having since been ascertained that about onehalf of that band was actually composed of the tenants of the ravensnest farms i endeavored to keep myself cool and succeeded pretty well considering the inducements there were to be angry argument with such men was out of the questionand knowing their numbers and physical superiority they held my legal rights in contempt  what was probably worse than all they knew that the law itself was administered by the people and that they had little to apprehend and did apprehend virtually nothing from any of the pains and penalties it might undertake to inflict should recourse be had to it at any future day ten or a dozen wily agents sent through the country to circulate lies and to visit the county town previously to and during a trial in order to raise a party that will act more or less directly on the minds of the jurors with a newspaper or two to scatter untruths and prejudices would at least be as effective at the critical moment as the law the evidence and the right as for the judges and their charges they have lost most of their influence under the operation of this nefarious system and count but for very little in the administration of justice either at nisi prius or at oyer terminer these are melancholy truths that any man who quits his theories and descends into the arena of practice will soon ascertain to be such to his wonder and alarm if he be a novice and an honest man a portion of this unhappy state of things is a consequence of the legislative tinkering that has destroyed one of the most healthful provisions of the common law in prohibiting the judges to punish for contempt unless for outrages committed in open court the press in particular now profits by this impunity and influences the decision of nearly every case that can at all enlist public feeling all these things men feel and few who are wrong care for the law for those who are right it is true there is still some danger my uncle ro says america is no more like what america was in this respect twenty years since than kamtschatka is like italy for myself i wish to state the truth exaggerating nothing nor yet taking refuge in a dastardly concealment  unwilling to be browbeaten on the threshold of my own door i determined to say something ere i returned to my place men like these before me can never understand that silence proceeds from contempt and i fancied it best to make some sort of a reply to the speeches i have recorded and to twenty more of the same moral calibre motioning for silence i again obtained it  i have ordered you to quit my lawn in the character of its owner i said and by remaining you make yourselves trespassers as for what you have done to my pew i should thank you for it had it not been done in violation of the right for it was fully my intention to have that canopy removed as soon as the feeling about it had subsided i am as much opposed to distinctions of any sort in the house of god as any of you can be and desire them not for myself or any belonging to me i ask for nothing but equal rights with all my fellowcitizens that my property should be as much protected as theirs but not more so but i do not conceive that you or any man has a right to ask to share in my worlds goods any more than i have a right to ask to share in his that you can more justly claim a portion of my lands than i can claim a share in your cattle and crops it is a poor rule that does not work both ways  youre an aristocrat cried one from among the injins or youd be willing to let other men have as much land as youve got yourself youre a patroon and all patroons are aristocrats and hateful  an aristocrat i answered is one of a few who wield political power the highest birth the largest fortune the most exclusive association would not make an aristocrat without the addition of a narrow political power in this country there are no aristocrats because there is no narrow political power there is however a spurious aristocracy which you do not recognize merely because it does not happen to be in the hands of gentlemen demagogues and editors are your privileged classes and consequently your aristocrats and none others as for your landlord aristocrats listen to a true tale which will satisfy you how far they deserve to be called an aristocracy mark what i now tell you is religious truth and it deserves to be known far and near wherever your cry of aristocracy reaches there is a landlord in this state a man of large means who became liable for the debts of another to a considerable amount at the very moment when his rents could not be collected owing to your interference and the remissness of those in authority to enforce the laws the sheriff entered his house and sold its contents in order to satisfy an execution against him there is american aristocracy for you and i am sorry to add american justice as justice has got to be administered among us  i was not disappointed in the effect of this narration of what is a sober truth wherever i have told it it has confounded even the most brawling demagogue and momentarily revived in his breast some of those principles of right which god originally planted there american aristocracy in sooth fortunate is the gentleman that can obtain even a reluctant and meagre justice     chapter xxix      how far that little candle throws his beams     so shines a good deed in a naughty world                                         shakespeare   i have said that my narrative of the manner in which justice is sometimes meted out among us was not without its effect on even that rude band of selfish and envious rioters rude because setting at naught reason and the law and selfish because induced so to do by covetousness and the desire to substitute the tenants for those whom they fancied to be better off in the world than they were themselves a profound stillness succeeded and after the bundles of calico had whispered one with another for a moment or two they remained quiet seemingly indisposed just then at least to molest us any farther i thought the moment favorable and fell back to my old station determined to let things take their own course this change and the profound stillness that succeeded brought matters back to the visit of the indians and its object  during the whole time occupied by the advance of the injins the men of the prairies and susquesus had continued nearly as motionless as so many statues it is true that the eyes of flintyheart were on the invaders but he managed to take good heed of them without betraying any undue uneasiness or care beyond this i do affirm that i scarce noted a single sign of even vigilance among these extraordinary beings though manytongues afterward gave me to understand that they knew very well what they were about and then i could not be watching the redmen the whole time now that there was a pause however everybody and thing seemed to revert to the original visit as naturally as if no interruption had occurred manytongues by the way of securing attention called on the injins in an authoritative voice to offer no interruption to the proceedings of the chiefs which had a species of religious sanctity and were not to be too much interfered with with impunity  so long as you keep quiet my warriors will not molest you he added but if any man amongst you has ever been on the preries he must understand enough of the nature of a redskin to know that when hes in airnest he is in airnest men who are on a journey three thousand miles in length dont turn aside for trifles which is a sign that serious business has brought these chiefs here  whether it was that this admonition produced an effect or that curiosity influenced the disguised and armed or that they did not choose to proceed to extremities or that all three considerations had their weight is more than i can say but it is certain the whole band remained stationary quiet and interested observers of what now occurred until an interruption took place which will be related in proper time manytongues who had posted himself near the centre of the piazza to interpret now signified to the chiefs that they might pursue their own purposes in tranquillity after a decent pause the same young warrior who had called up jaaf in the first instance now rose again and with a refinement in politeness that would be looked for in vain in most of the deliberative bodies of civilized men adverted to the circumstance that the negro had not finished his address and might have matter on his mind of which he wished to be delivered this was said simply but distinctly and it was explained to the negro by manytongues who assured him not one among all the chiefs would say a word until the last person on his legs had an opportunity of finishing his address this reserve marks the deportment of those whom we call savages men that have their own fierce and even ruthless customs beyond all controversy but who possess certain other excellent qualities that do not appear to flourish in the civilized state  it was with a good deal of difficulty that we got old jaaf up again for though a famous grumbler he was not much of an orator as it was understood that no chief would speak however until the black had exhausted his right my dear patt had to go and laying one of her ivorylooking hands on the shoulder of the grim old negro persuade him to rise and finish his speech he knew her and she succeeded it being worthy of remark that while this aged black scarce remembered for an hour what occurred confounding dates fearfully often speaking of my grandmother as miss dus and as if she were still a girl he knew every one of the family then living and honored and loved us accordingly at the very moments he would fancy we had been present at scenes that occurred when our greatgrandparents were young people but to the speech  what all them fellow want bundle up in calico like so many squaw growled out jaaf as soon as on his legs and looking intently at the injins ranged as they were in a line four deep quite near the piazza why you let em come masser hugh masser hodge masser malbone masser mordauntwhich you be here now i dont know dere so many and it so hard to member ebberyting oh i so olei do woner when my time come dere sus too he good for nuttin at all once he great walkergreat warriorgreat hunterpretty good fellow for redskin but he quite wore out dont see much use why he lib any longer injin good for nuttin when he cant hunt sometime he make basket and broom but they uses better broom now and injin lose dat business what dem calico debbil want here eh miss patty dere redskin tootwo tree fourall come to see sus woner nigger dont come to see me ole black good as ole redman where dem fellow get all dat calico and put over deir faces masser hodge what all dat mean  these are antirenters jaaf my uncle coldly answered men that wish to own your master hughs farms and relieve him from the trouble of receiving any more rent they cover their faces i presume to conceal their blushes the modesty of their nature sinking under the sense of their own generosity  although it is not very probable that jaaf understood the whole of the speech he comprehended a part for so thoroughly had his feelings been aroused on this subject a year or two earlier when his mind was not quite so much dimmed as at present that the impression made was indelible the effect of what my uncle said nevertheless was most apparent among the injins who barely escaped an outbreak my uncle has been blamed for imprudence in having resorted to irony on such an occasion but after all i am far from sure good did not come of it of one thing i am certain nothing is ever gained by temporizing on the subject of principles that which is right had better always be freely said since it is from the sacrifices that are made of the truth as concession to expediency that error obtains one half its power policy or fear or some other motive kept the rising ire of the injins under however and no interruption occurred in consequence of this speech  what you want here fellow demanded jaaf roughly and speaking as a scold would break out on some intrusive boy home wid yeget out oh i do grow so olei wish i was as i was when young for your sake you varmint what you want wid masser hughs landwhy dat you tink to get gentleems property eh member e time when your fadder come creepin and beggin to masser morder to ask just little farm to lib on and be he tenant and try to do a little for he family like and now come in calico bundle to tell my masser hugh dat he shant be masser of he own land who you i want to knew to come and talk to gentleem in dis poor fashion go homeget outoff wid you or you hear what you dont like  now while there was a good deal of nigger in this argument it was quite as good as that which was sometimes advanced in support of the spirit of the institutions more especially that part of the latter which is connected with aristocracy and poodle usages the negro had an idea that all his massers old and young were better than the rest of the human race while the advocates of the modern improvement seem to think that every right is concentrated in the lower half of the great republican family every gentleman is no gentleman and every blackguard a gentleman for one postulate of their great social proposition and what is more every man in the least elevated above the mass unless so elevated by the mass who consequently retain the power to pull him down again has no rights at all when put in opposition to the cravings of numbers so that after all the negro was not much more out of the way in his fashion of viewing things than the philosophers of industrious honesty happily neither the reasoning of one of these parties nor that of the other has much influence on the actual state of things facts are facts and the flounderings of envy and covetousness can no more shut mens eyes to their existence and prove that black is white than jaafs longenduring and besetting notion that the littlepages are the great of the earth can make us more than what we certainly are i have recorded the negros speech simply to show some who listen only to the misstatements and opinions of those who wish to become owners of other mens farms that there are two sides to the question and in the way of argument i do not see but one is quite as good as the other  one could hardly refrain from smiling notwithstanding the seriousness of the circumstances in which we were placed at the gravity of the indians during the continuance of this queer episode not one of them all rose turned round or manifested the least impatience or even curiosity the presence of two hundred armed men bagged in calico did not induce them to look about them though their previous experience with this gallant corps may possibly have led them to hold it somewhat cheap  the time had now come for the indians to carry out the main design of their visit to ravensnest and prairiefire slowly arose to speak the reader will understand that manytongues translated sentence by sentence all that passed he being expert in the different dialects of the tribes some of which had carried that of the onondagoes to the prairies in this particular the interpreter was a somewhat remarkable man not only rendering what was said readily and without hesitation but energetically and with considerable power it may be well to add however that in writing out the language i may have used english expressions that are a little more choice in some instances than those given by this uneducated person  father commenced prairefire solemnly and with a dignity that it is not usual to find connected with modern oratory the gestures he used being few but of singular force and significancefather the minds of your children are heavy they have travelled over a long and thorny path with moccasons worn out and feet that were getting sore but their minds were light they hoped to look at the face of the upright onondago when they got to the end of the path they have come to the end of that path and they see him he looks as they expected he would look he is like an oak that lightning may burn and the snows cover with moss but which a thousand storms and a hundred winters cannot strip of its leaves he looks like the oldest oak in the forest he is very grand it is pleasant to look on him when we see him we see a chief who knew our fathers fathers and their fathers fathers that is a long time ago he is a tradition and knows all things there is only one thing about him that ought not to be he was born a redman but has lived so long with the palefaces that when he does go away to the happy huntinggrounds we are afraid the good spirits will mistake him for a paleface and point out the wrong path should this happen the redmen would lose the upright of the onondagoes forever it should not be my father does not wish it to be he will think better he will come back among his children and leave his wisdom and advice among the people of his own color i ask him to do this  it is a long path now to the wigwams of redmen it was not so once but the path has been stretched it is a very long path our young men travel it often to visit the graves of their fathers and they know how long it is my tongue is not crooked but it is straight it will not sing a false songit tells my father the truth the path is very long but the palefaces are wonderful what have they not done what will they not do they have made canoes and sledges that fly swift as the birds the deer could not catch them they have wings of fire and never weary they go when men sleep the path is long but it is soon travelled with such wings my father can make the journey and not think of weariness let him try it his children will take good care of him uncle sam will give him venison and he will want nothing then when he starts for the happy huntinggrounds he will not mistake the path and will live with redmen forever  a long solemn pause succeeded this speech which was delivered with great dignity and emphasis i could see that susquesus was touched with this request and at the homage paid his character by having tribes from the prairiestribes of which he had never even heard through traditions in his younger dayscome so far to do justice to his character to request him to go and die in their midst it is true he must have known that the fragments of the old new york tribes had mostly found their way to those distant regions nevertheless it could not but be soothing to learn that even they had succeeded in making so strong an impression in his favor by means of their representations most men of his great age would have been insensible to feelings of this sort such in a great degree was the fact with jaaf but such was not the case with the onondago as he said in his former speech to his visitors his mind dwelt more on the scenes of his youth and native emotions came fresher to his spirit now than they had done even in middle age all that remained of his youthful fire seemed to be awakened and he did not appear that morning except when compelled to walk and in his outward person to be a man who had seen much more than his threescore years and ten  as a matter of course now that the chiefs from the prairies had so distinctly made known the great object of their visit and so vividly portrayed their desire to receive back into the bosom of their communities one of their color and race it remained for the onondago to let the manner in which he viewed this proposition be known the profound stillness that reigned around him must have assured the old indian how anxiously his reply was expected it extended even to the disguised and armed who by this time seemed to be as much absorbed in the interest of this curious scene as any of us who occupied the piazza i do believe that antirentism was momentarily forgotten by all partiestenants as well as landlords landlords as well as tenants i dare say prairiefire had taken his seat three minutes ere susquesus arose during all which time the deep stillness of which i have spoken prevailed  my children answered the onondago whose voice possessed just enough of the hollow tremulousness of age to render it profoundly impressive but who spoke so distinctly as to be heard by all presentmy children we do not know what will happen when we are youngall is young too that we see it is when we grow old that all grows old with us youth is full of hope but age is full of eyes it sees things as they are i have lived in my wigwam alone since the great spirit called out the name of my mother and she hurried away to the happy huntinggrounds to cook venison for my father who was called first my father was a great warrior you did not know him he was killed by the delawares more than a hundred winters ago  i have told you the truth when my mother went to cook venison for her husband i was left alone in my wigwam  here a long pause succeeded during which susquesus appeared to be struggling with his own feelings though he continued erect like a tree firmly rooted as for the chiefs most of them inclined their bodies forward to listen so intense was their interest here and there one of their number explaining in soft guttural tones certain passages in the speech to some other indians who did not fully comprehend the dialect in which they were uttered after a time susquesus proceeded yes i lived alone a young squaw was to have entered my wigwam and staid there she never came she wished to enter it but she did not another warrior had her promise and it was right that she should keep her word her mind was heavy at first but she lived to feel that it is good to be just no squaw has ever lived in any wigwam of mine i do not think ever to be a father but see how different it has turned out i am now the father of all redmen every indian warrior is my son you are my children i will own you when we meet on the pleasant paths beyond the hunts you make today you will call me father and i will call you sons  that will be enough you ask me to go on the long path with you and leave my bones on the prairies i have heard of those huntinggrounds our ancient traditions told us of them toward the rising sun they said is a great salt lake and toward the setting sun great lakes of sweet water across the great salt lake is a distant country filled with palefaces who live in large villages and in the midst of cleared fields toward the setting sun were large cleared fields too but no palefaces and few villages some of our wise men thought these fields were the fields of redmen following the palefaces round after the sun some thought they were fields in which the palefaces were following them i think this was the truth the redman cannot hide himself in any corner where the palefaces will not find him the great spirit will have it so it is his will the redman must submit  my sons the journey you ask me to make is too long for old age i have lived with the palefaces until onehalf of my heart is white though the other half is red onehalf is filled with the traditions of my fathers the other half is filled with the wisdom of the stranger i cannot cut my heart in two pieces i must all go with you or all stay here the body must stay with the heart and both must remain where they have now dwelt so long i thank you my children but what you wish can never come to pass  you see a very old man but you see a very unsettled mind there are red traditions and paleface traditions both speak of the great spirit but only one speak of his son a soft voice has been whispering in my ear lately much of the son of god do they speak to you in that way on the prairies i know not what to think i wish to think what is right but it is not easy to understand  here susquesus paused then he took his seat with the air of one who is at a loss how to explain his own feelings prairiefire waited a respectful time for him to continue his address but perceiving that he rose not he stood up himself to request a further explanation  my father has spoken wisdom he said and his children have listened they have not heard enough they wish to hear more if my father is tired of standing he can sit his children do not ask him to stand they ask to know where that soft voice came from and what it said  susquesus did not rise now but he prepared for a reply mr warren was standing quite near him and mary was leaning on his arm he signed for the father to advance a step or two in complying with which the parent brought forth the unconscious child also  see my children resumed susquesus this is a great medicine of the palefaces he talks always of the great spirit and of his goodness to men it is his business to talk of the happy huntingground and of good and bad palefaces i cannot tell you whether he does any good or not many such talk of these things constantly among the whites but i can see little change and i have lived among them now more than eighty winters and summersyes near ninety the land is changed so much that i hardly know it but the people do not alter see there here are menpalefaces in calico bags why do they run about and dishonor the redman by calling themselves injins i will tell you  there was now a decided movement among the virtuous and industrious though a strong desire to hear the old man out prevented any violent interruption at that time i question if ever men listened more intently than we all lent our faculties now to ascertain what the upright of the onondagoes thought of antirentism i received the opinions he expressed with the greater alacrity because i knew he was a living witness of most of what he related and because i was clearly of opinion that he knew quite as much of the subject as many who rose in the legislative halls to discuss the subject  these men are not warriors continued susquesus they hide their faces and they carry rifles but they frighten none but the squaws and pappooses when they take a scalp it is because they are a hundred and their enemies one they are not braves why do they come at all what do they want they want the land of this young chief my children all the land far and near was ours the palefaces came with their papers and made laws and said it is well we want this land there is plenty farther west for you redmen go there and hunt and fish and plant your corn and leave us this land our red brethren did as they were asked to do the palefaces had it as they wished they made laws and sold the land as the redmen sell the skins of beavers when the money was paid each paleface got a deed and thought he owned all that he had paid for but the wicked spirit that drove out the redman is now about to drive off the paleface chiefs it is the same devil and it is no other he wanted land then and he wants land now there is one difference and it is this when the paleface drove off the redman there was no treaty between them they had not smoked together and given wampum and signed a paper if they had it was to agree that the redman should go away and the paleface stay when the paleface drives off the paleface there is a treaty they have smoked together and given wampum and signed a paper this is the difference indian will keep his word with indian paleface will not keep his word with paleface  susquesus stopped speaking and the eye of every chief was immediately and for the first time that morning turned on the disguised and armedthe virtuous and hardworking a slight movement occurred in the band but no outbreak took place and in the midst of the sensation that existed eaglesflight slowly arose the native dignity and ease of his manner more than compensated for his personal appearance and he now seemed to us all one of those by no means unusual instances of the power of the mind to overshadow and even to obliterate the imperfections of the body before the effect of what susquesus had just said was lost this eloquent and muchpractised orator began his address his utterance was highly impressive being so deliberate with pauses so well adjusted as to permit manytongues to give full effect to each syllable he translated  my brethren said eaglesflight addressing the injins and the other auditors rather than any one else you have heard the words of age they are the words of wisdom they are the words of truth the upright of the onondagoes cannot lie he never could the great spirit made him a just indian and as the great spirit makes an indian so he is my brethren i will tell you his story it will be good for you to hear it we have heard your story first from the interpreter now from susquesus it is a bad story we were made sorrowful when we heard it what is right should be done what is wrong should not be done there are bad redmen and good redmen there are bad palefaces and good palefaces the good redmen and good palefaces do what is right the bad what is wrong it is the same with both the great spirit of the indian and the great spirit of the white man are alike so are the wicked spirits there is no difference in this  my brethren a redman knows in his heart when he does what is right and when he does what is wrong he does not want to be told he tells himself his face is red and he cannot change color the paint is too thick when he tells himself how much wrong he has done he goes into the bushes and is sorry when he comes out he is a better man  my brethren it is different with a paleface he is white and uses no stones for paint when he tells himself that he has done wrong his face can paint itself everybody can see that he is ashamed he does not go into the bushes it would do no good he paints himself so quickly that there is no time he hides his face in a calico bag this is not good but it is better than to be pointed at with the finger  my brethren the upright of the onondagoes has never run into the bushes because he was ashamed there has been no need of it he has not told himself he was wicked he has not put his face in a calico bag he cannot paint himself like a paleface  my brethren listen i will tell you a story a long time ago everything was very different here the clearings were small and the woods large then the redmen were many and the palefaces few now it is different you know how it is today  my brethren i am talking of what was a hundred winters since we were not born then susquesus was then young and strong and active he could run with the deer and battle with the bear he was a chief because his fathers were chiefs before him the onondagoes knew him and loved him not a warpath was opened that he was not the first to go on it no other warrior could count so many scalps no young chief had so many listeners at the councilfire the onondagoes were proud that they had so great a chief and one so young they thought he would live a long time and they should see him and be proud of him for fifty winters more  my brethren susquesus has lived twice fifty winters longer but he has not lived them with his own people no he has been a stranger among the onondagoes all that time the warriors he knew are dead the wigwams that he went into have fallen to the earth with time the graves have crumbled and the sons sons of his companions walk heavily with old age susquesus is there you see him he sees you he can walk he speaks he sees he is a living tradition why is this so the great spirit has not called him away he is a just indian and it is good that he be kept here that all redmen may know how much he is loved so long as he stays no redmen need want a calico bag  my brethren the younger days of susquesus the trackless were happy when he had seen twenty winters he was talked of in all the neighboring tribes the scalp notches were a great many when he had seen thirty winters no chief of the onondagoes had more honor or more power he was first among the onondagoes there was but one fault in him he did not take a squaw into his wigwam death comes when he is not looked for so does marriage at length my father became like other men and wished for a squaw it happened in this way  my brethren redmen have laws as well as the palefaces if there is a difference it is in keeping those laws a law of the redmen gives every warrior his prisoners if he bring off a warrior he is his if a squaw she is his this is right he can take the scalp of the warrior he can take the squaw into his wigwam if it be empty a warrior named waterfowl brought in a captive girl of the delawares she was called ouithwith and was handsomer than the hummingbird the waterfowl had his ears open and heard how beautiful she was he watched long to take her and he did take her she was his and he thought to take her into his wigwam when it was empty three moons passed before that could be in the meantime susquesus saw ouithwith and ouithwith saw susquesus their eyes were never off each other he was the noblest moose of the woods in her eyes she was the spotted fawn in his he wished to ask her to his wigwam she wished to go  my brethren susquesus was a great chief the waterfowl was only a warrior one had power and authority the other had neither but there is authority among redmen beyond that of the chief it is the redmans law ouithwith belonged to the waterfowl and she did not belong to susquesus a great council was held and men differed some said that so useful a chief so renowned a warrior as susquesus ought to be the husband of ouithwith some said her husband ought to be the waterfowl for he had brought her out from among the delawares a great difficulty arose on this question and the whole six nations took part in it many warriors were for the law but most were for susquesus they loved him and thought he would make the best husband for the delaware girl for six moons the quarrel thickened and a dark cloud gathered over the path that led among the tribes warriors who had taken scalps in company looked at each other as the panther looks at the deer some were ready to dig up the hatchet for the law some for the pride of the onondagoes and the hummingbird of the delawares the squaws took sides with susquesus far and near they met to talk together and they even threatened to light a councilfire and smoke around it like warriors and chiefs  brethren things could not stand so another moon ouithwith must go into the wigwam of the waterfowl or into the wigwam of susquesus the squaws said she should go into the wigwam of susquesus and they met together and led her to his door as she went along that path ouithwith looked at her feet with her eyes but her heart leaped like the bounding fawn when playing in the sun she did not go in at the door the waterfowl was there and forbade it he had come alone his friends were but few while the heads and arms of the friends of susquesus were as plenty as the berries on the bush  my brethren that command of the waterfowls was like a wall of rock before the door of the tracklesss wigwam ouithwith could not go in the eyes of susquesus said no while his heart said yes he offered the waterfowl his rifle his powder all his skins his wigwam but waterfowl would rather have his prisoner and answered no take my scalp he said you are strong and can do it but do not take my prisoner  my brethren susquesus then stood up in the midst of the tribe and opened his mind the waterfowl is right he said she is his by our laws and what the laws of the redman say the redman must do when the warrior is about to be tormented and he asks for time to go home and see his friends does he not come back at the day and hour agreed on shall i susquesus the first chief of the onondagoes be stronger than the law nomy face would be forever hid in the bushes did that come to pass it should not beit shall not be take her waterfowl she is yours deal kindly by her for she is as tender as the wren when it first quits the nest i must go into the woods for awhile when my mind is at peace susquesus will return  brethren the stillness in that tribe while susquesus was getting his rifle and his horn and his best moccasons and his tomahawk was like that which comes in the darkness men saw him go but none dare follow he left no trail and he was called the trackless his mind was never at peace for he never came back summer and winter came and went often before the onondagoes heard of him among the palefaces all that time the waterfowl lived with ouithwith in his wigwam and she bore him children the chief was gone but the law remained go you men of the palefaces who hide your shame in calico bags and do the same follow the example of an indianbe honest like the upright of the onondagoes  while this simple narrative was drawing to a close i could detect the signs of great uneasiness among the leaders of the calico bags the biting comparison between themselves and their own course and an indian and his justice was intolerable to them for nothing has more conduced to the abuses connected with antirentism than the widespread delusion that prevails in the land concerning the omnipotency of the masses the error is deeply rooted which persuades men that fallible parts can make an infallible whole it was offensive to their selfconceit and menacing to their success a murmur ran through the assembly and a shout followed the injins rattled their rifles most relying on intimidation to effect their purpose but a few seemed influenced by a worse intention and i have never doubted that blood would have been shed in the next minute the indians now standing to their arms had not the sheriff of the county suddenly appeared on the piazza with jack dunning at his elbow this unexpected apparition produced a pause during which the disguised and armed fell back some twenty yards and the ladies rushed into the house as for my uncle and myself we were as much astonished as any there at this interruption     chapter xxx      strong sense deep feeling passions strong       a hate of tyrant and of knave      a love of right a scorn of wrong       of coward and of slave                         hallecks wild rose of alloway   although experience has shown that the appearance of a sheriff is by no means a pledge of the appearance of a friend of the law in this antirent movement in our instance the fact happened to be so it was known to the disguised and armed that this functionary was disposed to do his duty30 one of the rank absurdities into which democracy has fallen and democracy is no more infallible than individual democrats has been to make the officers of the militia and the sheriffs of counties elective the consequences are that the militia is converted into a farce and the execution of the laws in a particular county is very much dependent on the pleasure of that county to have them executed or not the last is a capital arrangement for the resident debtor for instance though absent creditors are somewhat disposed to find fault but all this is of no great moment since the theories for laws and governments in vogue just now are of such a character as would render laws and governments quite unnecessary at all were they founded in truth restraints of all kinds can only be injurious when they are imposed on perfection  footnote 30 the editor may as well say here that for obvious reasons the names counties etc used in these manuscripts are feigned the real localities being close enough to those mentioned for the double purposes of truth and fiction as one of the honorable gentlemen of the legislature has quoted our references to provincial feelings and notions with a magnificence that proves how thoroughly he is a man of the world himself we will tell all the rest of the human race who may happen to read this book that we have made this explanation lest that comprehensive view of things which has hitherto been so eager because a street and a house are named in the pages of a fiction to suppose that everybody is to believe they know the very individual who dwelt in it should fancy that our allusions are to this or that particular functionaryeditor  the instant the commotion commenced and the ladies fled i took seneca and his fellowprisoner by the arm and led them into the library this i did conceiving it to be unfair to keep prisoners in a situation of danger this i did too without reflecting in the least on anything but the character of the act returning to the piazza immediately i was not missed and was a witness of all that passed  as has been intimated this particular sheriff was known to be unfavorable to the antirent movement and no one supposing he would appear in the midst unsupported in such a scene the injins fell back thus arresting the danger of an immediate collision it has since been privately intimated to me that some among them after hearing the narrative of eaglesflight really felt ashamed that a redskin should have a more lively sense of justice than a white man whatever may be said of the hardships of the tenants and of poodleusages and of aristocracy and fat hens by the leaders in this matter it by no means follows that those leaders believe in their own theories and arguments on the contrary it is generally the case with such men that they keep themselves quite free from the excitement that it is their business to awaken in others resembling the celebrated john wilkes who gravely said to george iii in describing the character of a former cooperator in agitation he was a wilkesite sir i never was  the unexpected appearance of dunning the offending agent too was not without its effectfor they who were behind the curtains found it difficult to believe that he would dare to show himself at ravensnest without sufficient support those who thought thus however did not know jack dunning he had a natural and judicious aversion to being tarred and feathered it is true but when it was necessary to expose himself no man did it more freely the explanation of his unlookedfor arrival is simply this  uneasy at our manner of visiting ravensnest this trustworthy friend after the delay of a day or two determined to follow us on reaching the county he heard of the firing of the barn and of the attempt on the house and went in quest of the sheriff without a moments delay as the object of dunning was to get the ladies out of the lions den he did not wait for the summoning of the posse comitatus but hiring a dozen resolute fellows they were armed and all set out in a body for the nest when within a mile or two of the house the rumor reached the party that we were besieged and it became expedient to have recourse to some manoeuvring in order to throw succor into the garrison dunning was familiar with all the windings and turnings of the place having passed many a month at the nest with my uncle and father both as man and boy and he knew the exact situation of the cliff court and of the various peculiar features of the place among other arrangements that had been made of late years a door had been opened at the end of the long gallery which led through one of the wings and a flight of steps been built against the rocks by means of which certain paths and walks that meandered through the meadows and followed the windings of the stream might be reached dunning determined to attempt an ascent from this quarter trusting to make himself heard by some one within should he find the door fastened everything succeeded to his wishesthe cook alone of all the household being at her post in the other wing and seeing him the instant he presented himself on the upper part of the steps jack dunnings face was so well known at the nest that the good woman did not hesitate a moment about admitting him and he thus penetrated into the building followed by all his party the last he kept concealed by sending them into the chambers while he and the sheriff drew near the door and heard most of the speech of eaglesflight the attention of everybody being given to the narrative the reader knows the rest  i might as well say at once however that opportunity who by her position had seen the entrance of dunning and his party no sooner found herself alone with the prisoners than she unbound them and showed them the means of flight by the same passage door and steps at least such has been my supposition for the sister has never been questioned on the subject seneca and his corascal vanished and have not since been seen in our part of the country in consequence of the flight no one has ever complained of either for arson the murder of steele the deputysheriff of delaware has given a check to the injin system and awakened a feeling in the country that was not to be resisted in that form at least by men engaged in a scheme so utterly opposed to the first principles of honesty as antirentism  when i regained the piazza after thrusting seneca into the library the injins had fallen back to the distance of twenty or thirty yards from the piazza in evident confusion while the indians cool and collected stood to their arms watchful as crouching panthers but held in hand by the calmness with which their leaders watched the progress of events the sheriff now required the first to disperse as violators of the law with the penalties of which he menaced them in a voice sufficiently clear and distinct to make itself audible there was a moment during which the injins seemed undecided they had come with the full intent to inflict on my uncle and myself the punishment of the tarbucket with the hope of frightening us into some sort of a compromise the cowardly expedient of a hundred men attacking and annoying one being particularly in favor with a certain class of those ultrafriends of liberty who fancy that they alone possess all the public virtue of the nation which public virtue justifies any of their acts all of a sudden the entire body of these virtuous citizens who found it necessary to hide their blushes beneath calico fell rapidly back observing a little order at first which soon degenerated however into confusion and shortly after into a downright scampering flight the fact was that dunnings men began to show themselves at the windows of the chambers thrusting muskets and rifles out before them and the disguised and armed as has invariably been the case in the antirent disturbances exhibited a surprising facility at the retreat if he is thricearmed who hath his quarrel just ten times is he a coward who hath his quarrel unjust this is the simple solution of the cowardice that has been so generally shown by those who have been engaged in this injin warfare causing twenty to chase one secret attempts on the lives of sentinels and all the other violations of manly feeling that have disgraced the proceedings of the heroes  as soon as released from all immediate apprehension on the score of the injins we had time to attend to the indians the warriors gazed after those who were caricaturing their habits and most of all their spirit with silent contempt and prairiefire who spoke a little english said to me with emphasis poor injinpoor triberun away from own whoop this was positively every syllable the men of the prairies deigned to bestow on these disturbers of the public peace the agents of covetousness who prowl about at night like wolves ready to seize the stray lamb but are quick to sneak off at the growl of the mastiff one cannot express himself in terms too harsh of such wretches who in no instance have manifested a solitary spark of the true spirit of freemen having invariably quailed before authority when that authority has assumed in the least the aspect of its power and as invariably trampled it underfoot whenever numbers put danger out of the question  old susquesus had been a quiet observer of all that passed he knew the nature of the disturbance and understood everything material that was connected with the outbreaks as soon as order was restored on the piazza he rose once more to address his guests  my children he said solemnly you hear my voice for the last time even the wren cannot sing forever the very eagles wing gets tired in time i shall soon cease to speak when i reach the happy huntinggrounds of the onondagoes i will tell the warriors i meet there of your visit your fathers shall know that their sons still love justice let the palefaces sign papers and laugh at them afterward the promise of a redman is his law if he is made a prisoner and his conquerors wish to torment him they are too generous to do so without letting him go to his tribe to take leave of his friends when the time is reached he comes back if he promises skins he brings them though no law can follow into the woods to force him to do so his promise goes with him his promise is stronger than chainsit brings him back  my children never forget this you are not palefaces to say one thing and do another what you say you do when you make a law you keep it that is right no redman wants anothers wigwam if he wants a wigwam he builds one himself it is not so with the palefaces the man who has no wigwam tries to get away his neighbors while he does this he reads in his bible and goes to his church i have sometimes thought the more he reads and prays the more he tries to get into his neighbors wigwam so it seems to an indian but it may not be so  my children the redman is his own master he goes and comes as he pleases if the young men strike the warpath he can strike it too he can go on the warpath or the hunt or he can stay in his wigwam all he has to do is to keep his promise not steal and not to go into another redmans wigwam unasked he is his own master he does not say so he is so how is it with the palefaces they say they are free when the sun rises they say they are free when the sun is over their heads they say they are free when the sun goes down behind the hills they never stop talking of their being their own masters they talk of that more than they read their bibles i have lived near a hundred winters among them and know what they are they do that then they take away anothers wigwam they talk of liberty then they say you shall have this farm and you shant have that they talk of liberty and call to one another to put on calico bags that fifty men may tar and feather one they talk of liberty and want everything their own way  my children these palefaces might go back with you to the prairies and learn to do what is right i do not wonder they hide their faces in bags they feel ashamed they ought to feel ashamed  my children this is the last time you will hear my voice the tongue of an old man cannot move forever this is my counsel do what is right the great spirit will tell you what that is let it be done what my son said of me is true it was hard to do the feelings yearned to do otherwise but it was not done in a little time peace came on my spirit and i was glad i could not go back to live among my people for i was afraid of doing what was wrong i stayed among the palefaces and made friends here my children farewell do what is right and you will be happier than the richest paleface who does what is wrong  susquesus took his seat and at the same time each of the redskins advanced and shook his hand the indians make few professions but let their acts speak for them not a syllable was uttered by one of those rude warriors as he took his leave of susquesus each man had willingly paid this tribute to one whose justice and selfdenial were celebrated in their traditions and having paid it he went his way satisfied if not altogether happy each man shook hands too with all on the piazza and to us they expressed their thanks for their kind treatment my uncle ro had distributed the remains of his trinkets among them and they left us with the most amicable feelings still there was nothing dramatic in their departure it was simple as their arrival they had come to see the upright of the onondagoes had fulfilled their mission and were ready to depart depart they did and as i saw their line winding along the highway the episode of such a visit appeared to us all more like a dream than reality  no interruption occurred to the return of these men and half an hour after they had left the piazza we saw them winding their way up the hill descending which we had first seen them  well hugh said jack dunning two or three hours later what is your decision will you remain here or will you go to your own place in westchester  i will remain here until it is our pleasure to depart then we will endeavor to be as free as indians and go where we please provided always we do not go into our neighbors wigwam against his will  jack dunning smiled and he paced the library once or twice before he resumed  they told me as soon as i got into the county that you and all belonging to you were preparing to retreat the morning after the attempt to fire your house  one of those amiable perversions of the truth that so much embellish the morality of the whole affair what men wish they fancy and what they fancy they say the girls even protest they would not quit the house while it has a roof to cover their heads but jack whence comes this spirit  i should think that was the last question a reasonably informed man need ask answered dunning laughing it is very plain where it comes from it comes from the devil and has every one of the characteristics of his handiwork in the first place love of money or covetousness is at its root then lies are its agents its first and most pretending lie is that of liberty every principle of which it tramples underfoot then come in the fifty auxiliaries in the way of smaller inventions denying the facts of the original settlement of the country fabricating statements concerning its progress and asserting directly in the teeth of truth such statements as it is supposed will serve a turn31 there can be no mistaking the origin of such contrivance or all that has been taught us of good and evil is a fiction really hodge i am astonished that so sensible a man should have asked the question  footnote 31 the frightful propensity to effect its purposes by lying has come to such a head in the country as seriously to threaten the subversion of all justice without adverting to general facts two circumstances directly connected with this antirent question force themselves on my attention they refer to large estates that were inherited by an englishman who passed half of a long life in the country in public legislative documents it has been pretended that the question of his title to his estates is still open when the published reports of the highest court of the country show that a decision was made in his favor thirty years since and in reference to his heir it has been officially stated that he has invariably refused to give any leases but such as run on lives now it is of little moment whether this be true or not since the law allows every man to do as he may please in this respect but the fact as i understand from the agent who draws the leases is precisely the reverse of that which has been openly stated in this legislative document the present possessor of the estate in question having been earnestly solicited by the tenants to grant new leases on lives and absolutely refused to comply in this instance the legislature doubtless have been deceived by the interested representations of antirenterseditor  perhaps you are right jack but to what will it lead  aye that is not so easily answered the recent events in delaware have aroused the better feelings of the country and there is no telling what it may do one thing however i hold to be certain the spirit connected with this affair must be put down thoroughly effectually completely or we are lost let it once be understood in the country that men can control their own indebtedness and fashion contracts to suit their own purposes by combinations and numbers and pandemonium would soon be a paradise compared to new york there is not a single just ground of complaint in the nature of any of these leases whatever hardships may exist in particular cases but admitting that there were false principles of social life embodied in the relation of landlord and tenant as it exists among us it would be a far greater evil to attempt a reform under such a combination than to endure the original wrong  i suppose these gentry fancy themselves strong enough to thrust their interests into politics and hope to succeed by that process but antimasonry and various other schemes of that sort have failed hitherto and this may fail along with it that is a redeeming feature of the institutions jack you may humbug for a time but the humbuggery is not apt to last forever it is only to be regretted that the really upright portion of the community are so long in making themselves felt would they only be onehalf as active as the miscreants we should get along well enough  the result is unknown the thing may be put down totally effectually and in a way to kill the snake not scotch it or it may be met with only halfway measures in which case it will remain like a disease in the human system always existing always menacing relapses quite possibly to be the agent of the final destruction of the body  my uncle nevertheless was as good as his word and did remain in the country where he is yet our establishment has received another reinforcement however and a change occurred shortly after our visit from the injins in the policy of the antirenters the two giving us a feeling of security that might otherwise have been wanting the reinforcement came from certain young men who have found their way across from the springs and become guests at the nest they are all old acquaintances of mine most of them schoolfellows and also admirers of the young ladies each of my uncles wards the coldbrooke and the marston has an accepted lover as we now discovered circumstances that have left me unobstructed in pursuing my suit with mary warren i have found patt a capital ally for she loves the dear girl almost as i do myself and has been of great service in the affair i am conditionally accepted though mr warrens consent has not been asked indeed i much question if the good rector has the least suspicion of what is in the wind as for my uncle ro he knew all about it though i have never breathed a syllable to him on the subject fortunately he is well satisfied with the choice made by his two wards and this has somewhat mitigated the disappointment  my uncle ro is not in the least mercenary and the circumstance that mary warren has not a cent gives him no concern he is indeed so rich himself that he knows it is in his power to make any reasonable addition to my means and if necessary to place me above the dangers of antirentism the following is a specimen of his humor and of his manner of doing things when the humor takes him we were in the library one morning about a week after the injins were shamed out of the field by the indians for that was the secret of their final disappearance from our part of the country but one morning about a week after their last visit my grandmother my uncle patt and i were seated in the library chatting over matters and things when my uncle suddenly exclaimed  by the way hugh i have a piece of important news to communicate to you news affecting your interests to the tune of fifty thousand dollars  no more antirent dangers i hope roger said my grandmother anxiously  hugh has little to apprehend from that source just now the supreme court of the united states is his buckler and it is broad enough to cover his whole body as for his future leases if he will take my advice he will not grant one for a term longer than five years and then his tenants will become clamorous petitioners to the legislature to allow them to make their own bargains shame will probably bring your freetrade men round and the time will come when your doubledistilled friends of liberty will begin to see it is a very indifferent sort of freedom which will not permit a wealthy landlord to part with his farms for a long period or a poor husbandman to make the best bargain in his power no no hugh has nothing serious to apprehend just now at least from that source whatever may come of it hereafter the loss to which i allude is much more certain and to the tune of fifty thousand dollars i repeat  that is a good deal of money for me to lose sir i answered but little disturbed by the intelligence and it might embarrass me to raise so large a sum in a hurry nevertheless i confess to no very great concern on the subject notwithstanding your announcement i have no debts and the title to all i possess is indisputable unless it shall be decided that a royal grant is not to be tolerated by republicans  all very fine master hugh but you forget that you are the natural heir of my estate patt knows that she is to have a slice of it when she marries and i am now about to make a settlement of just as much more on another young lady by way of marriage portion  roger exclaimed my grandmother surely you do not mean what you say of as much more  of precisely that money my dear mother i have taken a fancy to a young lady and as i cannot marry her myself i am determined to make her a good match so far as money is concerned for some one else  but why not marry her yourself i asked older men than yourself marry every day  ay widowers i grant you they will marry until they are a thousand but it is not so with us bachelors let a man once get fairly past forty and it is no easy matter to bring him to the sacrifice no jack dunnings being here is the most fortunate thing in the world and so i have set him at work to draw up a settlement on the young lady to whom i refer without any rights to her future husband let him turn out to be whom he may  it is mary warren exclaimed my sister in a tone of delight  my uncle smiled and he tried to look demure but i cannot say that he succeeded particularly well  it isit isit is mary warren and uncle ro means to give her a fortune added patt bounding across the floor like a young deer throwing herself into her guardians lap hugging and kissing him as if she were nothing but a child though a fine young woman of nineteen yes it is mary warren and uncle hodge is a delightful old gentlemanno a delightful young gentleman and were he only thirty years younger he should have his own heiress for a wife himself good dear generous sensible uncle ro this is so like him after all his disappointment for i know hugh his heart was set on your marrying henrietta  and what has my marrying or not marrying henrietta to do with this settlement of fifty thousand dollars on miss warren the young ladies are not even connected i believe  oh you know how all such things are managed said patt blushing and laughing at the passing allusion to matrimony even in another mary warren will not be mary warren always  who will she be then demanded uncle ro quickly  but patt was too true to the rights and privileges of her sex to say anything directly that might seem to commit her friend she patted her uncles cheek therefore like a saucy minx as she was colored still higher looked archly at me then averted her eyes consciously as if betraying a secret and returned to her seat as demurely as if the subject had been one of the gravest character  but are you serious in what you have told us roger asked my grandmother with more interest than i supposed the dear old lady would be apt to feel on such a subject is not this settlement a matter of fancy  true as the gospel my dear mother  and is martha right is mary warren really the favored young lady  for a novelty patt is right  does mary warren know of your intention or has her father been consulted in the matter  both know of it we had it all over together last evening and mr warren consents  to what i cried springing to my feet the emphasis on the last word being too significant to be overlooked  to receive hugh roger littlepage which is my own name recollect for a soninlaw and what is more the young lady is agreeable  we all know that she is more than agreeable put in patt she is delightful excellent agreeable is no word to apply to mary warren  pshaw girl if you had travelled now you would know that this expression is cockney english for agreeing to a thing mary warren agrees to become the wife of hugh roger littlepage and i settle fifty thousand dollars on her in consideration of matrimony  this hugh roger littlepage cried patt throwing an arm around my neck not that hugh roger littlepage do but add that dearest uncle and i will kiss you for an hour  excuse me my child a fourth of that time would be as much as i could reasonably expect i believe you are right however as i do not remember that this hugh roger had any connection with the affair unless it were to give his money i shall deny none of your imputations  just as this was said the door of the library was slowly opened and mary warren appeared the moment she saw who composed our party she would have drawn back but my grandmother kindly bade her come in  i was afraid of disturbing a family party maam mary timidly answered  patt darted forward threw her arm around marys waist and drew her into the room closing and locking the door all this was done in a way to attract attention and as if the young lady wished to attract attention we all smiled but mary who seemed half pleased half frightened  it is a family party cried patt kissing her affianced sister and no one else shall be admitted to it unless good mr warren come to claim his place uncle ro has told us all about it and we know all  mary hid her face in patts bosom but it was soon drawn out by my dear grandmother to kiss it then my uncle had his turn and patt hers after this the whole party except mary and i slid out of the room andyes and then it was my turn  we are not yet married but the day is named the same is true with respect to the wards and even patt blushes and my grandmother smiles occasionally when gentlemen who are travelling in egypt just now are named the last letters from young beekman they tell me say that he was then there the three marriages are to take place in st andrews church mr warren being engaged to officiate  the reader will be surprised to hear two things my engagement with the daughter of a poor clergyman has produced great scandal among the antirenters they who so loudly decry aristocracy the objection is that the match is not equal that equality which is the consequence of social position connections education and similarity of habits thoughts and if you will prejudices is all thrown away on these persons they have no notion of its existence but they can very well understand that the owner of an unencumbered and handsome estate is richer than the heiress of a poor divine who can just make the year meet on 500 per annum i let them grumble as i know they must and will find fault with something connected with myself until they have got away my land or are satisfied it is not to be had as for opportunity i have been assured that she threatens to sue me for a breach of promise nor should i be at all surprised were she actually to make the attempt it is by no means unusual when a person sets his or her whole soul on a particular object to imagine circumstances favorable to his or her views which never had an existence and opportunity may fancy that what i have heard has been the buzzing in her own ear then the quackery of legislatures has set the ladies at work in earnest and he will soon be a fortunate youth who can pass through his days of celibacy without some desperate assault legal or moral from the other sex besides nothing can be out of the way when it is found that the more popular and most numerous branch of the legislature of new york really believes it can evade that solemn provision of the constitution of the united states which says no state shall pass any law impairing the obligations of contracts by enacting as they can regulate the statute of descent that whenever a landlord dies the tenant by applying to the chancellor can have his leasehold tenure converted into a mortgage on discharging which the land will be his unencumbered we have heard of a thimblerig administration in england and really that industrious nation seems to have exported the breed to this country how many of those who voted for such a law will like to see the ayes and noes on the journals of the assembly ten years hence if there should be one such man left in the state he will be an object of humane commiseration we have had many efforts at legislative chicanery and some that have been tolerably clever but this is a palpable experiment in the same way made for a reason that everybody understands that has not even the negative merit of ingenuity our own courts will probably disregard it should the senate even concur and as for those of the united states they will out of all doubt treat it as it ought to be treated and brand it with ignominy the next step will be to pass a law regulating descents as it is called under the provisions of which the debtors of the deceased can meet his obligations with a coin technically called puppies  jaaf drivels away the black occasionally mumbles out his sentiments concerning past events and the state of the country an antirenter he regards as he would a thief and makes no bones of saying so sometimes he blunders on a very good remark in connection with the subject and one he made no later than yesterday is worthy of notice  what dem feller want masser hugh he demanded deys got one half of deir farms and now dey wants tudder half spose i own a cow or a sheep in parnership what right i got to say i will have him all gosh dere no sich law in ole time den who ebber see sich poor injins redskins misrubble enough make e bess of him but dis injin so misrubble dat i doesnt woner you cant bear him oh how ole i do giti do tink ole sus cant last much longer too  old susquesus still survives but an object of great hatred to all the antirenters far and near the injin system has been broken up temporarily at least but the spirit which brought it into existence survives under the hypocritical aspect of human rights the upright of the onondagoes is insensible of the bad feeling which is so active against him nor is it probable that most of those who entertain this enmity are conscious of the reason which is simply the fact that he is a man who respected laws to the making of which he was a party and preferred to suffer rather than be guilty of an act of injustice     note by the editor   here the manuscript of mr hugh roger littlepage jun terminates that gentlemans feelings have probably forbidden his relating events so recent as those which have since occurred it remains therefore for us to add a few words  jaaf died about ten days since railing at the redskins to the last and talking about his young massers and missuses as long as he had breath as for his own descendants he had not been heard to name them for the last forty years  susquesus still survives but the injins are all defunct public opinion has at last struck that tribe out of existence and it is hoped that their calico bags have been transmitted to certain politicians among us who as certain as the sun rises and sets will find them useful to conceal their own countenances when contrition and shame come as contrition and shame will be sure to succeed such conduct as theirs  it may be well to add a word on the subject of the tone of this book it is the language of a man who feels that he has been grievously injured and who writes with the ardor of youth increased by a sense of wrong as editors we have nothing more to do with that than to see while calling things by their right names that language too strong for the public taste should not be introduced into our pages as to the moral and political principles connected with this matter we are wholly of the side of the messrs littlepage though we do not think it necessary to adopt all their phrasesphrases that may be natural to men of their situations but which would be out of place perhaps in the mouths of those who act solely in the capacity of essayists and historians  to concludemr littlepage and mary warren were married in st andrews church a very few days since we met the young gentleman on his wedding tour no later than yesterday and he assured us that provided with such a companion he was ready to change his domicile to any other part of the union and that he had selected washington for the express purpose of being favorably situated for trying the validity of the laws of the united states as opposed to the thimblerigging of the new york legislature it is his intention to have every question connected with the covenants of his leases clearly settled that of taxing the landlord for property on which the tenant has covenanted to pay all taxes that of distress for rent when distress must precede the reentry stipulated for by the leases and that of any other trick or device which the brains of your smallpotato legislature may invent in order to wrong him out of his property as for ourselves we can only say god give him success for we are most deeply impressed that the more valuable parts of the institutions of this country can be preserved only by crushing into the dust this nefarious spirit of cupidity which threatens the destruction of all moral feeling and every sense of right that remains among us  in our view oregon mexico and europe united against us do not threaten this nation with onehalf as much real danger as that which menaces at this moment from an enemy that is now in possession of many of its strongholds and which is incessantly working its evil under the cry of liberty while laying deeper the foundation of a most atrocious tyranny  i forgot to add mr littlepage significantly remarked at parting that should washington fail him he has the refuge of florence open where he can reside among the other victims of oppression with the advantage of being admired as a refugee from republican tyranny   the end
