end     none eer ran compass more than they intend     pope  in two volumes  vol i   new york  published by burgess  stringer  1846  entered according to the act of congress in the year 1846 by  j fenimore cooper  in the clerks office of the district court for the northern district of new york   stereotyped by j fagan philadelphia     preface   this book closes the series of the littlepage manuscripts which have been given to the world as containing a fair account of the comparative sacrifices of time money and labour made respectively by the landlord and the tenants on a new york estate together with the manner in which usages and opinions are changing among us as well as certain of the reasons of these changes the discriminating reader will probably be able to trace in these narratives the progress of those innovations on the great laws of morals which are becoming so very manifest in connection with this interest setting at naught the plainest principles that god has transmitted to man for the government of his conduct and all under the extraordinary pretence of favouring liberty in this downward course our picture embraces some of the proofs of that looseness of views on the subject of certain species of property which is in a degree perhaps inseparable from the semibarbarous condition of a new settlement the gradation of the squatter from him who merely makes his pitch to crop a few fields in passing to him who carries on the business by wholesale and last though not least in this catalogue of marauders the antirenter  it would be idle to deny that the great principle which lies at the bottom of antirentism if principle it can be called is the assumption of a claim that the interests and wishes of numbers are to be respected though done at a sacrifice of the clearest rights of the few that this is not liberty but tyranny in its worst form every rightthinking and rightfeeling man must be fully aware every one who knows much of the history of the past and of the influence of classes must understand that whenever the educated the affluent and the practised choose to unite their means of combination and money to control the political destiny of a country they become irresistible making the most subservient tools of those very masses who vainly imagine they are the true guardians of their own liberties the wellknown election of 1840 is a memorable instance of the power of such a combination though that was a combination formed mostly for the mere purposes of faction sustained perhaps by the desperate designs of the insolvents of the country such a combination was necessarily wanting in union among the affluent it had not the high support of principles to give it sanctity and it affords little more than the proof of the power of money and leisure when applied in a very doubtful cause in wielding the masses of a great nation to be the instruments of their own subjection no wellintentioned american legislator consequently ought ever to lose sight of the fact that each invasion of the right which he sanctions is a blow struck against liberty itself which in a country like this has no auxiliary so certain or so powerful as justice  the state of new york contains about 43000 square miles of land or something like 27000000 of acres in 1783 its population must have been about 200000 souls with such a proportion between people and surface it is unnecessary to prove that the husbandman was not quite as dependent on the landholder as the landholder was dependent on the husbandman this would have been true had the state been an island but we all know it was surrounded by many other communities similarly situated and that nothing else was so abundant as land all notions of exactions and monopolies therefore must be untrue as applied to those two interests at that day  in 17867 the state of new york then in possession of all powers on the subject abolished entails and otherwise brought its law of real estate in harmony with the institutions at that time hundreds perhaps thousands of the leases which have since become so obnoxious were in existence with the attention of the state drawn directly to the main subject no one saw anything incompatible with the institutions in them it was felt that the landlords had bought the tenants to occupy their lands by the liberality of their concessions and that the latter were the obliged parties had the landlords of that day endeavoured to lease for one year or for ten years no tenants could have been found for wild lands but it became a different thing when the owner of the soil agreed to part with it for ever in consideration of a very low rent granting six or eight years free from any charge whatever and consenting to receive the product of the soil itself in lieu of money then indeed men were not only willing to come into the terms but eager the best evidence of which is the fact that the same tenants might have bought land out and out in every direction around them had they not preferred the easier terms of the leases now that these same men or their successors have become rich enough to care more to be rid of the encumbrance of the rent than to keep their money the rights of the parties certainly are not altered  in 1789 the constitution of the united states went into operation new york being a party to its creation and conditions by that constitution the state deliberately deprived itself of the power to touch the covenants of these leases without conceding the power to any other government unless it might be through a change of the constitution itself as a necessary consequence these leases in a legal sense belong to the institutions of new york instead of being opposed to them not only is the spirit of the institutions in harmony with these leases but so is the letter also men must draw a distinction between the spirit of the institutions and their own spirits the latter being often nothing more than a stomach that is not easily satisfied it would be just as true to affirm that domestic slavery is opposed to the institutions of the united states as to say the same of these leases it would be just as rational to maintain because a does not choose to make an associate of b that he is acting in opposition to the spirit of the institutions inasmuch as the declaration of independence advances the dogmas that men are born equal as it is to say it is opposed to the same spirit for b to pay rent to a according to his covenant  it is pretended that the durable leases are feudal in their nature we do not conceive this to be true but admitting it to be so it would only prove that feudality to this extent is a part of the institutions of the state what is more it would become a part over which the state itself has conceded all power of control beyond that which it may remotely possess as one out of twentyeight communities as respects this feudal feature it is not easy to say where it must be looked for it is not to be found in the simple fact of paying rent for that is so general as to render the whole country feudal could it be true it cannot be in the circumstance that the rent is to be paid in kind as it is called and in labour for that is an advantage to the tenant by affording him the option since the penalty of a failure leaves the alternative of paying in money it must be therefore that these leases are feudal because they run for ever now the length of the lease is clearly a concession to the tenant and was so regarded when received and there is not probably a single tenant under lives who would not gladly exchange his term of possession for that of one of these detestable durable leases  among the absurdities that have been circulated on this subject of feudality it has been pretended that the wellknown english statute of quia emptores has prohibited fines for alienation or that the quartersales fifthsales sixthsales c of our own leases were contrary to the law of the realm when made under the common law in certain cases of feudal tenures the fines for alienation were an incident of the tenure the statute of quia emptores abolished that general principle but it in no manner forbade parties to enter into covenants of the nature of quartersales did they see fit the common law gives all the real estate to the eldest son our statute divides the real estate among the nearest of kin without regard even to sex it might just as well be pretended that the father cannot devise all his lands to his eldest son under our statute as to say that the law of edward i prevents parties from bargaining for quartersales altering a provision of the common law does not preclude parties from making covenants similar to its ancient provisions  feudal tenures were originally divided into two great classes those which were called the military tenures or knights service and soccage the first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society soccage was of two kinds free and villian the first has an affinity to our own system as connected with these leases the last never existed among us at all when the knights service or military tenures of england were converted into free soccage in the reign of charles ii the concession was considered of a character so favourable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time one of which was the habeas corpus act  the only feature of our own leases in the least approaching villian soccage is that of the days works but every one acquainted with the habits of american life will understand that husbandmen in general throughout the northern states would regard it as an advantage to be able to pay their debts in this way and the law gives them an option since a failure to pay in kind or in work merely incurs the forfeiture of paying what the particular thing is worth in money in point of fact money has always been received for these days works and at a stipulated price  but it is pretended whatever may be the equity of these leasehold contracts they are offensive to the tenants and ought to be abrogated for the peace of the state the state is bound to make all classes of men respect its laws and in nothing more so than in the fulfilment of their legal contracts the greater the number of the offenders the higher the obligation to act with decision and efficiency to say that these disorganizers ought not to be put down is to say that crime is to obtain impunity by its own extent and to say that they cannot be put down under our form of government is a direct admission that the government is unequal to the discharge of one of the plainest and commonest obligations of all civilized society if this be really so the sooner we get rid of the present form of government the better the notion of remedying such an evil by concession is as puerile as it is dishonest the larger the concessions become the greater will be the exactions of a cormorant cupidity as soon as quiet is obtained by these means in reference to the leasehold tenures it will be demanded by some fresh combination to attain some other end  when lee told washington at monmouth sir your troops will not stand against british grenadiers washington is said to have answered sir you have never tried them the same reply might be given to those miserable traducers of this republic who in order to obtain votes affect to think there is not sufficient energy in its government to put down so barefaced an attempt as this of the antirenters to alter the conditions of their own leases to suit their own convenience the county of delaware has of itself nobly given the lie to the assertion the honest portion of its inhabitants scattering the knaves to the four winds the moment there was a fair occasion made for them to act a single energetic proclamation from albany calling a spade a spade and not affecting to gloss over the disguised robbery of these antirenters and laying just principles fairly before the public mind would of itself have crushed the evil in its germ the people of new york in their general capacity are not the knaves their servants evidently suppose  the assembly of new york in its memorable session of 1846 has taxed the rents on long leases thus not only taxing the same property twice but imposing the worst sort of incometax or one aimed at a few individuals it has thimblerigged in its legislation as mr hugh littlepage not unaptly terms it endeavouring to do that indirectly which the constitution will not permit it to do directly in other words as it can pass no direct law impairing the obligation of contracts while it can regulate descents it has enacted so far as one body of the legislature has power to enact anything that on the death of a landlord the tenant may convert his lease into a mortgage on discharging which he shall hold his land in fee  we deem the first of these measures far more tyrannical than the attempt of great britain to tax her colonies which brought about the revolution it is of the same general character that of unjust taxation while it is attended by circumstances of aggravation that were altogether wanting in the policy of the mother country this is not a tax for revenue which is not needed but a tax to choke off the landlords to use a common american phrase it is clearly taxing nothing or it is taxing the same property twice it is done to conciliate three or four thousand voters who are now in the market at the expense of three or four hundred who it is known are not to be bought it is unjust in its motives its means and its end the measure is discreditable to civilization and an outrage on liberty  but the other law mentioned is an atrocity so grave as to alarm every man of common principle in the state were it not so feeble in its devices to cheat the constitution as to excite contempt this extraordinary power is exercised because the legislature can control the law of descents though it cannot impair the obligation of contracts had the law said at once that on the death of a landlord each of his tenants should own his farm in fee the ensemble of the fraud would have been preserved since the law of descents would have been so far regulated as to substitute one heir for another but changing the nature of a contract with a party who has nothing to do with the succession at all is not so very clearly altering or amending the law of descents it is scarcely necessary to say that every reputable court in the country whether state or federal would brand such a law with the disgrace it merits  but the worst feature of this law or attempted law remains to be noticed it would have been a premium on murder murder has already been committed by these antirenters and that obviously to effect their ends and they were to be told that whenever you shoot a landlord as some have already often shot at them you can convert your leasehold tenures into tenures in fee the mode of valuation is so obvious too as to deserve a remark a master was to settle the valuation on testimony the witnesses of course would be the neighbours and a whole patent could swear for each other  as democrats we protest most solemnly against such barefaced frauds such palpable cupidity and covetousness being termed anything but what they are if they come of any party at all it is the party of the devil democracy is a lofty and noble sentiment it does not rob the poor to make the rich richer nor the rich to favour the poor it is just and treats all men alike it does not impair the obligations of contracts it is not the friend of a canting legislation but meaning right dare act directly there is no greater delusion than to suppose that true democracy has anything in common with injustice or roguery  nor is it an apology for antirentism in any of its aspects to say that leasehold tenures are inexpedient the most expedient thing in existence is to do right were there no other objection to this antirent movement than its corrupting influence that alone should set every wise man in the community firmly against it we have seen too much of this earth to be so easily convinced that there is any disadvantage nay that there is not a positive advantage in the existence of large leasehold estates when they carry with them no political power as is the fact here the commonplace argument against them that they defeat the civilization of a country is not sustained by fact the most civilized countries on earth are under this system and this system too not entirely free from grave objections which do not exist among ourselves that a poorer class of citizens have originally leased than have purchased lands in new york is probably true and it is equally probable that the effects of this poverty and even of the tenure in the infancy of a country are to be traced on the estates but this is taking a very onesided view of the matter the men who became tenants in moderate but comfortable circumstances would have been mostly labourers on the farms of others but for these leasehold tenures that is the benefit of the system in a new country and the ultra friend of humanity who decries the condition of a tenant should remember that if he had not been in this very condition he might have been in a worse it is indeed one of the proofs of the insincerity of those who are decrying leases on account of their aristocratic tendencies that their destruction will necessarily condemn a numerous class of agriculturists either to fall back into the ranks of the peasant or daylabourer or to migrate as is the case with so many of the same class in new england in point of fact the relation of landlord and tenant is one entirely natural and salutary in a wealthy community and one that is so much in accordance with the necessities of men that no legislation can long prevent it a state of things which will not encourage the rich to hold real estate would not be desirable since it would be diverting their money knowledge liberality feelings and leisure from the improvement of the soil to objects neither so useful nor so praiseworthy  the notion that every husbandman is to be a freeholder is as utopian in practice as it would be to expect that all men were to be on the same level in fortune condition education and habits as such a state of things as the last never yet did exist it was probably never designed by divine wisdom that it should exist the whole structure of society must be changed even in this country ere it could exist among ourselves and the change would not have been made a month before the utter impracticability of such a social fusion would make itself felt by all  we have elsewhere imputed much of the antirent feeling to provincial education and habits this term has given the deepest offence to those who were most obnoxious to the charge nevertheless our opinion is unchanged we know that the distance between the cataract of niagara and the massachusetts line is a large hundred leagues and that it is as great between sandy hook and the 45th parallel of latitude many excellent things moral and physical are to be found within these limits beyond a question but we happen to know by an experience that has extended to other quarters of the world for a term now exceeding forty years that more are to be found beyond them if honourable gentlemen at albany fancy the reverse they must still permit us to believe they are too much under the influence of provincial notions     the redskins     chapter i      thy mother was a piece of virtue and     she saidthou wert my daughter and thy father     was duke of milan and his only heir     a princessno worse issued      tempest   my uncle ro and myself had been travelling together in the east and had been absent from home fully five years when we reached paris for eighteen months neither of us had seen a line from america when we drove through the barriers on our way from egypt viâ algiers marseilles and lyons not once in all that time had we crossed our own track in a way to enable us to pick up a straggling letter and all our previous precautions to have the epistles meet us at different bankers in italy turkey and malta were thrown away  my uncle was an old travelleri might almost say an old residentin europe for he had passed no less than twenty years of his fiftynine off the american continent a bachelor with nothing to do but to take care of a very ample estate which was rapidly increasing in value by the enormous growth of the town of new york and with tastes early formed by travelling it was natural he should seek those regions where he most enjoyed himself hugh roger littlepage was born in 1786the second son of my grandfather mordaunt littlepage and of ursula malbone his wife my own father malbone littlepage was the eldest child of that connexion and he would have inherited the property of ravensnest in virtue of his birthright had he survived his own parents but dying young i stepped into what would otherwise have been his succession in my eighteenth year my uncle ro however had got both satanstoe and lilacsbush two countryhouses and farms which while they did not aspire to the dignity of being estates were likely to prove more valuable in the long run than the broad acres which were intended for the patrimony of the elder brother my grandfather was affluent for not only had the fortune of the littlepages centred in him but so did that of the mordaunts the wealthier family of the two together with some exceedingly liberal bequests from a certain col dirck follock or van valkenburgh who though only a very distant connexion chose to make my greatgrandmothers or anneke mordaunts descendants his heirs we all had enough my aunts having handsome legacies in the way of bonds and mortgages on an estate called mooseridge in addition to some lots in town while my own sister martha had a clear fifty thousand dollars in money i had townlots also which were becoming productive and a special minority of seven years had made an accumulation of cash that was well vested in new york state stock and which promised well for the future i say a special minority for both my father and grandfather in placing the one myself and a portion of the property and the other the remainder of my estate under the guardianship and ward of my uncle had made a provision that i was not to come into possession until i had completed my twentyfifth year  i left college at twenty and my uncle ro for so martha and myself always called him and so he was always called by some twenty cousins the offspring of our three auntsbut my uncle ro when i was done with college proposed to finish my education by travelling as this was only too agreeable to a young man away we went just after the pressure of the great panic of 18367 was over and our lots were in tolerable security and our stocks safe in america it requires almost as much vigilance to take care of property as it does industry to acquire it  mr hugh roger littlepageby the way i bore the same name though i was always called hugh while my uncle went by the different appellations of roger ro and hodge among his familiars as circumstances had rendered the associations sentimental affectionate or manlymr hugh roger littlepage senior then had a system of his own in the way of aiding the scales to fall from american eyes by means of seeing more clearly than one does or can at home let him belong where he may and in clearing the specks of provincialism from off the diamond of republican water he had already seen enough to ascertain that while our country as this blessed nation is very apt on all occasions appropriate or not to be called by all who belong to it as well as by a good many who do not could teach a great deal to the old world there was a possibilityjust a possibility remark is my wordthat it might also learn a little with a view therefore of acquiring knowledge seriatim as it might be he was for beginning with the hornbook and going on regularly up to the belleslettres and mathematics the manner in which this was effected deserves a notice  most american travellers land in england the country farthest advanced in material civilization then proceed to italy and perhaps to greece leaving germany and the less attractive regions of the north to come in at the end of the chapter my uncles theory was to follow the order of time and to begin with the ancients and end with the moderns though in adopting such a rule he admitted he somewhat lessened the pleasure of the novice since an american fresh from the fresher fields of the western continent might very well find delight in memorials of the past more especially in england which pall on his taste and appear insignificant after he has become familiar with the temple of neptune the parthenon or what is left of it and the coliseum i make no doubt that i lost a great deal of passing happiness in this way by beginning at the beginning or by beginning in italy and travelling north  such was our course however and landing at leghorn we did the peninsula effectually in a twelvemonth thence passed through spain up to paris and proceeded on to moscow and the baltic reaching england from hamburg when we had got through with the british isles the antiquities of which seemed flat and uninteresting to me after having seen those that were so much more antique we returned to paris in order that i might become a man of the world if possible by rubbing off the provincial specks that had unavoidably adhered to the american diamond while in its obscurity  my uncle ro was fond of paris and he had actually become the owner of a small hotel in the faubourg in which he retained a handsome furnished apartment for his own use the remainder of the house was let to permanent tenants but the whole of the first floor and of the entresol remained in his hands as a special favour he would allow some american family to occupy even his own apartmentor rather appartement for the words are not exactly synonymouswhen he intended to be absent for a term exceeding six months using the money thus obtained in keeping the furniture in repair and his handsome suite of rooms including a salon salle à manger antechambre cabinet several chambres à coucher and a boudoiryes a male boudoir for so he affected to call itin a condition to please even his fastidiousness  on our arrival from england we remained an entire season at paris all that time rubbing the specks off the diamond when my uncle suddenly took it into his head that we ought to see the east he had never been further than greece himself and he now took a fancy to be my companion in such an excursion we were gone two years and a half visiting greece constantinople asia minor the holy land petra the red sea egypt quite to the second cataracts and nearly the whole of barbary the latter region we threw in by way of seeing something out of the common track but so many hats and travellingcaps are to be met with nowadays among the turbans that a wellmannered christian may get along almost anywhere without being spit upon this is a great inducement for travelling generally and ought to be so especially to an american who on the whole incurs rather more risk now of suffering this humiliation at home than he would even in algiers but the animus is everything in morals  we had then been absent two years and a half from paris and had not seen a paper or received a letter from america in eighteen months when we drove through the barrier even the letters and papers received or seen previously to this last term were of a private nature and contained nothing of a general character the twenty millionsit was only the other day they were called the twelve millionsbut the twenty millions we knew had been looking up amazingly after the temporary depression of the moneyed crisis it had gone through and the bankers had paid our drafts with confidence and without extra charges during the whole time we had been absent it is true uncle ro as an experienced traveller went well fortified in the way of credita precaution by no means unnecessary with americans after the cry that had been raised against us in the old world  and here i wish to say one thing plainly before i write another line as for falling into the narrow selfadulatory provincial feeling of the american who has never left his mothers apronstring and which causes him to swallow openmouthed all the nonsense that is uttered to the world in the columns of newspapers or in the pages of your yearling travellers who go on excursions before they are half instructed in the social usages and the distinctive features of their own country i hope i shall be just as far removed from such a weakness in any passing remark that may flow from my pen as from the crime of confounding principles and denying facts in a way to do discredit to the land of my birth and that of my ancestors i have lived long enough in the world not meaning thereby the southeast corner of the northwest township of connecticut to understand that we are a vast way behind older nations in thought as well as deed in many things while on the opposite hand they are a vast way behind us in others i see no patriotism in concealing a wholesome truth and least of all shall i be influenced by the puerility of a desire to hide anything of this nature because i cannot communicate it to my countrymen without communicating it to the rest of the world if england or france had acted on this narrow principle where would have been their shakspeares their sheridans their beaumonts and fletchers and their molieres no no great national truths are not to be treated as the gossiping surmises of village crones he who reads what i write therefore must expect to find what i think of matters and things and not exactly what he may happen to think on the same subjects any one is at liberty to compare opinions with me but i ask the privilege of possessing some small liberty of conscience in what is far and near proclaimed to be the only free country on the earth by far and near i mean from the st croix to the rio grande and from cape cod to the entrance of st juan de fuca and a pretty farm it makes the interval that lies between these limits one may call it far and near without the imputation of obscurity or that of vanity  our tour was completed in spite of all annoyances and here we were again within the walls of magnificent paris the postilions had been told to drive to the hotel in the rue st dominique and we sat down to dinner an hour after our arrival under our own roof my uncles tenant had left the apartment a month before according to agreement and the porter and his wife had engaged a cook set the rooms in order and prepared everything for our arrival  it must be owned hugh said my uncle as he finished his soup that day one may live quite comfortably in paris if he possess the savoir vivre nevertheless i have a strong desire to get a taste of native air one may say and think what he pleases about the paris pleasures and the paris cuisine and all that sort of things but home is home be it ever so homely a dinde aux truffes is capital eating so is a turkey with cranberry sauce i sometimes think i could fancy even a pumpkin pie though there is not a fragment of the rock of plymouth in the granite of my frame  i have always told you sir that america is a capital eating and drinking country let it want civilization in other matters as much as it may  capital for eating and drinking hugh if you can keep clear of the grease in the first place and find a real cook in the second there is as much difference between the cookery of new england for instance and that of the middle states barring the dutch as there is between that of england and germany the cookery of the middle states and of the southern states too though that savours a little of the west indiesbut the cookery of the middle states is english in its best sense meaning the hearty substantial savoury dishes of the english in their true domestic life with their roastbeef underdone their beefsteaks done to a turn their chops full of gravy their muttonbroth legsofmutton et id omne genus we have some capital things of our own too such as canvassbacks reedbirds sheepshead shad and blackfish the difference between new england and the middle states is still quite observable though in my younger days it was patent i suppose the cause has been the more provincial origin and the more provincial habits of our neighbours by george hugh one could fancy clamsoup just now eh  clamsoup sir well made is one of the most delicious soups in the world if the cooks of paris could get hold of the dish it would set them up for a whole season  what is crême de bavière and all such nicknacks boy to a good plateful of clamsoup well made as you saymade as a cook of jennings used to make it thirty years since did i ever mention that fellows soup to you before hugh  often sir i have tasted very excellent clamsoup however that he never saw of course you mean soup just flavoured by the little hardclamnone of your vulgar potage à la softclam  softclams be hanged they are not made for gentlemen to eat of course i mean the hardclam and the small clam too      heres your fine clams     as white as snow     on rockaway     these clams do grow  the cries of new york are quite going out like everything else at home that is twenty years old shall i send you some of this eternal poulet à la marengo i wish it were honest american boiled fowl with a delicate bit of shoatpork alongside of it i feel amazingly homeish this evening hugh  it is quite natural my dear uncle ro and i own to the soft impeachment myself here have we both been absent from our native land five years and half that time almost without hearing from it we know that jacobthis was a free negro who served my uncle a relic of the old domestic system of the colonies whose name would have been jaaf or yop thirty years beforehas gone to our bankers for letters and papers and that naturally draws our thoughts to the other side of the atlantic i dare say we shall both feel relieved at breakfast tomorrow when we shall have read our respective despatches  come let us take a glass of wine together in the good old york fashion hugh your father and i when boys never thought of wetting our lips with the halfglass of madeira that fell to our share without saying good health mall good health hodge  with all my heart uncle ro the custom was getting to be a little obsolete even before i left home but it is almost an american custom by sticking to us longer than to most people  henri  this was my uncles maitre dhotel whom he had kept at boardwages the whole time of our absence in order to make sure of his ease quiet taste skill and honesty on his return  monsieur  i dare saymy uncle spoke french exceedingly well for a foreigner but it is better to translate what he said as we goi dare say this glass of vin de bourgogne is very good it looks good and it came from a winemerchant on whom i can rely but mons hugh and i are going to drink together à lamèricaine and i dare say you will let us have a glass of madeira though it is somewhat late in the dinner to take it  tres volontiers messieursit is my happiness to oblige you  uncle ro and i took the madeira together but i cannot say much in favour of its quality  what a capital thing is a good newtown pippin exclaimed my uncle after eating a while in silence they talk a great deal about their poire beurrée here at paris but to my fancy it will not compare with the newtowners we grow at satanstoe where by the way the fruit is rather better i think than that one finds across the river at newtown itself  they are capital apples sir and your orchard at satanstoe is one of the best i know or rather what is left of it for i believe a portion of your trees are in what is now a suburb of dibbletonborough  yes blast that place i wish i had never parted with a foot of the old neck though i did rather make money by the sale but money is no compensation for the affections  rather make money my dear sir pray may i ask what satanstoe was valued at when you got it from my grandfather  pretty well up hugh for it was and indeed is a firstrate farm including sedges and saltmeadows you will remember that there are quite five hundred acres of it altogether  which you inherited in 1829  of course that was the year of my fathers death why the place was thought to be worth about thirty thousand dollars at that time but land was rather low in westchester in 1829  and you sold two hundred acres including the point the harbour and a good deal of the sedges for the moderate modicum of one hundred and ten thousand cash a tolerable sale sir  no not cash i got only eighty thousand down while thirty thousand were secured by mortgage  which mortgage you hold yet i dare say if the truth were told covering the whole city of dibbletonborough a city ought to be good security for thirty thousand dollars  it is not nevertheless in this case the speculators who bought of me in 1835 laid out their town built a hotel a wharf and a warehouse and then had an auction they sold four hundred lots each twentyfive feet by a hundred regulation size you see at an average of two hundred and fifty dollars receiving onehalf or fifty thousand dollars down and leaving the balance on mortgage soon after this the bubble burst and the best lot at dibbletonborough would not bring under the hammer twenty dollars the hotel and the warehouse stand alone in their glory and will thus stand until they fall which will not be a thousand years hence i rather think  and what is the condition of the townplot  bad enough the landmarks are disappearing and it would cost any man who should attempt it the value of his lot to hire a surveyor to find his twentyfive by a hundred  but your mortgage is good  ay good in one sense but it would puzzle a philadelphia lawyer to foreclose it why the equitable interests in that townplot people the place of themselves i ordered my agent to commence buying up the rights as the shortest process of getting rid of them and he told me in the very last letter i received that he had succeeded in purchasing the titles to three hundred and seventeen of the lots at an average price of ten dollars the remainder i suppose will have to be absorbed  absorbed that is a process i never heard of as applied to land  there is a good deal of it done notwithstanding in america it is merely including within your own possession adjacent land for which no claimant appears what can i do no owners are to be found and then my mortgage is always a title a possession of twenty years under a mortgage is as good as a deed in feesimple with full covenants of warranty barring minors and femmes covert  you did better by lilacsbush  ah that was a clean transaction and has left no drawbacks lilacsbush being on the island of manhattan one is sure there will be a town there some day or other it is true the property lies quite eight miles from the city hall nevertheless it has a value and can always be sold at something near it then the plan of new york is made and recorded and one can find his lots nor can any man say when the town will not reach kingsbridge  you got a round price for the bush too i have heard sir  i got three hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars in hard cash i would give no credit and have every dollar of the money at this moment in good six per cent stock of the states of new york and ohio  which some persons in this part of the world would fancy to be no very secure investment  more fools they america is a glorious country after all hugh and it is a pride and a satisfaction to belong to it look back at it as i can remember it a nation spit upon by all the rest of christendom  you must at least own my dear sir i put in somewhat pertly perhaps the example might tempt other people for if ever there was a nation that is assiduously spitting on itself it is our own beloved land  true it has that nasty custom in excess and it grows worse instead of better as the influence of the better mannered and better educated diminishes but this is a spot on the suna mere flaw in the diamond that friction will take out but what a countrywhat a glorious country in truth it is you have now done the civilized parts of the old world pretty thoroughly my dear boy and must be persuaded yourself of the superiority of your native land  i remember you have always used this language uncle ro yet have you passed nearly onehalf of your time out of that glorious country since you have reached mans estate  the mere consequence of accidents and tastes i do not mean that america is a country for a bachelor to begin with the means of amusement for those who have no domestic hearths are too limited for the bachelor nor do i mean that society in america in its ordinary meaning is in any way as wellordered as tasteful as wellmannered as agreeable or as instructive and useful as society in almost any european country i know i have never supposed that the man of leisure apart from the affections could ever enjoy himself half as much at home as he may enjoy himself in this part of the world and i am willing to admit that intellectually most gentlemen in a great european capital live as much in one day as they would live in a week in such places as new york and philadelphia and baltimore  you do not include boston i perceive sir  of boston i say nothing they take the mind hard there and we had better let such a state of things alone but as respects a man or woman of leisure a man or woman of taste a man or woman of refinement generally i am willing enough to admit that cæteris paribus each can find far more enjoyment in europe than in america but the philosopher the philanthropist the political economistin a word the patriot may well exult in such elements of profound national superiority as may be found in america  i hope these elements are not so profound but they can be dug up at need uncle ro  there will be little difficulty in doing that my boy look at the equality of the laws to begin with they are made on the principles of natural justice and are intended for the benefit of societyfor the poor as well as the rich  are they also intended for the rich as well as the poor  well i will grant you a slight blemish is beginning to appear in that particular it is a failing incidental to humanity and we must not expect perfection there is certainly a slight disposition to legislate for numbers in order to obtain support at the polls which has made the relation of debtor and creditor a little insecure possibly but prudence can easily get along with that it is erring on the right side is it not to favour the poor instead of the rich if either is to be preferred  justice would favour neither but treat all alike i have always heard that the tyranny of numbers was the worst tyranny in the world  perhaps it is where there is actually tyranny and for a very obvious reason one tyrant is sooner satisfied than a million and has even a greater sense of responsibility i can easily conceive that the czar himself if disposed to be a tyrant which i am far from thinking to be the case with nicholas might hesitate about doing that under his undivided responsibility which one of our majorities would do without even being conscious of the oppression it exercised or caring at all about it but on the whole we do little of the last and not in the least enough to counterbalance the immense advantages of the system  i have heard very discreet men say that the worst symptom of our system is the gradual decay of justice among us the judges have lost most of their influence and the jurors are getting to be lawmakers as well as lawbreakers  there is a good deal of truth in that i will acknowledge also and you hear it asked constantly in a case of any interest not which party is in the right but who is on the jury but i contend for no perfection all i say is that the country is a glorious country and that you and i have every reason to be proud that old hugh roger our predecessor and namesake saw fit to transplant himself into it a century and a half since  i dare say now uncle ro it would strike most europeans as singular that a man should be proud of having been born an americanmanhattanese as you and i both were  all that may be true for there have been calculated attempts to bring us into discredit of late by harping on the failure of certain states to pay the interest on their debts but all that is easily answered and more so by you and me as new yorkers there is not a nation in europe that would pay its interest if those who are taxed to do so had the control of these taxes and the power to say whether they were to be levied or not  i do not see how that mends the matter these countries tell us that such is the effect of your system there while we are too honest to allow such a system to exist in this part of the world  pooh all gammon that they prevent the existence of our system for very different reasons and they coerce the payment of the interest on their debts that they may borrow more this business of repudiation as it is called however has been miserably misrepresented and there is no answering a falsehood by an argument no american state has repudiated its debt that i know of though several have been unable to meet their engagements as they have fallen due  unable uncle ro  yes unablethat is the precise word take pennsylvania for instance that is one of the richest communities in the civilized world its coal and iron alone would make any country affluent and a portion of its agricultural population is one of the most affluent i know of nevertheless pennsylvania owing to a concurrence of events could not pay the interest on her debt for two years and a half though she is doing it now and will doubtless continue to do it the sudden breaking down of that colossal moneyed institution the soidisant bank of the united states after it ceased to be in reality a bank of the government brought about such a state of the circulation as rendered payment by any of the ordinary means known to government impossible i know what i say and repeat impossible it is well known that many persons accustomed to affluence had to carry their plate to the mint in order to obtain money to go to market then something may be attributed to the institutions without disparaging a peoples honesty our institutions are popular just as those of france are the reverse and the people they who were on the spotthe home creditor with his account unpaid and with his friends and relatives in the legislature and present to aid him contended for his own money before any should be sent abroad  was that exactly right sir  certainly not it was exactly wrong but very particularly natural do you suppose the king of france would not take the money for his civil list if circumstances should compel the country to suspend on the debt for a year or two or the ministers their salaries my word for it each and all of them would prefer themselves as creditors and act accordingly every one of these countries has suspended in some form or other and in many instances balanced the account with the sponge their clamour against us is altogether calculated with a view to political effect  still i wish pennsylvania for instance had continued to pay at every hazard  it is well enough to wish hugh but it is wishing for an impossibility then you and i as new yorkers have nothing to do with the debt of pennsylvania no more than london would have to do with the debt of dublin or quebec we have always paid our interest and what is more paid it more honestly if honesty be the point than even england has paid hers when our banks suspended the state paid its interest in as much paper as would buy the specie in open market whereas england made paper legal tender and paid the interest on her debt in it for something like fiveandtwenty years and that too when her paper was at a large discount i knew of one american who held near a million of dollars in the english debt on which he had to take unconvertible paper for the interest for a long series of years no no this is all gammon hugh and is not to be regarded as making us a whit worse than our neighbours the equality of our laws is the fact in which i glory  if the rich stood as fair a chance as the poor uncle ro  there is a screw loose there i must confess but it amounts to no great matter  then the late bankrupt law  ay that was an infernal procedurethat much i will acknowledge too it was special legislation enacted to pay particular debts and the law was repealed as soon as it had done its duty that is a much darker spot in our history than what is called repudiation though perfectly honest men voted for it  did you ever hear of a farce they got up about it at new york just after we sailed  never what was it hugh though american plays are pretty much all farces  this was a little better than common and on the whole really clever it is the old story of faust in which a young spendthrift sells himself soul and body to the devil on a certain evening as he is making merry with a set of wild companions his creditor arrives and insisting on seeing the master is admitted by the servant he comes on clubfooted and behorned as usual and betailed too i believe but tom is not to be scared by trifles he insists on his guests being seated on his taking a glass of wine and then on dicks finishing his song but though the rest of the company had signed no bonds to satan they had certain outstanding bookdebts which made them excessively uncomfortable and the odour of brimstone being rather strong tom arose approached his guest and desired to know the nature of the particular business he had mentioned to his servant this bond sir said satan significantly this bond what of it pray it seems all right is not that your signature i admit it signed in your blood a conceit of your own i told you at the time that ink was just as good in law it is past due seven minutes and fourteen seconds so it is i declare but what of that i demand payment nonsense no one thinks of paying nowadays why even pennsylvania and maryland dont pay i insist on payment oh you do do you tom draws a paper from his pocket and adds magnificently there then if youre so urgentthere is a discharge under the new bankrupt law signed smith thompson this knocked the devil into a cockedhat at once  my uncle laughed heartily at my story but instead of taking the matter as i had fancied he might it made him think better of the country than ever  well hugh we have wit among us it must be confessed he cried with the tears running down his cheeks if we have some rascally laws and some rascals to administer them but here comes jacob with his letters and papersi declare the fellow has a large basketfull  jacob a highly respectable black and the greatgrandson of an old negro named jaaf or yop who was then living on my own estate at ravensnest had just then entered with the porter and himself lugging in the basket in question there were several hundred newspapers and quite a hundred letters the sight brought home and america clearly and vividly before us and having nearly finished the dessert we rose to look at the packages it was no small task to sort our mail there being so many letters and packages to be divided  here are some newspapers i never saw before said my uncle as he tumbled over the pile the guardian of the soilthat must have something to do with oregon  i dare say it has sir here are at least a dozen letters from my sister  ay your sister is single and can still think of her brother but mine are married and one letter ayear would be a great deal this is my dear old mothers hand however that is something ursula malbone would never forget her child well bon soir hugh each of us has enough to do for one evening  au revoir sir we shall meet at ten tomorrow when we can compare our news and exchange gossip     chapter ii      why droops my lord like overripend corn     hanging the head at ceres plenteous load      king henry vi   i did not get into my bed that night until two nor was i out of it until halfpast nine it was near eleven when jacob came to tell me his master was in the salle à manger and ready to eat his breakfast i hastened up stairs sleeping in the entresol and was at table with my uncle in three minutes i observed on entering that he was very grave and i now perceived that a couple of letters and several american newspapers lay near him his good morrow hugh was kind and affectionate as usual but i fancied it sad  no bad news from home i hope sir i exclaimed under the first impulse of feeling marthas last letter is of quite recent date and she writes very cheerfully i know that my grandmother was perfectly well six weeks since  i know the same hugh for i have a letter from herself written with her own blessed hand my mother is in excellent health for a woman of fourscore but she naturally wishes to see us and you in particular grandchildren are ever the pets with grandmothers  i am glad to hear all this sir for i was really afraid on entering the room that you had received some unpleasant news  and is all your news pleasant after so long a silence  nothing that is disagreeable i do assure you patt writes in charming spirits and i dare say is in blooming beauty by this time though she tells me that she is generally thought rather plain that is impossible for you know when we left her at fifteen she had every promise of great beauty  as you say it is impossible that martha littlepage should be anything but handsome for fifteen is an age when in america one may safely predict the womans appearance your sister is preparing for you an agreeable surprise i have heard old persons say that she was very like my mother at the same time of life and dus malbone was a sort of toast once in the forest  i dare say it is all as you think more especially as there are several allusions to a certain harry beekman in her letters at which i should feel flattered were i in mr harrys place do you happen to know anything of such a family as the beekmans sir  my uncle looked up in a little surprise at this question a thorough new yorker by birth associations alliances and feelings he held all the old names of the colony and state in profound respect and i had often heard him sneer at the manner in which the newcomers of my day who had appeared among us to blossom like the rose scattered their odours through the land it was but a natural thing that a community which had grown in population in half a century from half a million to two millions and a half and that as much by immigration from adjoining communities as by natural increase should undergo some change of feeling in this respect but on the other hand it was just as natural that the true new yorker should not  of course you know hugh that it is an ancient and respected name among us answered my uncle after he had given me the look of surprise i have already mentioned there is a branch of the beekmans or bakemans as we used to call them settled near satanstoe and i dare say that your sister in her frequent visits to my mother has met with them the association would be but natural and the other feeling to which you allude is i dare say but natural to the association though i cannot say i ever experienced it  you will still adhere to your asseverations of never having been the victim of cupid i find sir  hugh hugh let us trifle no more there is news from home that has almost broken my heart  i sat gazing at my uncle in wonder and alarm while he placed both his hands on his face as if to exclude this wicked world and all it contained from his sight i did not speak for i saw that the old gentleman was really affected but waited his pleasure to communicate more my impatience was soon relieved however as the hands were removed and i once more caught a view of my uncles handsome but clouded countenance  may i ask the nature of this news i then ventured to inquire  you may and i shall now tell you it is proper indeed that you should hear all and understand it all for you have a direct interest in the matter and a large portion of your property is dependent on the result had not the manor troubles as they were called been spoken of before we left home  certainly though not to any great extent we saw something of it in the papers i remember just before we went to russia and i recollect you mentioned it as a discreditable affair to the state though likely to lead to no very important result  so i then thought but that hope has been delusive there were some reasons why a population like ours should chafe under the situation of the estate of the late patroon that i thought natural though unjustifiable for it is unhappily too much a law of humanity to do that which is wrong more especially in matters connected with the pocket  i do not exactly understand your allusion sir  it is easily explained the van rensselaer property is in the first place of great extentthe manor as it is still called and once was spreading east and west eightandforty miles and north and south twentyfour with a few immaterial exceptions including the sites of three or four towns three of which are cities containing respectively six twenty and forty thousand souls this large surface was the property of a single individual since his death it has become the property of two subject to the conditions of the leases of which by far the greater portion are what are called durable  i have heard all this of course sir and know something of it myself but what is a durable lease for i believe we have none of that nature at ravensnest  no your leases are all for three lives and most of them renewals at that there are two sorts of durable leases as we term them in use among the landlords of new york both give the tenant a permanent interest being leases for ever reserving an annual rent with the right to distrain and covenants of reentry but one class of these leases gives the tenant a right at any time to demand a deed in feesimple on the payment of a stipulated sum while the other gives him no such privilege thus one class of these leases is called a durable lease with a clause of redemption while the other is a simple durable lease  and are there any new difficulties in relation to the manor rents  far worse than that the contagion has spread until the greatest ills that have been predicted from democratic institutions by their worst enemies seriously menace the country i am afraid hugh i shall not be able to call new york any longer an exception to the evil example of a neighbourhood or the country itself a glorious country  this is so serious sir that were it not that your looks denote the contrary i might be disposed to doubt your words  i fear my words are only too true dunning has written me a long account of his own made out with the precision of a lawyer and in addition he has sent me divers papers some of which openly contend for what is substantially a new division of property and what in effect would be agrarian laws  surely my dear uncle you cannot seriously apprehend anything of that nature from our orderloving lawloving propertyloving americans  your last description may contain the secret of the whole movement the love of property may be so strong as to induce them to do a great many things they ought not to do i certainly do not apprehend that any direct attempt is about to be made in new york to divide its property nor do i fear any open declared agrarian statute for what i apprehend is to come through indirect and gradual innovations on the right that will be made to assume the delusive aspect of justice and equal rights and thus undermine the principles of the people before they are aware of the danger themselves in order that you may not only understand me but may understand facts that are of the last importance to your own pocket i will first tell you what has been done and then tell you what i fear is to follow the first difficultyor rather the first difficulty of recent occurrencearose at the death of the late patroon i say of recent occurrence since dunning writes me that during the administration of john jay an attempt to resist the payment of rent was made on the manor of the livingstons but he put it down instanter  yes i should rather think that roguery would not be apt to prosper while the execution of the laws was entrusted to such a man the age of such politicians however seems to have ended among us  it did not prosper governor jay met the pretension as we all know such a man would meet it and the matter died away and has been nearly forgotten it is worthy of remark that he put the evil down but this is not the age of john jays to proceed to my narrative when the late patroon died there was due to him a sum of something like two hundred thousand dollars of backrents and of which he had made a special disposition in his will vesting the money in trustees for a certain purpose it was the attempt to collect this money which first gave rise to dissatisfaction those who had been debtors so long were reluctant to pay in casting round for the means to escape from the payment of their just debts these men feeling the power that numbers ever give over right in america combined to resist with others who again had in view a project to get rid of the rents altogether out of this combination grew what have been called the manor troubles men appeared in a sort of mockindian dress calico shirts thrown over their other clothes and with a species of calico masks on their faces who resisted the bailiffs processes and completely prevented the collection of rents these men were armed mostly with rifles and it was finally found necessary to call out a strong body of the militia in order to protect the civil officers in the execution of their duties  all this occurred before we went to the east i had supposed those antirenters as they were called had been effectually put down  in appearance they were but the very governor who called the militia into the field referred the subject of the griefs of the tenants to the legislature as if they were actually aggrieved citizens when in truth it was the landlords or the rensselaers for at that time the troubles were confined to their property who were the aggrieved parties this false step has done an incalculable amount of mischief if it do not prove the entering wedge to rive asunder the institutions of the state  it is extraordinary when such things occur that any man can mistake his duty why were the tenants thus spoken of while nothing was said beyond what the law compelled in favour of the landlords  i can see no reason but the fact that the rensselaers were only two and that the disaffected tenants were probably two thousand with all the cry of aristocracy and feudality and nobility neither of the rensselaers by the letter of the law has one particle more of political power or political right than his own coachman or footman if the last be a white man while in practice he is in many things getting to be less protected  then you think sir that this matter has gained force from the circumstance that so many votes depend on it  out of all question its success depends on the violations of principles that we have been so long taught to hold sacred that nothing short of the overruling and corrupting influence of politics would dare to assail them if there were a landlord to each farm as well as a tenant universal indifference would prevail as to the griefs of the tenants and if two to one tenant universal indignation at their impudence  of what particular griefs do the tenants complain  you mean the rensselaer tenants i suppose why they complain of such covenants as they can though their deepest affliction is to be found in the fact that they do not own other mens lands the patroon had quarter sales on many of his farmsthose that were let in the last century  well what of that a bargain to allow of quarter sales is just as fair as any other bargain  it is fairer in fact than most bargains when you come to analyze it since there is a very good reason why it should accompany a perpetual lease is it to be supposed that a landlord has no interest in the character and habits of his tenants he has the closest interest in it possible and no prudent man should let his lands without holding some sort of control over the assignment of leases now there are but two modes of doing this either by holding over the tenant a power through his interests or a direct veto dependent solely on the landlords will  the last would be apt to raise a pretty cry of tyranny and feudality in america  pretty cries on such subjects are very easily raised in america more people join in them than understand what they mean nevertheless it is quite as just when two men bargain that he who owns every right in the land before the bargain is made should retain this right over his property which he consents to part with only with limitations as that he should grant it to another these men in their clamour forget that until their leases were obtained they had no right in their lands at all and that what they have got is through those very leases of which they complain take away the leases and they would have no rights remaining now on what principle can honest men pretend that they have rights beyond the leases on the supposition even that the bargains are hard what have governors and legislators to do with thrusting themselves in between parties so situated as special umpires i should object to such umpires moreover on the general and controlling principle that must govern all righteous arbitrationyour governors and legislators are not impartial they are political or party men one may say without exception and such umpires when votes are in the question are to be sorely distrusted i would as soon trust my interests to the decision of feed counsel as trust them to such judges  i wonder the really impartial and upright portion of the community do not rise in their might and put this thing downrip it up root and branch and cast it away at once  that is the weak point of our system which has a hundred strong points while it has this besetting vice our laws are not only made but they are administered on the supposition that there are both honesty and intelligence enough in the body of the community to see them well made and well administered but the sad reality shows that good men are commonly passive until abuses become intolerable it being the designing rogue and manager who is usually the most active vigilant philanthropists do exist i will allow but it is in such small numbers as to effect little on the whole and nothing at all when opposed by the zeal of a mercenary opposition no nolittle is ever to be expected in a political sense from the activity of virtue while a great deal may be looked for from the activity of vice  you do not take a very favourable view of humanity sir  i speak of the world as i have found it in both hemispheres or as your neighbour the magistrate squire newcome has it the four hemispheres our representation is at the best but an average of the qualities of the whole community somewhat lessened by the fact that men of real merit have taken a disgust at a state of things that is not very tempting to their habits or tastes as for a quarter sale i can see no more hardship in it than there is in paying the rent itself and by giving the landlord this check on the transfer of his lands he compels a compromise that maintains what is just the tenant is not obliged to sell and he makes his conditions accordingly when he has a good tenant to offer in his stead when he offers a bad tenant he ought to pay for it  many persons with us would think it very aristocratic i cried laughingly that a landlord should have it in his power to say i will not accept this or that substitute for yourself  it is just as aristocratic and no more so than it would be to put it in the power of the tenant to say to the landlord you shall accept this or that tenant at my hands the covenant of the quarter sale gives each party a control in the matter and the result has ever been a compromise that is perfectly fair as it is hardly possible that the circumstance should have been overlooked in making the bargain and he who knows anything of such matters knows that every exaction of this sort is always considered in the rent as for feudality so long as the power to alienate exists at all in the tenant he does not hold by a feudal tenure he has bought himself from all such tenures by his covenant of quarter sale and it only remains to say whether having agreed to such a bargain in order to obtain this advantage he should pay the stipulated price or not  i understand you sir it is easy to come at the equity of this matter if one will only go back to the original facts which colour it the tenant had no rights at all until he got his lease and can have no rights which that lease does not confer  then the cry is raised of feudal privileges because some of the rensselaer tenants are obliged to find so many days work with their teams or substitutes to the landlord and even because they have to pay annually a pair of fat fowls we have seen enough of america hugh to know that most husbandmen would be delighted to have the privilege of paying their debts in chickens and work instead of in money which renders the cry only so much the more wicked but what is there more feudal in a tenants thus paying his landlord than in a butchers contracting to furnish so much meat for a series of years or a mail contractors agreeing to carry the mail in a fourhorse coach for a term of years eh no one objects to the rent in wheat and why should they object to the rent in chickens is it because our republican farmers have got to be so aristocratic themselves that they do not like to be thought poulterers this is being aristocratic on the other side these dignitaries should remember that if it be plebeian to furnish fowls it is plebeian to receive them and if the tenant has to find an individual who has to submit to the degradation of tendering a pair of fat fowls the landlord has to find an individual who has to submit to the degradation of taking them and of putting them away in the larder it seems to me that one is an offset to the other  but if i remember rightly uncle ro these little matters were always commuted for in money  they always must lie at the option of the tenant unless the covenants went to forfeiture which i never heard that they did for the failure to pay in kind at the time stipulated would only involve a payment in money afterwards the most surprising part of this whole transaction is that men among us hold the doctrine that these leasehold estates are opposed to our institutions when being guarantied by the institutions they in truth form a part of them were it not for these very institutions to which they are said to be opposed and of which they virtually form a part we should soon have a pretty kettle of fish between landlord and tenant  how do you make it out that they form a part of the institutions sir  simply because the institutions have a solemn profession of protecting property there is such a parade of this that all our constitutions declare that property shall never be taken without due form of law and to read one of them you would think the property of the citizen is held quite as sacred as his person now some of these very tenures existed when the state institutions were framed and not satisfied with this we of new york in common with our sister states solemnly prohibited ourselves in the constitution of the united states from ever meddling with them nevertheless men are found hardy enough to assert that a thing which in fact belongs to the institutions is opposed to them  perhaps they mean sir to their spirit or to their tendency  ah there may be some sense in that though much less than the declaimers fancy the spirit of institutions is their legitimate object and it would be hard to prove that a leasehold tenure with any conditions of mere pecuniary indebtedness whatever is opposed to any institutions that recognise the full rights of property the obligation to pay rent no more creates political dependency than to give credit from an ordinary shop not so much indeed more especially under such leases as those of the rensselaers for the debtor on a bookdebt can be sued at any moment whereas the tenant knows precisely when he has to pay there is the great absurdity of those who decry the system as feudal and aristocratic for they do not see that those very leases are more favourable to the tenant than any other  i shall have to ask you to explain this to me sir being too ignorant to comprehend it  why these leases are perpetual and the tenant cannot be dispossessed the longer a lease is other things being equal the better it is for the tenant all the world over let us suppose two farms the one leased for five years and the other for ever which tenant is most independent of the political influence of his landlord to say nothing of the impossibility of controlling votes in this way in america from a variety of causes certainly he who has a lease for ever he is just as independent of his landlord as his landlord can be of him with the exception that he has rent to pay in the latter case he is precisely like any other debtorlike the poor man who contracts debts with the same storekeeper for a series of years as for the possession of the farm which we are to suppose is a desirable thing for the tenant he of the long lease is clearly most independent since the other may be ejected at the end of each five years nor is there the least difference as to acquiring the property in fee since the landlord may sell equally in either case if so disposed and if not disposed no honest man under any system ought to do anything to compel him so to do either directly or indirectly and no truly honest man would  i put some of the words of my uncle ro in small capitals as the spirit of the times not of the institutions renders such hints necessary but to continue our dialogue  i understand you now sir though the distinction you make between the spirit of the institutions and their tendencies is what i do not exactly comprehend  it is very easily explained the spirit of the institutions is their intention their tendencies is the natural direction they take under the impulses of human motives which are always corrupt and corrupting the spirit refers to what things ought to be the tendencies to what they are or are becoming the spirit of all political institutions is to place a check on the natural propensities of men to restrain them and keep them within due bounds while the tendencies follow those propensities and are quite often in direct opposition to the spirit that this outcry against leasehold tenures in america is following the tendencies of our institutions i am afraid is only too true but that it is in any manner in compliance with their spirit i utterly deny  you will allow that institutions have their spirit which ought always to be respected in order to preserve harmony  out of all question the first great requisite of a political system is the means of protecting itself the second to check its tendencies at the point required by justice wisdom and good faith in a despotism for instance the spirit of the system is to maintain that one man who is elevated above the necessities and temptations of a nationwho is solemnly set apart for the sole purpose of government fortified by dignity and rendered impartial by positionwill rule in the manner most conducive to the true interests of his subjects it is just as much the theory of russia and prussia that their monarchs reign not for their own good but for the good of those over whom they are placed as it is the theory in regard to the president of the united states we all know that the tendencies of a despotism are to abuses of a particular character and it is just as certain that the tendencies of a republic or rather of a democratic republicfor republic of itself means but little many republics having had kingsbut it is just as certain that the tendencies of a democracy are to abuses of another character whatever man touches he infallibly abuses and this more in connection with the exercise of political power perhaps than in the management of any one interest of life though he abuses all even to religion less depends on the nominal character of institutions perhaps than on their ability to arrest their own tendencies at the point required by everything that is just and right hitherto surprisingly few grave abuses have followed from our institutions but this matter looks frightfully serious for i have not told you half hugh  indeed sir i beg you will believe me quite equal to hearing the worst  it is true antirentism did commence on the estate of the rensselaers and with complaints of feudal tenures and of days works and fat fowls backed by the extravagantly aristocratic pretension that a manor tenant was so much a privileged being that it was beneath his dignity as a free man to do that which is daily done by mailcontractors stagecoach owners victuallers and even by themselves in their passing bargains to deliver potatoes onions turkeys and pork although they had solemnly covenanted with their landlords to pay the fat fowls and to give the days works the feudal system has been found to extend much further and troubles as they are called have broken out in other parts of the state resistance to process and a cessation of the payment of rents has occurred on the livingston property in hardenbergin short in eight or ten counties of the state even among the bonâ fide purchasers on the holland purchase this resistance has been organized and a species of troops raised who appear disguised and armed wherever a levy is to be made several men have already been murdered and there is the strong probability of a civil war  in the name of what is sacred and right what has the government of the state been doing all this time  in my poor judgment a great deal that it ought not to have done and very little that it ought you know the state of politics at home hugh how important new york is in all national questions and how nearly tied is her voteless than ten thousand majority in a canvass of near half a million of votes when this is the case the leastprincipled part of the voters attain an undue importancea truth that has been abundantly illustrated in this question the natural course would have been to raise an armed constabulary force and to have kept it in motion as the antirenters have kept their injins in motion which would have soon tired out the rebels for rebels they are who would thus have had to support one army in part and the other altogether such a movement on the part of the state well and energetically managed would have drawn half the injins at once from the ranks of disaffection to those of authority for all that most of these men want is to live easy and to have a parade of military movements instead of that the legislature substantially did nothing until blood was spilt and the grievance had got to be not only profoundly disgraceful for such a state and such a country but utterly intolerable to the wellaffected of the revolted counties as well as to those who were kept out of the enjoyment of their property then indeed it passed the law which ought to have been passed the first year of the injin systema law which renders it felony to appear armed and disguised but dunning writes me this law is openly disregarded in delaware and schoharie in particular and that bodies of injins in full costume and armed of a thousand men have appeared to prevent levies or sales where it will end heaven knows  do you apprehend any serious civil war  it is impossible to say where false principles may lead when they are permitted to make head and to become widely disseminated in a country like ours still the disturbances as such are utterly contemptible and could and would be put down by an energetic executive in ten days after he had time to collect a force to do it with in some particulars the present incumbent has behaved perfectly well while in others in my judgment he has inflicted injuries on the right that it will require years to repair if indeed they are ever repaired  you surprise me sir and this the more especially as i know you are generally of the same way of thinking on political subjects with the party that is now in power  did you ever know me to support what i conceived to be wrong hugh on account of my political affinities asked my uncle a little reproachfully as to manner but let me tell you the harm that i conceive has been done by all the governors who have had anything to do with the subject and that includes one of a party to which i am opposed and two that are not in the first place they have all treated the matter as if the tenants had really some cause of complaint when in truth all their griefs arise from the fact that other men will not let them have their property just as they may want it and in some respects on their own terms  that is certainly a grief not to be maintained by reason in a civilized country and in a christian community  umph christianity like liberty suffers fearfully in human hands one is sometimes at a loss to recognise either i have seen ministers of the gospel just as dogged just as regardless of general morality and just as indifferent to the right in upholding their parties as i ever saw laymen and i have seen laymen manifesting tempers in this respect that properly belong to devils but our governors have certainly treated this matter as if the tenants actually had griefs when in truth their sole oppression is in being obliged to pay rents that are merely nominal and in not being able to buy other mens property contrary to their wishes and very much at their own prices one governor has even been so generous as to volunteer a mode of settling disputes with which by the way he has no concern there being courts to discharge that office that is singularly presuming on his part to say the least and which looks a confounded sight more like aristocracy or monarchy than anything connected with leasehold tenure  why what can the man have done  he has kindly taken on himself the office of doing that for which i fancy he can find no authority in the institutions or in their spiritno less than advising citizens how they may conveniently manage their own affairs so as to get over difficulties that he himself substantially admits while giving this very advice are difficulties that the law sanctions  this is a very extraordinary interference in a public functionary because one of the parties to a contract that is solemnly guarantied by the law chooses to complain of its nature rather than of its conditions to pretend to throw the weight of his even assumed authority into the scales on either side of the question  and that in a popular government hugh in which it tells so strongly against a man to render him unpopular that not one man in a million has the moral courage to resist public opinion even when he is right you have hit the nail on the head boy it is in the last degree presuming and what would be denounced as tyrannical in any monarch in europe but he has lived in vain who has not learned that they who make the loudest professions of a love of liberty have little knowledge of the quality beyond submission to the demands of numbers our executive has carried his fatherly care even beyond this he has actually suggested the terms of a bargain by which he thinks the difficulty can be settled which in addition to the gross assumption of having a voice in a matter that in no manner belongs to him has the palpable demerit of recommending a pecuniary compromise that is flagrantly wrong as a mere pecuniary compromise  you astonish me sir what is the precise nature of his recommendation  that the rensselaers should receive such a sum from each tenant as would produce an interest equal to the value of the present rent now in the first place here is a citizen who has got as much property as he wants and who wishes to live for other purposes than to accumulate this property is not only invested to his entire satisfaction as regards convenience security and returns but also in a way that is connected with some of the best sentiments of his nature it is property that has descended to him through ancestors for two centuries property that is historically connected with his nameon which he was born on which he has lived and on which he has hoped to die property in a word that is associated with all the higher feelings of humanity because some interloper perhaps who has purchased an interest in one of his farms six months before feels an aristocratic desire not to have a landlord and wishes to own a farm in fee that in fact he has no other right to than he gets through his lease the governor of the great state of new york throws the weight of his official position against the old hereditary owner of the soil by solemnly suggesting in an official document that is intended to produce an effect on public opinion that he should sell that which he does not wish to sell but wishes to keep and that at a price which i conceive is much below its true pecuniary value we have liberty with a vengeance if these are some of its antics  what makes the matter worse is the fact that each of the rensselaers has a house on his estate so placed as to be convenient to look after his interests which interests he is to be at the trouble of changing leaving him his house on his hands because forsooth one of the parties to a plain and equitable bargain wishes to make better conditions than he covenanted for i wonder what his excellency proposes that the landlords shall do with their money when they get it buy new estates and build new houses of which to be dispossessed when a new set of tenants may choose to cry out against aristocracy and demonstrate their own love for democracy by wishing to pull others down in order to shove themselves into their places  you are right again hugh but it is a besetting vice of america to regard life as all means and as having no end in a worldly point of view i dare say men may be found among us who regard it as highly presuming in any man to build himself an ample residence and to announce by his mode of living that he is content with his present means and does not wish to increase them at the very moment they view the suggestions of the governor as the pink of modesty and excessively favourable to equal rights i like that thought of yours about the house too in order to suit the spirit of the new york institutions it would seem that a new york landlord should build on wheels that he may move his abode to some new estate when it suits the pleasure of his tenants to buy him out  do you suppose the rensselaers would take their money the principal of the rent at seven per cent and buy land with it after their experience of the uncertainty of such possessions among us  not they said my uncle ro laughing no no they would sell the manorhouse and beverwyck for taverns and then any one might live in them who would pay the principal sum of the cost of a dinner bag their dollars and proceed forthwith to wall street and commence the shaving of notesthat occupation having been decided as i see by the late arrivals to be highly honourable and praiseworthy hitherto they have been nothing but drones but by the time they can go to the quick with their dollars they will become useful members of society and be honoured and esteemed accordingly  what next might have been said i do not know for just then we were interrupted by a visit from our common banker and the discourse was necessarily changed     chapter iii      o when shall i visit the land of my birth     the loveliest land on the face of the earth     when shall i those scenes of affection explore           our forests our fountains           our hamlets our mountains     with the pride of our mountains the maid i adore      montgomery   it was truly news for an american who had been so long cut off from intelligence from home thus suddenly to be told that some of the scenes of the middle agesscenes connected with real wrongs and gross abuses of human rightswere about to be enacted in his own land that country which boasted itself not only to be the asylum of the oppressed but the conservator of the right i was grieved at what i had heard for during my travels i had cherished a muchloved image of justice and political excellence that i now began to fear must be abandoned my uncle and myself decided at once to return home a step that indeed was required by prudence i was now of an age to enter into the full possession of my own property so far as new laws and new lords would permit and the letters received by my late guardian as well as certain newspapers communicated the unpleasant fact that a great many of the tenants of ravensnest had joined the association paid tribute for the support of injins and were getting to be as bad as any of the rest of them so far as designs and schemes to plunder were concerned though they still paid their rents the latter circumstance was ascribed by our agent to the fact that many leases were about to fall in and it would be in my power to substitute more honest and better disposed successors for the present occupants of the several farms measures were taken accordingly for quitting paris as soon as possible so that we might reach home late in the month of may  if we had time i would certainly throw in a memorial or two to the legislature observed my uncle a day or two before we proceeded to havre to join the packet i have a strong desire to protest against the invasion of my rights as a freeman that is connected with some of their contemplated laws i do not at all like the idea of being abridged of the power of hiring a farm for the longest time i can obtain it which is one of the projects of some of the ultra reformers of free and equal new york it is wonderful hugh into what follies men precipitate themselves as soon as they begin to run into exaggerations whether of politics religion or tastes here are half of the exquisite philanthropists who see a great evil affecting the rights of human nature in one mans hiring a farm from another for as long a term as he can obtain it who are at the very extreme in their opinions on free trade so freetrade are some of the journals which think it a capital thing to prevent landlords and tenants from making their own bargains that they have actually derided the idea of having established fares for hackneycoaches but that it would be better to let the parties stand in the rain and higgle about the price on the freetrade principle some of these men are either active agents in stimulating the legislature to rob the citizen of this very simple control of his property or passive lookerson while others do it  votes sir votes  it is indeed votes sir votes nothing short of votes could reconcile these men to their own inconsistencies as for yourself hugh it might be well to get rid of that canopied pew  of what canopied pew i am sure i do not understand you  do you forget that the familypew in st andrews church at ravensnest has a wooden canopy over ita relic of our colonial opinions and usages  now you mention it i do remember a very clumsy and to own the truth a very ugly thing that i have always supposed was placed there by those who built the church by way of ornament  that ugly thing by way of ornament was intended for a sort of canopy and was by no means an uncommon distinction in the state and colony as recently as the close of the last century the church was built at the expense of my grandfather gen littlepage and his bosom friend and kinsman col dirck follock both good whigs and gallant defenders of the liberty of their country they thought it proper that the littlepages should have a canopied pew and that is the state in which they caused the building to be presented to my father the old work still stands and dunning writes me that among the other arguments used against your interests is the fact that your pew is thus distinguished from those of the rest of the congregation  it is a distinction no man would envy me could it be known that i have ever thought the clumsy illshaped thing a nuisance and detestable as an ornament i have never even associated it in my mind with personal distinction but have always supposed it was erected with a view to embellish the building and placed over our pew as the spot where such an excrescence would excite the least envy  in all that with one exception you have judged quite naturally forty years ago such a thing might have been done and a majority of the parishioners would have seen in it nothing out of place but that day has gone by and you will discover that on your own estate and in the very things created by your family and yourself you will actually have fewer rights of any sort beyond those your money will purchase than any man around you the simple fact that st andrews church was built by your greatgrandfather and by him presented to the congregation will diminish your claim to have a voice in its affairs with many of the congregation  this is so extraordinary that i musk ask the reason  the reason is connected with a principle so obviously belonging to human nature generally and to american nature in particular that i wonder you ask it it is envy did that pew belong to the newcomes for instance no one would think anything of it  nevertheless the newcomes would make themselves ridiculous by sitting in a pew that was distinguished from those of their neighbours the absurdity of the contrast would strike every one  and it is precisely because the absurdity does not exist in your case that your seat is envied no one envies absurdity however you will readily admit hugh that a church and a churchyard are the two last places in which human distinctions ought to be exhibited all are equal in the eyes of him we go to the one to worship and all are equal in the grave i have ever been averse to everything like worldly distinction in a congregation and admire the usage of the romish church in even dispensing with pews altogether monuments speak to the world and have a general connexion with history so that they may be tolerated to a certain point though notorious liars  i agree with you sir as to the unfitness of a church for all distinctions and shall be happy on every account to get rid of my canopy though that has an historical connexion also i am quite innocent of any feeling of pride while sitting under it though i will confess to some of shame at its quizzical shape when i see it has attracted the eyes of intelligent strangers  it is but natural that you should feel thus for while we may miss distinctions and luxuries to which we have ever been accustomed they rarely excite pride in the possessor even while they awaken envy in the lookeron  nevertheless i cannot see what the old pew has to do with the rents or my legal rights  when a cause is bad everything is pressed into it that it is believed may serve a turn no man who had a good legal claim for property would ever think of urging any other nor would any legislator who had sound and sufficient reasons for his measuresreasons that could properly justify him before god and man for his lawshave recourse to slang to sustain him if these antirenters were right they would have no need of secret combinations of disguises bloodandthunder names and special agents in the legislature of the land the right requires no false aid to make it appear the right but the wrong must get such support as it can press into its service your pew is called aristocratic though it confers no political power it is called a patent of nobility though it neither gives nor takes away and it is hated and you with it for the very reason that you can sit in it and not make yourself ridiculous i suppose you have not examined very closely the papers i gave you to read  enough so to ascertain that they are filled with trash  worse than trash hugh with some of the loosest principles and most atrocious feelings that degrade poor human nature some of the reformers propose that no man shall hold more than a thousand acres of land while others lay down the very intelligible and distinct principle that no man ought to hold more than he can use even petitions to that effect i have been told have been sent to the legislature  which has taken care not to allude to their purport either in debate or otherwise as i see nothing to that effect in the reports  ay i dare say the slangwhangers of those honourable bodies will studiously keep all such enormities out of sight as some of them doubtless hope to step into the shoes of the present landlords as soon as they can get the feet out of them which are now in but these are the projects and the petitions in the columns of the journals and they speak for themselves among other things they say it is nobility to be a landlord  i see by the letter of mr dunning that they have petitioned the legislature to order an inquiry into my title now we hold from the crown  so much the worse hugh faugh hold from a crown in a republican country i am amazed you are not ashamed to own it do you not know boy that it has been gravely contended in a court of justice that in obtaining our national independence from the king of great britain the people conquered all his previous grants which ought to be declared void and of none effect  that is an absurdity of which i had not heard i answered laughing why the people of new york who held all their lands under the crown would in that case have been conquering them for other persons my good grandfather and greatgrandfather both of whom actually fought and bled in the revolution must have been very silly thus to expose themselves to take away their own estates in order to give them to a set of immigrants from new england and other parts of the world  quite justly said hugh added my uncle joining in the laugh nor is this half of the argument the state too in its corporate character has been playing swindler all this time you may not know the fact but i as your guardian do know that the quitrents reserved by the crown when it granted the lands of mooseridge and ravensnest were claimed by the state and that wanting money to save the people from taxes it commuted with us receiving a certain gross sum in satisfaction of all future claims  ay that i did not know can the fact be shown  certainlyit is well known to all old fellows like myself for it was a very general measure and very generally entered into by all the landholders in our case the receipts are still to be found among the familypapers in the cases of the older estates such as those of the van rensselaers the equity is still stronger in their favour since the conditions to hold the land included an obligation to bring so many settlers from europe within a given time conditions that were fulfilled at great cost as you may suppose and on which in truth the colony had its foundation  how much it tells against a peoples honesty to wish to forget such facts in a case like this  there is nothing forgotten for the facts were probably never known to those who prate about the conquered rights from the crown as you say however the civilization of a community is to be measured by its consciousness of the existence of all principles of justice and a familiarity with its own history the great bulk of the population of new york have no active desire to invade what is right in this antirent struggle having no direct interests at stake their crime is a passive inactivity which allows those who are either working for political advancement or those who are working to obtain other mens property to make use of them through their own laws  but is it not an embarrassment to such a region as that directly around albany to have such tenures to the land and for so large a body of people to be compelled to pay rent in the very heart of the state as it might be and in situations that render it desirable to leave enterprise as unshackled as possible  i am not prepared to admit this much even as a general principle one argument used by these antirenters is for instance that the patroons in their leases reserved the millseats now what if they did some one must own the millseats and why not the patroon as well as another to give the argument any weight not as law not as morals but as mere expediency it must be shown that the patroons would not let these millseats at as low rents as any one else and my opinion is that they would let them at rents of not half the amount that would be asked were they the property of so many individuals scattered up and down the country but admitting that so large an estate of this particular sort has some inconveniences in that particular spot can there be two opinions among men of integrity about the mode of getting rid of it everything has its price and in a business sense everything is entitled to its price no people acknowledge this more than the americans or practise on it so extensively let the rensselaers be tempted by such offers as will induce them to sell but do not let them be invaded by that most infernal of all acts of oppression special legislation in order to bully or frighten them from the enjoyment of what is rightfully their own if the state think such a description of property injurious in its heart let the state imitate england in her conduct towards the slaveholdersbuy them out not tax them out and wrong them out and annoy them out but hugh enough of this at present we shall have much more than we want of it when we get home among my letters i have one from each of my other wards  still harping on my daughter sir i answered laughing i hope that the vivacious miss henrietta coldbrooke and the meek miss anne marston are both perfectly well  both in excellent health and both write charmingly i must really let you see the letter of henrietta as i do think it is quite creditable to her i will step into my room and get it  i ought to let the reader into a secret here that will have some connexion with what is to follow a deadset had been made at me previously to leaving home to induce me to marry either of three young ladiesmiss henrietta coldbrooke miss anne marston and miss opportunity newcome the advances in the cases of miss henrietta coldbrooke and miss anne marston came from my uncle ro who as their guardian had a natural interest in their making what he was pleased to think might be a good connexion for either while the advances on account of miss opportunity newcome came from herself under such circumstances it may be well to say who these young ladies actually were  miss henrietta coldbrooke was the daughter of an englishman of good family and some estate who had emigrated to america and married under the impulse of certain theories in politics which induced him to imagine that this was the promised land i remember him as a disappointed and dissatisfied widower who was thought to be daily growing poorer under the consequences of indiscreet investments and who at last got to be so very english in his wishes and longings as to assert that the common muscovy was a better bird than the canvasback he died however in time to leave his only child an estate which under my uncles excellent management was known by me to be rather more than one hundred and seventynine thousand dollars and which produced a nett eight thousand ayear this made miss henrietta a belle at once but having a prudent friend in my grandmother as yet she had not married a beggar i knew that uncle ro went quite as far as was proper in his letters in the way of hints touching myself and my dear excellent honesthearted straightforward old grandmother had once let fall an expression in one of her letters to myself which induced me to think that these hints had actually awakened as much interest in the young ladys bosom as could well be connected with what was necessarily nothing but curiosity  miss anne marston was also an heiress but on a very diminished scale she had rather more than three thousand ayear in buildings in town and a pretty little sum of about sixteen thousand dollars laid by out of its savings she was not an only child however having two brothers each of whom had already received as much as the sister and each of whom as is very apt to be the case with the heirs of new york merchants was already in a fair way of getting rid of his portion in riotous living nothing does a young american so much good under such circumstances as to induce him to travel it makes or breaks at once if a downright fool he is plucked by european adventurers in so short a time that the agony is soon over if only vain and frivolous because young and illeducated the latter being a new york endemic but with some foundation of native mind he lets his whiskers grow becomes fuzzy about the chin dresses better gets to be much better mannered soon loses his taste for the low and vulgar indulgences of his youth and comes out such a gentleman as one can only make who has entirely thrown away the precious moments of youth if tolerably educated in boyhood with capacity to build on the chances are that the scales will fall from his eyes very fast on landing in the old worldthat his ideas and tastes will take a new turnthat he will become what nature intended him for an intellectual man and that he will finally return home conscious alike of the evils and blessings the advantages and disadvantages of his own system and countrya wiser and it is to be hoped a better man how the experiment had succeeded with the marstons neither myself nor my uncle knew for they had paid their visit while we were in the east and had already returned to america as for miss anne she had a mother to take care of her mind and person though i had learned she was pretty sensible and discreet  miss opportunity newcome was a belle of ravensnest a village on my own property a rural beauty and of rural education virtues manners and habits as ravensnest was not particularly advanced in civilization or to make use of the common language of the country was not a very aristocratic place i shall not dwell on her accomplishments which did well enough for ravensnest but would not essentially ornament my manuscript  opportunity was the daughter of ovid who was the son of jason of the house of newcome in using the term house i adopt it understandingly for the family had dwelt in the same tenement a leasehold property of which the fee was in myself and the dwelling had been associated with the name of newcome from time immemorial that is for about eighty years all that time had a newcome been the tenant of the mill tavern store and farm that lay nearest the village of ravensnest or little nest as it was commonly called and it may not be impertinent to the moral of my narrative if i add that for all that time and for something longer had i and my ancestors been the landlords i beg the reader to bear this last fact in mind as there will soon be occasion to show that there was a strong disposition in certain persons to forget it  as i have said opportunity was the daughter of ovid there was also a brother who was named seneca or seneky as he always pronounced it himself the son of ovid the son of jason the first of the name at ravensnest this seneca was a lawyer in the sense of a license granted by the justices of the supreme court as well as by the court of common pleas in and for the county of washington as there had been a sort of hereditary education among the newcomes for three generations beginning with jason and ending with seneca and as the latter was at the bar i had occasionally been thrown into the society of both brother and sister the latter indeed used to be fond of visiting the nest as my house was familiarly called ravensnest being its true name whence those of the patent and village and as opportunity had early manifested a partiality for my dear old grandmother and not less dear young sister who occasionally passed a few weeks with me during the vacations more especially in the autumns i had many occasions of being brought within the influence of her charmsopportunities that i feel bound to state opportunity did not neglect i have understood that her mother who bore the same name had taught ovid the art of love by a very similar demonstration and had triumphed that lady was still living and may be termed opportunity the great while the daughter can be styled opportunity the less there was very little difference between my own years and those of the young lady and as i had last passed through the fiery ordeal at the sinister age of twenty there was not much danger in encountering the risk anew now i was five years older but i must return to my uncle and the letter of miss henrietta coldbrooke  here it is hugh cried my guardian gaily and a capital letter it is i wish i could read the whole of it to you but the two girls made me promise never to show their letters to any one which could mean only you before they would promise to write anything to me beyond commonplaces now i get their sentiments freely and naturally and the correspondence is a source of much pleasure to me i think however i might venture just to give you one extract  you had better not sir there would be a sort of treachery in it that i confess i would rather not be accessary to if miss coldbrooke do not wish me to read what she writes she can hardly wish that you should read any of it to me  uncle ro glanced at me and i fancied he seemed dissatisfied with my nonchalance he read the letter through to himself however laughing here smiling there then muttering capital good charming girl worthy of hannah more c c as if just to provoke my curiosity but i had no desire to read hannah more as any young fellow of fiveandtwenty can very well imagine and i stood it all with the indifference of a stoic my guardian had to knock under and put the letters in his writingdesk  well the girls will be glad to see us he said after a moment of reflection and not a little surprised in my very last letter to my mother i sent them word that we should not be home until october and now we shall see them as early as june at least  patt will be delighted i make no doubt as for the other two young ladies they have so many friends and relations to care for that i fancy our movements give them no great concern  then you do both injustice as their letters would prove they take the liveliest interest in our proceedings and speak of my return as if they look for it with the greatest expectation and joy  i made my uncle ro a somewhat saucy answer but fairdealing compels me to record it  i dare say they do sir was my reply but what young lady does not look with expectation and joy for the return of a friend who is known to have a long purse from paris  well hugh you deserve neither of those dear girls and if i can help it you shall have neither  thankee sir  poh this is worse than sillyit is rude i dare say neither would accept you were you to offer tomorrow  i trust not sir for her own sake it would be a singularly palpable demonstration were either to accept a man she barely knew and whom she had not seen since she was fifteen  uncle ro laughed but i could see he was confoundedly vexed and as i loved him with all my heart though i did not love matchmaking i turned the discourse in a pleasant way on our approaching departure  ill tell you what ill do hugh cried my uncle who was a good deal of a boy in some things for the reason i suppose that he was an old bachelor ill just have wrong names entered on board the packet and well surprise all our friends neither jacob nor your man will betray us we know and for that matter we can send them both home by the way of england each of us has trunks in london to be looked after and let the two fellows go by the way of liverpool that is a good thought and occurred most happily  with all my heart sir my fellow is of no more use to me at sea than an automaton would be and i shall be glad to get rid of his rueful countenance he is a capital servant on terrâ firma but a perfect niobe on the briny main  the thing was agreed on and a day or two afterwards both our bodyservants that is to say jacob the black and hubert the german were on their way to england my uncle let his apartment again for he always maintained i should wish to bring my bride to pass a winter in it and we proceeded to havre in a sort of incognito there was little danger of our being known on board the packet and we had previously ascertained that there was not an acquaintance of either in the ship there was a strong family resemblance between my uncle and myself and we passed for father and son in the ship as old mr davidson and young mr davidson of marylandor myrrland as it is doric to call that state we had no concern in this part of the deception unless abstaining from calling my supposed father uncle as one would naturally do in strange society can be so considered  the passage itselfby the way i wish all landsmen would be as accurate as i am here and understand that a voyage means out and home or thence and back again while a passage means from place to placebut our passage was pregnant with no events worth recording we had the usual amount of good and bad weather the usual amount of eating and drinking and the usual amount of ennui the latter circumstance perhaps contributed to the digesting of a further scheme of my uncles which it is now necessary to state  a reperusal of his letters and papers had induced him to think the antirent movement a thing of more gravity even than he had first supposed the combination on the part of the tenants we learned also from an intelligent new yorker who was a fellowpassenger extended much further than our accounts had given us reason to believe and it was deemed decidedly dangerous for landlords in many cases to be seen on their own estates insult personal degradation or injury and even death it was thought might be the consequences in many cases the blood actually spilled had had the effect to check the more violent demonstrations it is true but the latent determination to achieve their purposes was easily to be traced among the tenants in the face of all their tardy professions of moderation and a desire for nothing but what was right in this case what was right was the letter and spirit of the contracts and nothing was plainer than the fact that these were not what was wanted  professions pass for nothing with the experienced when connected with a practice that flatly contradicts them it was only too apparent to all who chose to look into the matter and that by evidence which could not mislead that the great body of the tenants in various counties of new york were bent on obtaining interests in their farms that were not conveyed by their leases without the consent of their landlords and insomuch that they were bent on doing that which should be discountenanced by every honest man in the community the very fact that they supported or in any manner connived at the socalled injin system spoke all that was necessary as to their motives and when we come to consider that these injins had already proceeded to the extremity of shedding blood it was sufficiently plain that things must soon reach a crisis  my uncle roger and myself reflected on all these matters calmly and decided on our course i trust with prudence as that decision has proved to be pregnant with consequences that are likely to affect my future life i shall now briefly give an outline of what induced us to adopt it  it was allimportant for us to visit ravensnest in person while it might be hazardous to do so openly the nest house stood in the very centre of the estate and ignorant as we were of the temper of the tenants it might be indiscreet to let our presence be known and circumstances favoured our projects of concealment we were not expected to reach the country at all until autumn or fall as that season of the year is poetically called in america and this gave us the means of reaching the property unexpectedly and as we hoped undetected our arrangement then was very simple and will be best related in the course of the narrative  the packet had a reasonably short passage as we were twentynine days from land to land it was on a pleasant afternoon in may when the hummocklike heights of navesink were first seen from the deck and an hour later we came in sight of the towerresembling sails of the coasters which were congregating in the neighbourhood of the low point of land that is so very appropriately called sandy hook the lighthouses rose out of the water soon after and objects on the shore of new jersey next came gradually out of the misty background until we got near enough to be boarded first by the pilot and next by the newsboat the first preceding the last for a wonder news usually being far more active in this good republic than watchfulness to prevent evil my uncle ro gave the crew of this newsboat a thorough scrutiny and finding no one on board her whom he had ever before seen he bargained for a passage up to town  we put our feet on the battery just as the clocks of new york were striking eight a customhouse officer had examined our carpetbags and permitted them to pass and we had disburthened ourselves of the effects in the ship by desiring the captain to attend to them each of us had a townhouse but neither would go near his dwelling mine being only kept up in winter for the use of my sister and an aunt who kindly took charge of her during the season while my uncles was opened principally for his mother at that season we had reason to think neither was tenanted but by one or two old family servants and it was our cue also to avoid them but jack dunning as my uncle always called him was rather more of a friend than of an agent and he had a bachelor establishment in chamber street that was precisely the place we wanted thither then we proceeded taking the route by greenwich street fearful of meeting some one in broadway by whom we might be recognised     chapter iv      cit speak speak      1 cit you are all resolved rather to die than to famish      cit resolved resolved      1 cit first you know caius marcus is chief enemy to the people      cit we knowt we knowt      1 cit lets kill him and well have corn at our own price               ist a verdict      coriolanus   the most inveterate manhattanese if he be anything of a man of the world must confess that new york is after all but a ragfair sort of a place so far as the eye is concerned i was particularly struck with this fact even at that hour as we went stumbling along over an atrociously bad sidewalk my eyes never at rest as any one can imagine after five years of absence i could not help noting the incongruities the dwellings of marble in close proximity with miserable low constructions in wood the wretched pavements and above all the country air of a town of near four hundred thousand souls i very well know that many of the defects are to be ascribed to the rapid growth of the place which gives it a sort of hobbledehoy look but being a manhattanese by birth i thought i might just as well own it all at once if it were only for the information of a particular portion of my townsmen who may have been under a certain delusion on the subject as for comparing the bay of new york with that of naples on the score of beauty i shall no more be guilty of any such folly to gratify the cockney feelings of broadway and bond street than i should be guilty of the folly of comparing the commerce of the ancient parthenope with that of old new york in order to excite complacency in the bosom of some bottegajo in the toledo or on the chiaja our fastgrowing manhattan is a great town in its waya wonderful placewithout a parallel i do believe on earth as a proof of enterprise and of the accumulation of business and it is not easy to make such a town appear ridiculous by any jibes and innuendoes that relate to the positive things of this world though nothing is easier than to do it for itself by setting up to belong to the sisterhood of such places as london paris vienna and st petersburg there is too much of the american notion of the omnipotence of numbers among us manhattanese which induces us to think that the higher rank in the scale of places is to be obtained by majorities no no let us remember the familiar axiom of ne sutor ultra crepidum new york is just the queen of business but not yet the queen of the world every man who travels ought to bring back something to the common stock of knowledge and i shall give a hint to my townsmen by which i really think they may be able to tell for themselves as by feeling a sort of moral pulse when the town is rising to the level of a capital when simplicity takes the place of pretension is one good rule but as it may require a good deal of practice or native taste to ascertain this fact i will give another that is obvious to the senses which will at least be strongly symptomatic and that is this when squares cease to be called parks when horsebazaars and fashionable streets are not called tattersalls and bond street when washington market is rechristened bear market and franklin and fulton and other great philosophers and inventors are plucked of the unmerited honours of having shambles named after them when commercial is not used as a prefix to emporium when people can return from abroad without being asked if they are reconciled to their country and strangers are not interrogated at the second question how do you like our city then may it be believed that the town is beginning to go alone and that it may set up for itself  although new york is out of all question decidedly provincial labouring under the peculiar vices of provincial habits and provincial modes of thinking it contains many a man of the world and some too who have never quitted their own firesides of this very number was the jack dunning as my uncle ro called him to whose house in chamber street we were now proceeding  if we were going anywhere but to dunnings said my uncle as we turned out of greenwich street i should have no fear of being recognised by the servants for no one here thinks of keeping a man six months dunning however is of the old school and does not like new faces so he will have no irishman at his door as is the case with two out of three of the houses at which one calls nowadays  in another minute we were at the bottom of mr dunnings stoupwhat an infernal contrivance it is to get in and out at the door by in a hottycold climate like oursbut there we were and i observed that my uncle hesitated  parlez au suisse said i ten to one he is fresh from some ballythis or ballythat  no no it must be old garry the niggermy uncle ro was of the old school himself and would say niggerjack can never have parted with garry  garry was the diminutive of garret a somewhat common dutch christian name among us  we rang and the door openedin about five minutes although the terms aristocrat and aristocracy are much in mens mouths in america just now as well as those of feudal and the middle ages and this too as applied to modes of living as well as to leasehold tenures there is but one porter in the whole country and he belongs to the white house at washington i am afraid even that personage royal porter as he is is often out of the way and the reception he gives when he is there is not of the most brilliant and princely character when we had waited three minutes my uncle ro said  i am afraid garry is taking a nap by the kitchenfire ill try him again  uncle ro did try again and two minutes later the door opened  what is your pleasure demanded the suisse with a strong brogue  my uncle started back as if he had met a sprite but he asked if mr dunning was at home  he is indeed sir  is he alone or is he with company  he is indeed  but what is he indeed  he is that  can you take the trouble to explain which that it is has he company or is he alone  just that sir walk in and hell be charmed to see you a fine gentleman is his honour and pleasure it is to live with him im sure  how long is it since you left ireland my friend  isnt it a mighty bit now yer honour answered barney closing the door tirteen weeks if its one day  well go ahead and show us the way this is a bad omen hugh to find that jack dunning of all men in the country should have changed his servantgood quiet lazy respectable old greyheaded garry the niggerfor such a bogtrotter as that fellow who climbs those stairs as if accustomed only to ladders  dunning was in his library on the second floor where he passed most of his evenings his surprise was equal to that which my uncle had just experienced when he saw us two standing before him a significant gesture however caused him to grasp his friend and clients hand in silence and nothing was said until the swiss had left the room although the fellow stood with the door in his hand a most inconvenient time just to listen to what might pass between the host and his guests at length we got rid of him honest wellmeaning fellow that he was after all and the door was closed  my last letters have brought you home roger said jack the moment he could speak for feeling as well as caution had something to do with his silence  they have indeed a great change must have come over the country by what i hear and one of the very worst symptoms is that you have turned away garry and got an irishman in his place  ah old men must die as well as old principles i find my poor fellow went off in a fit last week and i took that irishman as a pis aller after losing poor garry who was born a slave in my fathers house i became indifferent and accepted the first comer from the intelligence office  we must be careful dunning not to give up too soon but hear my story and then to other matters  my uncle then explained his wish to be incognito and his motive dunning listened attentively but seemed uncertain whether to dissent or approve the matter was discussed briefly and then it was postponed for further consideration  but how comes on this great moral dereliction called antirentism is it on the wane or the increase  on the wane to the eye perhaps but on the increase so far as principles the right and facts are concerned the necessity of propitiating votes is tempting politicians of all sides to lend themselves to it and there is imminent danger now that atrocious wrongs will be committed under the form of law  in what way can the law touch an existing contract the supreme court of the united states will set that right  that is the only hope of the honest let me tell you it is folly to expect that a body composed of such men as usually are sent to the state legislature can resist the temptation to gain power by conciliating numbers that is out of the question individuals of these bodies may resist but the tendency there will be as against the few and in favour of the many bolstering their theories by claptraps and slang political phrases the scheme to tax the rents under the name of quitrents will be resorted to in the first place  that will be a most iniquitous proceeding and would justify resistance just as much as our ancestors were justified in resisting the taxation of great britain  it would more so for here we have a written covenant to render taxation equal the landlord already pays one tax on each of these farmsa full and complete tax that is reserved from the rent in the original bargain with the tenant and now the wish is to tax the rents themselves and this not to raise revenue for that is confessedly not wanted but most clearly with a design to increase the inducements for the landlords to part with their property if that can be done the sales will be made on the principle that none but the tenant must be as indeed no one else can be the purchaser and then we shall see a queer exhibitionmen parting with their property under the pressure of a clamour that is backed by as much law as can be pressed into its service with a monopoly of price on the side of the purchaser and all in a country professing the most sensitive love of liberty where the prevailing class of politicians are freetrade men  there is no end of these inconsistencies among politicians  there is no end of knavery when men submit to noses instead of principles call things by their right names ro as they deserve to be this matter is so plain that he who runs can read  but will this scheme of taxation succeed it does not effect us for instance as our leases are for three lives  oh that is nothing for you they contemplate a law that will forbid the letting of land for the future for a period longer than five years hughs leases will soon be falling in and then he cant make a slave of any man for a longer period than five years  surely no one is so silly as to think of passing such a law with a view to put down aristocracy and to benefit the tenant i cried laughing  ay you may laugh young sir resumed jack dunning but such is the intention i know very well what will be your course of reasoning you will say the longer the lease the better for the tenant if the bargain be reasonably good and landlords cannot ask more for the use of their lands than they are really worth in this country there happening to be more lands than there are men to work it no no landlords rather get less for their lands than they are worth instead of more for that plain reason to compel the tenant to take a lease therefore for a term as short as five years is to injure him you think to place him more at the control of his landlord through the little interests connected with the cost and trouble of moving and through the natural desire he may possess to cut the meadows he has seeded and to get the full benefit of manure he has made and carted i see how you reason young sir but you are behind the ageyou are sadly behind the age  the age is a queer one if i am all over the world it is believed that long leases are favours or advantages to tenants and nothing can make it otherwise cæteris paribus then what good will the tax do after violating right and moral justice if not positive law to lay it on a hundred dollars of rent i should have to pay some fiftyfive cents of taxes as i am assessed on other things at ravensnest and does anybody suppose i will give up an estate that has passed through five generations of my family on account of a tribute like that  mighty well sirmighty well sir this is fine talk but i would advise you not to speak of your ancestors at all landlords cant name their ancestors with impunity just now  i name mine only as showing a reason for a natural regard for my paternal acres  that you might do if you were a tenant but not as a landlord in a landlord it is aristocratic and intolerable pride and to the last degree offensiveas dogberry says tolerable and not to be endured  but it is a fact and it is natural one should have some feelings connected with it  the more it is a fact the less it will be liked people associate social position with wealth and estates but not with farms and the longer one has such things in a family the worse for them  i do believe jack put in my uncle ro that the rule which prevails all over the rest of the world is reversed here and that with us it is thought a familys claim is lessened and not increased by time  to be sure it is answered dunning without giving me a chance to speak do you know that you wrote me a very silly letter once from switzerland about a family called de blonay that had been seated on the same rock in a little castle some six or eight hundred years and the sort of respect and veneration the circumstance awakened well all that was very foolish as you will find when you pay your incognito visit to ravensnest i will not anticipate the result of your schooling but go to school  as the rensselaers and other great landlords who have states on durable leases will not be very likely to give them up except on terms that will suit themselves for a tax as insignificant as that mentioned by hugh said my uncle what does the legislature anticipate from passing the law  that its members will be called the friends of the people and not the friends of the landlords would any man tax his friends if he could help it  but what will that portion of the people who compose the antirenters gain by such a measure  nothing and their complaints will be just as loud and their longings as active as ever nothing that can have any effect on what they wish will be accomplished by any legislation in the matter one committee of the assembly has actually reported you may remember that the state might assume the lands and sell them to the tenants or some one else or something of the sort  the constitution of the united states must be hughs ægis  and that alone will protect him let me tell you but for that noble provision of the constitution of the federal government his estate would infallibly go for onehalf its true value there is no use in mincing things or in affecting to believe men more honest than they arean infernal feeling of selfishness is so much talked of and cited and referred to on all occasions in this country that a man almost renders himself ridiculous who appears to rest on principle  have you heard what the tenants of ravensnest aim at in particular  they want to get hughs lands thats all nothing more i can assure you  on what conditions pray demanded i  as you light of chaps to use a saying of their own some even profess a willingness to pay a fair price  but i do not wish to sell for even a fair price i have no desire to part with property that is endeared to me by family feeling and association i have an expensive house and establishment on my estate which obtains its principal value from the circumstance that it is so placed that i can look after my interests with the least inconvenience to myself what can i do with the money but buy another estate and i prefer this that i have  poh boy you can shave notes youll recollect said uncle ro drily the calling is decided to be honourable by the highest tribunal and no man should be above his business  you have no right sir in a free country returned the caustic jack dunning to prefer one estate to another more especially when other people want it your lands are leased to honest hardworking tenants who can eat their dinners without silver forks and whose ancestors  stop i cried laughing i bar all ancestry no man has a right to ancestry in a free country youll remember  that means landlordancestry as for tenantancestry one can have a pedigree as long as the maison de levis no sir every tenant you have has every right to demand that his sentiment of family feeling should be respected his father planted that orchard and he loves the apples better than any other apples in the world  and my father procured the grafts and made him a present of them  his grandfather cleared that field and converted its ashes into pots and pearls  and my grandfather received that year ten shillings of rent for land off which his received two hundred and fifty dollars for his ashes  his greatgrandfather honest and excellent mannay superhonest and confiding creaturefirst took up the land when a wilderness and with his own hands felled the timber and sowed the wheat  and got his pay twentyfold for it all or he would not have been fool enough to do it i had a greatgrandfather too and i hope it will not be considered aristocratic if i venture to hint as much hea dishonest pestilent knave no doubtleased that very lot for six years without any rent at all in order that the poor confiding creature might make himself comfortable before he commenced paying his sixpence or shilling an acre rent for the remainder of three lives with a moral certainty of getting a renewal on the most liberal terms known to a new country and who knew the whole time he could buy land in fee within ten miles of his door but who thought this a better bargain than that  enough of this folly cried uncle ro joining in the laugh we all know that in our excellent america he who has the highest claims to anything must affect to have the least to stifle the monster envy and being of one mind as to principles let us come to facts what of the girls jack and of my honoured mother  she noble heroic woman she is at ravensnest at this moment and as the girls would not permit her to go alone they are all with her  and did you jack dunning suffer them to go unattended into a part of the country that is in open rebellion demanded my uncle reproachfully  come come hodge littlepage this is very sublime as a theory but not so clear when reduced to practice i did not go with mrs littlepage and her young fry for the good and substantial reason that i did not wish to be tarred and feathered  so you leave them to run the risk of being tarred and feathered in your stead  say what you will about the cant of freedom that is becoming so common among us and from which we were once so free say what you will ro of the inconsistency of those who raise the cry of feudality and aristocracy and nobility at the very moment they are manifesting a desire for exclusive rights and privileges in their own persons say what you will of dishonesty envy that prominent american vice knavery covetousness and selfishness and i will echo all you can utterbut do not say that a woman can be in serious danger among any material body of americans even if antirenters and mockredskins in the bargain  i believe you are right there jack on reflection pardon my warmth but i have lately been living in the old world and in a country in which women were not long since carried to the scaffold on account of their politics  because they meddled with politics your mother is in no serious danger though it needs nerve in a woman to be able to think so there are few women in the state and fewer of her time of life anywhere that would do what she has done and i give the girls great credit for sticking by her half the young men in town are desperate at the thought of three such charming creatures thus exposing themselves to insult your mother has only been sued  sued whom does she owe or what can she have done to have brought this indignity on her  you know or ought to know how it is in this country littlepage we must have a little law even when most bent on breaking it a downright straightforward rascal who openly sets law at defiance is a wonder then we have a great talk of liberty when plotting to give it the deepest stab and religion even gets to share in no small portion of our vices thus it is that the antirenters have dragged in the law in aid of their designs i understand one of the rensselaers has been sued for money borrowed in a ferryboat to help him across a river under his own door and for potatoes bought by his wife in the streets of albany  but neither of the rensselaers need borrow money to cross the ferry as the ferrymen would trust him and no lady of the rensselaer family ever bought potatoes in the streets of albany ill answer for it  you have brought back some knowledge from your travels i find said jack dunning with comic gravity your mother writes me that she has been sued for twentyseven pairs of shoes furnished her by a shoemaker whom she never saw or heard of until she received the summons  this then is one of the species of annoyances that has been adopted to bully the landlords out of their property  it is and if the landlords have recourse even to the covenants of their leases solemnly and deliberately made and as solemnly guarantied by a fundamental law the cry is raised of aristocracy and oppression by these very men and echoed by many of the creatures who get seats in high places among usor what would be high places if filled with men worthy of their trusts  i see you do not mince your words jack  why should i words are all that is left me i am of no more weight in the government of this state than that irishman who let you in just now will be five years henceless for he will vote to suit a majority and as i shall vote understandingly my vote will probably do no one any good  dunning belonged to a school that mingles a good deal of speculative and impracticable theory with a great deal of sound and just principles but who render themselves useless because they will admit of no compromises he did not belong to the class of american doctrinaires however or to those who contendno not contend for no one does that any longer in this country whatever may be his opinion on the subjectbut those who think that political power as in the last resort should be the property of the few for he was willing new york should have a very broad constituency nevertheless he was opposed to the universal suffrage in its wide extent that does actually exist as i suppose quite threefourths of the whole population are opposed to it in their hearts though no political man of influence now existing has the moral calibre necessary to take the lead in putting it down dunning deferred to principles and not to men he well knew that an infallible whole was not to be composed of fallible parts and while he thought majorities ought to determine many things that there are rights and principles that are superior to even such unanimity as man can manifest and much more to their majorities but dunning had no selfish views connected with his political notions wanting no office and feeling no motive to affect that which he neither thought nor wished he never had quitted home or it is highly probable his views of the comparative abuses of the different systems that prevail in the world would have been essentially modified those he saw had unavoidably a democratic source there being neither monarch nor aristocrat to produce any other and under such circumstances as abuses certainly abound it is not at all surprising that he sometimes a little distorted facts and magnified evils  and my noble highspirited and venerable mother has actually gone to the nest to face the enemy exclaimed my uncle after a thoughtful pause  she has indeed and the noble highspirited though not venerable young ladies have gone with her returned mr dunning in his caustic way  all three do you mean  every one of themmartha henrietta and anne  i am surprised that the last should have done so anne marston is such a meek quiet peaceloving person that i should think she would have preferred remaining as she naturally might have done without exciting remark with her own mother  she has not nevertheless mrs littlepage would brave the antirenters and the three maidens would be her companions i dare say ro you know how it is with the gentle sex when they make up their minds  my girls are all good girls and have given me very little trouble answered my uncle complacently  yes i dare say that may be true you have only been absent from home five years this trip  an attentive guardian notwithstanding since i left you as a substitute has my mother written to you since her arrival among the hosts of the philistines  she has indeed littlepage answered dunning gravely i have heard from her three times for she writes to urge my not appearing on the estate i did intend to pay her a visit but she tells me that it might lead to a violent scene and can do no good as the rents will not be due until autumn and master hugh is now of age and was to be here to look after his own affairs i have seen no motive for incurring the risk of the tarring and feathering we american lawyers young gentleman wear no wigs  does my mother write herself or employ another inquired my uncle with interest  she honours me with her own hand your mother writes much better than you do yourself roger  that is owing to her once having carried chain as she would say herself has martha written to you  of course sweet little patty and i are bosom friends as you know  and does she say anything of the indian and the negro  jaaf and susquesus to be sure she does both are living still and both are well i saw them myself and even ate of their venison so lately as last winter  those old fellows must have each lived a great deal more than his century jack they were with my grandfather in the old french war as active useful menolder then than my grandfather  ay a nigger or a redskin before all others for holding on to life when they have been temperate let me seethat expedition of abercrombies was about eighty years since why these fellows must be well turned of their hundred though jaap is rather the oldest judging from appearances  i believe no one knows the age of either a hundred each has been thought now for many years susquesus was surprisingly active too when i last saw himlike a healthy man of eighty  he has failed of late though he actually shot a deer as i told you last winter both the old fellows stray down to the nest martha writes me and the indian is highly scandalized at the miserable imitations of his race that are now abroad i have even heard that he and yop have actually contemplated taking the field against them seneca newcome is their especial aversion  how is opportunity i inquired does she take any part in this movement  a decided one i hear she is antirent while she wishes to keep on good terms with her landlord and that is endeavouring to serve god and mammon she is not the first however by a thousand that wears two faces in this business  hugh has a deep admiration of opportunity observed my uncle and you had needs be tender in your strictures the modern seneca i take it is dead against us  seneky wishes to go to the legislature and of course he is on the side of votes then his brother is a tenant at the mill and naturally wishes to be the landlord he is also interested in the land himself one thing has struck me in this controversy as highly worthy of notice and it is the naïveté with which men reconcile the obvious longings of covetousness with what they are pleased to fancy the principles of liberty when a man has worked a farm a certain number of years he boldly sets up the doctrine that the fact itself gives him a high moral claim to possess it for ever a moments examination will expose the fallacy by which these sophists apply the flattering unction to their souls they work their farms under a lease and in virtue of its covenants now in a moral sense all that time can do in such a case is to render these covenants the more sacred and consequently more binding but these worthies whose morality is all on one side imagine that these timehonoured covenants give them a right to fly from their own conditions during their existence and to raise pretensions far exceeding anything they themselves confer the moment they cease  poh poh jack there is no need of refining at all to come at the merits of such a question this is a civilized country or it is not if it be a civilized country it will respect the rights of property and its own laws and if the reverse it will not respect them as for setting up the doctrine at this late day when millions and millions are invested in this particular species of property that the leasehold tenure is opposed to the spirit of institutions of which it has substantially formed a part ever since those institutions have themselves had an existence it requires a bold front and more capacity than any man at albany possesses to make the doctrines go down men may run off with the notion that the tendencies to certain abuses which mark every system form their spirit but this is a fallacy that a very little thought will correct is it true that proposals have actually been made by these pretenders to liberty to appoint commissioners to act as arbitrators between the landlords and tenants and to decide points that no one has any right to raise  true as holy writ and a regular star chamber tribunal it would be it is wonderful after all how extremes do meet  that is as certain as the return of the sun after night but let us now talk of our project jack and of the means of getting among these selfdeluded mendeluded by their own covetousnesswithout being discovered for i am determined to see them and to judge of their motives and conduct for myself  take care of the tarbarrel and of the pillowcase of feathers roger  i shall endeavour so to do  we then discussed the matter before us at length and leisurely i shall not relate all that was said as it would be going over the same ground twice but refer the reader to the regular narrative at the usual hour we retired to our beds retaining the name of davidson as convenient and prudent next day mr john dunning busied himself in our behalf and made himself exceedingly useful to us in his character of an old bachelor he had many acquaintances at the theatre and through his friends of the greenroom he supplied each of us with a wig both my uncle and myself spoke german reasonably well and our original plan was to travel in the characters of immigrant trinket and essence pedlars but i had a fancy for a handorgan and a monkey and it was finally agreed that mr hugh roger littlepage senior was to undertake this adventure with a box of cheap watches and gilded trinkets while mr hugh roger littlepage junior was to commence his travels at home in the character of a musicgrinder modesty will not permit me to say all i might in favour of my own skill in music in general but i sang well for an amateur and played both on the violin and flute far better than is common  everything was arranged in the course of the following day our wigs of themselves completely effecting all the disguises that were necessary as for my uncle he was nearly bald and a wig was no great encumbrance but my shaggy locks gave me some trouble a little clipping however answered the turn and i had a hearty laugh at myself in costume that afternoon before dunnings dressingroom glass we got round the felony law about being armed and disguised by carrying no weapons but our tools in the way of trade     chapter v      and she hath smiles to earth unknown     smiles that with motion of their own     do spread and sink and rise     that come and go with endless play     and ever as they pass away     are hidden in her eyes      wordsworth   i was early in costume the following morning i question if my own mother could have known me had she lived long enough to see the whiskers sprout on my cheeks and to contemplate my countenance as a man i went into dunnings library drew the little hurdygurdy from its hidingplace slung it and began to play st patricks day in the morning with spirit and i trust i may add with execution i was in the height of the air when the door opened and barney thrust his highcheekedbone face into the room his mouth as wide open as that of a frozen porker  where the divil did ye come from demanded the new footman with the muscles of that vast aperture of his working from grin to grim and grim to grin again yees wilcome to the tchune but how comes ye here  i coomes vrom halle in preussen vat isht your vaterland  be yees a jew  neini isht a goot christian vilt you haf yankee tootle  yankee tunder yell wake up the masther and hell be displaisd else ye might work upon tat tchune till the end of time that i should hear it here in my own liberary and ould ireland tree thousand laigues away  a laugh from dunning interrupted the dialogue when barney vanished no doubt anticipating some species of american punishment for a presumed delinquency whether the blundering wellmeaning honest fellow really ascertained who we were that breakfasted with his master i do not know but we got the meal and left the house without seeing his face again dunning having a young yellow fellow to do the service of the table  i need scarcely say that i felt a little awkward at finding myself in the streets of new york in such a guise but the gravity and selfpossession of my uncle were a constant source of amusement to me he actually sold a watch on the wharf before the boat left it though i imputed his success to the circumstance that his price was what a brother dealer who happened to be trading in the same neighbourhood pronounced onconscionably low we took a comfortable stateroom between us under the pretence of lockingup our property and strolled about the boat gaping and looking curious as became our class  here are at least a dozen people that i know said my uncle as we were lounging aroundloafing around is the modern doricabout the time that the boat was paddling past fort washington i have reconnoitred in all quarters and find quite a dozen i have been conversing with an old schoolfellow and one with whom i have ever lived in tolerable intimacy for the last ten minutes and find my broken english and disguise are perfect i am confident my dear mother herself would not recognise me  we can then amuse ourselves with my grandmother and the young ladies i answered when we reach the nest for my part it strikes me that we had better keep our own secret to the last moment  hush as i live there is seneca newcome this moment he is coming this way and we must be germans again  sure enough there was squire seneky as the honest farmers around the nest call him though many of them must change their practices or it will shortly become so absurd to apply the term honest to them that no one will have the hardihood to use it newcome came slowly towards the forecastle on which we were standing and my uncle determined to get into conversation with him as a means of further proving the virtue of our disguises as well as possibly of opening the way to some communications that might facilitate our visit to the nest with this view the pretended pedlar drew a watch from his pocket and offering it meekly to the inspection of the quasi lawyer he said  puy a vatch shentlemans  hey what oh a watch returned seneca in that high condescending vulgar key with which the salt of the earth usually affect to treat those they evidently think much beneath them in intellect station or some other great essential at the very moment they are bursting with envy and denouncing

uncle cheerfully take himhe ist your broberty and wilcome only show me de town where i canst sell de nineteen udders  had my uncle ro been a true son of peddling he would have charged a dollar extra

afraid he might give the alarm to our companion but he did not from that time the best relations existed between us and seneca who in the course of the day recognised us by sundry smiles and winks though i could plainly see he did not like the antiaristocratic principle sufficiently to wish to seem too intimate with us before we reached the islands however he gave us directions where to meet him in the morning and we parted when the boat stopped alongside of the pier at albany that afternoon the best friends in the world  albany dear good old albany exclaimed my uncle ro as we stopped on the draw of the bridge to look at the busy scene in the basin where literally hundreds of canalboats were either lying to discharge or to load or were coming and going to say nothing of other craft dear good old albany you are a town to which i ever return with pleasure for you at least never disappoint me a firstrate countryplace you are and though i miss your quaint old dutch church and your rusticlooking old english church from the centre of your principal street almost every change you make is respectable i know nothing that tells so much against you as changing the name of market street by the paltry imitation of broadway but considering that a horde of yankees have come down upon you since the commencement of the present century you are lucky that the street was not called the appian way but excellent old albany whom even the corruptions of politics cannot change in the core lying against thy hillside and surrounded with thy picturesque scenery there is an air of respectability about thee that i admire and a quiet prosperity that i love yet how changed since my boyhood thy simple stoups have all vanished thy gables are disappearing marble and granite are rising in thy streets too but they take honest shapes and are free from the ambition of mounting on stilts thy basin has changed the whole character of thy once semisylvan semicommercial river but it gives to thy young manhood an appearance of abundance and thrift that promise well for thy age  the reader may depend on it that i laughed heartily at this rhapsody for i could hardly enter into my uncles feelings albany is certainly a very good sort of a place and relatively a more respectablelooking town than the commercial emporium which after all externally is a mere huge expansion of a very marked mediocrity with the pretension of a capital in its estimate of itself but albany lays no claim to be anything more than a provincial town and in that class it is highly placed by the way there is nothing in which our people to speak idiomatically more deceive themselves than in their estimate of what composes a capital it would be ridiculous to suppose that the representatives of such a government as this could impart to any place the tone opinions habits and manners of a capital for if they did they would impart it on the novel principle of communicating that which they do not possess in their own persons congress itself though tolerably free from most shackles including those of the constitution is not up to that in my opinion a man accustomed to the world might be placed blindfolded in the most finished quarter of new york and the place has new quarters in which the incongruities i have already mentioned do not exist and my life on it he could pronounce as soon as the bandage was removed that he was not in a town where the tone of a capital exists the last thing to make a capital is trade indeed the man who hears the words business and the merchants ringing in his ears may safely conclude de facto that he is not in a capital now a newyork village is often much less rustic than the villages of the most advanced country of europe but a newyork town is many degrees below any capital of a large state in the old world  will new york ever be a capital yesout of all question yes but the day will not come until after the sudden changes of condition which immediately and so naturally succeeded the revolution have ceased to influence ordinary society and those above again impart to those below more than they receive this restoration to the natural state of things must take place as soon as society gets settled and there will be nothing to prevent a town living under our own institutionsspirit tendencies and allfrom obtaining the highest tone that ever yet prevailed in a capital the folly is in anticipating the natural course of events nothing will more hasten these events however than a literature that is controlled not by the lower but by the higher opinion of the country which literature is yet in a great degree to be created  i had dispensed with the monkey after trying to get along with the creature for an hour or two and went around only with my music i would rather manage an army of antirenters than one monkey with the hurdygurdy slung around my neck therefore i followed my uncle who actually sold another watch before we reached a tavern of course we did not presume to go to congress hall or the eagle for we knew we should not be admitted this was the toughest part of our adventures i am of opinion my uncle made a mistake for he ventured to a secondclass house under the impression that one of the sort usually frequented by men of our supposed stamp might prove too coarse for us altogether i think we should have been better satisfied with the coarse fare of a coarse tavern than with the shabbygenteel of the house we blundered into in the former everything would have reminded us in a way we expected to be reminded that we were out of the common track and we might have been amused with the change though it is one singularly hard to be endured i remember to have heard a young man accustomed from childhood to the better habits of the country but who went to sea a lad before the mast declare that the coarseness of his shipmates and there is no vulgarity about a true sailor even when coarsest gave him more trouble to overcome than all the gales physical sufferings labour exposures and dangers put together i must confess i have found it so too in my little experience while acting as a strolling musician i could get along with anything better than the coarse habits which i encountered at the table your silverforkisms and your purely conventional customs as a matter of course no man of the world attaches any serious importance to but there are conventionalities that belong to the fundamental principles of civilized society which become second nature and with which it gets to be hard indeed to dispense i shall say as little as possible of the disagreeables of my new trade therefore but stick to the essentials  the morning of the day which succeeded that of our arrival at albany my uncle ro and i took our seats in the train intending to go to saratoga viâ troy i wonder the trojan who first thought of playing this travestie on homer did not think of calling the place troyville or troyborough that would have been semiamerican at least whereas the present appellation is so purely classical it is impossible to walk through the streets of this neat and flourishing town which already counts its twenty thousand souls and not have the images of achilles and hector and priam and hecuba pressing on the imagination a little uncomfortably had the place been called try the name would have been a sensible one for it is trying all it can to get the better of albany and much as i love the latter venerable old town i hope troy may succeed in its trying to prevent the hudson from being bridged by the way i will here remark for the benefit of those who have never seen any country but their own that there is a view on the road between schenectady and this grecian place just where the heights give the first full appearance of the valley of the hudson including glimpses of waterford lansingburg and albany with a full view of both troys which gives one a better idea of the affluence of european scenery than almost any other spot i can recall in america to my hurdygurdy  i made my first essay as a musician in public beneath the windows of the principal inn of troy i cannot say much in favour of the instrument though i trust the playing itself was somewhat respectable this i know full well that i soon brought a dozen fair faces to the windows of the inn and that each was decorated with a smile then it was that i regretted the monkey such an opening could not but awaken the dormant ambition of even a patriot of the purest water and i will own i was gratified  among the curious who thus appeared were two whom i at once supposed to be father and daughter the former was a clergyman and as i fancied by something in his air of the church begging pardon of those who take offence at this exclusive title and to whom i will just give a hint in passing any one at all acquainted with mankind will at once understand that no man who is certain of possessing any particular advantage ever manifests much sensibility because another lays claim to it also in the constant struggles of the jealous for instance on the subject of that universal source of jealous feeling social position the man or woman who is conscious of claims never troubles himself or herself about them for them the obvious fact is sufficient if it be answered to this that the pretension of the church is exclusive i shall admit it is and conclusive too it is not exclusive however in the sense urged since no one denies that there are many branches to the church although those branches do not embrace everything i would advise those who take offence at our styling ourselves the church to style themselves the church just as they call all their parsons bishops and see who will care about it that is a touchstone which will soon separate the true metal from the alloy  my parson i could easily see was a church clergymannot a meetinghouse clergyman how i ascertained that fact at a glance i shall not reveal but i also saw in his countenance some of that curiosity which marks simplicity of character it was not a vulgar feeling but one which induced him to beckon me to approach a little nearer i did so when he invited me in it was a little awkward at first i must acknowledge to be beckoned about in this manner but there was something in the air and countenance of the daughter that induced me not to hesitate about complying i cannot say that her beauty was so very striking though she was decidedly pretty but the expression of her face eyes smile and all put together was so singularly sweet and feminine that i felt impelled by a sympathy i shall not attempt to explain to enter the house and ascend to the door of a parlour that i saw at once was public though it then contained no one but my proper hosts  walk in young man said the father in a benevolent tone of voice i am curious to see that instrument and my daughter here who has a taste for music wishes it as much as i do myself what do you call it  hurtygurty i answered  from what part of the world do you come my young friend continued the clergyman raising his meek eyes to mine still more curiously  vrom charmany vrom preussen vere did reign so late de good koenig wilhelm  what does he say molly  so the pretty creature bore the name of mary i liked the molly too it was a good sign as none but the truly respectable dare use such familiar appellations in these ambitious times molly sounded as if these people had the aplomb of position and conscious breeding had they been vulgar it would have been mollissa  it is not difficult to translate father answered one of the sweetest voices that had ever poured its melody on my ear and which was rendered still more musical by the slight laugh that mingled with it he says he is from germanyfrom prussia where the good king william lately reigned  i liked the father toothat sounded refreshing after passing a night among a tribe of foulnosed adventurers in humanity every one of whom had done his or her share towards caricaturing the once pretty appellatives of pa and ma a young lady may still say papa or even mamma though it were far better that she said father and mother but as for pa and ma they are now done with in respectable life they will not even do for the nursery  and this instrument is a hurdygurdy continued the clergyman what have we herethe name spelt on it  dat isht de makers namehochstiel fecit  fecit repeated the clergyman is that german  neindat isht latin facio feci factum facerefeci feciste fecit it means make i suppose you know  the parson looked at me and at my dress and figure with open surprise and smiled as his eye glanced at his daughter if asked why i made this silly display of lowerform learning i can only say that i chafed at being fancied a mere everyday street musician that had left his monkey at home by the charming girl who stood gracefully bending over her fathers elbow as the latter examined the inscription that was stamped on a small piece of ivory which had been let into the instrument i could see that mary shrunk back a little under the sensitive feeling so natural to her sex that she was manifesting too much freedom of manner for the presence of a youth who was nearer to her own class than she could have supposed it possible for a player on the hurdygurdy to be a blush succeeded but the glance of the soft blue eye that instantly followed seemed to set all at rest and she leaned over her fathers elbow again  you understand latin then demanded the parent examining me over his spectacles from head to foot  a leetle sirjust a ferry leetle in my coontry efery mans isht obliget to be a soldier some time and them tat knows latin can be made sergeants and corporals  that is prussia is it  yapreussen vere so late did reign de goot koenig wilhelm  and is latin much understood among you i have heard that in hungary most wellinformed persons even speak the tongue  in charmany it isht not so we all larnts someting but not all dost larn efery ting  i could see a smile struggling around the sweet lips of that dear girl after i had thus delivered myself as i fancied with a most accurate inaccuracy but she succeeded in repressing it though those provoking eyes of hers continued to laugh much of the time our interview lasted  oh i very well know that in prussia the schools are quite good and that your government pays great attention to the wants of all classes rejoined the clergyman but i confess some surprise that you should understand anything of latin now even in this country where we boast so much  yees i could not refrain from drawling out dey does poast a great teal in dis coontry  mary actually laughed whether it was at my words or at the somewhat comical manner i had assumeda manner in which simplicity was tant soit peu blended with ironyi shall not pretend to say as for the father his simplicity was of proof and after civilly waiting until my interruption was done he resumed what he had been on the point of saying  i was about to add continued the clergyman that even in this country where we boast so muchthe little minx of a daughter passed her hand over her eyes and fairly coloured with the effort she made not to laugh againof the common schools and of their influence on the public mind it is not usual to find persons of your condition who understand the dead languages  yees i replied it isht my condition dat misleats you sir mine fater wast a shentlemans and he gifet me as goot an etication as de koenig did gif to de kron prinz  here my desire to appear well in the eyes of mary caused me to run into another silly indiscretion how i was to explain the circumstance of the son of a prussian gentleman whose father had given him an education as good as that which the king of his country had given to its crown prince being in the streets of troy playing on a hurdygurdy was a difficulty i did not reflect on for a moment the idea of being thought by that sweet girl a mere uneducated boor was intolerable to me and i threw it off by this desperate falsehoodfalse in its accessories but true in its main factsas one would resent an insult fortune favoured me however far more than i had any right to expect  there is a singular disposition in the american character to believe every wellmannered european at least a count i do not mean that those who have seen the world are not like other persons in this respect but a very great proportion of the country never has seen any other world than a world of business the credulity on this subject surpasseth belief and were i to relate facts of this nature that might be established in a court of justice the very parties connected with them would be ready to swear that they are caricatures now wellmannered i trust i am and though plainly dressed and thoroughly disguised neither my air nor attire was absolutely mean as my clothes were new i was neat in my appearance and there were possibly some incongruities about the last that might have struck eyes more penetrating than those of my companions i could see that both father and daughter felt a lively interest in me the instant i gave them reason to believe i was one of better fortunes so many crude notions exist among us on the subject of convulsions and revolutions in europe that i dare say had i told any improbable tale of the political condition of prussia it would have gone down for nothing so much resembles the ignorance that prevails in america generally concerning the true state of things in europe as the ignorance that prevails in europe generally concerning the true state of things in america as for mary her soft eyes seemed to me to be imbued with thrice their customary gentleness and compassion as she recoiled a step in native modesty and gazed at me when i had made my revelation  if such is the case my young friend returned the clergyman with benevolent interest you ought and might easily be placed in a better position than this you are now in have you any knowledge of greek  certainlygreek is moch study in charmany  in for a penny in for a pound i thought  and the modern languagesdo you understand any of them  i speaks de five great tongues of europe more ast less well and i read dem all easily  the five tongues said the clergyman counting on his fingers what can they be mary  french and german and spanish and italian i suppose sir  these make but four what can be the fifth my dear  de yoong laty forgets de englisch de englisch is das funf  oh yes the english exclaimed the pretty creature pressing her lips together to prevent laughing in my face  truei had forgotten the english not being accustomed to think of it as a mere european tongue i suppose young man you naturally speak the english less fluently than any other of your five languages  ya  again the smile struggled to the lips of mary  i feel a deep interest in you as a stranger and am sorry we have only met to part so soon which way shall you be likely to direct your steps my prussian young friend  i go to a place which is callet ravensnestgoot place to sell vatch dey tells me  ravensnest exclaimed the father  ravensnest repeated the daughter and that in tones which put the hurdygurdy to shame  why ravensnest is the place where i live and the parish of which i am the clergymanthe protestant episcopal clergyman i mean  this then was the rev mr warren the divine who had been called to our church the very summer i left home and who had been there ever since my sister martha had written me much concerning these people and i felt as if i had known them for years mr warren was a man of good connexions and some education but of no fortune whatever who had gone into the churchit was the church of his ancestors one of whom had actually been an english bishop a century or two agofrom choice and contrary to the wishes of his friends as a preacher his success had never been great but for the discharge of his duties no man stood higher and no man was more respected the living of st andrews ravensnest would have been poor enough had it depended on the contributions of the parishioners these last gave about one hundred and fifty dollars ayear for their share of the support of a priest i gave another hundred as regularly as clockwork and had been made to do so throughout a long minority and my grandmother and sister made up another fifty between them but there was a glebe of fifty acres of capital land a woodlot and a fund of two thousand dollars at interest the whole proceeding from endowments made by my grandfather during his lifetime altogether the living may have been worth a clear five hundred dollars a year in addition to a comfortable house hay wood vegetables pasture and some advantages in the way of small crops few country clergymen were better off than the rector of st andrews ravensnest and all as a consequence of the feudal and aristocratic habits of the littlepages though i say it perhaps who might better not in times like these  my letters had told me that the rev mr warren was a widower that mary was his only child that he was a truly pious not a shampious and a really zealous clergyman a man of purest truth whose word was gospelof great simplicity and integrity of mind and character that he never spoke evil of others and that a complaint of this world and its hardships seldom crossed his lips he loved his fellowcreatures both naturally and on principle mourned over the state of the diocese and greatly preferred piety even to highchurchism highchurchman he was nevertheless though it was not a highchurchmanship that outweighed the loftier considerations of his christian duties and left him equally without opinions of his own in matters of morals and without a proper respect in practice for those that he had solemnly vowed to maintain  his daughter was described as a sweettempered arch modest sensible and wellbred girl that had received a far better education than her fathers means would have permitted him to bestow through the liberality and affection of a widowed sister of her mothers who was affluent and had caused her to attend the same school as that to which she had sent her own daughters in a word she was a most charming neighbour and her presence at ravensnest had rendered marthas annual visits to the old house built in 1785 not only less irksome but actually pleasant such had been my sisters account of the warrens and their qualities throughout a correspondence of five years i have even fancied that she loved this mary warren better than she loved any of her uncles wards herself of course excepted  the foregoing flashed through my mind the instant the clergyman announced himself but the coincidence of our being on the way to the same part of the country seemed to strike him as forcibly as it did myself what mary thought of the matter i had no means of ascertaining  this is singular enough resumed mr warren what has directed your steps towards ravensnest  dey tell mine ooncle tis goot place to sell moch vatch  you have an uncle then ah i see him there in the street showing a watch at this moment to a gentleman is your uncle a linguist too and has he been as well educated as you seem to be yourself  certainhe moch more of a shentleman dan ast de shentleman to whom he now sell vatch  these must be the very persons put in mary a little eagerly of whom mr newcome spoke as thethe dear girl did not like to say pedlars after what i had told them of my origin so she addeddealers in watches and trinkets who intended to visit our part of the country  you are right my dear and the whole matter is now clear mr newcome said he expected them to join us at troy when we should proceed in the train together as far as saratoga but here comes opportunity herself and her brother cannot be far off  at that moment sure enough my old acquaintance opportunity newcome came into the room a public parlour with an air of great selfsatisfaction and a nonchalance of manner that was not a little more peculiar to herself than it is to most of her caste i trembled for my disguise since to be quite frank on a very delicate subject opportunity had made so very dead a set at mesetting a cap is but a pitiful phrase to express the assault i had to withstandas scarcely to leave a hope that her feminine instinct increased and stimulated with the wish to be mistress of the nest house could possibly overlook the thousand and one personal peculiarities that must still remain about one whose personal peculiarities she had made her particular study     chapter vi      o sic a geek she gave her head     and sic a toss she gave her feather     man saw ye neer a bonnier lass     before among the blooming heather      allan cunningham   ah here are some charming french vignettes cried opportunity running up to a table where lay some inferior coloured engravings that were intended to represent the cardinal virtues under the forms of tawdry female beauties the workmanship was french as were the inscriptions now opportunity knew just enough french to translate these inscriptions simple and schoolgirl as they were as wrong as they could possibly be translated under the circumstances  la vertue cried opportunity in a high decided way as if to make sure of an audience the virtue la solitude pronouncing the last word in a desperately english accent the solitude la charité the charity it is really delightful mary as sarah soothings would say to meet with these glimmerings of taste in this wilderness of the world  i wondered who the deuce sarah soothings could be but afterwards learned this was the nomdeguerre of a female contributor to the magazines who i dare say silly as she might be was never silly enough to record the sentiments opportunity had just professed to repeat as for the la charité and the la vertue they did not in the least surprise me for martha the hussy often made herself merry by recording that young ladys tours de force in french on one occasion i remember she wrote me that when opportunity wished to say on est venu me chercher instead of saying i am come for in homely english which would have been the best of all she had flown off in the high flight of je suis venue pour  mary smiled for she comprehended perfectly the difference between la solitude and the solitude but she said nothing i must acknowledge that i was so indiscreet as to smile also though opportunitys back being turned towards us these mutual signs of intelligence that escaped us both through the eyes opened a species of communication that to me at least was infinitely agreeable  opportunity having shown the owner of the strange figure at which she had just glanced on entering the room that she had studied french now turned to take a better look at him i have reason to think my appearance did not make a very happy impression on her for she tossed her head drew a chair seated herself in the manner most opposed to the descent of down and opened her budget of news without the least regard to my presence and apparently with as little attention to the wishes and tastes of her companions her accent and jumping hitching mode of speaking with the high key in which she uttered her sentiments too all grated on my ears which had become a little accustomed to different habits in young ladies in particular in the other hemisphere i confess myself to be one of those who regard an even quiet graceful mode of utterance as even a greater charm in a woman than beauty its effect is more lasting and seems to be directly connected with the character mary warren not only pronounced like one accustomed to good society but the modulations of her voice which was singularly sweet by nature were even and agreeable as is usual with wellbred women and as far as possible from the jerking fluttering now rapid now drawling manner of opportunity perhaps in this age of loose attire loose habits and free and easy deportment the speech denotes the gentleman or the lady more accurately than any other offhand test  sen is enough to wear out anybodys patience exclaimed opportunity we must quit troy in half an hour and i have visits that i ought to pay to miss jones and miss white and miss black and miss green and miss brown and three or four others and i cant get him to come near me  why not go alone asked mary quietly it is but a step to two or three of the houses and you cannot possibly lose your way i will go with you if you desire it  oh lose my way no indeed i know it too well for that i wasnt educated in troy not to know something of the streets but it looks so to see a young lady walking in the streets without a beau i never wish to cross a room in company without a beau much less to cross a street no if sen dont come in soon i shall miss seeing every one of my friends and that will be a desperate disappointment to us all but it cant be helped walk without a beau i will not if i never see one of them again  will you accept of me miss opportunity asked mr warren it will afford me pleasure to be of service to you  lord mr warren you dont think of setting up for a beau at your time of life do you everybody would see that youre a clergyman and i might just as well go alone no if sen dont come in at once i must lose my visits and the young ladies will be so put out about it i know araminta maria wrote me in the most particular manner never to go through troy without stopping to see her if i didnt see another mortal and katherine clotilda has as much as said she would never forgive me if i passed her door but seneca cares no more for the friendships of young ladies than he doesmiss newcome pronounced this word doos notwithstanding her education as she did been ben and fifty others just as much out of the common waybut seneca cares no more for the friendships of young ladies than he does for the young patroon i declare mr warren i believe sen will go crazy unless the antirenters soon get the best of it he does nothing but think and talk of rents and aristocracy and poodle usages from morning till night  we all smiled at the little mistake of miss opportunity but it was of no great consequence and i dare say she knew what she meant as well as most others who use the same term though they spell it more accurately poodle usages are quite as applicable to anything now existing in america as feudal usages  your brother is then occupied with a matter of the last importance to the community of which he is a member answered the clergyman gravely on the termination of this antirent question hangs in my judgment a vast amount of the future character and much of the future destiny of yew york  i wonder now im surprised to hear you say this mr warren for generally youre thought to be unfriendly to the movement sen says however that everything looks well and that he believes the tenants will get their lands throughout the state before theyve done with it he tells me we shall have injins enough this summer at ravensnest the visit of old mrs littlepage has raised a spirit that will not easily be put down he says  and why should the visit of mrs littlepage to the house of her grandson and to the house built by her own husband and in which she passed the happiest days of her life raise a spirit as you call it in any one in that part of the country  oh youre episcopal mr warren and we all know how the episcopals feel about such matters but for my part i dont think the littlepages are a bit better than the newcomes though i wont liken them to some i could name at ravensnest but i dont think they are any better than you yourself and why should they ask so much more of the law than other folks  i am not aware that they do ask more of the law than others and if they do im sure they obtain less the law in this country is virtually administered by jurors who take good care to graduate justice so far as they can by a scale suited to their own opinions and quite often to their prejudices as the last are so universally opposed to persons in mrs littlepages class in life if there be a chance to make her suffer it is pretty certain it will be improved  sen says he cant see why he should pay rent to a littlepage any more than a littlepage should pay rent to him  i am sorry to hear it since there is a very sufficient reason for the former and no reason at all for the latter your brother uses the land of mr littlepage and that is a reason why he should pay him rent if the case were reversed then indeed mr littlepage should pay rent to your brother  but what reason is there that these littlepages should go on from father to son from generation to generation as our landlords when were just as good as they its time there was some change besides only think weve been at the mills now hard upon eighty years grandpa having first settled there and we have had them very mills now for three generations among us  high time therefore opportunity that there should be some change put in mary with a demure smile  oh youre so intimate with marthy littlepage im not surprised at anything you think or say but reason is reason for all that i havent the least grudge in the world against young hugh littlepage if foreign lands havent spoilt him as they say theyre desperate apt to do hes an agreeable young gentleman and i cant say that he used to think himself any better than other folks  i should say none of the family are justly liable to the charge of so doing returned mary  well im amazed to hear you say that mary warren to my taste marthy littlepage is as disagreeable as she can be if the antirent cause had nobody better than she is to oppose it it would soon triumph  may i ask miss newcome what particular reason you have for so thinking asked mr warren who had kept his eye on the young lady the whole time she had been thus running on with an interest that struck me as somewhat exaggerated when one remembered the character of the speaker and the value of her remarks  i think so mr warren because everybody says so was the answer if marthy littlepage dont think herself better than other folks why dont she act like other folks nothing is good enough for her in her own conceit  poor little patt who was the very beau idéal of nature and simplicity as nature and simplicity manifest themselves under the influence of refinement and goodbreeding was here accused of fancying herself better than this ambitious young lady for no other reason than the fact of the little distinctive peculiarities of her air and deportment which opportunity had found utterly unattainable after one or two efforts to compass them in this very fact is the secret of a thousand of the absurdities and vices that are going up and down the land at this moment like raging lions seeking whom they may devour men often turn to their statutebooks and constitution to find the sources of obvious evils that in truth have their origin in some of the lowest passions of human nature the entrance of seneca at that moment however gave a new turn to the discourse though it continued substantially the same i remarked that seneca entered with his hat on and that he kept his head covered during most of the interview that succeeded notwithstanding the presence of the two young ladies and the divine as for myself i had been so free as to remove my cap though many might suppose it was giving myself airs while others would have imagined it was manifesting a degree of respect to human beings that was altogether unworthy of freemen it is getting to be a thing so particular and aristocratic to take off the hat on entering a house that few of the humbler democrats of america now ever think of it  as a matter of course opportunity upbraided her delinquent brother for not appearing sooner to act as her beau after which she permitted him to say a word for himself that seneca was in high goodhumour was easily enough to be seen he even rubbed his hands together in the excess of his delight  something has happened to please sen cried the sister her own mouth on a broad grin in her expectation of coming in for a share of the gratification i wish you would get him to tell us what it is mary hell tell you anything  i cannot describe how harshly this remark grated on my nerves the thought that mary warren could consent to exercise even the most distant influence over such a man as seneca newcome was to the last degree unpleasant to me and i could have wished that she would openly and indignantly repel the notion but mary warren treated the whole matter very much as a person who was accustomed to such remarks would be apt to do i cannot say that she manifested either pleasure or displeasure but a cold indifference was if anything uppermost in her manner possibly i should have been content with this but i found it very difficult to be so seneca however did not wait for miss warren to exert her influence to induce him to talk but appeared well enough disposed to do it of his own accord  something has happened to please me i must own he answered and i would as lief mr warren should know what it is as not things go ahead finely among us antirenters and we shall carry all our pints before long  i wish i were certain no points would be carried but those that ought to be carried mr newcome was the answer but what has happened lately to give a new aspect to the affair  were gaining strength among the politicians both sides are beginning to court us and the spirit of the institutions will shortly make themselves respected  i am delighted to hear that it is in the intention of the institutions to repress covetousness and uncharitableness and all frauds and to do nothing but what is right observed mr warren  ah here comes my friend the travelling jeweller said seneca interrupting the clergyman in order to salute my uncle who at that instant showed himself in the door of the room cap in hand walk in mr dafidson since that is your name rev mr warrenmiss mary warrenmiss opportunity newcome my sister who will be glad to look at your wares the cars will be detained on some special business and we have plenty of time before us  all this was done with a coolness and indifference of manner which went to show that seneca had no scruples whatever on the subject of whom he introduced to any one as for my uncle accustomed to these free and easy manners and probably not absolutely conscious of the figure he cut in his disguise he bowed rather too much like a gentleman for one of his present calling though my previous explanation of our own connexion and fallen fortunes had luckily prepared the way for this deportment  come in mr dafidson and open your boxmy sister may fancy some of your trinkets i never knew a girl that didnt  the imaginary pedlar entered and placed his box on a table near which i was standing the whole party immediately gathering around it my presence had attracted no particular attention from either seneca or his sister the room being public and my connexion with the vender of trinkets known in the mean time seneca was too full of his good news to let the subject drop while the watches rings chains brooches bracelets c c were passed under examination  yes mr warren i trust we are about to have a complete development of the spirit of our institutions and that in futur there will be no privileged classes in new york at least  the last will certainly be a great gain sir the divine coldly answered hitherto those who have most suppressed the truth and who have most contributed to the circulation of flattering falsehoods have had undue advantages in america  seneca obviously enough did not like this sentiment but i thought by his manner that he was somewhat accustomed to meeting with such rebuffs from mr warren  i suppose you will admit there are privileged classes now among us mr warren  i am ready enough to allow that sir it is too plain to be denied  waall i should like to hear you pint em out that i might see if we agree in our sentiments  demagogues are a highly privileged class the editors of newspapers are another highly privileged class doing things daily and hourly which set all law and justice at defiance and invading with perfect impunity the most precious rights of their fellowcitizens the power of both is enormous and as in all cases of great and irresponsible power both enormously abuse it  waall thats not my way of thinking at all in my judgment the privileged classes in this country are your patroons and your landlords men thats not satisfied with a reasonable quantity of land but who wish to hold more than the rest of their fellowcreaturs  i am not aware of a single privilege that any patroonof whom by the way there no longer exists one except in nameor any landlord possesses over any one of his fellowcitizens  do you call it no privilege for a man to hold all the land there may happen to be in a township i call that a great privilege and such as no man should have in a free country other people want land as well as your van renssalaers and littlepages and other people mean to have it too  on that principle every man who owns more of any one thing than his neighbour is privileged even i poor as i am and am believed to be am privileged over you mr newcome i own a cassock and have two gowns one old and one new and various other things of the sort of which you have not one what is more i am privileged in another sense since i can wear my cassock and gown and bands and do wear them often whereas you cannot wear one of them all without making yourself laughed at  oh but them are not privileges i care anything about if i did i would put on the things as the law does not prohibit it  i beg your pardon mr newcome the law does prohibit you from wearing my cassock and gown contrary to my wishes  waall waall mr warren we never shall quarrel about that i dont desire to wear your cassack and gown  i understand you then it is only the things that you desire to use that you deem it a privilege for the law to leave me  i am afraid we shall never agree mr warren about this antirent business and im very sorry for it as i wish particularly to think as you do glancing his eye most profanely towards mary as he spoke i am for the movementprinciple while you are too much for the standstill doctrine  i am certainly for remaining stationary mr newcome if progress mean taking away the property of old and long established families in the country to give it to those whose names are not to be found in our history or indeed to give it to any but those to whom it rightfully belongs  we shall never agree my dear sir we shall never agree then turning towards my uncle with the air of superiority that the vulgar so easily assumewhat do you say to all this friend dafidsonare you uprent or downrent  ja mynheer was the quiet answer i always downs mit der rent vens i leave a house or a garten it is goot to pay de debts ja it ist herr goot  this answer caused the clergyman and his daughter to smile while opportunity laughed outright  you wont make much of your dutch friend sen cried this buoyant young lady he says you ought to keep on paying rent  i apprehend mr dafidson does not exactly understand the case answered seneca who was a good deal disconcerted but was bent on maintaining his point i have understood you to say that you are a man of liberal principles mr dafidson and that youve come to america to enjoy the light of intelligence and the benefits of a free government  ja ven i might coome to america i say vell dat tis a goot coontry vhere an honest man might haf vhat he arns ant keep it too ja ja dat ist vhat i say ant vhat i dinks  i understand you sir you come from a part of the world where the nobles eat up the fat of the land taking the poor mans share as well as his own to live in a country where the law is or soon will be so equal that no citizen will dare to talk about his estates and hurt the feelins of such as havent got any  my uncle so well affected an innocent perplexity at the drift of this remark as to make me smile in spite of an effort to conceal it mary warren saw that smile and another glance of intelligence was exchanged between us though the young lady immediately withdrew her look a little consciously and with a slight blush  i say that you like equal laws and equal privileges friend dafidson continued seneca with emphasis and that you have seen too much of the evils of nobility and of feudal oppression in the old world to wish to fall in with them in the new  der nobles ant der feudal privileges ist no goot answered the trinketpedlar shaking his head with an appearance of great distaste  ay i knew it would be so you see mr warren no man who has ever lived under a feudal system can ever feel otherwise  but what have we to do with feudal systems mr newcome and what is there in common between the landlords of new york and the nobles of europe and between their leases and feudal tenures  what is there a vast deal too much sir take my word for it do not our very governors even while ruthlessly calling on one citizen to murder another  nay nay mr newcome interrupted mary warren laughing the governors call on the citizens not to murder each other  i understand you miss mary but we shall make antirenters of you both before we are done surely sir there is a great deal too much resemblance between the nobles of europe and our landlords when the honest and freeborn tenants of the last are obliged to pay tribute for permission to live on the very land that they till and which they cause to bring forth its increase  but men who are not noble let their lands in europe nay the very serfs as they become free and obtain riches buy lands and let them in some parts of the old world as i have heard and read  all feudal sir the whole system is pernicious and feudal serf or no serf  but mr newcome said mary warren quietly though with a sort of demure irony in her manner that said she was not without humour and understood herself very well even you let your landland that you lease too and which you do not own except as you hire it from mr littlepage  seneca gave a hem and was evidently disconcerted but he had too much of the game of the true progressive movementwhich merely means to lead in changes though they may lead to the devilto give the matter up repeating the hem more to clear his brain than to clear his throat he hit upon his answer and brought it out with something very like triumph  that is one of the evils of the present system miss mary did i own the two or three fields you mean and to attend to which i have no leisure i might sell them but now it is impossible since i can give no deed the instant my poor uncle diesand he cant survive a week being as you must know nearly gonethe whole property mills tavern farms timberlot and all fall in to young hugh littlepage who is off frolicking in europe doing no good to himself or others ill venture to say if the truth were known that is another of the hardships of the feudal system it enables one man to travel in idleness wasting his substance in foreign lands while it keeps another at home at the ploughhandles and the carttail  and why do you suppose mr hugh littlepage wastes his substance and is doing himself and country no good in foreign lands mr newcome that is not at all the character i hear of him nor is it the result that i expect to see from his travels  the money he spends in europe might do a vast deal of good at ravensnest sir  for my part my dear sir put in mary again in her quiet but pungent way i think it remarkable that neither of our late governors has seen fit to enumerate the facts just mentioned by mr newcome among those that are opposed to the spirit of the institutions it is indeed a great hardship that mr seneca newcome cannot sell mr hugh littlepages land  i complain less of that cried seneca a little hastily than of the circumstance that all my rights in the property must go with the death of my uncle that at least even you miss mary must admit is a great hardship  if your uncle were unexpectedly to revive and live twenty years mr newcome  no no miss mary answered seneca shaking his head in a melancholy manner that is absolutely impossible it would not surprise me to find him dead and buried on our return  but admit that you may be mistaken and that your lease should continueyou would still have a rent to pay  of that i wouldnt complain in the least if mr dunning littlepages agent will just promise in as much as half a sentence that we can get a new lease on the old terms id not say a syllable about it  well here is one proof that the system has its advantages exclaimed mr warren cheerfully im delighted to hear you say this for it is something to have a class of men among us whose simple promises in a matter of money have so much value it is to be hoped that their example will not be lost  mr newcome has made an admission i am also glad to hear added mary as soon as her father had done speaking his willingness to accept a new lease on the old terms is a proof that he has been living under a good bargain for himself hitherto and that down to the present moment he has been the obliged party  this was very simply said but it bothered seneca amazingly as for myself i was delighted with it and could have kissed the pretty arch creature who had just uttered the remark though i will own that as much might have been done without any great reluctance had she even held her tongue as for seneca he did what most men are apt to do when they have the consciousness of not appearing particularly well in a given point of view he endeavoured to present himself to the eyes of his companions in another  there is one thing mr warren that i think you will admit ought not to be he cried exultingly whatever miss mary thinks about it and that is that the littlepage pew in your church ought to come down  i will not say that much mr newcome though i rather think my daughter will i believe my dear you are of mr newcomes way of thinking in respect to this canopied pew and also in respect to the old hatchments  i wish neither was in the church answered mary in a low voice  from that moment i was fully resolved neither should be as soon as i got into a situation to control the matter  in that i agree with you entirely my child resumed the clergyman and were it not for this movement connected with the rents and the false principles that have been so boldly announced of late years i might have taken on myself the authority as rector to remove the hatchments even according to the laws connected with the use of such things they should have been taken away a generation or two back as to the pew it is a different matter it is private property was constructed with the church which was built itself by the joint liberality of the littlepages and mother trinity and it would be a most ungracious act to undertake to destroy it under such circumstances and more especially in the absence of its owner  you agree however that it ought not to be there asked seneca with exultation  i wish with all my heart it were not i dislike every thing like worldly distinction in the house of god and heraldic emblems in particular seem to me very much out of place where the cross is seen to be in its proper place  waall now mr warren i cant say i much fancy crosses about churches either whats the use in raising vain distinctions of any sort a church is but a house after all and ought so to be regarded  true said mary firmly but the house of god  yes yes we all know miss mary that you episcopalians look more at outward things and more respect outward things than most of the other denominations of the country  do you call leases outward things mr newcome asked mary archly and contracts and bargains and promises and the rights of property and the obligation to do as you would be done by  law good folks cried opportunity who had been all this time tumbling over the trinkets i wish it was down with the rent for ever with all my heart and that not another word might ever be said on the subject here is one of the prettiest pencils mary i ever did see and its price is only four dollars i wish sen youd let the rent alone and make me a present of this very pencil  as this was an act of which seneca had not the least intention of being guilty he merely shifted his hat from one side of his head to the other began to whistle and then he coolly left the room my uncle ro profited by the occasion to beg miss opportunity would do him the honour to accept the pencil as an offering from himself  you ant surely in earnest exclaimed opportunity flushing up with surprise and pleasure why you told me the price was four dollars and even that seems to me desperate little  dat ist de price to anudder said the gallant trinketdealer but dat ist not de price to you miss opportunity ve shall trafel togedder ant vhen ve gets to your coontry you vill dell me de best houses vhere i might go mit my vatches ant drinkets  that i will and get you in at the nest house in the bargain cried opportunity pocketing the pencil without further parley  in the mean time my uncle selected a very neat seal the handsomest he had being of pure metal and having a real topaz in it and offered it to mary warren with his best bow i watched the clergymans daughter with anxiety as i witnessed the progress of this galantérie doubting and hoping at each change of the ingenuous and beautiful countenance of her to whom the offering was made mary coloured smiled seemed embarrassed and as i feared for a single moment doubting but i must have been mistaken as she drew back and in the sweetest manner possible declined to accept the present i saw that opportunitys having just adopted a different course added very much to her embarrassment as otherwise she might have said something to lessen the seeming ungraciousness of the refusal luckily for herself however she had a gentleman to deal with instead of one in the station that my uncle ro had voluntarily assumed when this offering was made the pretended pedlar was ignorant altogether of the true characters of the clergyman and his daughter not even knowing that he saw the rector of st andrews ravensnest but the manner of mary at once disabused him of an error into which he had fallen through her association with opportunity and he now drew back himself with perfect tact bowing and apologizing in a way that i thought must certainly betray his disguise it did not however for mr warren with a smile that denoted equally satisfaction at his daughters conduct and a grateful sense of the others intended liberality but with a simplicity that was of proof turned to me and begged a tune on the flute which i had drawn from my pocket and was holding in my hand as expecting some such invitation  if i have any accomplishment it is connected with music and particularly with the management of the flute on this occasion i was not at all backward about showing off and i executed two or three airs from the best masters with as much care as if i had been playing to a salon in one of the best quarters of paris i could see that mary and her father were both surprised at the execution and that the first was delighted we had a most agreeable quarter of an hour together and might have had two had not opportunitywho was certainly well named being apropos of everythingbegan of her own accord to sing though not without inviting mary to join her as the latter declined this public exhibition as well as my uncle ros offering senecas sister had it all to herself and she sang no less than three songs in quick succession and altogether unasked i shall not stop to characterize the music or the words of these songs any further than to say they were all more or less of the jim crow school and executed in a way that did them ample justice  as it was understood that we were all to travel in the same train the interview lasted until we were ready to proceed nor did it absolutely terminate then as mary and opportunity sat together mr warren asked me to share his seat regardless of the hurdygurdy though my attire in addition to its being perfectly new and neat was by no means of the mean character that it is usual to see adorning streetmusic in general on the whole so long as the instrument was not en evidence i might not have seemed very much out of place seated at mr warrens side in this manner we proceeded to saratoga my uncle keeping up a private discourse the whole way with seneca on matters connected with the rent movement  as for the divine and myself we had also much interesting talk together i was questioned about europe in general and germany in particular and had reason to think my answers gave surprise as well as satisfaction it was not an easy matter to preserve the doric of my assumed dialect though practice and fear contributed their share to render me content to resort to it i made many mistakes of course but my listeners were not the persons to discover them i say my listeners for i soon ascertained that mary warren who sat on the seat directly before us was a profoundly attentive listener to all that passed this circumstance did not render me the less communicative though it did increase the desire i felt to render what i said worthy of such a listener as for opportunity she read a newspaper a little while munched an apple a very little while and slept the rest of the way but the journey between modern troy and saratoga is not a long one and was soon accomplished     chapter vii                            i will tell you     if youll bestow a small of what you have little     patience a while youll hear the bellys answer      menenius agrippa   at the springs we parted mr warren and his friends finding a conveyance with their own horses in readiness to carry them the remainder of the distance as for my uncle and myself it was understood that we were to get on in the best manner we could it being expected that we should reach ravensnest in the course of a day or two according to the theory of our new business we ought to travel on foot but we had a reservation in petto that promised us also the relief of a comfortable wagon of some sort or other  well said my uncle the moment we had got far enough from our new acquaintances to be out of earshot i must say one thing in behalf of mr seneky as he calls himself or sen as his elegant sister calls him and that is that i believe him to be one of the biggest scoundrels the state holds  this is not drawing his character en beau i answered laughing but why do you come out so decidedly upon him at this particular moment  because this particular moment happens to be the first in which i have had an opportunity to say anything since i have known the rascal you must have remarked that the fellow held me in discourse from the time we left troy until we stopped here  certainly i could see that his tongue was in motion unceasingly what he said i have to conjecture  he said enough to lay bare his whole character our subject was antirent which he commenced with a view to explain it to a foreigner but i managed to lead him on step by step until he let me into all his notions and expectations on the subject why hugh the villain actually proposed that you and i should enlist and turn ourselves into two of the rascally mock redskins  enlist do they still persevere so far as to keep up that organization in the very teeth of the late law  the law what do two or three thousand voters care for any penal law in a country like this who is to enforce the law against them did they commit murder and were they even convicted as might happen under the excitement of such a crime they very well know nobody would be hanged honesty is always too passive in matters that do not immediately press on its direct interests it is for the interest of every honest man in the state to set his face against this antirent movement and to do all he can by his vote and influence to put it down into the dirt out of which it sprang and into which it should be crushed but not one in a hundred even of those who condemn it toto cælo will go a foot out of their way even to impede its progress all depends on those who have the power and they will exert that power so as to conciliate the active rogue rather than protect the honest man you are to remember that the laws are executed here on the principle that what is everybodys business is nobodys business  you surely do not believe that the authorities will wink at an open violation of the laws  that will depend on the characters of individuals most will but some will not you and i would be punished soon enough were there a chance but the mass would escape oh we have had some precious disclosures in our corner of the car the two or three men who joined newcome are from antirent districts and seeing me with their friend little reserve has been practised one of those men is an antirent lecturer and being somewhat didactic he favoured me with some of his arguments seriatim  how have they got to lectures i should have supposed the newspapers would have been the means of circulating their ideas  oh the newspapers like hogs swimming too freely have cut their own throats and it seems to be fashionable just at this moment not to believe them lecturing is the great moral lever of the nation at present  but a man can lie in a lecture as well as in a newspaper  out of all question and if many of the lecturers are of the school of this mr holmeslecturer holmes as seneca called himbut if many are of his school a pretty set of libertytakers with the truth must they be  you detected him then in some of these liberties  in a hundred nothing was easier than for a man in my situation to do that knowing as i did so much of the history of the landtitles of the state one of his arguments partakes so largely of the weak side of our system that i must give it to you he spoke of the gravity of the disturbancesof the importance to the peace and character of the state of putting an end to them and then by way of corollary to his proposition produced a scheme for changing the titles in order to satisfy the people  the people of course meaning the tenants the landlords and their rights passing for nothing  that is one beautiful feature of the moralityan eye or a cheek if you willbut here is the nose and highly roman it is a certain portion of the community wish to get rid of the obligations of their contracts and finding it cannot be done by law they resort to means that are opposed to all law in order to effect their purposes public lawbreakers violators of the public peace they make use of their own wrong as an argument for perpetuating another that can be perpetuated in no other way i have been looking over some of the papers containing proclamations c and find that both lawmakers and lawbreakers are of one mind as to this charming policy without a single manly effort to put down the atrocious wrong that is meditated the existence of the wrong itself is made an argument for meeting it with concessions and thus sustaining it instead of using the means the institutions have provided for putting down all such unjust and illegal combinations the combinations are a sufficient reason of themselves why the laws should be altered and wrong be done to a few in order that many may be propitiated and their votes secured  this is reasoning that can be used only where real grievances exist but there are no real grievances in the case of the tenants they may mystify weak heads in the instance of the manor leases with their quarter sales fat hens loads of wood and days works but my leases are all on three lives with rent payable in money and with none of the conditions that are called feudal though no more feudal than any other bargain to pay articles in kind one might just as well call a bargain made by a butcher to deliver pork for a series of years feudal however feudal or not my leases and those of most other landlords are running on lives and yet by what i can learn the discontent is general and the men who have solemnly bargained to give up their farms at the expiration of the lives are just as warm for the downrent and titles in fee as the manor tenants themselves they say that the obligations given for actual purchases are beginning to be discredited  you are quite right and there is one of the frauds practised on the world at large in the public documents only the manor leases with their pretended feudal covenants and their perpetuity are kept in view while the combination goes to all leases or nearly all and certainly to all sorts of leases where the estates are of sufficient extent to allow of the tenants to make head against the landlords i dare say there are hundreds of tenants even on the property of the renssalaers who are honest enough to be willing to comply with their contracts if the conspirators would let them but the rapacious spirit is abroad among the occupants of other lands as well as among the occupants of theirs and the government considers its existence a proof that concessions should be made the discontented must be appeased right or not  did seneca say anything on the subject of his own interests  he did not so much in conversation with me as in the discourse he held with lecturer holmes i listened attentively happening to be familiar through tradition and through personal knowledge with all the leading facts of the case as you will soon be called on to act in that matter for yourself i may as well relate them to you they will serve also as guides to the moral merits of the occupation of half the farms on your estate these are things moreover you would never know by public statements since all the good bargains are smothered in silence while those that may possibly have been a little unfavourable to the tenant are proclaimed far and near it is quite possible that among the many thousands of leased farms that are to be found in the state some bad bargains may have been made by the tenants but what sort of a government is that which should undertake to redress evils of this nature if either of the renssalaers or you yourself were to venture to send a memorial to the legislature setting forth the grievances you labour under in connection with this very milllotand serious losses do they bring to you let me tell you though grievances in the proper sense of the term they are notyou and your memorial would be met with a general and merited shout of ridicule and derision one man has no rights as opposed to a dozen  so much difference is there between de la rochefocauld et de la rochefoucauld  all the difference in the world but let me give you the facts for they will serve as a rule by which to judge of many others in the first place my greatgrandfather mordaunt the patentee as he was called first let the milllot to the grandfather of this seneca the tenant then being quite a young man in order to obtain settlers in that early day it was necessary to give them great advantages for there was vastly more land than there were people to work it the first lease therefore was granted on highly advantageous terms to that jason newcome whom i can just remember he had two characters the one and the true which set him down as a covetous envious narrowminded provincial who was full of cant and roguery some traditions exist among us of his having been detected in stealing timber and in various other frauds in public he is one of those virtuous and hardworking pioneers who have transmitted to their descendants all their claims those that are supposed to be moral as well as those that are known to be legal this flummery may do for elderly ladies who affect snuff and bohea and for some men who have minds of the same calibre but they are not circumstances to influence such legislators and executives as are fit to be legislators and executives not a great while before my fathers marriage the said jason still living and in possession the lease expired and a new one was granted for three lives or twentyone years certain of which one of the lives is still running that lease was granted on terms highly favourable to the tenant sixty years since old newcome luckily for himself and his posterity having named this longlived son as one of his three lives now seneky god bless him is known to lease a few of the lots that have fallen to his share of the property for more money than is required to meet all your rent on the whole such in effect has been the fact with that milllot for the last thirty years or even longer and the circumstance of the great length of time so excellent a bargain has existed is used as an argument why the newcomes ought to have a deed of the property for a nominal price or indeed for no price at all if the tenants could have their wishes  i am afraid there is nothing unnatural in thus perverting principles half mankind appear to me really to get a great many of their notions dessus dessous  half is a small proportion as you will find my boy when you grow older but was it not an impudent proposal of seneca when he wished you and me to join the corps of injins  what answer did you make though i suppose it would hardly do for us to go disguised and armed now that the law makes it a felony even while our motive at the bottom might be to aid the law  catch me at that act of folly why hugh could they prove such a crime on either of us or any one connected with an old landed family we should be the certain victims no governor would dare pardon us no no clemency is a word reserved for the obvious and confirmed rogues  we might get a little favour on the score of belonging to a very powerful body of offenders  true i forgot that circumstance the more numerous the crimes and the criminals the greater the probability of impunity and this too not on the general principle that power cannot be resisted but on the particular principle that a thousand or two votes are of vast importance where three thousand can turn an election god only knows where this thing is to end  we now approached one of the humbler taverns of the place where it was necessary for those of our apparent pretensions to seek lodgings and the discourse was dropped it was several weeks too early in the season for the springs to be frequented and we found only a few of those in the place who drank the waters because they really required them my uncle had been an old stager at saratogaa beau of the purest water as he laughingly described himselfand he was enabled to explain all that it was necessary for me to know an american wateringplace however is so very much inferior to most of those in europe as to furnish very little in their best moments beyond the human beings they contain to attract the attention of the traveller  in the course of the afternoon we availed ourselves of the opportunity of a return vehicle to go as far as sandy hill where we passed the night the next morning bright and early we got into a hired wagon and drove across the country until near night when we paid for our passage sent the vehicle back and sought a tavern at this house where we passed the night we heard a good deal of the injins having made their appearance on the littlepage lands and many conjectures as to the probable result we were in a township or rather on a property that was called mooseridge and which had once belonged to us but which having been sold and in a great measure paid for by the occupants no one thought of impairing the force of the covenants under which the parties held the most trivial observer will soon discover that it is only when something is to be gained that the aggrieved citizen wishes to disturb a covenant now i never heard any one say a syllable against either of the covenants of his lease under which he held his farm let him be ever so loud against those which would shortly compel him to give it up had i complained of the factand such facts aboundedthat my predecessors had incautiously let farms at such low prices that the lessees had been enabled to pay the rents for half a century by subletting small portions of them as my uncle ro had intimated i should be pointed at as a fool stick to your bond would have been the cry and shylock would have been forgotten i do not say that there is not a vast difference between the means of acquiring intelligence the cultivation the manners the social conditions and in some senses the social obligations of an affluent landlord and a really hardworking honest wellintentioned husbandman his tenantdifferences that should dispose the liberal and cultivated gentleman to bear in mind the advantages he has perhaps inherited and not acquired by his own means in such a way as to render him in a certain degree the repository of the interests of those who hold under him but while i admit all this and say that the community which does not possess such a class of men is to be pitied as it loses one of the most certain means of liberalizing and enlarging its notions and of improving its civilization i am far from thinking that the men of this class are to have their real superiority of position with its consequences thrown into their faces only when they are expected to give while they are grudgingly denied it on all other occasions there is nothing so likely to advance the habits opinions and true interests of a rural population as to have them all directed by the intelligence and combined interests that ought to mark the connection between landlord and tenant it may do for one class of political economists to prate about a state of things which supposes every husbandman a freeholder and rich enough to maintain his level among the other freeholders of the state but we all know that as many minute gradations in means must and do exist in a community as there exists gradations in characters a majority soon will in the nature of things be below the level of the freeholder and by destroying the system of having landlords and tenants two great evils are createdthe one preventing men of large fortunes from investing in lands as no man will place his money where it will be insecure or profitless thereby cutting off real estate generally from the benefits that might be and would be conferred by their capital as well as cutting it off from the benefits of the increased price which arise from having such buyers in the market and the other is to prevent any man from being a husbandman who has not the money necessary to purchase a farm but they who want farms now and they who will want votes next november do not look quite so far ahead as that while shouting equal rights they are in fact for preventing the poor husbandman from being anything but a daylabourer  we obtained tolerably decent lodgings at our inn though the profoundest patriot america possesses if he know anything of other countries or of the best materials of his own cannot say much in favour of the sleeping arrangements of an ordinary country inn the same money and the same trouble would render that which is now the very beau idéal of discomfort at least tolerable and in many instances good but who is to produce this reform according to the opinions circulated among us the humblest hamlet we have has already attained the highest point of civilization and as for the people without distinction of classes it is universally admitted that they are the best educated the acutest and the most intelligent in christendomno i must correct myself they are all this except when they are in the act of leasing lands and then the innocent and illiterate husbandmen are the victims of the arts of designing landlords the wretches1  we passed an hour on the piazza after eating our supper and there being a collection of men assembled there inhabitants of the hamlet we had an opportunity to get into communication with them my uncle sold a watch and i played on the hurdygurdy by way of making myself popular after this beginning the discourse turned on the engrossing subject of the day antirentism the principal speaker was a young man of about sixandtwenty of a sort of shabby genteel air and appearance whom i soon discovered to be the attorney of the neighbourhood his name was hubbard while that of the other principal speaker was hall the last was a mechanic as i ascertained and was a plainlooking workingman of middle age each of these persons seated himself on a common kitchen chair leaning back against the side of the house and of course resting on the two hind legs of the rickety support while he placed his own feet on the rounds in front the attitudes were neither graceful nor picturesque but they were so entirely common as to excite no surprise as for hall he appeared perfectly contented with his situation after fidgeting a little to get the two supporting legs of his chair just where he wanted them but hubbards eye was restless uneasy and even menacing for more than a minute he drew a knife from his pocketa small neat penknife only it is truegazed a little wildly about him and just as i thought he intended to abandon his nicely poised chair and to make an assault on one of the pillars that upheld the roof of the piazza the innkeeper advanced holding in his hand several narrow slips of pine board one of which he offered at once to squire hubbard this relieved the attorney who took the wood and was soon deeply plunged in to me the unknown delights of whittling i cannot explain the mysterious pleasure that so many find in whittling though the prevalence of the custom is so well known but i cannot explain the pleasure so many find in chewing tobacco or in smoking the precaution of the landlord was far from being unnecessary and appeared to be taken in good part by all to whom he offered whittlingpieces some six or eight in the whole the state of the piazza indeed proved that the precaution was absolutely indispensable if he did not wish to see the house come tumbling down about his head in order that those who have never seen such thing may understand their use i will go a little out of the way to explain  the inn was of wood a hemlock frame with a siding of clapboards in this there was nothing remarkable many countries of europe even still building principally of wood houses of lath and plaster were quite common until within a few years even in large towns i remember to have seen some of these constructions while in london in close connection with the justly celebrated westminster hall and of such materials is the muchtalkedof miniature castle of horace walpole at strawberry hill but the inn of mooseridge had some pretensions to architecture besides being three or four times larger than any other house in the place a piazza it enjoyed of course it must be a pitiful village inn that does not and building accessaries and all rejoiced in several coats of a spurious white lead the columns of this piazza as well as the clapboards of the house itself however exhibited the proofs of the danger of abandoning your true whittler to his own instincts spreadeagles five points american flags huzzahs for polk the initials of names and names at full length with various other similar conceits records and ebullitions of patriotic or partyotic feelings were scattered up and down with an affluence the said volumes in favour of the mint in which they had been coined but the most remarkable memorial of the industry of the guests was to be found on one of the columns and it was one at a corner too and consequently of double importance to the superstructureunless indeed the house were built on that wellknown principle of american architecture of the last century which made the architrave uphold the pillar instead of the pillar the architrave the column in question was of white pine as usualthough latterly in brick edifices bricks and stucco are much resorted toand at a convenient height for the whittlers it was literally cut twothirds in two the gash was very neatly madethat much must be said for itindicating skill and attention and the surfaces of the wound were smoothed in a manner to prove that appearances were not neglected  vat do das i asked of the landlord pointing to this gaping wound in the main column of his piazza  that oh thats only the whittlers answered the host with a goodnatural smile  assuredly the americans are the bestnatured people on earth here was a man whose house was nearly tumbling down about his earsalways bating the principle in architecture just namedand he could smile as nero may be supposed to have done when fiddling over the conflagration of rome  but vhy might de vhittler vhittle down your house  oh this is a free country you know and folks do pretty much as they like in it returned the still smiling host i let em cut away as long as i dared but it was high time to get out whittlingpieces i believe you must own its best always to keep a ruff roof over a mans head to be ready for bad weather a week longer would have had the column in two  vell i dinks i might not bear dat vhat ist mein house ist mein house ant dey shall not so moch vittles  by letting em so much vittles there they so much vittles in the kitchen so you see there is policy in having your underpinnin knocked away sometimes if its done by the right sort of folks  youre a stranger in these parts friend observed hubbard complacently for by this time his whittlingpiece was reduced to a shape and he could go on reducing it according to some law of the art of whittling with which i am not acquainted we are not so particular in such matters as in some of your countries in the old world  jadas i can see but does not woot ant column cost money in america someding  to be sure it does there is not a man in the country who would undertake to replace that pillar with a new one paint and all for less than ten dollars  this was an opening for a discussion on the probable cost of putting a new pillar into the place of the one that was injured opinions differed and quite a dozen spoke on the subject some placing the expense as high as fifteen dollars and others bringing it down as low as five i was struck with the quiet and selfpossession with which each man delivered his opinion as well as with the language used the accent was uniformly provincial that of hubbard included having a strong and unpleasant taint of the dialect of new england in it and some of the expressions savoured a little of the stilts of the newspapers but on the whole the language was sufficiently accurate and surprisingly good considering the class in life of the speakers the conjectures too manifested great shrewdness and familiarity with practical things as well as in a few instances some reading hall however actually surprised me he spoke with a precision and knowledge of mechanics that would have done credit to a scholar and with a simplicity that added to the influence of what he said some casual remark induced me to put invell i might spose an injin voult cut so das column but i might not spose a vhite man could this opinion gave the discourse a direction towards antirentism and in a few minutes it caught all the attention of my uncle ro and myself  this business is going ahead after all observed hubbard evasively after others had had their say  mores the pity put in hall it might have been put an end to in a month at any time and ought to be put an end to in a civilized land  you will own neighbour hall notwithstanding it would be a great improvement in the condition of the tenants all over the state could they change their tenures into freeholds  no doubt t would and so it would be a great improvement in the condition of any journeyman in my shop if he could get to be the boss but that is not the question here the question is what right has the state to say any man shall sell his property unless he wishes to sell it a pretty sort of liberty we should have if we all held our houses and gardens under such laws as that supposes  but do we not all hold our houses and gardens and farms too by some such law rejoined the attorney who evidently respected his antagonist and advanced his own opinions cautiously if the public wants land to use it can take it by paying for it  yes to use but use is everything ive read that old report of the committee of the house and dont subscribe to its doctrines at all public policy in that sense doesnt at all mean public use if land is wanted for a road or a fort or a canal it must be taken under a law by appraisement or the thing could not be had at all but to pretend because one side to a contract wishes to alter it that the state has a right to interfere on the ground that the discontented can be bought off in this way easier and cheaper than they can be made to obey the laws is but a poor way of supporting the right the same principle carried out might prove it would be easier to buy off pickpockets by compromising than to punish them or it would be easy to get round all sorts of contracts in this way  but all governments use this power when it becomes necessary neighbour hall  that word necessary covers a great deal of ground squire hubbard the most that can be made of the necessity here is to say it is cheaper and may help along parties to their objects better no man doubts that the state of new york can put down these antirenters and i trust will put them down so far as force is concerned there is then no other necessity in the case to begin with than the necessity which demagogues always feel of getting as many votes as they can  after all neighbour hall these votes are pretty powerful weapons in a popular government  ill not deny that and now they talk of a convention to alter the constitution it is a favourable moment to teach such managers they shall not abuse the right of suffrage in this way  how is it to be prevented you are an universal suffrage man i know  yes im for universal suffrage among honest folks but do not wish to have my rulers chosen by them that are never satisfied without having their hands in their neighbours pockets let em put a clause into the constitution providing that no town or village or county shall hold a poll within a given time after the execution of process has been openly resisted in it that would take the conceit out of all such lawbreakers in very short order  it was plain that this idea struck the listeners and several even avowed their approbation of the scheme aloud hubbard received it as a new thought but was more reluctant to admit its practicability as might be expected from a lawyer accustomed to practise in a small way his objections savoured more of narrow views than of the notions of a statesman  how would you determine the extent of the district to be disfranchised he asked  take the legal limits as they stand if process be resisted openly by a combination strong enough to look down the agents of the law in a town disfranchise that town for a given period if in more than one town disfranchise the offending towns if a county disfranchise the whole county  but in that way you would punish the innocent with the guilty  it would be for the good of all besides you punish the innocent for the guilty or with the guilty rather in a thousand ways you and i are taxed to keep drunkards from starving because it is better to do that than to offend humanity by seeing men die of hunger or tempting them to steal when you declare martial law you punish the innocent with the guilty in one sense and so you do in a hundred cases all we have to ask is if it be not wiser and better to disarm demagogues and those disturbers of the public peace who wish to pervert their right of suffrage to so wicked an end by so simple a process than to suffer them to effect their purposes by the most flagrant abuse of their political privileges  how would you determine when a town should lose the right of voting  by evidence given in open court the judges would be the proper authority to decide in such a case and they would decide beyond all question nineteen times in twenty right it is the interest of every man who is desirous of exercising the suffrage on right principles to give him some such protection against them that wish to exercise the suffrage on wrong a peaceofficer can call on the posse comitatus or on the people to aid him if enough appear to put down the rebels well and good but if enough do not appear let it be taken as proof that the district is not worthy of giving the votes of freemen they who abuse such a liberty as man enjoys in this country are the least entitled to our sympathies as for the mode that could easily be determined as soon as you settled the principle  the discourse went on for an hour neighbour hall giving his opinions still more at large i listened equally with pleasure and surprise these then after all i said to myself are the real bone and sinew of the country there are tens of thousands of this sort of men in the state and why should they be domineered over and made to submit to a legislation and to practices that are so often without principle by the agents of the worst part of the community will the honest for ever be so passive while the corrupt and dishonest continue so active on my mentioning these notions to my uncle he answered  yes it ever has been so and i fear ever will be so there is the curse of this country pointing to a table covered with newspapers the invariable companion of an american inn of any size so long as men believe what they find there they can be nothing but dupes or knaves  but there is good in newspapers  that adds to the curse if they were nothing but lies the world would soon reject them but how few are able to separate the true from the false now how few of these papers speak the truth about this very antirentism occasionally an honest man in the corps does come out but where one does this ten affect to think what they do not believe in order to secure votesvotes votes votes in that simple word lies all the mystery of the matter  jefferson said if he were to choose between a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government he would take the last  ay jefferson did not mean newspapers as they are now i am old enough to see the change that has taken place in his day three or four fairly convicted lies would damn any editor now there are men that stand up under a thousand ill tell you what hugh this country is jogging on under two of the most antagonist systems possiblechristianity and the newspapers the first is daily hammering into every man that he is a miserable frail goodfornothing being while the last is eternally proclaiming the perfection of the people and the virtues of selfgovernment  perhaps too much stress ought not to be laid on either  the first is certainly true under limitations that we all understand but as to the last i will own i want more evidence than a newspaper eulogy to believe it  after all my uncle ro is sometimes mistaken though candour compels me to acknowledge that he is very often right     chapter viii              i see thee still     remembrance faithful to her trust     calls thee in beauty from the dust     thou comest in the morning light     thou rt with me through the gloomy night     in dreams i meet thee as of old     then thy soft arms my neck enfold     and thy sweet voice is in my ear     in every sense to memory dear             i see thee still      sprague   it was just ten in the morning of the succeeding day when my uncle ro and myself came in sight of the old house at the nest i call it old for a dwelling that has stood more than half a century acquires a touch of the venerable in a country like america to me it was truly old the building having stood there where i then saw it for a period more than twice as long as that of my own existence and was associated with all my early ideas from childhood i had regarded that place as my future home as it had been the home of my parents and grandparents and in one sense of those who had gone before them for two generations more the whole of the land in sightthe rich bottoms then waving with grassthe sidehills the woods the distant mountainsthe orchards dwellings barns and all the other accessaries of rural life that appertained to the soil were mine and had thus become without a single act of injustice to any human being so far as i knew and believed even the red man had been fairly bought off by herman mordaunt the patentee and so susquesus the redskin of ravensnest as our old onondago was often called had ever admitted the fact to be it was natural that i should love an estate thus inherited and thus situated no civilized man no man indeed savage or not had ever been the owner of those broad acres but those who were of my own blood this is what few besides americans can say and when it can be said truly in parts of the country where the arts of life have spread and amid the blessings of civilization it becomes the foundation of a sentiment so profound that i do not wonder those adventurerserrant who are flying about the face of the country thrusting their hands into every mans mess have not been able to find it among their other superficial discoveries nothing can be less like the ordinary cravings of avarice than the feeling that is thus engendered and i am certain that the general tendency of such an influence is to elevate the feelings of him who experiences it  and there were men among us high in political stationhigh as such men ever can get for the consequence of having such men in power is to draw down station itself nearer to their own natural levelbut men in power had actually laid down propositions in political economy which if carried out would cause me to sell all that estate reserving perhaps a single farm for my own use and reinvest the money in such a way as that the interest i obtained might equal my present income it is true this theory was not directly applied to me as my farms were to fall in by the covenants of their leases but it had been directly applied to stephen and william van rensselaer and by implication to others and my turn might come next what business had the rensselaers or the livingstons or the hunters or the littlepages or the verplancks or the morgans or the wadsworths or five hundred others similarly placed to entertain sentiments that interfered with business or that interfered with the wishes of any straggling yankee who had found his way out of new england and wanted a particular farm on his own terms it is aristocratic to put sentiment in opposition to trade and trade itself is not to be trade any longer than all the profit is to be found on the side of numbers even the principles of holy trade are to be governed by majorities  even my uncle ro who never owned a foot of the property could not look at it without emotion he too had been born therehad passed his childhood thereand loved the spot without a particle of the grovelling feeling of avarice he took pleasure in remembering that our race had been the only owners of the soil on which he stood and had that very justifiable pride which belongs to enduring respectability and social station  well hugh he cried after both of us had stood gazing at the grey walls of the good and substantial but certainly not very beautiful dwelling here we are and we now may determine on what is next to be done shall we march down to the village which is four miles distant you will remember and get our breakfasts thereshall we try one of your tenantsor shall we plunge at once in medias res and ask hospitality of my mother and your sister  the last might excite suspicion i fear sir tar and feathers would be our mildest fate did we fall into the hands of the injins  injins why not go at once to the wigwam of susquesus and get out of him and yop the history of the state of things i heard them speaking of the onondago at our tavern last night and while they said he was generally thought to be much more than a hundred that he was still like a man of eighty that indian is full of observation and may let us into some of the secrets of his brethren  they can at least give us the news from the family and though it might seem in the course of things for pedlars to visit the nest house it will be just as much so for them to halt at the wigwam  this consideration decided the matter and away we went towards the ravine or glen on the side of which stood the primitivelooking hut that went by the name of the wigwam the house was a small cabin of logs neat and warm or cool as the season demanded as it was kept up and was whitewashed and occasionally furnished anew by the landlordthe odious creature he who paid for so many similar things in the neighbourhoodit was never unfit to be seen though never of a very alluring cottagelike character there was a garden and it had been properly made that very season the negro picking and pecking about it during the summer in a way to coax the vegetables and fruits on a little though i well knew that the regular weedings came from an assistant at the nest who was ordered to give it an eye and an occasional halfday on one side of the hut there was a hogpen and a small stable for a cow but on the other the trees of the virgin forest which had never been disturbed in that glen overshadowed the roof this somewhat poetical arrangement was actually the consequence of a compromise between the tenants of the cabin the negro insisting on the accessories of his rude civilization while the indian required the shades of the woods to reconcile him to his position here had these two singularly associated beingsthe one deriving his descent from the debased races of africa and the other from the fierce but loftyminded aboriginal inhabitant of this continentdwelt nearly for the whole period of an ordinary human life the cabin itself began to look really ancient while those who dwelt in it had little altered within the memory of man such instances of longevity whatever theorists may say on the subject are not unfrequent among either the blacks or the natives though probably less so among the last than among the first and still less so among the first of the northern than of the southern sections of the republic it is common to say that the great age so often attributed to the people of these two races is owing to ignorance of the periods of their births and that they do not live longer than the whites this may be true in the main for a white man is known to have died at no great distance from ravensnest within the last fiveandtwenty years who numbered more than his six score of years but aged negroes and aged indians are nevertheless so common when the smallness of their whole numbers is remembered as to render the fact apparent to most of those who have seen much of their respective people  there was no highway in the vicinity of the wigwam for so the cabin was generally called though wigwam in the strict meaning of the word it was not as the little building stood in the grounds of the nest house which contain two hundred acres a bit of virgin forest included and exclusively of the fields that belonged to the adjacent farm it was approached only by footpaths of which several led to and from it and by one narrow winding carriageroad which in passing for miles through the grounds had been led near the hut in order to enable my grandmother and sister and i dare say my dear departed mother while she lived to make their calls in their frequent airings by this sweeping road we approached the cabin  there are the two old fellows sunning themselves this fine day exclaimed my uncle with something like tremor in his voice as we drew near enough to the hut to distinguish objects hugh i never see these men without a feeling of awe as well as of affection they were the friends and one was the slave of my grandfather and as long as i can remember have they been aged men they seem to be set up here as monuments of the past to connect the generations that are gone with those that are to come  if so sir they will soon be all there is of their sort it really seems to me that if things continue much longer in their present direction men will begin to grow jealous and envious of history itself because its actors have left descendants to participate in any little credit they may have gained  beyond all contradiction boy there is a strange perversion of the old and natural sentiments on this head among us but you must bear in mind the fact that of the two millions and a half the state contains not half a million probably possess any of the true york blood and can consequently feel any of the sentiments connected with the birthplace and the older traditions of the very society in which they live a great deal must be attributed to the facts of our condition though i admit those facts need not and ought not to unsettle principles but look at those two old fellows there they are true to the feelings and habits of their races even after passing so long a time together in this hut there squats susquesus on a stone idle and disdaining work with his rifle leaning against the appletree while jaafor yop as i believe it is better to call himis pecking about in the garden still a slave at his work in fancy at least  and which is the happiest sirthe industrious old man or the idler  probably each finds most happiness in indulging his own early habits the onondago never would work however and i have heard my father say great was his happiness when he found he was to pass the remainder of his days in otium cum dignitate and without the necessity of making baskets  yop is looking at us had we not better go up at once and speak to them  yop may stare the most openly but my life on it the indian sees twice as much his faculties are the best to begin with and he is a man of extraordinary and characteristic observation in his best days nothing ever escaped him as you say we will approach  my uncle and myself then consulted on the expediency of using broken english with these two old men of which at first we saw no necessity but when we remembered that others might join us and that our communications with the two might be frequent for the next few days we changed our minds and determined rigidly to observe our incognitos  as we came up to the door of the hut jaaf slowly left his little garden and joined the indian who remained immoveable and unmoved on the stone which served him for a seat we could see but little change in either during the five years of our absence each being a perfect picture in his way of extreme but not decrepit old age in the men of his race of the two the blackif black he could now be called his colour being a muddy greywas the most altered though that seemed scarcely possible when i saw him last as for the trackless or susquesus as he was commonly called his temperance throughout a long life did him good service and his halfnaked limbs and skeletonlike body for he wore the summer dress of his people appeared to be made of a leather long steeped in a tannin of the purest quality his sinews too though much stiffened seemed yet to be of whipcord and his whole frame a species of indurated mummy that retained its vitality the colour of the skin was less red than formerly and more closely approached to that of the negro as the latter now was though perceptibly different  sagosago cried my uncle as we came quite near seeing no risk in using that familiar semiindian salutation2 sago sago dis charmin mornin in my tongue dat might be guten tag  sago returned the trackless in his deep guttural voice while old yop brought two lips together that resembled thick pieces of overdone beefsteak fastened his redencircled gummy eyes on each of us in turn pouted once more working his jaws as if proud of the excellent teeth they still held and said nothing as the slave of a littlepage he held pedlars as inferior beings for the ancient negroes of new york ever identified themselves more or less with the families to which they belonged and in which they so often were born sago repeated the indian slowly courteously and with emphasis after he had looked a moment longer at my uncle as if he saw something about him to command respect  dis ist charmin day frients said uncle ro placing himself coolly on a log of wood that had been hauled for the stove and wiping his brow vat might you calls dis coontry  dis here answered yop not without a little contempt dis is york colony where you come from to ask sich a question  charmany dat ist far off but a goot coontry ant dis ist goot coontry too  why you leab him den if he be good country eh  vhy you leaf africa canst you dell me dat retorted uncle ro somewhat coolly  nebber was dere growled old yop bringing his blubber lips together somewhat in the manner the boar works his jaws when it is prudent to get out of his way im yorknigger born and nebber seen no africa and nebber want to see him nudder  it is scarcely necessary to say that jaaf belonged to a school by which the term of coloured gentleman was never used the men of his time and stamp called themselves niggers and ladies and gentlemen of that age took them at their word and called them niggers too a term that no one of the race ever uses now except in the way of reproach and which by one of the singular workings of our very wayward and common nature he is more apt to use than any other when reproach is intended  my uncle paused a moment to reflect before he continued a discourse that had not appeared to commence under very flattering auspices  who might lif in dat big stone house asked uncle ro as soon as he thought the negro had had time to cool a little  anybody can see you no yorker by dat werry speech answered yop not at all mollified by such a question who should lib dere but ginral littlepage  vell i dought he wast dead long ago  what if he be its his house and he lib in it and ole young missus lib dere too  now there had been three generations of generals among the littlepages counting from father to son first there had been brigadier general evans littlepage who held that rank in the militia and died in service during the revolution the next was brigadier general cornelius littlepage who got his rank by brevet at the close of the same war in which he had actually figured as a colonel of the new york line third and last was my own grandfather major general mordaunt littlepage he had been a captain in his fathers regiment at the close of the same struggle got the brevet of major at its termination and rose to be a major general of the militia the station he held for many years before he died as soon as the privates had the power to elect their own officers the position of a major general in the militia ceased to be respectable and few gentlemen could be induced to serve as might have been foreseen the militia itself fell into general contempt where it now is and where it will ever remain until a different class of officers shall be chosen the people can do a great deal no doubt but they cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear as soon as officers from the old classes shall be appointed the militia will come up for in no interest in life is it so material to have men of certain habits and notions and education in authority as in those connected with the military service a great many fine speeches may be made and much patriotic eulogy expended on the intrinsic virtue and intelligence of the people and divers projects entertained to make citizensoldiers as they are called but citizens never can be and never will be turned into soldiers at all good or bad until proper officers are placed over them to return to yop  bray vhat might be der age of das laty dat you callet olt young missus asked my uncle  gosh she nutten but galborn sometime just ater ole

redskins might be blenty  the manner in which the onondago raised his figure and the look he fastened on my uncle were both fine and startling as yet he had said nothing beyond the salutation but i could see he now intended to speak  new tribe he said after regarding us for half a minute intently what you call himwhere he come from  ja jadas ist der antirent redskins haf you seen em trackless  sartain come to see meface in bagbehave like squaw poor injinpoor warrior  yees i believes dat ist true enough i cant bear soch injinmight not be soch injin in world vhat you call em eh  susquesus shook his head slowly and with dignity then he gazed intently at my uncle after which he fastened his eyes in a similar manner on me in this manner his looks turned from one to the other for some little time when he again dropped them to the earth calmly and in silence i took out the hurdygurdy and began to play a lively airone that was very popular among the american blacks and which i am sorry to say is getting to be not less so among the whites no visible effect was produced on susquesus unless a slight shade of contempt was visible on his dark features with jaaf however it was very different old as he was i could see a certain nervous twitching of the lower limbs which indicated that the old fellow actually felt some disposition to dance it soon passed away though his grim hard wrinkled dusky grey countenance continued to gleam with a sort of dull pleasure for some time there was nothing surprising in this the indifference of the indian to melody being almost as marked as the negros sensitiveness to its power  it was not to be expected that men so aged would be disposed to talk much the onondago had ever been a silent man dignity and gravity of character uniting with prudence to render him so but jaaf was constitutionally garrulous though length of days had necessarily much diminished the propensity at that moment a fit of thoughtful and melancholy silence came over my uncle too and all four of us continued brooding on our own reflections for two or three minutes after i had ceased to play presently the even smooth approach of carriagewheels was heard and a light summer vehicle that was an old acquaintance came whirling round the stable and drew up within ten feet of the spot where we were all seated  my heart was in my mouth at this unexpected interruption and i could perceive that my uncle was scarcely less affected amid the flowing and pretty drapery of summer shawls and the other ornaments of the female toilet were four youthful and sunny faces and one venerable with years in a word my grandmother my sister and my uncles two other wards and mary warren were in the carriage yes the pretty gentle timid yet spirited and intelligent daughter of the rector was of the party and seemingly quite at home and at her ease as one among friends she was the first to speak even though it was in a low quiet voice addressed to my sister and in words that appeared extorted by surprise  there are the very two pedlars of whom i told you martha she said and now you may hear the flute well played  i doubt if he can play better than hugh was my dear sisters answer but well have some of his music if it be only to remind us of him who is so far away  the music we can and will have my child cried my grandmother cheerfully though that is not wanted to remind us of our absent boy good morrow susquesus i hope this fine day agrees with you  sago returned the indian making a dignified and even graceful forward gesture with one arm though he did not rise weadder goodgreat spirit good dat reason how squaws do  we are all well i thank you trackless good morrow jaaf how do you do this fine morning  yop or jaap or jaaf rose tottering made a low obeisance and then answered in the semirespectful semifamiliar manner of an old confidential family servant as the last existed among our fathers  tank ee miss dus wid all my heart he answered pretty well today but ole sus he fail and grow oler and oler despate fast  now of the two the indian was much the finest relic of human powers though he was less uneasy and more stationary than the black but the propensity to see the mote in the eye of his friend while he forgot the beam in his own was a longestablished and wellknown weakness of jaaf and its present exhibition caused everybody to smile i was delighted with the beaming laughing eyes of mary warren in particular though she said nothing  i cannot say i agree with you jaaf returned my smiling grandmother the trackless bears his years surprisingly and i think i have not seen him look better this many a day than he is looking this morning we are none of us as young as we were when we first became acquainted jaafwhich is now near if not quite threescore years ago  you nuttin but gal nudder growled the negro ole sus be raal ole fellow but miss dus and masser mordaunt dey get married only tudder day why dat was ater de revylooshen  it was indeed replied the venerable woman with a touch of melancholy in her tones but the revolution took place many many a long year since  well now i be surprise miss dus how you call dat so long when he only be tudder day retorted the pertinacious negro who began to grow crusty and to speak in a short spiteful way as if displeased by hearing that to which he could not assent masser corny was little ole praps if he lib but all de rest ob you nuttin but children tell me one ting miss dus be it true deys got a town at satanstoe  an attempt was made a few years since to turn the whole country into towns and among other places the neck but i believe it will never be anything more than a capital farm  so besser dat good land i tell you one acre down dere wort more dan twenty acre up here  my grandson would not be pleased to hear you say that jaaf  who your grandson miss dus remember you hab little baby tudder day but baby cant hab baby  ah jaaf my old friend my babies have long since been men and women and are drawing on to old age one and he was my first born is gone before us to a better world and his boy is now your young master this young lady that is seated opposite to me is the sister of that young master and she would be grieved to think you have forgotten her  jaaf laboured under the difficulty so common to old age he was forgetful of things of more recent date while he remembered those which had occurred a century ago the memory is a tablet that partakes of the peculiarity of all our opinions and habits in youth it is easily impressed and the images then engraved on it are distinct deep and lasting while those that succeed become crowded and take less root from the circumstance of finding the ground already occupied in the present instance the age was so great that the change was really startling the old negros recollections occasionally coming on the mind like a voice from the grave as for the indian as i afterwards ascertained he was better preserved in all respects than the black his great temperance in youth freedom from labour exercise in the open air united to the comforts and abundance of semicivilized habits that had now lasted for near a century contributing to preserve both mind and body as i now looked at him i remembered what i had heard in boyhood of his history  there had ever been a mystery about the life of the onondago if any one of our set had ever been acquainted with the facts it was andries coejemans a halfuncle of my dear grandmother a person who has been known among us by the sobriquet of the chainbearer my grandmother had told me that uncle chainbearer as we all called the old relative did know all about susquesus in his timethe reason why he had left his tribe and become a hunter and warrior and runner among the palefacesand that he had always said the particulars did his red friend great credit but that he would reveal it no further so great however was uncle chainbearers reputation for integrity that such an opinion was sufficient to procure for the onondago the fullest confidence of the whole connection and the experience of fourscore years and ten had proved that this confidence was well placed some imputed the sort of exile in which the old man had so long lived to love others to war and others again to the consequences of those fierce personal feuds that are known to occur among men in the savage state but all was just as much a mystery and matter of conjecture now we were drawing near to the middle of the nineteenth century as it had been when our forefathers were receding from the middle of the eighteenth to return to the negro  although jaaf had momentarily forgotten me and quite forgotten my parents he remembered my sister who was in the habit of seeing him so often in what manner he connected her with the family it is not easy to say but he knew her not only by sight but by name and as one might say by blood  yes yes cried the old fellow a little eagerly champing his thick lips together somewhat as an alligator snaps his jaws yes i knows miss patty of course miss patty is werry hansome and grows hansomer and hansomer ebbery time i sees heryah yah yah the laugh of that old negro sounded startling and unnatural yet there was something of the joyous in it after all like every negros laugh yah yah yah yes miss patty wonerful hansome and werry like miss dus i spose now miss patty wast born about e time dat ginral washington die  as this was a good deal more than doubling my sisters age it produced a common laugh among the lighthearted girls in the carriage a gleam of intelligence that almost amounted to a smile also shot athwart the countenance of the onondago while the muscles of his face worked but he said nothing i had reason to know afterwards that the tablet of his memory retained its records better  what friends have you with you today jaaf inquired my grandmother inclining her head towards us pedlars graciously at the same time a salutation that my uncle ro and myself rose hastily to acknowledge  as for myself i own honestly that i could have jumped into the vehicle and kissed my dear grandmothers still goodlooking but colourless cheeks and hugged patt and possibly some of the others to my heart uncle ro had more command of himself though i could see that the sound of his venerable parents voice in which the tremour was barely perceptible was near overcoming him  dese be pedlar maam i do spose answered the black deys got box wid sometin in him and deys got new kind of fiddle come young man gib miss dus a tunea libely one sich as make an ole nigger dance  i drew round the hurdygurdy and was beginning to flourish away when a gentle sweet voice raised a little louder than usual by eagerness interrupted me  oh not that thing not that the flute the flute exclaimed mary warren blushing to the eyes at her own boldness the instant she saw that she was heard and that i was about to comply  it is hardly necessary to say that i bowed respectfully laid down the hurdygurdy drew the flute from my pocket and after a few flourishes commenced playing one of the newest airs or melodies from a favourite opera i saw the colour rush into marthas cheeks the moment i had got through a bar or two and the start she gave satisfied me that the dear girl remembered her brothers flute i had played on that very instrument ever since i was sixteen but i had made an immense progress in the art during the five years just passed in europe masters at naples paris vienna and london had done a great deal for me and i trust i shall not be thought vain if i add that nature had done something too my excellent grandmother listened in profound attention and all four of the girls were enchanted  that music is worthy of being heard in a room observed the former as soon as i concluded the air and we shall hope to hear it this evening at the nest house if you remain anywhere near us in the mean time we must pursue our airing  as my grandmother spoke she leaned forward and extended her hand to me with a benevolent smile i advanced received the dollar that was offered and unable to command my feelings raised the hand to my lips respectfully but with fervour had marthas face been near me it would have suffered also i suppose there was nothing in this respectful salutation that struck the spectators as very much out of the way foreigners having foreign customs but i saw a flush in my venerable grandmothers cheek as the carriage moved off she had noted the warmth of the manner my uncle had turned away i dare say to conceal the tears that started to his eyes and jaaf followed towards the door of the hut whither my uncle moved in order to do the honours of the place this left me quite alone with the indian  why no kiss face of grandmodder asked the onondago coolly and quietly  had a clap of thunder broken over my head i could not have been more astonished the disguise that had deceived my nearest relationsthat had baffled seneca newcome and had set at naught even his sister opportunityhad failed to conceal me from that indian whose faculties might be supposed to have been numbed with age  is it possible that you know me susquesus i exclaimed signing towards the negro at the same time by way of caution that you remember me at all i should have thought this wig these clothes would have concealed me  sartain answered the aged indian calmly know young chief soon as see him know faderknow mudder know granfader granmuddergreatgranfader his fader too know all why forget young chief  did you know me before i kissed my grandmothers hand or only by that act  know as soon as see him what eyes good for if dont know know uncle dere sartain welcome home  but you will not let others know us too trackless we have always been friends i hope  be sure friends why ole eagle wid white head strike young pigeon nebber hatchet in e path between susquesus and any of de tribe of ravensnest too ole to dig him up now  there are good reasons why my uncle and myself should not be known for a few days perhaps you have heard something of the trouble that has grown up between the landlords and the tenants in the land  what dat trouble  the tenants are tired of paying rent and wish to make a new bargain by which they can become owners of the farms on which they live  a grim light played upon the swarthy countenance of the indian his lips moved but he uttered nothing aloud  have you heard anything of this susquesus  little bird sing sich song in my eardidnt like to hear it  and of indians who are moving up and down the country armed with rifles and dressed in calico  what tribe dem injin asked the trackless with a quickness and a fire i did not think it possible for him to retain what ey do marchin bouton warpath eh  in one sense they may be said to be so they belong to the antirent tribe do you know such a nation  poor injin dat blieve why come so latewhy no come when e foot of susquesus light as feather of birdwhy stay away till palefaces plentier dan leaf on tree or snow in air hundred year ago when dat oak little sich injin might be good now he good for nuttin  but you will keep our secret suswill not even tell the negro who we are  the trackless simply nodded his head in assent after this he seemed to me to sink back in a sort of brooding lethargy as if indisposed to pursue the subject i left him to go to my uncle in order to relate what had just passed mr roger littlepage was as much astonished as i had been myself at hearing that one so aged should have detected us through disguises that had deceived our nearest of kin but the quiet penetration and close observation of the man had long been remarkable as his good faith was of proof however neither felt any serious apprehension of being betrayed as soon as he had a moment for reflection     chapter ix      he saw a cottage with a double coachhouse     a cottage of gentility     and the devil did grin for his darling sin     is the pride that apes humility      devils thoughts   it was now necessary to determine what course we ought next to pursue it might appear presuming in men of our pursuits to go to the nest before the appointed time and did we proceed on to the village we should have the distance between the two places to walk over twice carrying our instruments and jewelbox after a short consultation it was decided to visit the nearest dwellings and to remain as near my own house as was practicable making an arrangement to sleep somewhere in its immediate vicinity could we trust any one with our secret our fare would probably be all the better but my uncle thought it most prudent to maintain a strict incognito until he had ascertained the true state of things in the town  we took leave of the indian and the negro therefore promising to visit them again in the course of that or the succeeding day and followed the path that led to the farmhouse it was our opinion that we might at least expect to meet with friends in the occupants of the home farm the same family had been retained in possession there for three generations and being hired to manage the husbandry and to take care of the dairy there was not the same reason for the disaffection that was said so generally to exist among the tenantry prevailing among them the name of this family was miller and it consisted of the two heads and some six or seven children most of the latter being still quite young  tom miller was a trusty lad when i knew much of him said my uncle as we drew near to the barn in which we saw the party mentioned at work and he is said to have behaved well in one or two alarms they have had at the nest this summer still it may be wiser not to let even him into our secret as yet  i am quite of your mind sir i answered for who knows that he has not just as strong a desire as any of them to own the farm on which he lives he is the grandson of the man who cleared it from the forest and has much the same title as the rest of them  very true and why should not that give him just as good a right to claim an interest in the farm beyond that he has got under his contract to work it as if he held a lease he who holds a lease gets no right beyond his bargain nor does this man the one is paid for his labour by the excess of his receipts over the amount of his annual rent while the other is paid partly in what he raises and partly in wages in principle there is no difference whatever not a particle yet i question if the veriest demagogue in the state would venture to say that the man or the family which works a farm for hire even for a hundred years gets the smallest right to say he shall not quit it if its owner please as soon as his term of service is up  the love of money is the root of all evil and when that feeling is uppermost one can never tell what a man will do the bribe of a good farm obtained for nothing or for an insignificant price is sufficient to upset the morality of even tom miller  you are right hugh and here is one of the points in which our political men betray the cloven foot they write and proclaim and make speeches as if the antirent troubles grew out of the durable lease system solely whereas we all know that it is extended to all descriptions of obligations given for the occupancy of landlife leases leases for a term of years articles for deeds and bonds and mortgages it is a widespread though not yet universal attempt of those who have the least claim to the possession of real estate to obtain the entire right and that by agencies that neither the law nor good morals will justify it is no new expedient for partizans to place en evidence no more of their principles and intentions than suits their purposes but here we are within earshot and must resort to the high dutch guten tag guten tag continued uncle ro dropping easily into the broken english of our masquerade as we walked into the barn where miller two of his older boys and a couple of hired men were at work grinding scythes and preparing for the approaching hayharvest it might be warm day dis fine mornin  good day good day cried miller hastily and glancing his eye a little curiously at our equipments what have you got in your boxessences  nein vatches and drinkets setting down the box and opening it at once for the inspection of all present vont you burchase a goot vatch dis bleasant mornin  be they raal gold asked miller a little doubtingly and all them chains and rings be they gold too  not true golt nein nein i might not say dat but goot enough golt for blain folks like you and me  them things would never do for the grand quality over at the big house cried one of the labourers who was unknown to me but whose name i soon ascertained was joshua brigham and who spoke with a sort of malicious sneer that at once betrayed he was no friend you mean em for poor folks i spose  i means dem for any bodies dat will pay deir money for em answered my uncle vould you like a vatch  that would i and a farm too if i could get em cheap answered brigham with a sneer he did not attempt to conceal how do you sell farms today  i haf got no farms i sells drinkets and vatches but i doesnt sell farms vhat i haf got i vill sell but i cannot sells vhat i haf not got  oh youll get all you want if youll stay long enough in this country this is a free land and just the place for a poor man or it will be as soon as we get all the lords and aristocrats out of it  this was the first time i had ever heard this political blarney with my own ears though i had understood it was often used by those who wish to give to their own particular envy and covetousness a grand and sounding air  vell i haf heards dat in america dere might not be any noples ant aristocrats put in my uncle with an appearance of beautiful simplicity and dat dere ist not ein graaf in der whole coontry  oh theres all sorts of folks here just as they are to be found elsewhere cried miller seating himself coolly on the end of the grindstoneframe to open and look into the mysteries of one of the watches now josh brigham here calls all thats above him in the world aristocrats but he doesnt call all thats below him his equals  i liked that speech and i liked the cool decided way in which it was uttered it denoted in its spirit a man who saw things as they are and who was not afraid to say what he thought about them my uncle ro was surprised and that agreeably too and he turned to miller to pursue the discourse  den dere might not be any nopility in america after all he asked inquiringly  yes theres plenty of such lords as josh here who want to be uppermost so plaguily that they dont stop to touch all the rounds of the ladder i tell him friend he wants to get on too fast and that he mustnt set up for a gentleman before he knows how to behave himself  josh looked a little abashed at a rebuke that came from one of his own class and which he must have felt in secret was merited but the demon was at work in him and he had persuaded himself that he was the champion of a quality as sacred as liberty when in fact he was simply and obviously doing neither more nor less than breaking the tenth commandment he did not like to give up while he skirmished with miller as the dog that has been beaten already two or three times growls over a bone at the approach of his conqueror  well thank heaven he cried i have got some spirit in my body  thats very true joshua answered miller laying down one watch and taking up another but it happens to be an evil spirit  now heres them littlepages what makes them better than other folks  you had better let the littlepages alone joshua seein theyre a family that you know nothing at all about  i dont want to know them though i do happen to know all i want to know i despise em  no you dont joshy my boy nobody despises folks they talk so spitefully about whats the price of this here watch friend  four dollars said my uncle eagerly falling lower than was prudent in his desire to reward miller for his good feeling and sound sentiments ja jayou might haf das vatch for four dollars  im afraid it isnt good for anything returned miller feeling the distrust that was natural at hearing a price so low lets have another look at its inside  no man probably ever bought a watch without looking into its works with an air of great intelligence though none but a mechanician is any wiser for his survey tom miller acted on this principle for the good looks of the machine he held in his hand and the four dollars tempted him sorely it had its effect too on the turbulent and envious joshua who seemed to understand himself very well in a bargain neither of the men had supposed the watches to be of gold for though the metal that is in a watch does not amount to a great deal it is usually of more value than all that was asked for the article now under examination in point of fact my uncle had this very watch invoiced to him at twice the price he now put it at  and what do you ask for this demanded joshua taking up another watch of very similar looks and of equal value to the one that miller still retained open in his hand wont you let this go for three dollars  no der brice of dat is effery cent of forty dollars answered uncle ro stubbornly  the two men now looked at the pedlar in surprise miller took the watch from his hired man examined it attentively compared it with the other and then demanded its price anew  you might haf eider of dem vatches for four dollars returned my uncle as i thought incautiously  this occasioned a new surprise though brigham fortunately referred the difference to a mistake  oh he said i understood you to say forty dollars four dollars is a different matter  josh interrupted the more observant and coolerheaded miller it is high time now you and peter go and look ater them sheep the conch will soon be blowing for dinner if you want a trade you can have one when you get back  notwithstanding the plainness of his appearance and language tom miller was captain of his own company he gave this order quietly and in his usual familiar way but it was obviously to be obeyed without a remonstrance in a minute the two hired men were off in company leaving no one behind in the barn but miller his sons and us two i could see there was a motive for all this but did not understand it  now hes gone continued tom quietly but laying an emphasis that sufficiently explained his meaning perhaps youll let me know the true price of this watch ive a mind for it and may be we can agree  four dollars answered my uncle distinctly i haf said you might haf it for dat money and vhat i haf said once might always be  i will take it then i almost wish you had asked eight though four dollars saved is suthin for a poor man its so plaguy cheap im a little afraid on t but ill ventur there theres your money and in hard cash  dank you sir wont das ladies choose to look at my drinkets  oh if you want to deal with ladies who buy chains and rings the nest house is the place my woman wouldnt know what to do with sich things and dont set herself up for a fine lady at all that chap who has just gone for the sheep is the only great man we have about this farm  ja ja he ist a nople in a dirty shirt ja ja why hast he dem pig feelins  i believe you have named them just as they ought to be pigs feelins its because he wishes to thrust his own snout all over the trough and is mad when he finds anybody elses in the way were getting to have plenty of such fellows up and down the country and an uncomfortable time they give us boys i do believe it will turn out ater all that josh is an injin  i know he is answered the oldest of the two sons a lad of nineteen where else should he be so much of nights and sundays but at their traininsand what was the meanin of the calico bundle i saw under his arm a month ago as i told you on at the time  if i find it out to be as you say harry he shall tramp off of this farm ill have no injins here  vell i dought i dit see an olt injin in a hut up yonder ast by der woots put in my uncle innocently  oh that is susquesus an onondago he is a true injin and a gentleman but we have a parcel of the mock gentry about who are a pest and an eyesore to every honest man in the country half on em are nothing but thieves in mock injin dresses the law is agin em right is agin em and every true friend of liberty in the country ought to be agin em  vhat ist der matter in dis coontry i hear in europe how america ist a free lant ant how efery man hast his rights but since i got here dey do nothin but talk of barons and noples and tenants and arisdograts and all der bat dings i might leaf behint me in der olt worlt  the plain matter is friend that they who have got little envy them thats got much and the struggle is to see which is the strongest on the one side is the law and right and bargains and contracts and on the other thousandsnot of dollars but of men thousands of voters dye understand  ja jai oonderstands dat ist easy enough but vhy do dey dalk so much of noples and arisdogratsist der noples and arisdograts in america  well i dont much understand the natur of sich things there sartainly is a difference in men and a difference in their fortuns and edications and such sort of things  und der law den favours der rich man at der cost of der poor in america too does it und you haf arisdograts who might not pay taxes and who holt all der offices and get all der pooblic money and who ist petter pefore de law in all dings dan ast dem dat be not arisdograts is it so  miller laughed outright and shook his head at this question continuing to examine the trinkets the whole time  no no my friend weve not much of that in this part of the world either rich men get very few offices to begin with for its an argooment in favour of a man for an office that hes poor and wants it folks dont so much ask who the office wants as who wants the office then as for taxes there isnt much respect paid to the rich on that score young squire littlepage pays the tax on this farm directly himself and its assessed half as high agin all things considered as any other farm on his estate  but dat ist not right  right who says it isor who thinks there is anything right about assessments anywhere i have heard assessors with my own ears use such words as thesesich a man is rich and can afford to pay and sich a man is poor and it will come hard on him oh they kiver up dishonesty nowadays under all sorts of argooments  but der law der rich might haf der law on deir side surely  in what way i should like to know juries be everything and juries will go accordin to their feelins as well as other men ive seen the things with my own eyes the county pays just enough aday to make poor men like to be on juries and they never fail to attend while them that can pay their fines stay away and so leave the law pretty much in the hands of one party no rich man gains his cause unless his case is so strong it cant be helped  i had heard this before there being a very general complaint throughout the country of the practical abuses connected with the jury system i have heard intelligent lawyers complain that whenever a cause of any interest is to be tried the first question asked is not what are the merits which has the law and the facts on his side but who is likely to be on the jurythus obviously placing the composition of the jury before either law or evidence systems may have a very fair appearance on paper and as theories that are execrable in practice as for juries i believe the better opinion of the intelligent of all countries is that while they are a capital contrivance to resist the abuse of power in narrow governments in governments of a broad constituency they have the effect which might easily be seen of placing the control of the law in the hands of those who would be most apt to abuse it since it is adding to instead of withstanding and resisting the controlling authority of the state from which in a popular government most of the abuses must unavoidably proceed  as for my uncle ro he was disposed to pursue the subject with miller who turned out to be a discreet and conscientious man after a very short pause as if to reflect on what had been said he resumed the discourse  vhat den makes arisdograts in dis coontry asked my uncle  waalno man but an american of new england descent as was the case with miller can give this word its attic soundwaal its hard to say i hear a great deal about aristocrats and i read a great deal about aristocrats in this country and i know that most folks look upon them as hateful but im by no means sartain i know what an aristocrat is do you happen to know anything about it friend  ja ja an arisdograt ist one of a few men dat hast all de power of de government in deir own hands  king that isnt what we think an aristocrat in this part of the world why we call them critturs here dimigogues now young squire littlepage who owns the nest house over yonder and who is owner of all this estate far and near is what we call an aristocrat and he hasnt power enough to be named town clerk much less to anything considerable or what is worth having  how can he be an arisdograt den  how sure enough if your account be true i tell you tis the dimigogues that be the aristocrats of america why josh brigham who has just gone for the sheep can get more votes for any office in the country than young littlepage  berhaps dis young littlebage ist a pat yoong man  not he hes as good as any on em and better than most besides if he was as wicked as lucifer the folks of the country dont know anything about it sin hes ben away ever sin he has ben a man  vhy den gant he haf as many votes as dat poor ignorant fellow might hafdas ist ott  it is odd but its true as gospel why it may not be so easy to tell many men many minds you know some folks dont like him because he lives in a big house some hate him because they think he is better off than they are themselves others mistrust him because he wears a fine coat and some pretend to laugh at him because he got his property from his father and grandther and so on and didnt make it himself accordin to some folks notions nowadays a man ought to enjy only the property he heaps together himself  if dis be so your herr littlebage ist no arisdograt  waal that isnt the idee hereaway we have had a great many meetins latterly about the right of the people to their farms and there has been a good deal of talk at them meetins consarnin aristocracy and feudal tenors do you know what a feudal tenor is too  ja dere ist moch of dat in teutchlandin mine coontry it ist not ferry easy to explain it in a few vords but der brincipal ding ist dat der vassal owes a serfice to hist lort in de olten dimes dis serfice vast military und dere ist someding of dat now it ist de noples who owe der feudal serfice brincipally in mine coontry and dey owes it to de kings and brinces  and dont you call giving a chicken for rent feudal service in germany  uncle ro and i laughed in spite of our efforts to the contrary there being a pathos in this question that was supremely ridiculous curbing his merriment however as soon as he could my uncle answered the question  if der landlordt hast a right to coome and dake as many chickens as he bleases und ast often ast he bleases den dat wouldt look like a feudal right but if de lease says dat so many chickens moost be paid ayear for der rent vhy dat ist all der same as baying so much moneys und it might be easier for der tenant to bay in chicken ast it might be to bay in der silver vhen a man canst bay his debts in vhat he makes himself he ist ferry interpentent  it does seem so i vow yet theres folks about here and some at albany that call it feudal for a man to have to carry a pair of fowls to the landlords office and the landlord an aristocrat for asking it  but der man canst sent a poy or a gal or a nigger wid his fowls if he bleases  sartain all that is asked is that the fowls should come  und vhen der batroon might owe hist tailor or hist shoemaker must he not go to hist shop or find him and bay him vhat he owes or be suet for der debt  thats true too boys put me in mind of telling that to josh this evening yes the greatest landlord in the land must hunt up his creditor or be sued all the same as the lowest tenant  und he most bay in a particlar ding he most bay in golt or silver  true lawful tender is as good for one as tis for tother  und if your herr littlebage signs a baper agreein to gif der apples from dat orchart to somebody on his landts most he send or carry der apples too  to be sure that would be the bargain  und he most carry der ferry apples dat grows on dem ferry drees might it not be so  all true as gospel if a man contracts to sell the apples of one orchard he cant put off the purchaser with the apples of another  und der law ist der same for one ast for anudder in dese tings  there is no difference and there should be none  und der batroons und der landlordts wants to haf der law changet so dat dey may be excuset from baying der debts accordin to der bargains und to gif dem atfantages over der poor tenants  i never heard anything of the sort and dont believe they want any such change  of vhat den dost der beople complain  of having to pay rent at all they think the landlords ought to be made to sell their farms or give them away some stand out for the last  but der landlordts dont vant to sell deir farms und dey might not be made to sell vhat ist deir own and vhat dey dont vant to sell any more dan der tenants might be made to sell deir hogs and deir sheep vhen dey dont vant to sell dem  it does seem so boys as ive told the neighbours all along but ill tell this dutchman all about it some folks want the state to look ater the title of young littlepage pretending he has no title  but der state wilt do dat widout asking for it particularly vill it not  i never heard that it would  if anybody hast a claim to der broperty vilt not der courts try it  yes yesin that way but a tenant cant set up a title agin his landlord  vhy should he he canst haf no title but his landlorts and it vould be roguery and cheatery to let a man get into der bossession of a farm under der pretence of hiring it und den coome out und claim it as owner if any tenant dinks he hast a better right dan his landlort he can put der farm vhere it vast before he might be a tenant und den der state wilt examine into der title i fancys  yes yesin that way but these men want it another way what they want is for the state to set up a legal examination and turn the landlords off altogether if they can and then let themselves have the farms in their stead  but dat would not be honest to dem dat hafent nothing to do wid der farms if der state owns der farms it ought to get as moch as it can for dem and so safe all der people from baying taxes it looks like roguery all roundt  i believe it is that and nothing else as you say the state will examine into the title as it is and there is no need of any laws about it  would der state dink you pass a law dat might inquire into de demandts dat are made against der batroons vhen der tratesmen sent in deir bills  i should like to see any patroon ask sich a thing he would be laughed at from york to buffalo  und he would desarf it by vhat i see frient your denants be der arisdograts und der landlordts der vassals  why you seewhat may your name beas were likely to become acquainted i should like to know your name  my name is greisenbach und i comes from preussen  well mr greisenbach the difficulty about aristocracy is this hugh littlepage is rich and his money gives him advantages that other men cant enjy now that sticks in some folks crops  oh den it ist meant to divite broperty in dis coontry und to say no man might haf more ast anudder  folks dont go quite as far as that yet though some of their talk does squint thataway i must own now there are folks about here that complain that old madam littlepage and her young ladies dont visit the poor  vell if deys be hardhearted und hast no feelins for der poor and miseraple  no no that is not what i mean neither as for that sort of poor everybody allows they do more for them than anybody else about here but they dont visit the poor that isnt in want  vell it ist a ferry coomfortable sort of poor dat ist not in any vant berhaps you mean dey dont associate wid em as equals  thats it now on that head i must say there is some truth in the charge for the gals over at the nest never come here to visit my gal and kitty is as nice a young thing as there is about  und gitty goes to visit the gal of the man who lives over yonter in de house on der hill pointing to a residence of a man of the very humblest class in the town  hardly kittys by no means proud but i shouldnt like her to be too thick there  oh youre an arisdograt den after all else might your daughter visit dat mans daughter  i tell you grunzebach or whatever your name may be returned miller a little angrily though a particularly goodnatured man in the main that my gal shall not visit old stevens daghters  vell im sure she might do as she bleases but i dinks der mademoiselles littlepage might do ast dey pleases too  there is but one littlepage gal if you saw them out this morning in the carriage you saw two york gals and parson warrens daghter with her  und dis parson warren might be rich too  not he he hasnt a sixpence on arth but what he gets from the parish why he is so poor his friends had to edicate his daghter i have heern say over and over  und das littlepage gal und de warren gal might be goot friends  they are the thickest together of any two young women in this part of the world ive never seen two gals more intimate now theres a young lady in the town one opportunity newcome who one might think would stand before mary warren at the big house any day in the week but she doesnt mary takes all the shine out on her  which ist der richest obbordunity or mary  by all accounts mary warren has nothing while opportunity is thought to come next to matty herself as to property of all the young gals about here but opportunity is no favourite at the nest  den it would seem after all dat dis miss littlebage does not choose her friends on account of riches she likes mary warren who ist boor und she does not like obbordunity who ist vell to do in de vorlt berhaps der littlepages be not as big arisdograts as you supposes  miller was bothered while i felt a disposition to laugh one of the commonest errors of those who from position and habits are unable to appreciate the links which connect cultivated society together is to refer everything to riches riches in a certain sense as a means and through their consequences may be a principal agent in dividing society into classes but long after riches have taken wings their fruits remain when good use has been made of their presence so untrue is the vulgar opinionor it might be better to say the opinion of the vulgarthat money is the one tie which unites polished society that it is a fact which all must know who have access to the better circles of even our own commercial towns that those circles loosely and accidentally constructed as they are receive with reluctance nay often sternly exclude vulgar wealth from their associations while the door is open to the cultivated who have nothing the young in particular seldom think much of money while family connections early communications similarity of opinions and most of all of tastes bring sets together and often keep them together long after the golden band has been broken  but men have great difficulty in comprehending things that lie beyond their reach and money being apparent to the senses while refinement through its infinite gradations is visible principally and in some cases exclusively to its possessors it is not surprising that common minds should refer a tie that to them would otherwise be mysterious to the more glittering influence and not to the less obvious infinite indeed are the gradations of cultivated habits nor are as many of them the fruits of caprice and selfindulgence as men usually suppose there is a common sense nay a certain degree of wisdom in the laws of even etiquette while they are confined to equals that bespeak the respect of those who understand them as for the influence of associations on mens manners on their exteriors and even on their opinions my uncle ro has long maintained that it is so apparent that one of his time of life could detect the man of the world at such a place as saratoga even by an intercourse of five minutes and what is more that he could tell the class in life from which he originally emerged he tried it the last summer on our return from ravensnest and i was amused with his success though he made a few mistakes it must be admitted  that young man comes from the better circles but he has never travelled he said alluding to one of a group which still remained at table while he who is next him has travelled but commenced badly this may seem a very nice distinction but i think it is easily made there are two brothers of an excellent family in pennsylvania he continued as one might know from the name the eldest has travelled the youngest has not this was a still harder distinction to make but one who knew the world as well as my uncle ro could do it he went on amusing me by his decisionsall of which were respectable and some surprisingly accuratein this way for several minutes now like has an affinity to like and in this natural attraction is to be found the secret of the ordinary construction of society you shall put two men of superior minds in a room full of company and they will find each other out directly and enjoy the accident the same is true as to the mere modes of thinking that characterize social castes and it is truer in this country perhaps than most others from the mixed character of our associations of the two i am really of opinion that the man of high intellect who meets with one of moderate capacity but of manners and social opinions on a level with his own has more pleasure in the communication than with one of equal mind but of inferior habits  that patt should cling to one like mary warren seemed to me quite as natural as that she should be averse to much association with opportunity newcome the money of the latter had my sister been in the least liable to such an influence was so much below what she had been accustomed all her life to consider affluence that it would have had no effect even had she been subject to so low a consideration in regulating her intercourse with others but this poor tom miller could not understand he could only reason from what he knew and he knew little of the comparative notions of wealth and less of the powers of cultivation on the mind and manners he was struck however with a fact that did come completely within the circle of his own knowledge and that was the circumstance that mary warren while admitted to be poor was the bosom friend of her whom he was pleased to call sometimes the littlepage gal it was easy to see he felt the force of this circumstance and it is to be hoped that as he was certainly a wiser he also became a better man on one of the most common of the weaknesses of human frailty  waal he replied to my uncles last remark after fully a minute of silent reflection i dont know it would seem so i vow and yet it hasnt been my wifes notion nor is it kittys youre quite upsetting my idees about aristocrats for though i like the littlepages ive always set em down as desprate aristocrats  nein nein dem as vat you calls dimigogues be der american arisdograts dey gets all der money of der pooblic and haf all der power but dey gets a little mads because dey might not force demselves on der gentlemen and laties of der coontry as vell as on der lands und der offices  i swan i dont know but this may be true ater all i dont know what right anybody has to complain of the littlepages  does dey dreat beoples vell as might coome to see dem  yes indeed if folks treat them well as sometimes doesnt happen ive seen hogs heretom was a little saxon in his figures but their nature will prove their justificationive seen hogs about here bolt right in before old madam littlepage and draw their chairs up to her fire and squirt about the tobacco and never think of even taking off their hats them folks be always huffy about their own importance though they never think of other peoples feelins  we were interrupted by the sound of wheels and looking round we perceived that the carriage of my grandmother had driven up to the farmhouse door on its return home miller conceived it to be no more than proper to go and see if he were wanted and we followed him slowly it being the intention of my uncle to offer his mother a watch by way of ascertaining if she could penetrate his disguise     chapter x      will you buy any tape     or lace for your cape     come to the pedlar     moneys a medler     that doth utter all mens warea      winters tale   there they sat those four young creatures a perfect galaxy of bright and beaming eyes there was not a plain face among them and i was struck with the circumstance of how rare it was to meet with a youthful and positively ugly american female kitty too was at the door by the time we reached the carriage and she also was a blooming and attractivelooking girl it was a thousand pities that she spoke however the vulgarity of her utterance tone of voice cadences and accent the latter a sort of singing whine being in striking contrast to a sort of healthful and vigorous delicacy that marked her appearance all the bright eyes grew brighter as i drew nearer carrying the flute in my hand but neither of the young ladies spoke  buy a vatch maams said uncle ro approaching his mother cap in hand with his box open  i thank you friend but i believe all here are provided with watches already  mine ist ferry sheaps  i dare say they may be returned dear grandmother smiling though cheap watches are not usually the best is that very pretty pencil gold  yes maams it ist of goot gold if it might not be i might not say so  i saw suppressed smiles among the girls all of whom however were too wellbred to betray to common observers the sense of the ridiculous that each felt at the equivoque that suggested itself in my uncles words  what is the price of this pencil asked my grandmother  uncle roger had too much tact to think of inducing his mother to make a purchase as he had influenced miller and he mentioned something near the true value of the article which was fifteen dollars  i will take it returned my grandmother dropping three half eagles into the box when turning to mary warren she begged her acceptance of the pencil with as much respect in her manner as if she solicited instead of conferred a favour  mary warrens handsome face was covered with blushes she looked pleased and she accepted the offering though i thought she hesitated one moment about the propriety of so doing most probably on account of its value my sister asked to look at this little present and after admiring it it passed from hand to hand each praising its shape and ornaments all my uncles wares indeed were in perfect good taste the purchase having been made of an importer of character and paid for at some cost the watches it is true were with one or two exceptions cheap as were most of the trinkets but my uncle had about his person a watch or two and some fine jewelry that he had brought from europe himself expressly to bestow in presents among which had been the pencil in question and which he had dropped into the box but a moment before it was sold  waal madam littlepage cried miller who used the familiarity of one born on the estate this is the queerest watchpedlar ive met with yet he asks fifteen dollars for that pencil and only four for this watch showing his own purchase as he concluded  my grandmother took the watch in her hand and examined it attentively  it strikes me as singularly cheap she remarked glancing a little distrustfully as i fancied at her son as if she thought he might be selling his brushes cheaper than those who only stole the materials because he stole them ready made i know that these watches are made for very little in the cheap countries of europe but one can hardly see how this machinery was put together for so small a sum  i has em matam at all brices put in my uncle  i have a strong desire to purchase a good ladys watch but should a little fear buying of any but a known and regular dealer  you neednt fear us maam i ventured to say if we might sheat anypodies we shouldnt sheat so goot a laty  i do not know whether my voice struck patts ear pleasantly or a wish to see the project of her grandmother carried out at once induced my sister to interfere but interfere she did and that by urging her aged parent to put confidence in us years had taught my grandmother caution and she hesitated  but all these watches are of base metal and i want one of good gold and handsome finish observed my grandmother  my uncle immediately produced a watch that he had bought of blondel in paris for five hundred francs and which was a beautiful little ornament for a ladys belt he gave it to my grandmother who read the name of the manufacturer with some little surprise the watch itself was then examined attentively and was applauded by all  and what may be the price of this demanded my grandmother  one hoondred dollars matam and sheaps at dat  tom miller looked at the bit of tinsel in his own hand and at the smaller but exquisitelyshaped article that my grandmother held up to look at suspended by its bit of ribbon and was quite as much puzzled as he had evidently been a little while before in his distinctions between the rich and the poor tom was not able to distinguish the base from the true that was all  my grandmother did not appear at all alarmed at the price though she cast another distrustful glance or two over her spectacles at the imaginary pedlar at length the beauty of the watch overcame her  if you will bring this watch to yonder large dwelling i will pay you the hundred dollars for it she said i have not as much money with me here  ja jaferry goot you might keep das vatch laty and i will coome for der money after i haf got some dinners of somebodys  my grandmother had no scruple about accepting of the credit of course and she was about to put the watch in her pocket when patt laid her little gloved hand on it and cried  now dearest grandmother let it be done at oncethere is no one but us three present you know  such is the impatience of a child exclaimed the elder lady laughing well you shall be indulged i gave you that pencil for a keepsake mary only en attendant it having been my intention to offer a watch as soon as a suitable one could be found as a memorial of the sense i entertain of the spirit you showed during that dark week in which the antirenters were so menacing here then is such a watch as i might presume to ask you to have the goodness to accept  mary warren seemed astounded the colour mounted to her temples then she became suddenly pale i had never seen so pretty a picture of gentle female distressa distress that arose from conflicting but creditable feelings  oh mrs littlepage she exclaimed after looking in astonishment at the offering for a moment and in silence you cannot have intended that beautiful watch for me  for you my dear the beautiful watch is not a whit too good for my beautiful mary  but dear dear mrs littlepage it is altogether too handsome for my stationfor my means  a lady can very well wear such a watch and you are a lady in every sense of the word and so you need have no scruples on that account as for the means you will not misunderstand me if i remind you that it will be bought with my means and there can be no extravagance in the purchase  but we are so poor and that watch has so rich an appearance it scarcely seems right  i respect your feelings and sentiments my dear girl and can appreciate them i suppose you know i was once as poor nay much poorer than you are yourself  you mrs littlepage no that can hardly be you are of an affluent and very respectable family i know  it is quite true nevertheless my dear i shall not affect extreme humility and deny that the malbones did and do belong to the gentry of the land but my brother and myself were once so much reduced as to toil with the surveyors in the woods quite near this property we had then no claim superior to yours and in many respects were reduced much lower besides the daughter of an educated and wellconnected clergyman has claims that in a worldly point of view alone entitle her to a certain consideration you will do me the favour to accept my offering  dear mrs littlepage i do not know how to refuse you or how to accept so rich a gift you will let me consult my father first  that will be no more than proper my dear returned my beloved grandmother quietly putting the watch into her own pocket mr warren luckily dines with us and the matter can be settled before we sit down to table  this ended the discussion which had commenced under an impulse of feeling that left us all its auditors as for my uncle and myself it is scarcely necessary to say we were delighted with the little scene the benevolent wish to gratify on the one side with the natural scruples on the other about receiving made a perfect picture for our contemplation the three girls who were witnesses of what passed too much respected marys feelings to interfere though patt restrained herself with difficulty as to tom miller and kitty they doubtless wondered why warrens gal was such a fool as to hesitate about accepting a watch that was worth a hundred dollars this was another point they did not understand  you spoke of dinner continued my grandmother looking at my uncle if you and your companion will follow us to the house i will pay you for the watch and order you a dinner in the bargain  we were right down glad to accept this offer making our bows and expressing our thanks as the carriage whirled off we remained a moment to take our leave of miller  when youve got through at the nest said that semiworthy fellow give us another call here i should like my woman and kitty to have a look at your finery before you go down to the village with it  with a promise to return to the farmhouse we proceeded on our way to the building which in the familiar parlance of the country was called the nest or the nest house from ravensnest its true name and which tom miller in his country dialect called the neest the distance between the two buildings was less than half a mile the grounds of the family residence lying partly between them many persons would have called the extensive lawns which surrounded my paternal abode a park but it never bore that name with us they were too large for a paddock and might very well have come under the former appellation but as deer or animals of any sort except those that are domestic had never been kept within it the name had not been used we called them the groundsa term which applies equally to large and small enclosures of this naturewhile the broad expanse of verdure which lies directly under the windows goes by the name of the lawn notwithstanding the cheapness of land among us there has been very little progress made in the art of landscape gardening and if we have anything like park scenery it is far more owing to the gifts of a bountiful nature than to any of the suggestions of art thanks to the cultivated taste of downing as well as to his welldirected labours this reproach is likely to be soon removed and country life will acquire this pleasure among the many others that are so peculiarly its own after lying for more than twenty yearsa stigma on the national tastedisfigured by ravines or gullies and otherwise in a rude and discreditable condition the grounds of the white house have been brought into a condition to denote that they are the property of a civilized country the americans are as apt at imitation as the chinese with a far greater disposition to admit of change and little beyond good models are required to set them on the right track but it is certain that as a nation we have yet to acquire nearly all that belongs to the art i have mentioned that lies beyond avenues of trees with an occasional tuft of shrubbery the abundance of the latter that forms the wilderness of sweets the masses of flowers that spot the surface of europe the beauty of curved lines and the whole finesse of surprises reliefs backgrounds and vistas are things so little known among us as to be almost arisdogratic as my uncle ro would call the word  little else had been done at ravensnest than to profit by the native growth of the trees and to take advantage of the favourable circumstances in the formation of the grounds most travellers imagine that it might be an easy thing to lay out a park in the virgin forest as the axe might spare the thickets and copses and woods that elsewhere are the fruits of time and planting this is all a mistake however as the rule though modified exceptions may and do exist the tree of the american forest shoots upward toward the light growing so tall and slender as to be unsightly and even when time has given its trunk is due size the top is rarely of a breadth to ornament a park or a lawn while its roots seeking their nourishment in the rich alluvium formed by the decayed leaves of a thousand years lie too near the surface to afford sufficient support after losing the shelter of its neighbours it is owing to reasons like these that the ornamental grounds of an american countryhouse have usually to be commenced ab origine and that natural causes so little aid in finishing them  my predecessors had done a little towards assisting nature at the nest and what was of almost equal importance in the state of knowledge on this subject as it existed in the country sixty years since they had done little to mar her efforts the results were that the grounds of ravensnest possess a breadth that is the fruit of the breadth of our lands and a rural beauty which without being much aided by art was still attractive the herbage was kept short by sheep of which one thousand of the fine wool were feeding on the lawns along the slopes and particularly on the distant heights as we crossed the grounds on our way to the doors  the nest house was a respectable new york country dwelling as such buildings were constructed among us in the last quarter of the past century a little improved and enlarged by the second and third generations of its owners the material was of stone the low cliff on which it stood supplying enough of an excellent quality and the shape of the main corps de batiment as near a square as might be each face of this part of the constructions offered five windows to view this being almost the prescribed number for a country residence in that day as three have since got to be in towns these windows however had some size the main building being just sixty feet square which was about ten feet in each direction larger than was common so soon after the revolution but wings had been added to the original building and that on a plan which conformed to the shape of a structure in square logs that had been its predecessor on its immediate site these wings were only of a story and a half each and doubling on each side of the main edifice just far enough to form a sufficient communication they ran back to the very verge of a cliff some forty feet in height overlooking at their respective ends a meandering rivulet and a wide expanse of very productive flats that annually filled my barns with hay and my cribs with corn of this level and fertile bottomland there was near a thousand acres stretching in three directions of which two hundred belonged to what was called the nest farm the remainder was divided among the farms of the adjacent tenantry this little circumstance among the thousandandone other atrocities that were charged upon me had been made a ground of accusation to which i shall presently have occasion to advert i shall do this the more readily because the fact has not yet reached the ears and set in motion the tongues of legislatorsheaven bless us how words do get corrupted by too much usein their enumeration of the griefs of the tenants of the state  everything about the nest was kept in perfect order and in a condition to do credit to the energy and taste of my grandmother who had ordered all these things for the last few years or since the death of my grandfather this circumstance connected with the fact that the building was larger and more costly than those of most of the other citizens of the country had of late years caused ravensnest to be termed an aristocratic residence this word aristocratic i find since my return home has got to be a term of expansive signification its meaning depending on the particular habits and opinions of the person who happens to use it thus he who chews tobacco thinks it aristocratic in him who deems the practice nasty not to do the same the man who stoops accuses him who is straight in the back of having aristocratic shoulders and i have actually met with one individual who maintained that it was excessively aristocratic to pretend not to blow ones nose with his fingers it will soon be aristocratic to maintain the truth of the familiar latin axiom of de gustibus non disputandum est  as we approached the door of the nest house which opened on the piazza that stretched along three sides of the main building and the outer ends of both wings the coachman was walking his horses away from it on the road that led to the stables the party of ladies had made a considerable circuit after quitting the farm and had arrived but a minute before us all the girls but mary warren had entered the house careless on the subject of the approach of two pedlars she remained however at the side of my grandmother to receive us  i believe in my soul whispered uncle ro that my dear old mother has a secret presentiment who we are by her manifesting so much respecttousand tanks matam tousand tanks he continued dropping into his halfaccurate halfblundering broken english for dis great honour such as we might not expect das laty of das house to wait for us at her door  this young lady tells me that she has seen you before and that she understands you are both persons of education and good manners who have been driven from your native country by political troubles such being the case i cannot regard you as common pedlars i have known what it was to be reduced in fortunemy dear grandmothers voice trembled a littleand can feel for those who thus suffer  matam dere might be moch trut in some of dis answered my uncle taking off his cap and bowing very much like a gentleman an act in which i imitated him immediately we haf seen petter tays and my son dere hast peen edicatet at an university but we are now poor pedlars of vatches und dem dat might make moosic in der streets  my grandmother looked as a lady would look under such circumstances neither too free to forget present appearances nor coldly neglectful of the past she knew that something was due to her own household and to the example she ought to set it while she felt that far more was due to the sentiment that unites the cultivated we were asked into the house were told a table was preparing for us and were treated with a generous and considerate hospitality that involved no descent from her own character or that of the sex the last being committed to the keeping of every lady  in the mean time business proceeded with my uncle he was paid his hundred dollars and all his stores of value including rings brooches earrings chains bracelets and other trinkets that he had intended as presents to his wards were produced from his pockets and laid before the bright eyes of the three girlsmary warren keeping in the back ground as one who ought not to look on things unsuited to her fortune her father had arrived however had been consulted and the pretty watch was already attached to the girdle of the prettier waist i fancied the tear of gratitude that still floated in her serene eyes was a jewel of far higher price than any my uncle could exhibit  we had been shown into the library a room that was in the front of the house and of which the windows all opened on the piazza i was at first a little overcome at thus finding myself and unrecognized under the paternal roof and in a dwelling that was my own after so many years of absence shall i confess it everything appeared diminutive and mean after the buildings to which i had been accustomed in the old world i am not now drawing comparisons with the palaces of princes and the abodes of the great as the american is apt to fancy whenever anything is named that is superior to the things to which he is accustomed but to the style dwellings and appliances of domestic life that pertain to those of other countries who have not a claim in anything to be accounted my superiorsscarcely my equals in a word american aristocracy or that which it is getting to be the fashion to stigmatize as aristocratic would be deemed very democratic in most of the nations of europe our swiss brethren have their chateaux and their habits that are a hundred times more aristocratic than anything about ravensnest without giving offence to liberty and i feel persuaded were the proudest establishment in all america pointed out to a european as an aristocratic abode he would be very apt to laugh at it in his sleeve the secret of this charge among ourselves is the innate dislike which is growing up in the country to see any man distinguished from the mass around him in anything even though it should be in merit it is nothing but the expansion of the principle which gave rise to the traditionary feud between the plebeians and patricians of albany at the commencement of this century and which has now descended so much farther than was then contemplated by the soidisant plebeians of that day as to become quite disagreeable to their own descendants but to return to myself  i will own that so far from finding any grounds of exultation in my own aristocratical splendour when i came to view my possessions at home i felt mortified and disappointed the things that i had fancied really respectable and even fine from recollection now appeared very commonplace and in many particulars mean really i found myself saying sotto voce all this is scarcely worthy of being the cause of deserting the right setting sound principles at defiance and of forgetting god and his commandments perhaps i was too inexperienced to comprehend how capacious is the maw of the covetous man and how microscopic the eye of envy  you are welcome to ravensnest said mr warren approaching and offering his hand in a friendly way much as he would address any other young friend we arrived a little before you and i have had my ears and eyes open ever since in the hope of hearing your flute and of seeing your form in the highway near the parsonage where you promised to visit me  mary was standing at her fathers elbow as when i first saw her and she gazed wistfully at my flute as she would not have done had she seen me in my proper attire assuming my proper character  i danks you sir was my answer we might haf plenty of times for a little moosic vhen das laties shall be pleaset to say so i canst blay yankee doodle hail coloombias and der star spangled banner und all dem airs as dey so moch likes at der taverns and on der road  mr warren laughed and he took the flute from my hand and began to examine it i now trembled for the incognito the instrument had been mine for many years and was a very capital one with silver keys stops and ornaments what if pattwhat if my dear grandmother should recognise it i would have given the handsomest trinket in my uncles collection to get the flute back again into my own hands but before an opportunity offered for that it went from hand to hand as the instrument that had produced the charming sounds heard that morning until it reached those of martha the dear girl was thinking of the jewelry which it will be remembered was rich and intended in part for herself and she passed the instrument on saying hurriedly  see dear grandmother this is the flute which you pronounced the sweetest toned of any you had ever heard  my grandmother took the flute started put her spectacles closer to her eyes examined the instrument turned palefor her cheeks still retained a little of the colour of their youthand then cast a glance hurriedly and anxiously at me i could see that she was pondering on something profoundly in her most secret mind for a minute or two luckily the others were too much occupied with the box of the pedlar to heed her movements she walked slowly out of the door almost brushing me as she passed and went into the hall here she turned and catching my eye she signed for me to join her obeying this signal i followed until i was led into a little room in one of the wings that i well remembered as a sort of private parlour attached to my grandmothers own bedroom to call it a boudoir would be to caricature things its furniture being just that of the sort of room i have mentioned or of a plain neat comfortable country parlour here my grandmother took her seat on a sofa for she trembled so she could not stand and then she turned to gaze at me wistfully and with an anxiety it would be difficult for me to describe  do not keep me in suspense she said almost awfully in tone and manner am i right in my conjecture  dearest grandmother you are i answered in my natural voice  no more was needed we hung on each others necks as had been my wont in boyhood  but who is that pedlar hugh demanded my grandmother after a time can it possibly be roger my son  it is no other we have come to visit you incog  and why this disguiseis it connected with the troubles  certainly we have wished to take a near view with our own eyes and supposed it might be unwise to come openly in our proper characters  in this you have done well yet i hardly know how to welcome you in your present characters on no account must your real names be revealed the demons of tar and feathers the sons of liberty and equality who illustrate their principles as they do their courage by attacking the few with the many would be stirring fancying themselves heroes and martyrs in the cause of justice did they learn you were here ten armed and resolute men might drive a hundred of them i do believe for they have all the cowardice of thieves but they are heroes with the unarmed and feeble are you safe yourselves appearing thus disguised under the new law  we are not armed not having so much as a pistol and that will protect us  i am sorry to say hugh that this country is no longer what i once knew it its justice if not wholly departed is taking to itself wings and its blindness not in a disregard of persons but in a faculty of seeing only the stronger side a landlord in my opinion would have but little hope with jury judge or executive for doing that which thousands of the tenants have done still do and will continue to do with perfect impunity unless some dire catastrophe stimulates the public functionaries to their duties by awakening public indignation  this is a miserable state of things dearest grandmother and what makes it worse is the cool indifference with which most persons regard it a better illustration of the utter selfishness of human nature cannot be given than in the manner in which the body of the people look on and see wrong thus done to a few of their number  such persons as mr seneca newcome would answer that the public sympathises with the poor who are oppressed by the rich because the last do not wish to let the first rob them of their estates we hear a great deal of the strong robbing the weak all over the world but few among ourselves i am afraid are sufficiently clearsighted to see how vivid an instance of the truth now exists among ourselves  calling the tenants the strong and the landlords the weak  certainly numbers make strength in this country in which all power in practice and most of it in theory rests with the majority were there as many landlords as there are tenants my life on it no one would see the least injustice in the present state of things  so says my uncle but i hear the light steps of the girlswe must be on our guard  at that instant martha entered followed by all three of the girls holding in her hand a very beautiful manilla chain that my uncle had picked up in his travels and had purchased as a present to my future wife whomsoever she might turn out to be and which he had had the indiscretion to show to his ward a look of surprise was cast by each girl in succession as she entered the room on me but neither said and i fancy neither thought much of my being shut up there with an old lady of eighty after the first moment other thoughts were uppermost at the moment  look at this dearest grandmamma cried patt holding up the chain as she entered the room here is just the most exquisite chain that was ever wrought and of the purest gold but the pedlar refuses to part with it  perhaps you do not offer enough my child it is indeed very very beautiful pray what does he say is its value  one hundred dollars he says and i can readily believe it for its weight is near half the money i do wish hugh were at home i am certain he would contrive to get it and make it a present to me  nein nein young lady put in the pedlar who a little unceremoniously had followed the girls into the room though he knew of course precisely where he was coming dat might not be dat chain is der broperty of my son tere und i haf sworn it shalt only be gifen to his wife  patt coloured a little and she pouted a good deal then she laughed outright  if it is only to be had on those conditions i am afraid i shall never own it she said saucily though it was intended to be uttered so low as not to reach my ears i will pay the hundred dollars out of my own pocketmoney however if that will buy it do say a good word for me grandmamma  how prettily the hussy uttered that word of endearment so different from the paw and maw one hears among the dirtynoses that are to be found in the mudpuddles but our grandparent was puzzled for she knew with whom she had to deal and of course saw that money would do nothing nevertheless the state of the game rendered it necessary to say and do something that might have an appearance of complying with pattys request  can i have more success in persuading you to change your mind sir she said looking at her son in a way that let him know at once or at least made him suspect at once that she was in his secret it would give me great pleasure to be able to gratify my granddaughter by making her a present of so beautiful a chain  my uncle ro advanced to his mother took the hand she had extended with the chain in it in order the better to admire the trinket and he kissed it with a profound respect but in such a manner as to make it seem to the lookerson an act of european usage rather than what it was the tempered salute of a child to his parent  laty he then said with emphasis if anyboty might make me change a resolution long since made it would be one as fenerable und gracious und goot as i am sartain you most be but i haf vowet to gif dat chain to das wife of mine son vhen he might marry one day some bretty young american und it might not be  dear grandmother smiled but now she understood that it was really intended the chain was to be an offering to my wife she no longer wished to change its destination she examined the bauble a few moments and said to me  do you wish this as well as your unfather i should say it is a rich present for a poor man to make  ja ja laty it ist so but vhen der heart goes golt might be tought sheap to go wid it  the old lady was half ready to laugh in my face at hearing this attempt at germanic english but the kindness and delight and benevolent tenderness of her still fine eyes made me wish to throw myself in her arms again and kiss her patt continued to bouder for a moment or two longer but her excellent nature soon gave in and the smiles returned to her countenance as the sun issues from behind a cloud in may  well the disappointment may and must be borne she said goodnaturedly though it is much the most lovely chain i have ever seen  i dare say the right person will one day find one quite as lovely to present to you said henrietta coldbrook a little pointedly  i did not like this speech it was an allusion that a wellbred young woman ought not to have made at least before others even pedlars and it was one that a young woman of a proper tone of feeling would not be apt to make i determined from that instant the chain should never belong to miss henrietta though she was a fine showy girl and though such a decision would disappoint my uncle sadly i was a little surprised to see a slight blush on patts cheek and then i remembered something of the name of the traveller beekman turning towards mary warren i saw plain enough that she was disappointed because my sister was disappointed and for no other reason in the world  your grandmother will meet with another chain when she goes to town that will make you forget this she whispered affectionately close at my sisters ear  patt smiled and kissed her friend with a warmth of manner that satisfied me these two charming young creatures loved each other sincerely but my dear old grandmothers curiosity had been awakened and she felt a necessity for having it appeased she still held the chain and as she returned it to me who happened to be nearest to her she said  and so sir your mind is sincerely made up to offer this chain to your future wife  yes laty or what might be better to das yoong frau before we might be marriet  and is your choice made glancing round at the girls who were grouped together looking at some other trinkets of my uncles have you chosen the young woman who is to possess so handsome a chain  nein nein i answered returning the smile and glancing also at the group dere ist so many peautiful laties in america one neednt be in a hurry in goot time i shalt find her dat ist intended for me  well grandmamma interrupted patt since nobody can have the chain unless on certain conditions here are the three other things that we have chosen for ann henrietta and myself and they are a ring a pair of bracelets and a pair of earrings the cost altogether will be two hundred dollars can you approve of that  my grandmother now she knew who was the pedlar understood the whole matter and had no scruples the bargain was soon made when she sent us all out of the room under the pretence we should disturb her while settling with the watchseller her real object however was to be alone with her son not a dollar passing between them of course     chapter xi      our life was changed another love         in its lone woof began to twine     but oh the golden thread was wove         between my sisters heart and mine      willis   half an hour later uncle ro and myself were seated at table eating our dinners as quietly as if we were in an inn the footman who had set the table was an old family servant one who had performed the same sort of duty in that very house for a quarter of a century of course he was not an american no man of american birth ever remaining so long a time in an inferior station or in any station so low as that of a houseservant if he has good qualities enough to render it desirable to keep him he is almost certain to go up in the world if not one does not care particularly about having him but europeans are less elastic and less ambitious and it is no uncommon thing to find one of such an origin remaining a long time in the same service such had been the fact with this man who had followed my own parents from europe when they returned from their marriage tour and had been in the house on the occasion of my birth from that time he had continued at the nest never marrying nor ever manifesting the smallest wish for any change he was an englishman by birth and what is very unusual in a servant of that country when transferred to america the lettingup which is certain to attend such a change from the depression of the original condition to that in which he is so suddenly placed had not made him saucy an american is seldom what is called impudent under any circumstances he is careless nay ignorant of forms pays little or no purely conventional respect does not understand half the social distinctions which exist among the higher classes of even his own countrymen and fancies there are equalities in things about which in truth there is great inequality between himself and others merely because he has been taught that all men are equal in rights but he is so unconscious of any pressure as seldom to feel a disposition to revenge himself by impudence  but while john was not impudent either he had a footmans feeling towards those whom he fancied no better than himself he had set the table with his customary neatness and method and he served the soup with as much regularity as he would have done had we sat there in our proper characters but then he withdrew he probably remembered that the landlord or upper servant of an english hotel is apt to make his appearance with the soup and to disappear as that disappears so it was with john after removing the soup he put a dumbwaiter near my uncle touched a carvingknife or two as much as to say help yourselves and quitted the room as a matter of course our dinner was not a very elaborate one it wanting two or three hours to the regular time of dining though my grandmother had ordered in my hearing one or two delicacies to be placed on the table that had surprised patt among the extraordinary things for such guests was wine the singularity however was a little explained by the quality commanded which was rhenish  my uncle ro was a little surprised at the disappearance of john for seated in that room he was so accustomed to his face that it appeared as if he were not half at home without him  let the fellow go he said withdrawing his hand from the bellcord which he had already touched to order him back again we can talk more freely without him well hugh here you are under your own roof eating a charitable dinner and treated as hospitably as if you did not own all you can see for a circle of five miles around you it was a lucky idea of the old ladys by the way to think of ordering this rudesheimer in our character of dutchmen how amazingly well she is looking boy  indeed she is and i am delighted to see it i do not know why my grandmother may not live these twenty years for even that would not make her near as old as sus who i have often heard her say was a middleaged man when she was born  true she seems like an elder sister to me rather than as a mother and is altogether a most delightful old woman but if we had so charming an old woman to receive us so are there also some very charming young womenhey hugh  i am quite of your way of thinking sir and must say i have not in many a day seen two as charming creatures as i have met with here  twoumph a body would think one might suffice pray which may be the two master padishah  patt and mary warren of course the other two are well enough but these two are excellent  my uncle ro looked grum but he said nothing for some time eating is always an excuse for a broken conversation and he ate away as if resolute not to betray his disappointment but it is a hard matter for a gentleman to do nothing but eat at table and so was obliged to talk  everything looks well here after all hugh observed my uncle these antirenters may have done an infinite deal of harm in the way of abusing principles but they do not seem to have yet destroyed any material things  it is not their cue sir the crops are their own and as they hope to own the farms it would be scarcely wise to injure what no doubt they begin to look on as their own property too as for the nest house grounds farm c i dare say they will be very willing to leave me them for a while longer provided they can get everything else away from me  for a time longer at least though that is the folly of those who expect to get along by concessions as if men were ever satisfied with the yielding of a part when they ask that which is wrong in itself without sooner or later expecting to get the whole as well might one expect the pickpocket who had abstracted a dollar to put back twoandsixpence change but things really look well around the place  so much the better for us though to my judgment and taste miss mary warren looks better than anything else i have yet seen in america  another umph expressed my uncles dissatisfactiondispleasure would be too strong a wordand he continued eating  you have really some good rhenish in your cellar hugh resumed uncle ro after tossing off one of the knowing green glasses fullthough i never could understand why any man should wish to drink his wine out of green when he might do it out of crystal it must have been a purchase of mine made when we were last in germany and for the use of my mother  as you please sir it neither adds nor subtracts from the beauty of martha and her friend  since you are disposed to make these boyish allusions be frank with me and say at once how you like my wards  meaning of course sir my own sister exclusively i will be as sincere as possible and say that as to miss marston i have no opinion at all and as to miss coldbrook she is what in europe would be called a fine woman  you can say nothing as to her mind hugh for you have had no opportunity for forming an opinion  not much of a one i will own nevertheless i should have liked her better had she spared the allusion to the proper person who is one day to forge a chain for my sister to begin with  poh poh that is the mere squeamishness of a boy i do not think her in the least pert or forward and your construction would be tant soit peu vulgar  put your own construction on it mon oncle i do not like it  i do not wonder young men remain unmarried they are getting to be so ultra in their tastes and notions  a stranger might have retorted on an old bachelor for such a speech by some allusion to his own example but i well knew that my uncle ro had once been engaged and that he lost the object of his passion by death and too much respected his constancy and true sentiments ever to joke on such subjects i believe he felt the delicacy of my forbearance rather more than common for he immediately manifested a disposition to relent and to prove it by changing the subject  we can never stay here tonight he said it would be at once to proclaim our namesour name i might saya name that was once so honoured and beloved in this town and which is now so hated  no no not as bad as that we have done nothing to merit hatred  raison de plus for hating us so much the more heartily when men are wronged who have done nothing to deserve it the evildoer seeks to justify his wickedness to himself by striving all he can to calumniate the injured party and the more difficulty he finds in doing that to his mind the more profound is his hatred rely on it we are most sincerely disliked here on the spot where we were once both much beloved such is human nature  at that moment john returned to the room to see how we were getting on and to count his forks and spoons for i saw the fellow actually doing it my uncle somewhat indiscreetly i fancied but by merely following the chain of thought then uppermost in his mind detained him in conversation  dis broperty he said inquiringly is de broperty of one yeneral littlepage i hears say  not of the general who was madam littlepages husband and who has long been dead but of his grandson mr hugh  und vhere might he be dis mr hughmight he be at hand or might he not  no hes in europe that is to say in hengland john thought england covered most of europe though he had long gotten over his wish to return mr hugh and mr roger be both habsent from the country just now  dat ist unfortunate for dey dells me dere might be moch troobles here abouts and injinacting  there is indeed and a wicked thing it is that there should be anything of the sort  und vhat might be der reason of so moch trooblesand vhere ist der blame  well that is pretty plain i fancy returned john who in consequence of being a favoured servant at headquarters fancied himself a sort of cabinet minister and had much pleasure in letting his knowledge be seen the tenants on this estate wants to be landlords and as they cant be so so long as mr hugh lives and wont let em why they just tries all sorts of schemes and plans to frighten people out of their property i never go down to the village but i has a talk with some of them and that in a way that might do them some good if anything can  und vhat dost you sayund vid whom dost you talk as might do dem moch goot  why you see i talks more with one squire newcome as they calls him though hes no more of a real squire than you beonly a sort of an attorney like such as they has in this country you come from the old countries i believe  ja jadat ist yeswe comes from charmany so you can say vhat you bleases  they has queer squires in this part of the world if truth must be said but thats neither here nor there though i give this mr seneca newcome as good as he sends what is it you wants i says to himyou cant all be landlordssomebody must be tenants and if you didnt want to be tenants how come you to be so land is plenty in this country and cheap too and why didnt you buy your land at first instead of coming to rent of mr hugh and now when you have rented to be quarrelling about the very thing you did of your own accord  dere you didst dell em a goot ting and vhat might der squire say to dat  oh he was quite dumbfounded at first then he said that in old times when people first rented these lands they didnt know as much as they do now or they never would have done it  und you could answer dat or vast it your durn to be dumfounded  i pitched it into him as they says i did says i hows this says iyou are for ever boasting how much you americans knowand how the people knows everything that ought to be done about politics and religionand you proclaim far and near that your yeomen are the salt of the earthand yet you dont know how to bargain for your leases a pretty sort of wisdom is this says i i had him there for the people round about here is only too sharp at a trade  did he own dat you vast right and dat he vast wrong dis herr squire newcome  not he he will never own anything that makes against his own doctrine unless he does it ignorantly but i havent told you half of it i told him says i how is it you talk of one of the littlepage family cheating you when as you knows yourselves you had rather have the word of one of that family than have each others bonds says i you know sir it must be a poor landlord that a tenant cant and wont take his word and this they all know to be true for a gentleman as has a fine estate is raised above temptation like and has a pride in him to do what is honourable and fair and in my opinion it is good to have a few such people in a country if it be only to keep the wicked one from getting it altogether in his own keeping  und did you say dat moch to der squire  no that i just says to you two seeing that we are here talking together in a friendly way but a man neednt be ashamed to say it anywhere for its a religious truth but i says to him newcome says i you who has been living so long on the property of the littlepages ought to be ashamed to wish to strip them of it but youre not satisfied with keeping gentlemen down quite as much out of sight as you can by holding all the offices yourselves and taking all the money of the public you can lay your hands on for your own use but you wants to trample them under your feet i says and so take your revenge for being what you be says i  vell my friend said my uncle you vast a bolt man to dell all dis to der beoples of dis coontry vhere i have heard a man may say just vhat he hast a mind to say so dat he dost not sbeak too moch trut  thats itthats it you have been a quick scholar i find i told this mr newcome says i youre bold enough in railing at kings and nobles for you very well know says i that they are three thousand miles away from you and can do you no harm but you would no more dare get up before your masters the people here and say what you really think about em and what i have heard you say of them in private than you would dare put your head before a cannon as the gunner touched it off oh i gave him a lesson you may be sure  although there was a good deal of the english footman in johns logic and feeling there was also a good deal of truth in what he said the part where he accused newcome of holding one set of opinions in private concerning his masters and another in public is true to the life there is not at this moment within the wide reach of the american borders one demagogue to be found who might not with justice be accused of precisely the same deception there is not one demagogue in the whole country who if he lived in a monarchy would not be the humblest advocate of men in power ready to kneel at the feet of those who stood in the sovereigns presence there is not at this instant a man in power among us a senator or a legislator who is now the seeming advocate of what he wishes to call the rights of the tenants and who is for overlooking principles and destroying law and right in order to pacify the antirenters by extraordinary concessions that would not be among the foremost under a monarchial system to recommend and support the freest application of the sword and the bayonet to suppress what would then be viewed ay and be termed the rapacious longings of the disaffected to enjoy the property of others without paying for it all this is certain for it depends on a law of morals that is infallible any one who wishes to obtain a clear index to the true characters of the public men he is required to support or oppose has now the opportunity for each stands before a mirror that reflects him in his just proportions and in which the dullest eye has only to cast a glance in order to view him from head to foot  the entrance of my grandmother put a stop to johns discourse he was sent out of the room on a message and then i learned the object of this visit my sister had been let into the secret of our true characters and was dying to embrace me my dear grandmother rightly enough had decided it would be to the last degree unkind to keep her in ignorance of our presence and the fact known nature had longings which must be appeased i had myself been tempted twenty times that morning to snatch patt to my heart and kiss her as i used to do just after my beard began to grow and she was so much of a child as to complain the principal thing to be arranged then was to obtain an interview for me without awakening suspicion in the observers my grandmothers plan was arranged however and she now communicated it to us  there was a neat little dressingroom annexed to marthas bedroom in that the meeting was to take place  she and mary warren are now there waiting for your appearance hugh  mary warrendoes she then know who i am  not in the least she has no other idea than that you are a young german of good connections and well educated who has been driven from his own country by political troubles and who is reduced to turn his musical taste and acquisitions to account in the way you seem to do until he can find some better employment all this she had told us before we met you and you are not to be vain hugh if i add that your supposed misfortunes and great skill with the flute and good behaviour have made a friend of one of the best and most truehearted girls i ever had the good fortune to know i say good behaviour for little just now can be ascribed to good looks  i hope i am not in the least revolting in appearance in this disguise for my sisters sake  the hearty laugh of my dear old grandmother brought me up and i said no more colouring i believe a little at my own folly even uncle ro joined in the mirth though i could see he wished mary warren even safely translated along with her father and that the latter was archbishop of canterbury i must acknowledge that i felt a good deal ashamed of the weakness i had betrayed  you are very well hugh darling continued my grandmother though i must think you would be more interesting in your own hair which is curling than in that lank wig still one can see enough of your face to recognise it if one has the clue and i told martha at the first that i was struck with a certain expression of the eyes and smile that reminded me of her brother but there they are mary and martha in the drawingroom waiting for your appearance the first is so fond of music and indeed is so practised in it as to have been delighted with your flute and she has talked so much of your skill as to justify us in seeming to wish for a further exhibition of your skill henrietta and ann having less taste that way have gone together to select bouquets in the greenhouse and there is now an excellent opportunity to gratify your sister i am to draw mary out of the room after a little while when you and martha may say a word to each other in your proper characters as for you roger you are to open your box again and i will answer for it that will serve to amuse your other wards should they return too soon from their visit to the gardener  everything being thus explained and our dinner ended all parties proceeded to the execution of the plan each in his or her designated mode when my grandmother and i reached the dressingroom however martha was not there though mary warren was her bright but serene eyes full of happiness and expectation martha had retired to the inner room for a moment whither my grandmother suspecting the truth followed her as i afterwards ascertained my sister fearful of not being able to suppress her tears on my entrance had withdrawn in order to struggle for selfcommand without betraying our secret i was told to commence an air without waiting for the absent young lady as the strain could easily be heard through the open door  i might have played ten minutes before my sister and grandmother came out again both had been in tears though the intense manner in which mary warren was occupied with the harmony of my flute probably prevented her from observing it to me however it was plain enough and glad was i to find that my sister had succeeded in commanding her feelings in a minute or two my grandmother profited by a pause to rise and carry away with her mary warren though the last left the room with a reluctance that was very manifest the pretence was a promise to meet the divine in the library on some business connected with the sundayschools  you can keep the young man for another air martha observed my grandmother and i will send jane to you as i pass her room  jane was my sisters own maid and her room was close at hand and i dare say dear grandmother gave her the order in mary warrens presence as soon as she quitted the room else might mary warren well be surprised at the singularity of the whole procedure but jane did not make her appearance nevertheless as for myself i continued to play as long as i thought any ear was near enough to hear me then i laid aside my flute in the next instant patt was in my arms where she lay some time weeping but looking inexpressibly happy  oh hugh what a disguise was this to visit your own house in she said as soon as composed enough to speak  would it have done to come here otherwise you know the state of the country and the precious fruits our boasted tree of liberty is bringing forth the owner of the land can only visit his property at the risk of his life  martha pressed me in her arms in a way to show how conscious she was of the danger i incurred in even thus visiting her after which we seated ourselves side by side on a little divan and began to speak of those things that were most natural to a brother and sister who so much loved each other and who had not met for five years my grandmother had managed so well as to prevent all interruption for an hour if we saw fit to remain together while to others it should seem as if patt had dismissed me in a few minutes  not one of the other girls suspect in the least who you are said martha smiling when we had got through with the questions and answers so natural to our situation i am surprised that henrietta has not for she prides herself on her penetration she is as much in the dark as the others however  and miss mary warrenthe young lady who has just left the roomhas she not some small notion that i am not a common dutch musicgrinder  patt laughed and that so merrily as to cause the tones of her sweet voice to fill me with delight as i remembered what she had been in childhood and girlhood five years before and she shook her bright tresses off her cheeks ere she would answer  no hugh she replied she fancies you an uncommon dutch musicgrinder an artiste that not only grinds but who dresses up his harmonies in such a way as to be palatable to the most refined taste how came mary to think you and my uncle two reduced german gentlemen  and does the dear girl believethat is does miss mary warren do us so much honour as to imagine that  indeed she does for she told us as much as soon as she got home and henrietta and ann have made themselves very merry with their speculations on the subject of miss warrens great incognito they call you herzog von geige  thank them for that i am afraid i answered a little too pointedly for i saw that patt seemed surprised but your american towns are just such halfway things as to spoil young women making them neither refined and polished as they might be in real capitals while they are not left the simplicity and nature of the country  well master hugh this is being very cross about a very little and not particularly complimentary to your own sister and why not your american towns as well as oursare you no longer one of us  certainly one of yours always my dearest patt though not one of every chattering girl who may set up for a belle with her dukes of fiddle but enough of thisyou like the warrens  very much so father and daughter the first is just what a clergyman should be of a cultivation and intelligence to fit him to be any mans companion and a simplicity like that of a child you remember his predecessorso dissatisfied so selfish so lazy so censorious so unjust to every person and thing around him and yet so exacting and at the same time so  what thus far you have drawn his character well i should like to hear the remainder  i have said more than i ought already for one has an idea that by bringing a clergyman into disrepute it brings religion and the church into discredit too a priest must be a very bad man to have injurious things said of him in this country hugh  that is perhaps true but you like mr warren better than him who has left you  a thousand times and in all things in addition to having a most pious and sincere pastor we have an agreeable and wellbred neighbour from whose mouth in the five years that he has dwelt here i have not heard a syllable at the expense of a single fellowcreature you know how it is apt to be with the other clergy and ours in the countryfor ever at swords points and if not actually quarrelling keeping up a hollow peace  that is only too trueor used to be true before i went abroad  and it is so now elsewhere ill answer for it though it be so no longer here mr warren and mr peck seem to live on perfectly amicable terms though as little alike at bottom as fire and water  by the way how do the clergy of the different sects up and down the country behave on the subject of antirent  i can answer only from what i hear with the exception of mr warrens course he has preached two or three plain and severe sermons on the duty of honesty in our worldly transactions one of which was from the tenth commandment of course he said nothing of the particular trouble but everybody must have made the necessary application of the hometruths he uttered i question if another voice has been raised far and near on the subject although i have heard mr warren say the movement threatens more to demoralize new york than anything that has happened in his time  and the man down at the village  oh he goes of course with the majority when was one of that set ever known to oppose his parish in anything  and mary is as sound and as highprincipled as her father  quite so though there has been a good deal said about the necessity of mr warrens removing and giving up st andrews since he preached against covetousness all the antirenters say i hear that they know he meant them and that they wont put up with it  i dare say each one fancying he was almost called out by name that is the way when conscience works  i should be very very sorry to part with mary and almost as much so to part with her father there is one thing however that mr warren himself thinks we had better have done hugh and that is to take down the canopy from over our pew you can have no notion of the noise that foolish canopy is making up and down the country  i shall not take it down it is my property and there it shall remain as for the canopy it was a wrong distinction to place in a church i am willing to allow but it never gave offence until it has been thought that a cry against it would help to rob me of my lands at half price or at no price at all as it may happen  all that may be true but if improper for a church why keep it  because i do not choose to be bullied out of what is my own even though i care nothing about it there might have been a time when the canopy was unsuited to the house of god and that was when those who saw it might fancy it canopied the head of a fellowcreature who had higher claims than themselves to divine favour but in times like these when men estimate merit by beginning at the other end of the social scale there is little danger of any ones falling into the mistake the canopy shall stand little as i care about it now i would actually prefer it should come down as i can fully see the impropriety of making any distinctions in the temple but it shall stand until concessions cease to be dangerous it is a right of property and as such i will maintain it if others dislike it let them put canopies over their pews too the best test in such a matter is to see who could bear it a pretty figure seneca newcome would cut for instance seated in a canopied pew even his own set would laugh at him which i fancy is more than they yet do at me  martha was disappointed but she changed the subject we next talked of our own little private affairs as they were connected with smaller matters  for whom is that beautiful chain intended hugh asked patt laughingly i can now believe the pedlar when he says it is reserved for your future wife but who is that wife to be will her name be henrietta or ann  why not ask also if it will be marywhy exclude one of your companions while you include the other two  patt startedseemed surprised her cheeks flushed and then i saw that pleasure was the feeling predominant  am i too late to secure that jewel as a pendant to my chain i asked half in jest half seriously  too soon at least to attract it by the richness and beauty of the bauble a more natural and disinterested girl than mary warren does not exist in the country  be frank with me martha and say at once has she a favoured suitor  why this seems really serious exclaimed my sister laughing but to put you out of your pain i will answer i know of but one one she has certainly or female sagacity is at fault  but is he one that is favoured you can never know how much depends on your answer  of that you can judge for yourself it is squire seneky newcome as he is called hereaboutsthe brother of the charming opportunity who still reserves herself for you  and they are as rank antirenters as any male and female in the country  they are rank newcomites and that means that each is for himself would you believe it but opportunity really gives herself airs with mary warren  and how does mary warren take such an assumption  as a young person shouldquietly and without manifesting any feeling but there is something quite intolerable in one like opportunity newcomes assuming a superiority over any true lady mary is as well educated and as well connected as any of us and is quite as much accustomed to good company while opportunity here patt laughed and then added hurriedly but you know opportunity as well as i do  oh yes she is la vertue or the virtue and je suis venue pour  the latter allusion patt understood well enough having laughed over the story a dozen times and she laughed again when i explained the affair of the solitude  then came a fit of sisterly feeling patt insisted on taking off my wig and seeing my face in its natural dress i consented to gratify her when the girl really behaved like a simpleton first she pushed about my curls until they were arranged to suit the silly creature when she ran back several steps clapped her hands in delight then rushed into my arms and kissed my forehead and eyes and called me her brotherher only brotherher dear dear hugh and by a number of other such epithets until she worked herself and me too into such an excess of feeling that we sat down side by side and each had a hearty fit of crying perhaps some such burst as this was necessary to relieve our minds and we submitted to it wisely  my sister wept the longest as a matter of course but as soon as she had dried her eyes she replaced the wig and completely restored my disguise trembling the whole time lest some one might enter and detect me  you have been very imprudent hugh in coming here at all she said while thus busy you can form no notion of the miserable state of the country or how far the antirent poison has extended or the malignant nature of its feeling the annoyances they have attempted with dear grandmother are odious you they would scarcely leave alive  the country and the people must have strangely altered then in five years our new york population has hitherto had very little of the assassinlike character tar and feathers are the blackguards and have been the petty tyrants weapons from time immemorial in this country but not the knife  and can anything sooner or more effectually alter a people than longings for the property of others is not the love of money the root of all eviland what right have we to suppose our ravensnest population is better than another when that sordid feeling is thoroughly aroused you know you have written me yourself that all the american can or does live for is money  i have written you dear that the country in its present condition leaves no other incentive to exertion and therein it is cursed military fame military rank even are unattainable under our system the arts letters and science bring little or no reward and there being no political rank that a man of refinement would care for men must live for money or live altogether for another state of being but i have told you at the same time martha that notwithstanding all this i believe the american a less mercenary being in the ordinary sense of the word than the european that two men might be bought for instance in any european country for one here this last i suppose to be the result of the facility of making a living and the habits it produces  never mind causes mr warren says there is a desperate intention to rob existing among these people and that they are dangerous as yet they do a little respect women but how long they will do that one cannot know  it may all be so it must be so respecting what i have heard and read yet this vale looks as smiling and as sweet at this very moment as if an evil passion never sullied it but depend on my prudence which tells me that we ought now to part i shall see you again and again before i quit the estate and you will of course join us somewhereat the springs perhapsas soon as we find it necessary or expedient to decamp  martha promised this of course and i kissed her previously to separating no one crossed my way as i descended to the piazza which was easily done since i was literally at home i lounged about on the lawn a few minutes and then showing myself in front of the library windows i was summoned to the room as i had expected  uncle ro had disposed of every article of the fine jewelry that he had brought home as presents for his wards the pay was a matter to be arranged with mrs littlepage which meant no pay at all and as the donor afterwards told me he liked this mode of distributing the various ornaments better than presenting them himself as he was now certain each girl had consulted her own fancy  as the hour of the regular dinner was approaching we took our leave soon after not without receiving kind and pressing invitations to visit the nest again ere we left the township of course we promised all that was required intending most faithfully to comply on quitting the house we returned towards the farm though not without pausing on the lawn to gaze around us on a scene so dear to both from recollection association and interest but i forget this is aristocratical the landlord has no right to sentiments of this nature which are feelings that the sublimated liberty of the law is beginning to hold in reserve solely for the benefit of the tenant     chapter xii      there shall be in england seven halfpenny loaves sold for a     penny the threehooped pot shall have ten hoops and i will make     it felony to drink small beer all the realm shall be in common and     in cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass      jack cade   i do not see sir i remarked as we moved on from the last of these pauses why the governors and legislators and writers on this subject of antirentism talk so much of feudality and chickens and days works and durable leases when we have none of these while we have all the disaffection they are said to produce  you will understand that better as you come to know more of men no party alludes to its weak points it is just as you say but the proceedings of your tenants for instance give the lie to the theories of the philanthropists and must be kept in the background it is true that the disaffection has not yet extended to onehalf or to onefourth of the leased estates in the country perhaps not to onetenth if you take the number of the landlords as the standard instead of the extent of their possessions but it certainly will should the authorities tamper with the rebels much longer  if they tax the incomes of the landlords under the durable rent system why would not the parties aggrieved have the same right to take up arms to resist such an act of oppression as our fathers had in 1776  their cause would be better for that was only a constructive right and one dependent on general principles whereas this is an attempt at a most mean evasion of a written law the meanness of the attempt being quite as culpable as its fraud every human being knows that such a tax so far as it has any object beyond that of an electionsop is to choke off the landlords from the maintenance of their covenants which is a thing that no state can do directly without running the risk of having its law pronounced unconstitutional by the courts of the united states if indeed not by its own courts  the court of errors think you  the court of errors is doomed by its own abuses catiline never abused the patience of rome more than that mongrel assembly has abused the patience of every sound lawyer in the state fiat justitia ruat coelum is interpreted now into let justice be done and the court fall no one wishes to see it continued and the approaching convention will send it to the capulets if it do nothing else to be commended it was a pitiful imitation of the house of lords system with this striking difference the english lords are men of education and men with a vast deal at stake and their knowledge and interests teach them to leave the settlement of appeals to the legal men of their body of whom there are always a respectable number in addition to those in possession of the woolsack and the bench whereas our senate is a court composed of small lawyers country doctors merchants farmers with occasionally a man of really liberal attainments under the direction of an acute and honest judge as most of our true judges actually are the court of errors would hardly form such a jury as would allow a creditable person to be tried by his peers in a case affecting character for instance and here we have it set up as a court of the last resort to settle points of law  i see it has just made a decision in a libel suit at which the profession sneers  it has indeed now look at that very decision for instance as the measure of its knowledge an editor of a newspaper holds up a literary man to the world as one anxious to obtain a small sum of money in order to put it into wall street for shaving purposes now the only material question raised was the true signification of the word shaving if to say a man is a shaver in the sense in which it is applied to the use of money be bringing him into discredit then was the plaintiffs declaration sufficient if not it was insufficient being wanting in what is called an innuendo the dictionaries and men in general understand by shaving extortion and nothing else to call a man a shaver is to say he is an extortioner without going into details but in wall street and among moneydealers certain transactions that in their eyes and by the courts are not deemed discreditable have of late been brought within the category of shaving thus it is technically or by convention among bankers termed shaving if a man buy a note at less than its face which is a legal transaction on the strength of this last circumstance as is set forth in the published opinions the highest court of appeals in new york has decided that it does not bring a man into discredit to say he is a shaverthus making a conventional signification of the brokers of wall street higher authority for the use of the english tongue than the standard lexicographers and all the rest of those who use the language on the same principle if a set of pickpockets at the five points should choose to mystify their trade a little by including the term to filch the literal borrowing of a pockethandkerchief it would not be a libel to accuse a citizen of filching his neighbors handkerchief  but the libel was uttered to the world and not to the brokers of wall street only who might possibly understand their own terms  very true and was uttered in a newspaper that carried the falsehood to europe for the writer of the charge when brought up for it publicly admitted that he had no ground for suspecting the literary man of any such practices he called it a joke every line of the context however showed it was a malicious charge the decision is very much as if a man who is sued for accusing another of stealing should set up a defense that he meant stealing hearts for the word is sometimes used in that sense when men use epithets that convey discredit in their general meaning it is their business to give them a special signification in their own contexts if such be their real intention but i much question if there be a respectable moneydealer even in wall street who would not swear if called on in a court of justice so to do that he thought the general charge of shaving discreditable to any man  and you think the landlords whose rents were taxed sir would have a moral right to resist  beyond all question as it would be an income tax on them only of all in the country what is more i am fully persuaded that two thousand men embodied to resist such tyranny would look down the whole available authority of the state inasmuch as i do not believe citizens could be found to take up arms to enforce a law so flagrantly unjust men will look on passively and see wrongs inflicted that would never come out to support them by their own acts but we are approaching the farm and there is tom miller and his hired men waiting our arrival  it is unnecessary to repeat in detail all that passed in this our second visit to the farmhouse miller received us in a friendly manner and offered us a bed if we would pass the night with him this business of a bed had given us more difficulty than anything else in the course of our peregrinations new york has long got over the twoman and threeman bed system as regards its best inns at no respectable new york inn is a gentleman now asked to share even his room without an apology and a special necessity with another much less his bed but the rule does not hold good as respects pedlars and musicgrinders we had ascertained that we were not only expected to share the same bed but to occupy that bed in a room filled with other beds there are certain things that get to be second nature and that no masquerading will cause to go down and among others one gets to dislike sharing his room and his toothbrush this little difficulty gave us more trouble that night at tom millers than anything we had yet encountered at the taverns bribes had answered our purpose but this would not do so well at a farm residence at length the matter was got along with by putting me in the garret where i was favoured with a straw bed under my own roof the decent mrs miller making many apologies for not having a feathersmotherer in which to squash me i did not tell the good woman that i never used feathers summer or winter for had i done so she would have set me down as a poor creature from oppressed germany where the folks did not know how to live nor would she have been so much out of the way quoad the beds for in all my journeyings i never met with such uncomfortable sleeping as one finds in germany off the rhine and out of the large towns3  while the negotiation was in progress i observed that josh brigham as the antirent disposed hireling of millers was called kept a watchful eye and an open ear on what was done and said of all men on earth the american of that class is the most distrustful as he calls it himself and has his suspicions the soonest awakened the indian on the warpaththe sentinel who is posted in a fog near his enemy an hour before the dawn of daythe husband that is jealous or the priest that has become a partisan is not a whit more apt to fancy conjecture or assert than the american of that class who has become distrustful this fellow brigham was the very beau idéal of the suspicious school being envious and malignant as well as shrewd observant and covetous the very fact that he was connected with the injins as turned out to be the case added to his natural propensities the consciousness of guilt and rendered him doubly dangerous the whole time my uncle and myself were crossing over and figuring in in order to procure for each a room though it were only a closet his watchful distrustful looks denoted how much he saw in our movements to awaken curiosity if not downright suspicion when all was over he followed me to the little lawn in front of the house whither i had gone to look at the familiar scene by the light of the setting sun and began to betray the nature of his own suspicions by his language  the old man meaning my uncle ro must have plenty of gold watches about him he said to be so plaguy particlar consarnin his bed pedlin sich matters is a ticklish trade i guess in some parts  ja it ist dangerous somevhere but it might not be so in dis goot coontry  why did the old fellow then try so hard to get that little room all to himself and shove you off into the garret we hired men dont like the garret which is a hot place in summer  in charmany one man hast ever one bed i answered anxious to get rid of the subject  i bounced a little as one has onehalf of a bed would be nearer to the truth though the other half might be in another room  oh thats it ist waal every country has its ways i spose jarmany is a despate aristocratic land i take it  ja dere ist moch of de old feudal law and feudal coostum still remaining in charmany  landlords a plenty i guess if the truth was known leases as long as my arm i calkerlate  vell dey do dink in charmany dat de longer might be de lease de better it might be for de denant  as that was purely a german sentiment or at least not an american sentiment according to the notions broached by statesmen among ourselves i made it as dutch as possible by garnishing it well with ds  thats a droll idee now we think here that a lease is a bad thing and the less you have of a bad thing the better  vell dat ist queer so queer ast i dont know vhat vill dey do as might help it  oh the legislature will set it all right they mean to pass a law to prevent any more leases at all  und vill de beople stand dat dis ist a free coontry effery body dells me and vilt der beoples agree not to hire lands if dey vants to  oh you see we wish to choke the landlords off from their present leases and by and bye when that is done the law can let up again  but ist dat right der law should be joost and not hold down and let oop as you calls it  you dont understand us yet i see why thats the prettiest and the neatest legislation on airth thats just what the bankrupt law did  vhat did der bankroopt law do bray vhat might you mean nowi dont know  do why it did wonders for some on us i can tell you it paid our debts and let us up when we was down and thats no trifle i can tell you i took the benefit as it is called myself  youyou might take der benefit of a bankroopt law you lifing here ast a hiret man on dis farm  sartain why not all a man wanted under that law was about 60 to carry him through the mill and if he could rake and scrape that much together he might wipe off as long a score as he pleased i had been dealin in speckylation and thats a make or break business i can tell you well i got to be about 42322 wuss than nothin but having about 90 in hand i went through the mill without getting cogged the smallest morsel a man doos a good business to my notion when he can make 20 cents pay a whull dollar of debt  und you did dat goot business  you may say that and now i means to make antirentism get me a farm cheapwhat i call cheap and that ant none of your 30 or 40 an acre i can tell you  it was quite clear that mr joshua brigham regarded these transactions as so many pragmatic sanctions that were to clear the moral and legal atmospheres of any atoms of difficulty that might exist in the forms of old opinions to his getting easily out of debt in the one case and suddenly rich in the other i dare say i looked bewildered but i certainly felt so at thus finding myself face to face with a low knave who had a deliberate intention as i now found to rob me of a farm it is certain that joshua so imagined for inviting me to walk down the road with him a short distance he endeavoured to clear up any moral difficulties that might beset me by pursuing the subject  you see resumed joshua i will tell you how it is these littlepages have had this land long enough and its time to give poor folks a chance the young spark that pretends to own all the farms you see far and near never did any thing for em in his life only to be his fathers son now to my notion a man should do suthin for his land and not be obligated for it to mere natur this is a free country and what right has one man to land more than another  or do his shirt or do his dobacco or do his coat or do anyding else  well i dont go as far as that a man has a right to his clothes and maybe to a horse or a cow but he has no right to all the land in creation the law gives a right to a cow as agin execution  und doesnt der law gif a right to der landt too you most not depend on der law if you might succeed  we like to get as much law as we can on our side americans like law now youll read in all the booksour books i mean them thats printed herethat the americans be the most lawful people on airth and that theyll do more for the law than any other folks known  vell dat isnt vhat dey says of der americans in europe nein nein dey might not say dat  why dont you think it is so dont you think this the greatest country on airth and the most lawful  vell i donts know das coontry ist das coontry and it ist vhat it ist you might see  yes i thought you would be of my way of thinking when we got to understand each other nothing is easier than to mislead an american on the estimate foreigners place on them in this respect they are the most deluded people living though in other matters certainly among the shrewdest thats the way with acquaintances at first they dont always understand one another and then you talk a little thick like but now friend ill come to the pintbut first swear youll not betray me  ja jai oonderstandst i most schwear i wont bedray you das ist goot  but hold up your hand stop of what religion be you  gristian to be sure i might not be a chew nein nein i am a ferry bat gristian  we are all bad enough for that matter but i lay no stress on that a little of the devil in a man helps him along in this business of ourn but you must be suthin more than a christian i spose as we dont call that bein of any religion at all in this country of what supportin religion be you  soobortin vell i might not oonderstands dat vhat ist soobortin religion coomes dat vrom melanchton and lutheror coomes it vrom der pope vhat ist dat soobortin religion  why what religion do you patronize do you patronize the standin order or the kneelin orderor do you patronize neither some folks thinks its best to lie down at prayer as the least likely to divert the thoughts  i might not oonderstand but nefer mindt der religion and coome to der pint dat you mentioned  well that pint is this youre a jarman and cant like aristocrats and so ill trust you though if you do betray me youll never play on another bit of music in this country or any other if you want to be an injin as good an opportunity will offer tomorrow as ever fell in a mans way  an injin vhat goot vill it do to be an injin i dought it might be better to be a vhite man in america  oh i mean only an antirent injin weve got matters so nicely fixed now that a chap can be an injin without any paint at all or any washin or scrubbin but can convart himself into himself agin at any time in two minutes the wages is good and the work light then we have rare chances in the stores and round about among the farms the law is that an injin must have what he wants and no grumblin and we take care to want enough if youll be at the meetin ill tell you how youll know me  ja jadat ist goot i vill be at der meetin sartainly vhere might it be  down at the village the word came up this aternoon and we shall all be on the ground by ten oclock  vilt der be a fight dat you meet so bunctually and wid so moch spirit  fight lord no who is there to fight i should like to know we are pretty much all agin the littlepages and theres none of them on the ground but two or three women ill tell you how its all settled the meetin is called on the deliberative and libertysupportin plan i spose you know weve all sorts of meetins in this country  nein i dought dere might be meetins for bolitics vhen der beople might coome but i dont know vhat else  ist possible what have you no indignation meetins in jarmany we count a great deal on our indignation meetins and both sides haveem in abundance when things get to be warm our meetin tomorrow is for deliberation and libertyprinciples generally we may pass some indignation resolutions about aristocrats for nobody can bear them critturs in this part of the country i can tell you  lest this manuscript should get into the hands of some of those who do not understand the real condition of new york society it may be well to explain that aristocrat means in the parlance of the country no other than a man of gentlemanlike tastes habits opinions and associations there are gradations among the aristocracy of the state as well as among other men thus he who is an aristocrat in a hamlet would be very democratic in a village and he of the village might be no aristocrat in the town at all though in the towns generally indeed always when their population has the least of a town character the distinction ceases altogether men quietly dropping into the traces of civilized society and talking or thinking very little about it to see the crying evils of american aristocracy then one must go into the country there indeed a plenty of cases exist thus if there happen to be a man whose property is assessed at twentyfive per cent above that of all his neighbourswho must have right on his side bright as a cloudless sun to get a verdict if obliged to appeal to the lawswho pays fifty per cent more for everything he buys and receives fifty per cent less for everything he sells than any other person near himwho is surrounded by rancorous enemies in the midst of a seeming state of peacewho has everything he says and does perverted and added to and lied aboutwho is traduced because his dinnerhour is later than that of other folkswho dont stoop but is straight in the backwho presumes to doubt that this country in general and his own township in particular is the focus of civilizationwho hesitates about signing his name to any flagrant instance of ignorance bad taste or worse morals that his neighbours may get up in the shape of a petition remonstrance or resolutiondepend on it that man is a prodigious aristocrat and one who for his many offences and manner of lording it over mankind deserves to be banished i ask the readers pardon for so abruptly breaking in upon joshuas speech but such very different notions exist about aristocrats in different parts of the world that some such explanation was necessary in order to prevent mistakes i have forgotten one mark of the tribe that is perhaps more material than all the rest which must not be omitted and is thisif he happen to be a man who prefers his own pursuits to public life and is regardless of popularity he is just guilty of the unpardonable sin the people will forgive anything sooner than this though there are folks who fancy it as infallible a sign of an aristocrat not to chew tobacco but unless i return to joshua the reader will complain that i cause him to stand still  no no continued mr brigham anything but an aristocrat for me i hate the very name of the sarpents and wish there warnt one in the land tomorrow we are to have a great antirent lecturer out  a vhat  a lecturer one that lecturs you understand on antirentism temperance aristocracy government or any other grievance that may happen to be uppermost have you no lecturers in jarmany  ja ja dere ist lecturers in das universitiesblenty of dem  well we have em universal and particlar as we happen to want em tomorrow were to have one they tell me the smartest man that has appeared in the cause he goes it strong and the injins mean to back him up with all sorts of shrieks and whoopins your hurdygurdy there makes no sort of music to what our tribe can make when we fairly open our throats  vell dis ist queer i vast told dat der americans vast all philosophers und dat all dey didt vast didt in a toughtful and sober manner und now you dells me dey screams deir arguments like injins  that we do i wish youd been here in the hardcider and logcabin times and youd a seen reason and philosophy as you call it i was a whig that summer though i went democrat last season theres about five hundred on us in this county that make the most of things i can tell you whats the use of a vote if a body gets nothin by it but tomorrow youll see the business done up and matters detarmined for this part of the world in fine style we know what were about and we mean to carry things through quite to the end  und vhat do you means to do  well seein that you seem to be of the right sort and be so likely to put on the injin shirt ill tell you all about it we mean to get good and old farms at favourable rates thats what we mean to do the peoples up and in arnest and what the people want theyll have this time they want farms and farms they must have whats the use of havin a government of the people if the peoples obliged to want farms weve begun agin the renssalaers and the durables and the quartersales and the chickens but we dont by no manner of means think of eending there what should we get by that a man wants to get suthin when he puts his foot into a matter of this natur we know whos our frinds and whos our inimies could we have some men i could name for governors all would go clear enough the first winter we would tax the landlords out and law em about in one way and another so as to make em right down glad to sell the last rod of their lands and that cheap too  und who might own dese farms all oop and down der coontry dat i sees  as the law now stands littlepage owns em but if we alter the law enough he wunt if we can only work the legislature up to the stickin pint we shall get all we want would you believe it the man wunt sell a single farm they say but wishes to keep every one on em for himself is that to be borne in a free country theyd hardly stand that in jarmany im thinkin a man that is such an aristocrat us to refuse to sell anything i despise  veil dey stand to der laws in charmany and broperty is respected in most coontries you vouldnt do away wid der rights of broperty if you mights i hopes  not i if a man owns a watch or a horse or a cow im for having the law such that a poor man can keep em even agin execution were getting the laws pretty straight on them pints in old york i can tell you a poor man let him be ever so much in debt can hold on to a mighty smart lot of things nowadays and laugh at the law right in its face ive known chaps that owed as much as 200 hold on to as good as 300 though most of their debts was for the very things they held on to  what a picture is this yet is it not true a state of society in which a man can contract a debt for a cow or his household goods and laugh at his creditor when he seeks his pay on the one hand and on the other legislators and executives lending themselves to the chicanery of another set that are striving to deprive a particular class of its rights of property directly in the face of written contracts this is straining at the gnat and swallowing the camel with a vengeance and all for votes does any one really expect a community can long exist favoured by a wise and justicedispensing providence in which such things are coolly attempteday and coolly done it is time that the american began to see things as they are and not as they are said to be in the speeches of governors fourth of july orations and electioneering addresses i write warmly i know but i feel warmly and i write like a man who sees that a most flagitious attempt to rob him is tampered with by some in power instead of being met as the boasted morals and intelligence of the country would require by the stern opposition of all in authority cursesdeep deep cursesere long will fall on all who shrink from their duty in such a crisis even the very men who succeed if succeed they should will in the end curse the instruments of their own success4  a firstrate lecturer on feudal tenors joshua was not in the least particular in his language but in the substance he knew what he was talking about as well as some who are in high places chickens and days works we expect a great deal from this man who is paid well for coming  und who might bay himder state  nowe havent got to that yet though some think the state will have to do it in the long run at present the tenants are taxed so much on the dollar accordin to rent or so much an acre and that way the needful money is raised but one of our lecturers told us a time back that it was money put out at use and every man ought to keep an account of what he give for the time was not far off when he would get it back with double interest it is paid now for a reform he said and when the reform is obtained no doubt the state would feel itself so much indebted to us all that it would tax the late landlords until we got all our money back again and more too  dat vould pe a bretty speculation ja dat might be most bootiful  why yes it wouldnt be a bad operation living on the inimy as a body might say but youll not catch our folks livin on themselves i can tell you that they might do without societies no weve an object and when folks has an object they commonly look sharp ater it we dont let on all we want and mean openly and youll find folks among us thatll deny stoutly that antirenters has anything to do with the injin system but folks ant obliged to believe the moon is all cheese unless theyve a mind to some among us maintain that no man ought to hold more than a thousand acres of land while others think natur has laid down the law on that pint and that a man shouldnt hold more than he has need on  und vich side dost you favourvich of dese obinions might not be yours  im not particlar so i get a good farm i should like one with comfortable buildins on t and one that hasnt been worked to death for them two principles i think id stand out but whether there be four hundred acres or four hundred and fifty or even five hundred im no way onaccomadatin i expect therell be trouble in the eend when we come to the division but im not the man to make it i spose i shall get my turn at the town offices and other chances and givin me my rights in them ill take up with almost any farm young littlepage has though i should rather have one in the main valley here than one more out of the way still i dont set myself down as at all particlar  und vhat do you expect to bay mr littlepage for der farm ast you might choose  that depends on sarcumstances the injins mainly expect to come in cheap some folks think its best to pay suthin as it might stand agin law better should it come to that while other some see no great use in paying anything them thats willing to pay mainly hold out for paying the principal of the first rents  i doesnt oonderstandt vhat you means py der brincipal of der first rents  its plain enough when you get the lay on t you see these lands were let pretty low when they were first taken up from the forest in order to get folks to live here thats the way were obliged to do in america or people wont come many tenants paid no rent at all for six eight or ten years and ater that until their three lives run out as it is called they paid only sixpence an acre or six dollars and a quarter on the hundred acres that was done you see to buy men to come here at all and you can see by the price that was paid how hard a time they must have had on t now some of our folks hold that the whull time ought to be countedthat which was rent free and that which was notin a way that ill explain to you for id have you to know i havent entered into this business without looking to the right and the wrong ont  exblain exblain i might hear you exblain and you most exblain  why youre in a hurry friend griezenbach or whatever your name be but ill explain if you wish it spose now a lease run thirty yearsten on nothin and twenty on sixpences well a hundred sixpences make fifty shillings and twenty times fifty make a thousand as all the rent paid in thirty years if you divide a thousand by thirty it leaves thirtythree shillings and a fractionjoshua calculated like an american of his class accurately and with rapidityfor the average rent of the thirty years calling thirtythree shillings four dollars and its plaguy little more we have that for the interest which at 7 per cent will make a principal of rather more than fifty dollars though not as much as sixty as sich matters ought to be done on liberal principles they say that littlepage ought to take fifty dollars and give a deed for the hundred acres  und vhat might be der rent of a hoondred acres nowhe might get more dan sixpence today  that he does most all of the farms are running out on second and some on third leases four shillings an acre is about the average of the rents accordin to circumstances  den you dinks der landtlort ought to accept one years rent for der farms  i dont look on it in that light he ought to take fifty dollars for a hundred acres you forget the tenants have paid for their farms over and over again in rent they feel as if they have paid enough and that it was time to stop  extraordinary as this reasoning may seem in most mens minds i have since found it is a very favourite sentiment among antirenters are we to go on and pay rent for ever they ask with logical and virtuous indignation  und vhat may be der aferage value of a hoondred acre farm in dis part of de coontry i inquired  from two thousand five hundred to three thousand dollars it would be more but tenants wont put good buildings on farms you know seein that they dont own them i heard one of our leaders lamentin that he didnt foresee what times was comin to when he repaired his old house or he would have built a new one but a man cant foretell everything i dare say many has the same feelins now  den you dinks herr littlebage ought to accept 50 for vhat is worth 2500 das seem ferry little  you forget the back rent that has been paid and the work the tenant has done what would the farm be good for without the work that has been done on it  ja jai oonderstandst and vhat vould der work be goot for vidout der landt on vhich it vast done  this was rather an incautious question to put to a man as distrustful and rogueish as joshua brigham the fellow cast a lowering and distrustful look at me but ere there was time to answer miller of whom he stood in healthful awe called him away to look after the cows  here then i had enjoyed an opportunity of hearing the opinions of one of my own hirelings on the interesting subject of my right to my own estate i have since ascertained that while these sentiments are sedulously kept out of view in the proceedings of the government which deals with the whole matter as if the tenants were nothing but martyrs to hard bargains and the landlords their taskmasters of greater or less lenity they are extensively circulated in the infected districts and are held to be very sound doctrines by a large number of the bone and sinew of the land of course the reasoning is varied a little to suit circumstances and to make it meet the facts but of this school is a great deal and a very great deal of the reasoning that circulates on the leased property and from what i have seen and heard already i make no doubt that there are quasi legislators among us who instead of holding the manly and only safe doctrine which ought to be held on such a subject and saying that these deluded men should be taught better are ready to cite the very fact that such notions do exist as a reason for the necessity of making concessions in order to keep the peace at the cheapest rate that profound principle of legislation which concedes the right in order to maintain quiet is admirably adapted to forming sinners and if carried out in favour of all who may happen to covet their neighbours goods would in a short time render this community the very paradise of knaves  as for joshua brigham i saw no more of him that night for he quitted the farm on leave just as it got to be dark where he went i do not know but the errand on which he left us could no longer be a secret to me as the family retired early and we ourselves were a good deal fatigued everybody was in bed by nine oclock and judging from myself soon asleep previously to saying good night however miller told us of the meeting of the next day and of his intention to attend it     chapter xiii      he knows the game how true he keeps the wind     silence      king henry vi   after an early breakfast next morning the signs of preparation for a start became very apparent in the family not only miller but his wife and daughter intended to go down to little neest as the hamlet was almost invariably called in that fragment of the universe in contradistinction to the neest proper i found afterwards that this very circumstance was cited against me in the controversy it being thought lèse majesté for a private residence to monopolize the major of the proposition while a hamlet had to put up with the minor the latter moreover including two taverns which are exclusively the property of the public there being exclusiveness with the public as well as with aristocratsmore especially in all things that pertain to power or profit as to the two last even joshua brigham was much more of an aristocrat than i was myself it must be admitted that the americans are a humane population for they are the only people who deem that bankruptcy gives a claim to public favour5  as respects the two nests had not so much more serious matter been in agitation the precedence of the names might actually have been taken up as a question of moment i have heard of a lawsuit in france touching a name that has been illustrious in that country for a period so long as to extend beyond the reach of manas indeed was apparent by the matter in controversyand which name has obtained for itself a high place in the annals of even our own republic i allude to the house of grasse which was seated prior to the revolution and may be still at a place called grasse in the southern part of the kingdom the town being almost as famous for the manufacture of pleasant things as the family for its exploits in arms about a century since the marquis de grasse is said to have had a procés with his neighbours of the place to establish the fact whether the family gave its name to the town or the town gave its name to the family the marquis prevailed in the struggle but greatly impaired his fortune in achieving that new victory as my house or its predecessor was certainly erected and named while the site of little nest was still in the virgin forest one would think its claims to the priority of possession beyond dispute but such might not prove to be the case on a trial there are two histories among us as relates to both public and private things the one being as nearly true as is usual while the other is invariably the fruits of the human imagination everything depending so much on majorities that soon gets to be the most authentic tradition which has the most believers for under the system of numbers little regard is paid to superior advantages knowledge or investigation all depending on 3 as against 2 which makes 1 majority i find a great deal of this spurious history is getting to be mixed up with the antirent controversy facts coming out daily that long have lain dormant in the graves of the past these facts affect the whole structure of the historical picture of the state and colony leaving touches of black where the pencil had originally put in white and placing the high lights where the shadows have before always been understood to be in a word men are telling the stories as best agrees with their present views and not at all as they agree with fact  it was the intention of tom miller to give my uncle ro and me a dearborn to ourselves while he drove his wife kitty and a help as far as the little neest in a twohorse vehicle that was better adapted to such a freight thus disposed of then we all left the place in company just as the clock in the farmhouse entry struck nine i drove our horse myself and mine he was in fact every hoof vehicle and farming utensil on the nest farm being as much my property under the old laws as the hat on my head it is true the millers had now been fifty years or more nay nearly sixty in possession and by the new mode of construction it is possible some may fancy that we had paid them wages so long for working the land and for using the cattle and utensils that the title in a moral sense had passed out of me in order to pass into tom miller if use begets a right why not to a wagon and horse as well as to a farm  as we left the place i gazed wistfully towards the nest house in the hope of seeing the form of some one that i loved at a window on the lawn or in the piazza not a soul appeared however and we trotted down the road a short distance in the rear of the other wagon conversing on such things as came uppermost in our minds the distance we had to go was about four miles and the hour named for the commencement of the lecture which was to be the great affair of the day had been named at eleven this caused us to be in no hurry and i rather preferred to coincide with the animal i drove and move very slowly than hurry on and arrive an hour or two sooner than was required in consequence of this feeling on our part miller and his family were soon out of sight it being their wish to obtain as much of the marvels of the day as was possible  the road of course was perfectly well known to my uncle and myself but had it not been there was no danger of missing our way as we had only to follow the general direction of the broad valley through which it ran then miller had considerately told us that we must pass two churches or a church and a meetinus the spires of both of which were visible most of the way answering for beacons referring to this term of meetinghouse does it not furnish conclusive evidence of itself of the inconsistent folly of that wisest of all earthly beings man it was adopted in contradistinction from and in direct opposition to the supposed idolatrous association connected with the use of the word church at a time when certain sects would feel offended at hearing their places of worship thus styled whereas at the present day those very sectarians are a little disposed to resent this exclusive appropriation of the proscribed word by the sects who have always adhered to it as offensively presuming and in a slight degree arisdogradic i am a little afraid that your outandouters in politics religion love of liberty and other human excellences are somewhat apt to make these circuits in their eccentric orbits and to come out somewhere quite near the places from which they started  the road between the nest house and little nest the hamlet is rural and quite as agreeable as is usually found in a part of the country that is without waterviews or mountain scenery our new york landscapes are rarely nay never grand as compared with the noble views one finds in italy switzerland spain and the finer parts of europe but we have a vast many that want nothing but a finish to their artificial accessories to render them singularly agreeable such is the case with the principal vale of ravensnest which at the very moment we were driving through it struck my uncle and myself as presenting a picture of rural abundance mingled with rural comfort that one seldom sees in the old world where the absence of enclosures and the concentration of the dwellings in villages leave the fields naked and with a desolate appearance in spite of their high tillage and crops  this is an estate worth contending for now said my uncle as we trotted slowly on although it has not hitherto been very productive to its owner the first half century of an american property of this sort rarely brings much to its proprietor beyond trouble and vexation  and after that time the tenant is to have it pretty much at his own price as a reward for his own labour  what evidences are to be found wherever the eye rests of the selfishness of man and his unfitness to be left to the unlimited control of his own affairs in england they are quarrelling with the landlords who do compose a real aristocracy and make the laws about the manner in which they protect themselves and the products of their estates while here the true owner of the soil is struggling against the power of numbers with the people who are the only aristocrats we possess in order to maintain his right of property in the simplest and most naked form a common vice is at the bottom of both wrongs and that is the vice of selfishness  but how are abuses like those of which we complain hereabuses of the most formidable character of any that can exist since the oppressors are so many and so totally irresponsible by their numbersto be avoided if you give the people the right of selfgovernment  god help the nation where selfgovernment in its literal sense exists hugh the term is conventional and properly viewed means a government in which the source of authority is the body of the nation and does not come from any other sovereign when a people that has been properly educated by experience calmly selects its agents and coolly sets to work to adopt a set of principles to form its fundamental law or constitution the machine is on the right track and will work well enough so long as it is kept there but this running off and altering the fundamental principles every time a political faction has need of recruits is introducing tyranny in its worst forma tyranny that is just as dangerous to real liberty as hypocrisy is to religion  we were now approaching st andrews church and the rectory with its glebe the latter lying contiguous to the churchyard or as it is an americanism to say the graveyard there had been an evident improvement around the rectory since i had last seen it shrubbery had been planted care was taken of the fences the garden was neatly and well worked the fields looked smooth and everything denoted that it was new lords and new laws the last incumbent had been a whining complaining narrowminded selfish and lazy priest the least estimable of all human characters short of the commission of the actual and higher crimes but his successor had the reputation of being a devout and real christianone who took delight in the duties of his holy office and who served god because he loved him i am fully aware how laborious is the life of a country priest and how contracted and mean is the pittance he in common receives and how much more he merits than he gets if his reward were to be graduated by things here but this picture like every other has its different sides and occasionally men do certainly enter the church from motives as little as possible connected with those that ought to influence them  there is the wagon of mr warren at his door observed my uncle as we passed the rectory can it be that he intends visiting the village also on an occasion like this  nothing more probable sir if the character patt has given of him be true i answered she tells me he has been active in endeavouring to put down the covetous spirit that is getting uppermost in the town and has even preached boldly though generally against the principles involved in the question the other man they say goes for popularity and preaches and prays with the antirenters  no more was said but on we went soon entering a large bit of wood a part of the virgin forest this wood exceeding a thousand acres in extent stretched down from the hills along some broken and otherwise little valuable land and had been reserved from the axe to meet the wants of some future day it was mine therefore in the fullest sense of the word and singular as it may seem one of the grounds of accusation brought against me and my predecessors was that we had declined leasing it thus on the one hand we were abused for having leased our land and on the other for not having leased it the fact is we in common with other extensive landlords are expected to use our property as much as possible for the particular benefit of other people while those other people are expected to use their property as much as possible for their own particular benefit  there was near a mile of forest to pass before we came out again in the open country at about a mile and a halfs distance from the hamlet on our left this little forest did not extend more than a hundred rods terminating at the edge of the rivuletor creek as the stream is erroneously called and for no visible reason but the fact that it was only a hundred feet widewhich swept close under the broken ground mentioned at this point on our right however the forest stretched away for more than a mile until indeed it became lost and confounded with other portions of wood that had been reserved for the farms on which they grew as is very usual in america in cases where roads pass through a forest a second growth had shot up on each side of this highway which was fringed for the whole distance with large bushes of pine hemlock chestnut and maple in some places these bushes almost touched the track while in others a large space was given we were winding our way through this wood and had nearly reached its centre at a point where no house was visibleand no house indeed stood within half a mile of uswith the view in front and in rear limited to some six or eight rods in each direction by the young trees when our ears were startled by a low shrill bandittilike whistle i must confess that my feelings were anything but comfortable at that interruption for i remembered the conversation of the previous night i thought by the sudden jump of my uncle and the manner he instinctively felt where he ought to have had a pistol to meet such a crisis that he believed himself already in the hands of the philistines  a half minute sufficed to tell us the truth i had hardly stopped the horse in order to look around me when a line of men all armed and disguised issued in single file from the bushes and drew up in the road at right angles to its course there were six of these injins as they are called and indeed call themselves each carrying a rifle horn and pouch and otherwise equipped for the field the disguises were very simple consisting of a sort of loose calico huntingshirt and trowsers that completely concealed the person the head was covered by a species of hood or mask equally of calico that was fitted with holes for the eyes nose and mouth and which completed the disguise there were no means of recognizing a man thus equipped unless it might be by the stature in cases in which the party was either unusually tall or unusually short a middlesized man was perfectly safe from recognition so long as he did not speak and could keep his equipments those who did speak altered their voices as we soon found using a jargon that was intended to imitate the imperfect english of the native owners of the soil although neither of us had ever seen one of the gang before we knew these disturbers of the public peace to be what in truth they were the instant our eyes fell on them one could not well be mistaken indeed under the circumstances in which we were placed but the tomahawks that one or two carried the manner of their march and other pieces of mummery that they exhibited would have told us the fact had we met them even in another place  my first impulse was to turn the wagon and to endeavour to lash the lazy beast i drove into a run fortunately before the attempt was made i turned my head to see if there was room for such an exploit and saw six others of these injins drawn across the road behind us it was now so obviously the wisest course to put the best face on the matter that we walked the horse boldly up to the party in front until he was stopped by one of the gang taking him by the bridle  sago sago cried one who seemed to act as a chief and whom i shall thus designate speaking in his natural voice though affecting an indian pronunciation how do how dowhere come from ehwhere go ehwhat you say tooup rent or down rent eh  ve ist two charmans returned uncle ro in his most desperate dialect the absurdity of men who spoke the same language resorting to such similar means of deception tempting me sorely to laugh in the fellows faces ve ist two charmans dat ist goin to hear a mans sbeak about bayin rent und to sell vatches might you buy a vatch goot shentlemans  although the fellows doubtless knew who we were so far as our assumed characters went and had probably been advised of our approach this bait took and there was a general jumping up and down and a common powwowing among them indicative of the pleasure such a proposal gave in a minute the whole party were around us with some eight or ten more who appeared from the nearest bushes we were helped out of the wagon with a gentle violence that denoted their impatience as a matter of course i expected that all the trinkets and watches which were of little value fortunately would immediately disappear for who could doubt that men engaged in attempting to rob on so large a scale as these fellows were engaged in would hesitate about doing a job on one a little more diminutive i was mistaken however some sort of imperceptible discipline keeping those who were thus disposed of whom there must have been some in such a party in temporary order the horse was left standing in the middle of the highway right glad to take his rest while we were shown the trunk of a fallen tree near by on which to place our box of wares a dozen watches were presently in the hands of as many of these seeming savages who manifested a good deal of admiration at their shining appearance while this scene which was half mummery and half nature was in the course of enactment the chief beckoned me to a seat on the further end of the tree and attended by one or two of his companions he began to question me as follows  mind tell truth he said making no very expert actor in the way of imitation dis streak o lightning laying his hand on his own breast that i might not misconceive the person of the warrior who bore so eminent a title no good lie to himknow ebbery ting

homely rustic english as ever came out of the mouth of a clown if hes our friend why did he send the artillery and horse down to hudsonand why has he had big thunder up afore his infarnal courts he be dd  there was no mistaking this outpouring of the feelings and so streak o lightning seemed to think too for he whispered one of the tribe who took the plainspeaking injin by the arm and led him away grumbling and growling as the thunder mutters in the horizon after the storm has passed on for myself i made several profitable reflections concerning the inevitable fate of those who attempt to serve god and mammon this antirentism is a question in which so far as a governor is concerned there is but one course to pursue and that is to enforce the laws by suppressing violence and leaving the parties to the covenants of leases to settle their differences in the courts like the parties to any other contracts it is a poor rule that will not work both ways many a landlord has made a hard bargain for himself and i happen to know of one case in particular in which a family has long been and is still kept out of the enjoyment of a very valuable estate as to any benefit of importance purely by the circumstance that a weakminded possessor of the property fancied he was securing souls for paradise by letting his farms on leases for ninetynine years at nominal rents with a covenant that the tenant should go twice to a particular church now nothing is plainer than that it is a greater hardship to the citizen who is the owner of many farms so situated than to the citizen who is the lessee of only one with a hard covenant and on general principles the landlord in question would be most entitled to relief since one man who suffers a good deal is more an object of true commiseration than many who suffer each a little what would a governor be apt to say if my landlord should go with his complaints to the foot of the executive chair and tell him that the very covenant which had led his predecessor into the mistake of thus wasting his means was openly disregarded that farms worth many thousands of dollars had now been enjoyed by the tenants for near a century for mere nominal rents and that the owner of the land in fee had occasion for his property c c would the governor recommend legislative action in that case would the length of such leases induce him to recommend that no lease should exceed five years in duration would the landlords who should get up a corps of injins to worry their tenants into an abandonment of their farms be the objects of commiserationand would the law slumber for years over their rebellions and depredations until two or three murders aroused public indignation let them answer that know as a landlord i should be sorry to incur the ridicule that would attend even a public complaint of the hardships of such a case a common sneer would send me to the courts for my remedy if i had one and the whole difference between the if and ifs of the two cases would be that a landlord gives but one vote while his tenants may be legion6  he be dd muttered the plainspeaking injin as long as i could hear him as soon as released from his presence streak of lightning continued his examination though a little vexed at the undramatical character of the interruption  sartain no spy ehsartain gubbernor no send him ehsartain come

antirent ist bad dey dinks as dey wishes  here a low whistle came down the road or rather down the bushes when every injin started up each man very fairly gave back the watch he was examining and in less than half a minute we were alone on the log this movement was so sudden that it left us in a little doubt as to the proper mode of proceeding my uncle however coolly set about replacing his treasures in their box while i went to the horse which had shaken off his headstall and was quietly grazing along the roadside a minute or two might have been thus occupied when the trotting of a horse and the sound of wheels announced the near approach of one of those vehicles which have got to be almost national a dearborn or a onehorse wagon as it came out from behind a screen of bushes formed by a curvature in the road i saw that it contained the rev mr warren and his sweet daughter  the road being narrow and our vehicle in its centre it was not possible for the newcomers to proceed until we got out of the way and the divine pulled up as soon as he reached the spot where we stood  good morning gentlemen said mr warren cordially and using a word that in his mouth i felt meant all it expressed good morning gentlemen are you playing handel to the woodnymphs or reciting eclogues  neider neider herr pastor we meet wid coostomers here und dey has joost left us answered uncle ro who certainly enacted his part with perfect àplomb and the most admirable mimicry as to manner guten tag guten tag might der herr pastor been going to der village  we are i understand there is to be a meeting there of the misguided men called antirenters and that several of my parishioners are likely to be present on such an occasion i conceive it to be my duty to go among my own particular people and whisper a word of advice nothing can be farther from my notions of propriety than for a clergyman to be mingling and mixing himself up with political concerns in general but this is a matter that touches morality and the minister of god is neglectful of his duty who keeps aloof when a word of admonition might aid in preventing some wavering brother from the commission of a grievous sin this last consideration has brought me out to a scene i could otherwise most heartily avoid  this might be well enough i said to myself but what has your daughter to do in such a scene is the mind of mary warren then after all no better than vulgar minds in generaland can she find a pleasure in the excitement of lectures of this cast and in that of public meetings no surer test can be found of cultivation than the manner in which it almost intuitively shrinks from communion unnecessarily with tastes and principles below its own level yet here was the girl with whom i was already half in loveand that was saying as little as could be said tooactually going down to the little neest to hear an itinerant lecturer on political economy utter his crudities and to see and be seen i was grievously disappointed and would at the moment have cheerfully yielded the best farm on my estate to have had the thing otherwise my uncle must have had some similar notion by the remark he made  und doost das jung frau go to see der injins too to bersuade em dey ist fery vicked  marys face had been a little pale for her i thought as the wagon drew up but it immediately became scarlet she even suffered her head to droop a little and then i perceived that she cast an anxious and tender glance at her father i cannot say whether this look were or were not intended for a silent appeal unconsciously made but the father without even seeing it acted as if he fancied it might be  no no he said hurriedly this dear girl is doing violence to all her feelings but one in venturing to such a place her filial piety has proved stronger than her fears and her tastes and when she found that go i would no argument of mine could persuade her to remain at home i hope she will not repent it  the colour did not quit marys face but she looked grateful at finding her true motives appreciated and she even smiled though she said nothing my own feelings underwent another sudden revulsion there was no want of those tastes and inclinations that can alone render a young woman attractive to any man of sentiment but there was high moral feeling and natural affection enough to overcome them in a case in which she thought duty demanded the sacrifice it was very little probable that anything would or could occur that day to render the presence of mary warren in the least necessary or useful but it was very pleasant to me and very lovely in her to think otherwise under the strong impulses of her filial attachment  another idea however and one far less pleasant suggested itself to the minds of my uncle and myself and almost at the same instant it was this the conversation was carried on in a high key or loud enough to be heard at some little distance the horse and part of the wagon interposing between the speakers and there was the physical certainty that some of those whom we knew to be close at hand in the bushes must hear all that was said and might take serious offence at it under this apprehension therefore my uncle directed me to remove our own vehicle as fast as possible in order that the clergyman might pass mr warren however was in no hurry to do this for he was utterly ignorant of the audience he had and entertained that feeling towards us that men of liberal acquirements are apt to feel when they see others of similar educations reduced by fortune below their proper level he was consequently desirous of manifesting his sympathy with us and would not proceed even after i had opened the way for him  it is a painful thing continued mr warren to find men mistaking their own cupidity for the workings of a love of liberty to me nothing is more palpable than that this antirent movement is covetousness incited by the father of evil yet you will find men among us who fancy they are aiding the cause of free institutions by joining in it when in truth they are doing all they can to bring them into discredit and to insure their certain downfall in the end  this was sufficiently awkward for by going near enough to give a warning in a low voice and have that warning followed by a change in the discourse we should be betraying ourselves and might fall into serious danger at the very moment the clergyman was thus speaking i saw the masked head of streak o lightning appearing through an opening in some small pines that grew a little in the rear of the wagon a position that enabled him to hear every syllable that was uttered i was afraid to act myself and trusted to the greater experience of my uncle whether the last also saw the pretended chief was more than i knew but he decided to let the conversation go on rather leaning to the antirent side of the question as the course that could do no serious evil while it might secure our own safety it is scarcely necessary to say all these considerations glanced through our minds so swiftly as to cause no very awkward or suspicious pause in the discourse  brhaps dey doosnt like to bay rent put in my uncle with a roughness of manner that was in accordance with the roughness of the sentiment beoples might radder haf deir landts for nuttin dan bay rents for dem  in that case then let them go and buy lands for themselves if they do not wish to pay rent why did they agree to pay rent  may be dey changes deir minds vhat is goot today doosnt always seem goot tomorrow  that may be true but we have no right to make others suffer for our own fickleness i dare say now that it might be better for the whole community that so large a tract of land as that included in the manor of rensselaerwyck for instance and lying as it does in the very heart of the state should be altogether in the hands of the occupants than have it subject to the divided interest that actually exists but it does not follow that a change is to be made by violence or by fraudulent means in either of the latter cases the injury done the community would be greater than if the present tenures were to exist a thousand years i dare say much the larger portion of those farms can be bought off at a moderate advance on their actual moneyvalue and that is the way to get rid of the difficulty not by bullying owners out of their property if the state finds a political consideration of so much importance for getting rid of the tenures let the state tax itself to do so and make a liberal offer in addition to what the tenants will offer and ill answer for it the landlords will not stand so much in their own way as to decline good prices  but maybes dey wont sell all der landts dey may wants to keep some of dem  they have a right to say yes or no while we have no right to juggle or legislate them out of their property the legislature of this state has quite lately been exhibiting one of the most pitiable sights the world has seen in my day it has been struggling for months to find a way to get round the positive provisions of laws and constitutions in order to make a sacrifice of the rights of a few to secure the votes of the many  votes ist a goot ding at election dimehaw haw haw exclaimed my uncle  mr warren looked both surprised and offended the coarseness of manner that my uncle had assumed effected its object with the injins but it almost destroyed the divines previous good opinion of our characters and quite upset his notions of our refinement and principles there was no time for explanations however for just as my uncles broad and wellacted haw haw haw was ended a shrill whistle was heard in the bushes and some forty or fifty of the injins came whooping and leaping out from their cover filling the road in all directions immediately around the wagons  mary warren uttered a little scream at this startling scene and i saw her arm clinging to that of her father by a sort of involuntary movement as if she would protect him at all hazards then she seemed to rally and from that instant her character assumed an energy an earnestness a spirit and an intrepidity that i had least expected in one so mild in aspect and so really sweet in disposition  all this was unnoticed by the injins they had their impulses too and the first thing they did was to assist mr warren and his daughter to alight from their wagon this was done not without decorum of manner and certainly not without some regard to the holy office of one of the parties and to the sex of the other nevertheless it was done neatly and expeditiously leaving us all mr warren and mary my uncle and myself with a cluster of some fifty injins around us standing in the centre of the highway     chapter xiv      no toil in despair         no tyrant no slave     no breadtax is there         with a maw like the grave   all this was so suddenly done as scarce to leave us time to think there was one instant notwithstanding while two injins were assisting mary warren to jump from the wagon when my incognito was in great danger perceiving that the young lady was treated with no particular disrespect i so far overcame the feeling as to remain quiet though i silently changed my position sufficiently to get near her elbow where i could and did whisper a word or two of encouragement but mary thought only of her father and had no fears for herself she saw none but him trembled only for him dreaded and hoped for him alone  as for mr warren himself he betrayed no discomposure had he been about to enter the desk his manner could not have been more calm he gazed around him to ascertain if it were possible to recognise any of his captors but suddenly turned his head away as if struck with the expediency of not learning their names even though it had been possible he might be put on the stand as a witness against some misguided neighbour did he know his person all this was so apparent in his benevolent countenance that i think it struck some among the injins and still believe it may have had a little influence on their treatment of him a pot of tar and a bag of feathers had been brought into the road when the gang poured out of the bushes but whether this were merely accidental or it had originally been intended to use them on mr warren i cannot say the offensive materials soon and silently disappeared and with them every sign of any intention to offer personal injury  what have i done that i am thus arrested in the public highway by men armed and disguised contrary to law demanded the divine as soon as the general pause which succeeded the first movement invited him to speak this is a rash and illegal step that may yet bring repentance  no preachee now answered streak o lightning preachee for meetin no good for road  mr warren afterwards admitted to me that he was much relieved by this reply the substitution of the word meeting for church giving him the grateful assurance that this individual at least was not one of his own people  admonition and remonstrance may always be useful when crime is meditated you are now committing a felony for which the states prison is the punishment prescribed by the laws of the land and the duties of my holy office direct me to warn you of the consequences the earth itself is but one of gods temples and his ministers need never hesitate to proclaim his laws on any part of it  it was evident that the calm severity of the divine aided no doubt by his known character produced an impression on the gang for the two who had still hold of his arms released them and a little circle was now formed in the centre of which he stood  if you will enlarge this circle my friends continued mr warren and give room i will address you here where we stand and let you know my reasons why i think your conduct ought to be  no nono preachee here suddenly interrupted streak o lightning go to village go to

understood well enough what was meant mr warren offered no resistance but suffered himself to be placed in millers wagon with my uncle at his side without opposition then it was however that he bethought himself of his daughter though his daughter had never ceased to think of him i had some little difficulty in keeping her from rushing into the crowd and clinging to his side mr warren rose and giving her an encouraging smile bade her be calm told her he had nothing to fear and requested that she would enter his own wagon again and return home promising to rejoin her as soon as his duties at the village were discharged  here is no one to drive the horse my child but our young german acquaintance the distance is very short and if he will thus oblige me he can come down to the village with the wagon as soon as he has seen you safe at our own door  mary warren was accustomed to defer to her fathers opinions and she so far submitted now as to permit me to assist her into the wagon and to place myself at her side whip in hand proud of and pleased with the precious charge thus committed to my care these arrangements made the injins commenced their march about half of them preceding and the remainder following the wagon that contained their prisoner four however walked on each side of the vehicle thus preventing the possibility of escape no noise was made and little was said the orders being given by signs and signals rather than by words  our wagon continued stationary until the party had got at least a hundred yards from us no one giving any heed to our movements i had waited thus long for the double purpose of noting the manner of the proceedings among the injins and to obtain room to turn at a spot in the road a short distance in advance of us and which was wider than common to this spot i now walked the horse and was in the act of turning the animals head in the required direction when i saw mary warrens little gloved hand laid hurriedly on the reins she endeavoured to keep the head of the horse in the road  no no said the charming girl speaking earnestly as if she would not be denied we will follow my father to the village i may not must not cannot quit him  the time and place were every way propitious and i determined to let mary warren know who i was by doing it i might give her confidence in me at a moment when she was in distress and encourage her with the hope that i might also befriend her father at any rate i was determined to pass for an itinerant dutch musicgrinder with her no longer  miss mary miss warren i commenced cautiously and with quite as much hesitation and diffidence of feeling as of manner i am not what i seemthat is i am no musicgrinder  the start the look and the alarm of my companion were all eloquent and natural her hand was still on the reins and she now drew on them so hard as actually to stop the horse i thought she intended to jump out of the vehicle as a place no longer fit for her  be not alarmed miss warren i said eagerly and i trust so earnestly as to inspire a little confidence you will not think the worse of me at finding i am your countryman instead of a foreigner and a gentleman instead of a musicgrinder i shall do all you ask and will protect you with my life  this is so extraordinaryso unusualthe whole country appears unsettled pray sir if you are not the person whom you have represented yourself to be who are you  one who admires your filial love and couragewho honours you for them both i am the brother of your friend marthai am hugh littlepage  the little hand now abandoned the reins and the dear girl turned half round on the cushion of the seat gazing at me in mute astonishment i had been cursing in my heart the lank locks of the miserable wig i was compelled to wear ever since i had met with mary warren as unnecessarily deforming and ugly for one might have as well a becoming as a horridly unbecoming disguise off went my cap therefore and off went the wig after it leaving my own shaggy curls for the sole setting of my face  mary made a slight exclamation as she gazed at me and the deadly paleness of her countenance was succeeded by a slight blush a smile too parted her lips and i fancied she was less alarmed  am i forgiven miss warren i asked and will you recognise me for the brother of your friend  does marthadoes mrs littlepage know of this the charming girl at length asked  both i have had the happiness of being embraced by both my grandmother and my sister you were taken out of the room yesterday by the first that i might be left alone with the last for that very purpose  i see it all now yes i thought it singular then though i felt there could be no impropriety in any of mrs littlepages acts dearest martha how well she played her part and how admirably she has kept your secret  it is very necessary you see the condition of the country and will understand that it would be imprudent in me to appear openly even on my own estate i have a written covenant authorizing me to visit every farm near us to look after my own interests yet it may be questioned if it would be safe to visit one among them all now that the spirits of misrule and covetousness are up and doing  replace your disguise at once mr littlepage said mary eagerly dodo not delay an instant  i did as desired mary watching the process with interested and at the same time amused eyes i thought she looked as sorry as i felt myself when that lank villanous wig was again performing its office  am i as well arranged as when we first met miss warren do i appear again the musicgrinder  i see no difference returned the dear girl laughing how musical and cheering to me were the sounds of her voice in that little burst of sweet feminine merriment indeed indeed i do not think even martha could know you now for the person you the moment before seemed  my disguise is then perfect i was in hopes it left a little that my friends might recognise while it effectually concealed me from my enemies  it doesoh it does now i know who you are i find no difficulty in tracing in your features the resemblance to your portrait in the family gallery at the nest the eyes too cannot be altered without artificial brows and those you have not  this was consoling but all that time mr warren and the party in front had been forgotten perhaps it was excusable in two young persons thus situated and who had now known each other a week to think more of what was just then passing in the wagon than to recollect the tribe that was marching down the road and the errand they were on i felt the necessity however of next consulting my companion as to our future movements mary heard me in evident anxiety and her purpose seemed unsettled for she changed colour under each new impulse of her feelings  if it were not for one thing she answered after a thoughtful pause i should insist on following my father  and what may be the reason of this change of purpose  would it be altogether safe for you mr littlepage to venture again among those misguided men  never think of me miss warren you see i have been among them already undetected and it is my intention to join them again even should i first have to take you home decide for yourself  i will then follow my father my presence may be the means of saving him from some indignity  i was rejoiced at this decision on two accounts of which one might have been creditable enough to me while the other i am sorry to say was rather selfish i delighted in the dear girls devotion to her parent and i was glad to have her company as long as possible that morning without entering into a very close analysis of motives however i drove down the road keeping the horse on a very slow gait being in no particular hurry to quit my present fair companion  mary and i had now a free and in some tense a confidential dialogue her manner towards me had entirely changed for while it maintained the modesty and retenue of her sex and station it displayed much of that frankness which was the natural consequence of her great intimacy at the nest and as i have since ascertained of her own ingenuous nature the circumstance too that she now felt she was with one of her own class who had opinions habits tastes and thoughts like her own removed a mountain of restraint and made her communications natural and easy i was near an hour i do believe in driving the two miles that lay between the point where the injins had been met and the village and in that hour mary warren and i became better acquainted than would have been the case under ordinary circumstances in a year  in the first place i explained the reasons and manner of my early and unexpected return home and the motives by which i had been governed in thus coming in disguise on my own property then i said a little of my future intentions and of my disposition to hold out to the last against every attempt on my rights whether they might come from the open violence and unprincipled designs of those below or the equally unprincipled schemes of those above a spurious liberty and political cant were things that i despised as every intelligent and independent man must and i did not intend to be persuaded i was an aristocrat merely because i had the habits of a gentleman at the very moment when i had less political influence than the hired labourers in my own service  mary warren manifested a spirit and an intelligence that surprised me she expressed her own belief that the proscribed classes of the country had only to be true to themselves to be restored to their just rights and that on the very principle by which they were so fast losing them the opinions she thus expressed are worthy of being recorded  everything that is done in that way said this gentle but admirable creature has hitherto been done on a principle that is quite as false and vicious as that by which they are now oppressed we have had a great deal written and said lately about uniting people of property but it has been so evidently with an intention to make money rule and that in its most vulgar and vicious manner that persons of right feelings would not unite in such an effort but it does seem to me mr littlepage that if the gentlemen of new york could form themselves into an association in defence of their rights and for nothing else and let it be known that they would not be robbed with impunity they are numerous enough and powerful enough to put down this antirent project by the mere force of numbers thousands would join them for the sake of principles and the country might be left to the enjoyment of the fruits of liberty without getting any of the fruits of its cant  this is a capital idea and might easily be carried out it requires nothing but a little selfdenial with the conviction of the necessity of doing something if the downward tendency is to be ever checked short of civil war and a revolution that is to let in despotism in its more direct form despotism in the indirect is fast appearing among us as it is  i have heard of a proposition for the legislature to appoint special commissioners who are to settle all the difficulties between the landlords and tenants i remarked a scheme in the result of which some people profess to have a faith i regard it as only one of the many projects that have been devised to evade the laws and institutions of the country as they now exist  mary warren seemed thoughtful for a moment then her eye and face brightened as if she were struck with some thought suddenly after which the colour deepened on her cheek and she turned to me as if half doubting and yet half desirous of giving utterance to the idea that was uppermost  you wish to say something miss warren  i dare say it will be very sillyand i hope you wont think it pedantic in a girl but really it does look so to mewhat difference would there be between such a commission and the starchamber judges of the stuarts mr littlepage  not much in general principles certainly as both would be the instruments of tyrants but a very important one in a great essential the starchamber courts were legal whereas this commission would be flagrantly illegal the adoption of a special tribunal to effect certain purposes that could exist only in the very teeth of the constitution both in its spirit and its letter yet this project comes from men who prate about the spirit of the institutions which they clearly understand to be their own spirit let that be what it may  providence i trust will not smile on such desperate efforts to do wrong said mary warren solemnly  one hardly dare look into the inscrutable ways of a power that has its motives so high beyond our reach providence permits much evil to be done and is very apt to be as frederic of prussia expressed it on the side of strong battalions so far as human vision can penetrate of one thing however i feel certain and that is that they who are now the most eager to overturn everything to effect present purposes will be made to repent of it bitterly either in their own persons or in those of their descendants  that is what is meant my father says by visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations but there is the party with their prisoners just entering the village who is your companion mr littlepageone hired to act as an assistant  it is my uncle himself you have often heard i should think of mr roger littlepage  mary gave a little exclamation at hearing this and she almost laughed after a short pause she blushed brightly and turned to me as she said  and my father and i have supposed you the one a pedlar and the other a streetmusician  but bedlars and moosicgrinders of goot etications as might be panishet for deir bolitics  now indeed she laughed out for the long and frank dialogue we had held together made this change to broken english seem as if a third person had joined us i profited by the occasion to exhort the dear girl to be calm and not to feel any apprehension on the subject of her father i pointed out how little probable it was that violence would be offered to a minister of the gospel and showed her by the number of persons that had collected in the village that it was impossible he should not have many warm and devoted friends present i also gave her permission to nay requested she would tell mr warren the fact of my uncles and my own presence and the reasons of our disguises trusting altogether to the very obvious interest the dear girl took in our safety that she would add of her own accord the necessary warning on the subject of secresy just as this conversation ended we drove into the hamlet and i helped my fair companion to alight  mary warren now hastened to seek her father while i was left to take care of the horse this i did by fastening him to the rails of a fence that was lined for a long distance by horses and wagons drawn up by the wayside surprisingly few persons in the country at this day are seen on horseback notwithstanding the vast difference in the amount of the population ten horsemen were to be met with forty years ago by all accounts on the highways of the state for one today the wellknown vehicle called a dearborn with its four light wheels and mere shell of a box is in such general use as to have superseded almost every other species of conveyance coaches and chariots are no longer met with except in the towns and even the coachee the english sociable which was once so common has very generally given way to a sort of carriagewagon that seems a very general favourite my grandmother who did use the statelylooking and elegant chariot in town had nothing but this carriagewagon in the country and i question if onehalf of the population of the state would know what to call the former vehicle if they should see it  as a matter of course the collection of people assembled at little nest on this occasion had been brought together in dearborns of which there must have been between two and three hundred lining the fences and crowding the horsesheds of the two inns the american countryman in the true sense of the word is still quite rustic in many of his notions though on the whole less marked in this particular than his european counterpart as the rule he has yet to learn that the little liberties which are tolerated in a thinlypeopled district and which are of no great moment when put in practice under such circumstances become oppressive and offensive when reverted to in places of much resort the habits of popular control too come to aid in making them fancy that what everybody does in their part of the country can have no great harm in it it was in conformity with this tendency of the institutions perhaps that very many of the vehicles i have named were thrust into improper places stopping up the footways impeding the entrances to doors here and there letting down bars without permission and garnishing orchards and pastures with onehorse wagons nothing was meant by all these liberties beyond a desire to dispose of the horses and vehicles in the manner easiest to their owners nevertheless there was some connection between the institutions and these little liberties which some statesmen might fancy existed in the spirit of the former this however was a capital mistake inasmuch as the spirit of the institutions is to be found in the laws which prohibit and punish all sorts of trespasses and which are enacted expressly to curb the tendencies of human nature no no as my uncle ro says nothing can be less alike sometimes than the spirit of institutions and their tendencies  i was surprised to find nearly as many females as men had collected at the little nest on this occasion as for the injins after escorting mr warren as far as the village as if significantly to admonish him of their presence they had quietly released him permitting him to go where he pleased mary had no difficulty in finding him and i saw her at his side apparently in conversation with opportunity and her brother seneca as soon as i moved down the road after securing the horse the injins themselves kept a little aloof having my uncle in their very centre not as a prisoner for it was clear no one suspected his character but as a pedlar the watches were out again and near half of the whole gang seemed busy in trading though i thought that some among them were anxious and distrustful  it was a singular spectacle to see men who were raising the cry of aristocracy against those who happened to be richer than themselves while they did not possess a single privilege or power that substantially was not equally shared by every other man in the country thus openly arrayed in defiance of law and thus violently trampling the law under their feet what made the spectacle more painful was the certainty that was obtained by their very actions on the ground that no small portion of these injins were mere boys led on by artful and knavish men and who considered the whole thing as a joke when the laws fall so much into disrepute as to be the subjects of jokes of this sort it is time to inquire into their mode of administration does any one believe that fifty landlords could have thus flown into the face of a recent enactment and committed felony openly and under circumstances that had rendered their intentions no secret for a time long enough to enable the authorities to collect a force sufficient to repress them my own opinion is that had mr stephen rensselaer and mr william rensselaer and mr harry livingston and mr john hunter and mr daniel livingston and mr hugh littlepage and fifty more that i could name been caught armed and disguised in order to defend the rights of property that are solemnly guarantied in these institutions of which it would seem to be the notion of some that it is the spirit to dispossess them we should all of us have been the inmates of states prisons without legislators troubling themselves to pass laws for our liberation this is another of the extraordinary features of american aristocracy which almost deprives the noble of the everyday use and benefit of the law it would be worth our while to lose a moment in inquiring into the process by which such strange results are brought about but it is fortunately rendered unnecessary by the circumstance that the principle will be amply developed in the course of the narrative  a stranger could hardly have felt the real character of this meeting by noting the air and manner of those who had come to attend it the armed and disguised kept themselves in a body it is true and maintained in a slight degree the appearance of distinctness from the people but many of the latter stopped to speak to these men and were apparently on good terms with them not a few of the gentler sex even appeared to have acquaintances in the gang and it would have struck a political philosopher from the other hemisphere with some surprise to have seen the people thus tolerating fellows who were openly trampling on a law that the people themselves had just enacted a political philosopher from among ourselves however might have explained the seeming contradiction by referring it to the spirit of the institutions if one were to ask hugh littlepage to solve the difficulty he would have been very apt to answer that the people of ravensnest wanted to compel him to sell lands which he did not wish to sell and that not a few of them were anxious to add to the compulsory bargains conditions as to price that would rob him of about onehalf of his estate and that what the albany philosophers called the spirit of the institutions was in fact a spirit of the devil which the institutions were expressly designed to hold in subjection  there was a good deal of outdoor management going on as might be seen by the private discussions that were held between pairs under what is called the horseshedding process this horseshedding process i understand is well known among us and extends not only to politics but to the administration of justice your regular horseshedder is employed to frequent taverns where jurors stay and drops hints before them touching the merits of causes known to be on the calendars possibly contrives to get into a room with six or eight beds in which there may accidentally be a juror or even two in a bed when he drops into a natural conversation on the merits of some matter at issue praises one of the parties while he drops dark hints to the prejudice of the other and makes his own representations of the facts in a way to scatter the seed where he is morally certain it will take root and grow all this time he is not conversing with a juror not he he is only assuming the office of the judge by anticipation and dissecting evidence before it has been given in the ear of a particular friend it is true there is a law against doing anything of the sort it is true there is law to punish the editor of a newspaper who shall publish anything to prejudice the interests of litigants it is true the horseshedding process is flagrantly wicked and intended to destroy most of the benefits of the jurysystem but notwithstanding all this the spirit of the institutions carries everything before it and men regard all these laws and provisions as well as the eternal principles of right precisely as if they had no existence at all or as if a freeman were above the law he makes the law and why should he not break it here is another effect of the spirit of the institutions  at length the bell rang and the crowd began to move towards the meetinus this building was not that which had been originally constructed and at the raising of which i have heard it said my dear old grandmother then a lovely and spirited girl of nineteen had been conspicuous for her coolness and judgment but a far more pretending successor the old building had been constructed on the true model of the highest dissenting spirita spirit that induced its advocates to quarrel with good taste as well as religious dogmas in order to make the chasm as wide as possiblewhile in this some concessions had been made to the temper of the times i very well remember the old meetinus at the little nest for it was pulled down to give place to its more pretending successor after i had attained my sixteenth year a description of both may let the reader into the secret of our rural church architecture  the old neest meetinus like its successor was of a hemlock frame covered with pine clapboards and painted white of late years the paint had been of a most fleeting quality the oil seeming to evaporate instead of striking in and setting leaving the colouring matter in a somewhat decomposed condition to rub off by friction and wash away in the rains the house was a stiff formal parallelogram resembling a man with high shoulders appearing to be stuck up it had two rows of formal short and ungraceful windows that being a point in orthodoxy at the period of its erection it had a tower uncouth and in some respects too large and others too small if one can reconcile the contradiction but there are anomalies of this sort in art as well as in nature on top of this tower stood a longlegged belfry which had got a very dangerous though a very common propensity in ecclesiastical matters in other words it had begun to cant it was this diversion from the perpendicular which had suggested the necessity of erecting a new edifice and the building in which the lecture on feudal tenures and aristocracy was now to be delivered  the new meetinghouse at little nest was a much more pretending edifice than its predecessor it was also of wood but a bold diverging from first principles had been ventured on not only in physical but in the moral church the last was newschool as indeed was the first what newschool means in a spiritual sense i do not exactly know but i suppose it to be some improvement on some other improvement of the more ancient and venerable dogmas of the sect to which it belongs these improvements on improvements are rather common among us and are favourably viewed by a great number under the name of progress though he who stands at a little distance can half the time discover that the parties in progress very often come out at the precise spot from which they started  for my part i find so much wisdom in the bibleso profound a knowledge of human nature and of its tendenciescounsel so comprehensive and so safe and this solely in reference to the things of this life that i do not believe everything is progress in the right direction because it sets us in motion on paths that are not two thousand years old i believe that we have quite as much that ought to be kept as of that which ought to be thrown away and while i admit the vast number of abuses that have grown up in the old world under the spirit of their institutions as our philosophers would say i can see a goodly number that are also growing up here certainly not under the same spirit unless we refer them both as a truly wise man would to our common and miserable nature  the main departure from first principles in the sense of material things was in the fact that the new meetinghouse had only one row of windows and that the windows of that row had the pointed arch the time has been when this circumstance would have created a schism in the theological world and i hope that my youth and inexperience will be pardoned if i respectfully suggest that a pointed arch or any other arch in wood ought to create another in the world of taste  but in we went men women and children uncle ro mr warren mary seneca opportunity and all the injins excepted for some reason connected with their policy those savages remained outside until the whole audience had assembled in grave silence the orator was in or on a sort of stage which was made under the newlight system in architecture to supersede the old inconvenient and ugly pulpit supported on each side by two divines of what denomination i shall not take on myself to say it will be sufficient if i add mr warren was not one of them he and mary had taken their seats quite near the door and under the gallery i saw that the rector was uneasy the moment the lecturer and his two supporters entered the pulpit and appeared on the stage and at length he arose and followed by mary he suddenly left the building in an instant i was at their side for it struck me indisposition was the cause of so strange a movement fortunately at this moment the whole audience rose in a body and one of the ministers commenced an extempore prayer  at that instant the injins had drawn themselves up around the building close to its sides and under the open windows in a position that enabled them to hear all that passed as i afterwards learned this arrangement was made with an understanding with those within one of the ministers having positively refused to address the throne of grace so long as any of the tribe were present well has it been said that man often strains at a gnat and swallows a camel     chapter xv      i tell thee jack cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth     and turn it and put a new nap upon it      king henry vi   as i knew mary must have communicated to her father my real name i did not hesitate as i ought to have done in my actual dress and in my assumed character about following them in order to inquire if i could be of any service i never saw distress more strongly painted in any mans countenance than it was in that of mr warren when i approached so very obvious indeed was his emotion that i did not venture to obtrude myself on him but followed in silence and he and mary slowly walked side by side across the street to the stoop of a house of which all the usual inmates had probably gone in the other direction here mr warren took a seat mary still at his side while i drew near standing before him  i thank you mr littlepage the divine at length said with a smile so painful it was almost haggard for so mary tells me you should be calledi thank you for this attention sirbut it will be over in another minutei feel better now and shall be able to command myself  no more was then said concerning the reason of this distress but mary has since explained to me its cause when her father went into the meetinghouse he had not the smallest idea that anything like a religious service would be dragged into the ceremonies of such a day the two ministers on the stage first gave him the alarm when a most painful struggle occurred in his mind whether or not he should remain and be a party to the mockery of addressing god in prayer in an assembly collected to set at naught one of the plainest of his lawsnay with banded felons drawn up around the building as principal actors in the whole mummery the alternative was for him a minister of the altar to seem to quit those who were about to join in prayer and to do this moreover under circumstances which might appear to others as if he rejected all worship but that which was in accordance with his own views of right a notion that would be certain to spread far and near greatly to the prejudice of his own people but the first as he viewed the matter involved a species of blasphemy and yielding to his feelings he took the decided step he had intending to remain out of the building until the more regular business of the day commenced  it is certain mr warren who acted under the best impulse of christian feeling a reverence for god and a profound wish not to be a party in offending him with the mockery of worship under such circumstances has lost much influence and made many enemies by the step he then took the very same feeling which has raised the cry of aristocracy against every gentleman who dwells in sufficiently near contact with the masses to distinguish his habits from those around him which induces the eastern emigrant who comes from a state of society where there are no landlords to fancy those he finds here ought to be pulled down because he is not a landlord himself which enables the legislator to stand up in his place and unblushingly talk about feudal usages at the very instant he is demonstrating that equal rights are denied to those he would fain stigmatize as feudal lords has extended to religion and the church of which mr warren was a minister is very generally accused of being aristocratic too this charge is brought because it has claims which other churches affect to renounce and reject as forming no part of the faith but the last cannot remain easy under their own decisions and while they shout and sing that they have found a church without a bishop they hate the church that has a bishop because it has something they do not possess themselves instead of pitying its deluded members if they believe them wrong this will not be admitted generally but it is nevertheless true and betrays itself in a hundred ways it is seen in the attempt to call their own priests bishops in the feeling so manifest whenever a cry can be raised against their existence and in the general character of these theological rallies whenever they do occur  for one i see a close analogy between my own church as it exists in this country and comparing it with that from which it sprung and to those which surround it and the true political circumstances of the two hemispheres in discarding a vast amount of surplusage in reducing the orders of the ministry in practice as well as in theory to their primitive number  three and in rejecting all connection with the state the american branch of the episcopal church has assumed the position it was desirous to fill restoring as near as may be the simplicity of the apostolical ages while it does not disregard the precepts and practices of the apostles themselves it has not set itself above antiquity and authority but merely endeavoured to sustain them without the encumbrances of more modern abuses thus too has it been in political things no attempt has been made to create new organic social distinctions in this country but solely to disencumber those that are inseparable from the existence of all civilized society of the clumsy machinery with which the expedients of military oppressors had invested them the real sages of this country in founding its institutions no more thought of getting rid of the landlords of the country than the church thought of getting rid of its bishops the first knew that the gradations of property were an inevitable incident of civilization that it would not be wise if it were possible to prevent the affluent from making large investments in the soil and that this could not be done in practice without leaving the relation of landlord and tenant because landlords in other parts of the world possessed privileges that were not necessary to the natural or simple existence of the character was no reason for destroying the character itself any more than the fact that the bishops of england possess an authority the apostles knew nothing of rendered it proper for the american branch of the church to do away with an office that came from the apostles but envy and jealousy do not pause to reflect on such things it is enough for them in the one case that you and yours have estates and occupy social positions that i and mine do not and cannot easily occupy and possess therefore i will oppose you and join my voice to the cry of those who wish to get their farms for nothing and in the other that you have bishops when we can have none without abandoning our present organization and doctrines  i dwell on these points at some little length because the movements of mr warren and myself at that moment had a direct influence on the circumstances that will soon be related it is probable that fully onehalf of those collected in the little nest meetinghouse that morning as they stood up and lent a sort of onesided and listless attention to the prayer were thinking of the scandalous and aristocratical conduct of mr warren in goin out o meetin just as meetin went to prayers few indeed were they who would be likely to ascribe any charitable motive for the act and probably not one of those present thought of the true and conscientious feeling that had induced it so the world wags it is certain that a malignant and bitter feeling was got up against the worthy rector on that occasion and for that act which has not yet abated and which will not abate in many hundreds until the near approach of death shall lay bare to them the true character of so many of their own feelings  it was some minutes before mr warren entirely regained his composure at length he spoke to me in his usual benevolent and mild way saying a few words that were complimentary on the subject of my return while he expressed his fears that my uncle ro and myself had been imprudent in thus placing ourselves as it might be in the lions jaws  you have certainly made your disguises so complete he added smiling as to have escaped wonderfully well so far that you should deceive mary and myself is no great matter since neither of us ever saw you before but the manner in which your nearest relatives have been misled is surprising nevertheless you have every inducement to be cautious for hatred and jealousy have a penetration that does not belong even to love  we think we are safe sir i answered for we are certainly within the statute we are too well aware of our miserable aristocratical condition to place ourselves within the grasp of the law for such are our eminent privileges as a landed nobility that we are morally certain either of us would not only be sent to the states prison were he to be guilty of the felony those injins are committing and will commit with perfect impunity but that he would be kept there as long as a single tear of anguish could be wrung from one of those who are classed with the aristocracy democracy alone finds any sympathy in the ordinary administration of american justice  i am afraid that your irony has only too much truth in it but the movement around the building would seem to say that the real business of the day is about to commence and we had better return to the church  those men in disguise are watching us in a most unpleasant and alarming manner said mary warren delighting me far more by the vigilance she thus manifested in my behalf than alarming me by the fact  that we were watched however became obviously apparent as we walked towards the building by the actions of some of the injins they had left the side of the church where they had posted themselves during the prayer and head was going to head among those nearest to us or it would be nearer to appearances were i to say bunch of calico was going to bunch of calico for nothing in the form of a head was visible among them nothing was said to mr warren and mary however who were permitted to go into the meetinghouse unmolested but two of these disguised gentry placed themselves before me laying their rifles across my path and completely intercepting my advance  who you abruptly demanded one of the twowhere gowhere come from  the answer was ready and i trust it was sufficiently steady  i coomes from charmany und i goes into der kerch as dey say in mine coontry what might be callet meetinus here  what might have followed it is not easy to say had not the loud declamatory voice of the lecturer just then been heard as he commenced his address this appeared to be a signal for the tribe to make some movement for the two fellows who had stopped me walked silently away though bag of calico went to bag of calico as they trotted off together seemingly communicating to each other their suspicions i took advantage of the opening and passed into the church where i worked my way through the throng and got a seat at my uncles side  i have neither time room nor inclination to give anything like an analysis of the lecture the speaker was fluent inflated and anything but logical not only did he contradict himself but he contradicted the laws of nature the intelligent reader will not require to be reminded of the general character of a speech that was addressed to the passions and interests of such an audience rather than to their reason he commented at first on the particular covenants of the leases on the old estates of the colony alluding to the quartersales chickens days work and durable tenures in the customary way the reservation of the mines too was mentioned as a tyrannical covenant precisely as if a landlord were obliged to convey any more of the rights that were vested in him than he saw fit or the tenant could justly claim more than he had hired this man treated all these branches of the subject as if the tenants had acquired certain mysterious interests by time and occupation overlooking the fact that the one party got just as good a title as the other by this process the lease being the instrument between them that was getting to be venerable if one party grew old as a tenant so did the other as a landlord i thought that this lecturer would have been glad to confine himself to the manor leases that being the particular branch of the subject he had been accustomed to treat but such was not the precise nature of the job he was now employed to execute at ravensnest he could not flourish the feudal grievance of the quartersales the four fat fowls the days works and the length of the leases here it was clearly his cue to say nothing of the three first and to complain of the shortness of the leases as mine were about to fall in in considerable numbers finding it was necessary to take new ground he determined it should be bold ground and such as would give him the least trouble to get along with  as soon as the lecturer had got through with his general heads and felt the necessity of coming down to particulars he opened upon the family of littlepage in a very declamatory way what had they ever done for the country he demanded that they should be lords in the land by some process known to himself he had converted landlords into lords in the land and was now aiming to make the tenants occupy the latter stationnay both stations of course some services of a public character of which the littlepages might boast were not touched upon at all everything of that nature being compressed into what the lecturer and his audience deemed serving the people by helping to indulge them in all their desires however rapacious or wicked as everybody who knows anything of the actual state of matters among us must be aware how rarely the people hear the truth when their own power and interests are in question it is not surprising that a very shallow reasoner was enabled to draw wool over the eyes of the audience of ravensnest on that particular subject  but my interest was most awakened when this man came to speak of myself it is not often that a man enjoys the same opportunity as that i then possessed to hear his own character delineated and his most private motives analyzed in the first place the audience were told that this young hugh littlepage had never done anything for the land that he proudly and like a great european noble he calls his estate most of you fellowcitizens can show your hard hands and recall the burning suns under which you have opened the swarth through those then lovely meadows yonder as your titles to these farms but hugh littlepage never did a days work in his lifeten minutes before he had been complaining of the days work in the manor leases as indignities that a freeman ought not to submit tono fellowcitizens he never had that honour and never will have it until by a just division of his property or what he now calls his property you reduce him to the necessity of labouring to raise the crops he wants to consume  where is this hugh littlepage at this very moment in paris squandering your hard earnings in riotous living according to the best standards of aristocracy he lives in the midst of abundance dresses richly and fares richly while you and yours are eating the sweat of your brows he is no man for a pewter spoon and twopronged fork no my countrymen he must have a gold spoon for some of his dishes and you will find it hard to believeplain unpretending republican farmers as you are but it is not the less truehe must have forks of silver fellowcitizens hugh littlepage would not put his knife into his mouth as you and i do in eatingas all plain unpretending republicans dofor the world it would choke him no he keeps silver forks to touch his anointed lips here there was an attempt to get up something like applause but it totally failed the men of ravensnest had been accustomed all their lives to see the littlepages in the social station they occupied and after all it did not seem so very extraordinary that we should have silver forks any more than that others should have silver spoons the lecturer had the tact to see that he had failed on this point and he turned to another  the next onset was made against our title whence did it come demanded the lecturer from the king of england and the people had conquered the country from that sovereign and put themselves in his place now is it not a good principle in politics that to the victors belong the spoils he believed it was and that in conquering america he was of opinion that the people of america had conquered the land and that they had a right to take the land and to keep it titles from kings he did not respect much and he believed the american people generally did not think much of them if hugh littlepage wished an estate as he called it let him come to the people and sarve them and see what sort of an estate they would give him  but there was one portion of his speech which was so remarkable that i must attempt to give it as it was uttered it was while the lecturer was expatiating on this subject of titles that he broke out in the following languagedont talk to me he bellowedfor by this time his voice had risen to the pitch of a methodists in a campmeetingdont talk to me of antiquity and time and length of possession as things to be respected theyre nawthinjest nawthin at all possessions good in law ill admit and i contind thats jest what the tenants has theyve got the lawful possession of this very property that layeth not eggs but up and down far and near and all around a rich and goodly heritage when divided up among hardworking and honest folks but too much by tens of thousands of acres for a young chap who is wasting his substance in foreign lands to hold i contind that the tenants has this very precise lawful possession at this blessed moment only the law wont let em enjy it its all owing to that accursed law that the tenant cant set up a title agin his landlord you see by this one fact fellowcitizens that they are a privileged class and ought to be brought down to the level of ginral humanity you can set up title agin anybody else but you shant set up title agin a landlord i know what is said in the primisis shaking his head in derision of any arguments on the other side of this particular point i know that circumstances alter cases i can see the hardship of one neighbours coming to another and asking to borrow or hire his horse for a day and then pretendin to hold him on some other ketch but horses isnt land you must all allow that no if horses was land the case would be altered land is an element and so is fire and so is water and so is air now who will say that a freeman hasnt a right to air hasnt a right to water and on the same process hasnt a right to land he has fellowcitizenshe has these are what are called in philosophy elementary rights which is the same thing as a right to the elements of which land is one and a principal one i say a principal one for if there was no land to stand on we should drop away from air and couldnt enjy that we should lose all our water in vapour and couldnt put it to millin and manafacterin purposes and where could we build our fires no land is the first elementary right and connected with it comes the first and most sacred right to the elements  i do not altogether disregard antiquity neither no i respect and revere preemption rights for they fortify and sustain the right to the elements now i do not condemn squattin as some doos its actin accordin to natur and natur is right i respect and venerate a squatters possession for its held under the sacred principle of usefulness it says go and make the wilderness blossom as the rose and means progress thats an antiquity i respect i respect the antiquity of your possessions here as tenants for it is a hardworking and useful antiquityan antiquity that increases and multiplies if it be said that hugh littlepages ancestorsyour noble has his ancestors while us common folks are satisfied with forefathersthis hit took with a great many present raising a very general laughbut if this hughs ancestors did pay anything for the land if i was you fellowcitizens id be ginrous and let him have it back agin perhaps his forefathers gave a cent an acre to the kingmay be two or say sixpence if you will id let him have his sixpence an acre back again by way of shutting his mouth no im for nawthin thats unginrous  fellowcitizens i profess to be what is called a democrat i know that many of you be what is called whigsbut i apprehend there isnt much difference between us on the subject of this system of leasing land we are all republicans and leasing farms is antirepublican then i wish to be liberal even to them i commonly oppose at elections and i will freely admit then on the whull the whigs have rather outdone us democrats on the subject of this antirentism i am sorry to be obliged to own in it but it must be confessed that while in the way of governors there hasnt been much differenceyes put em in a bag and shake em up and youd hardly know which would come out firstwhich has done himself the most immortal honour which has shown himself the most comprehensive profound and safe statesman i know that some of our people complain of the governors for ordering out troops agin the injins but they could not help thatthey wouldnt have done it in my judgment had there been any way of getting round it but the law was too strong for them so they druv in the injins and now they join us in putting down aristocracy and in raising up ginral humanity no i dont go agin the governors though many doos  but i profess to be a democrat and ill give an outline of my principles that all may see why they cant and dont and never will agree with aristocracy or nobility in any form or shape i believe one man is as good as another in all things neither birth nor law nor edication nor riches nor poverty nor anything else can ever make any difference in this principle which is sacred and fundamental and is the chief stone of the corner in true democracy one man is as good as another i say and has just the same right to the enjyment of arth and its privileges as any other man i think the majority ought to rule in all things and that it is the duty of the minority to submit now ive had this here sentiment thrown back upon me in some places where i have spoken and been asked how is thisthe majority must rule and the minority must submitin that case the minority isnt as good as the majority in practice and hasnt the same right they are made to own what they think ought not to be done the answer to this is so plain i wonder a sensible man can ask the question for all the minority has to do is to join the majority to have things as they want em the road is free and it is this open road that makes true liberty any man can fall in with the majority and sensible folks commonly do when they can find it and that makes a person not only a man as the saying is but a freeman a still more honourable title  fellowcitizens a great movement is in progress go ahead is the cry and the march is onward our thoughts already fly about on the wings of the lightning and our bodies move but little slower on the vapour of steamsoon our principles will rush ahead of all and let in the radiance of a glorious day of universal reform and loveliness and virtue and charity when the odious sound of rent will never be heard when every man will set down under his own apple or cherry tree if not under his own fig tree  i am a democratyes a democrat glorious appellation i delight in it it is my pride my boast my very virtue let but the people truly rule and all must come well the people has no temptation to do wrong if they hurt the state they hurt themselves for they are the state is a man likely to hurt himself equality is my axiom nor by equality do i mean your narrow pitiful equality before the law as it is sometimes tarmed for that may be no equality at all but i mean an equality that is substantial and which must be restored when the working of the law has deranged it fellowcitizens do you know what leapyear means i dare say some of you dont the ladies in particlar not giving much attention to astronomy well i have inquired and it is thisthe arth revolves around the sun in a year as we all know and we count three hundred and sixtyfive days in a year we all know but the arth is a few hours longer than three hundred and sixtyfive days in making its circuitnearly six hours longer now everybody knows that 4 times 6 makes 24 and so a twentyninth day is put into february every fourth year to restore the lost time another change being to be made a long distance ahead to settle the fractions thus will it be with democracy human natur cant devise laws yet that will keep all things on an exactly equal footing and political leapyears must be introduced into the political calendar to restore the equilibrium in astronomy we must divide up anew the hours and minutes in humanity we must from time to time divide up the land  but i cannot follow this inflated fool any longer for he was quite as much of fool as of knave though partaking largely of the latter character it was plain that he carried many of his notions much farther than a good portion of his audience carried theirs though whenever he touched upon antirentism he hit a chord that vibrated through the whole assembly that the tenants ought to own their farms and pay no more rents and pocket all the benefits of their own previous labours though these labours had been considered in the earlier rents and were indeed still considered in the low rates at which the lands were let was a doctrine all could understand and few were they i am sorry to say who did not betray how much selflove and selfinterest had obscured the sense of right  the lecture such as it was lasted more than two hours and when it was done an individual rose in the character of a chairmanwhen did three americans ever get together to discuss anything that they had not a chairman and secretary and all the parliamentary formsand invited any one present who might entertain views different from the speaker to give his opinion never before did i feel so tempted to speak in public my first impulse was to throw away the wig and come out in my own person and expose the shallow trash that had just been uttered i believe even i unaccustomed as i was to public speaking could easily have done this and i whispered as much to my uncle who was actually on his feet to perform the office for me when the sound of mr chairman from a different part of the church anticipated him looking round i recognised at once the face of the intelligent mechanic named hall whom we had met at mooseridge on our way to the nest i took my seat at once perfectly satisfied that the subject was in good hands  this speaker commenced with great moderation both of manner and tone and indeed he preserved them throughout his utterance accent and language of course were all tinctured by his habits and associations but his good sense and his good principles were equally gifts from above more of the true image of his maker was to be found in that one individual than existed in fifty common men he saw clearly spoke clearly and demonstrated effectively as he was well known in that vicinity and generally respected he was listened to with profound attention and spoke like a man who stood in no dread of tar and feathers had the same sentiments been delivered by one in a fine coat and a stranger or even by myself who had so much at stake very many of them would have been incontinently set down as aristocratic and not to be tolerated the most sublimated lover of equality occasionally falling into these little contradictions  hall commenced by reminding the audience that they all knew him and knew he was no landlord he was a mechanic and a labouring man like most of themselves and had no interest that could be separate from the general good of society this opening was a little homage to prejudice since reason is reason and right right let them come whence they will i too am a democrat he went on to say but i do not understand democracy to mean anything like that which has been described by the last speaker i tell that gentleman plainly that if he is a democrat i am none and if i am a democrat he is none by democracy i understand a government in which the sovereign power resides in the body of the nation and not in a few or in one but this principle no more gives the body of the people authority to act wrong than in a monarchy in which the sovereign power resides in one man that one man has a right to act wrong by equality i do not understand anything more than equality before the lawnow if the law had said that when the late malbone littlepage died his farms should go not to his next of kin or to his devisee but to his neighbours then that would have been the law to be obeyed although it would be a law destructive of civilization since men would never accumulate property to go to the public something nearer home is necessary to make men work and deny themselves what they like  the gentleman has told us of a sort of political leapyear that is to regulate the social calender i understand him to mean that when property has got to be unequal it must be divided up in order that men may make a new start i fear he will have to dispense with leap years and come to leap months or leap weeks ay or even to leap days for was the property of this township divided up this very morning and in this meetinus it would get to be unequal before night some folks cant keep money when they have it and others cant keep their hands off it  then again if hugh littlepages property is to be divided the property of all of hugh littlepages neighbours ought to be divided too to make even an appearance of equality though it would be but an appearance of equality admitting that were done since hugh littlepage has more than all the rest of the town put together yes fellowcitizens hugh littlepage pays at this moment onetwentieth of the taxes of this whole county that is about the proportion of ravensnest and that tax in reality comes out of his pockets as much the greater part of the taxes of rensselaer and albany counties if you will except the cities they contain are paid by the rensselaers it wont do to tell me the tenants pay the taxes for i know better we all know that the probable amount of the taxes is estimated in the original bargain and is so much deducted from the rent and comes out of the landlord if it come out of anybody there is a good reason why the tenant should pay it and a reason that is altogether in his interest because the law would make his oxen and horses and carts liable for the taxes should the landlord neglect to pay the taxes the collector always sells personals for a tax if he can find them on the property and by deducting it from the rent and paying it himself the tenant makes himself secure against that loss to say that a tenant dont take any account of the taxes he will be likely to pay in making his bargain is as if one should say he is non com and not fit to be trusted with his own affairs there are men in this community i am sorry to say who wish a law passed to tax the rents on durable leases or on all leases in order to choke the landlords off from their claims but such men are true friends to neither justice nor their country such a law would be a tax on the incomes of a particular class of society and on no other it is a law that would justify the aggrieved parties in taking up arms to resist it unless the law would give em relief as i rather think it would by removing into another state however they would escape the tax completely laugh at those who framed it who would incur the odium of doing an impotent wrong and get laughed at as well as despised besides injuring the state by drawing away its money to be spent out of its limits think for one moment of the impression that would be made of new york justice if a hundred citizens of note and standing were to be found living in philadelphia or paris and circulating to the world the report that they were exiles to escape a special taxation the more the matter was inquired into the worse it must appear for men may say what they please to be ready agin election time as there is but one piece or parcel of property to tax it is an income tax and nothing else what makes the matter still worse is that every man of sense will know that it is taxing the same person twice substantially for the same thing since the landlord has the direct land tax deducted from the rent in the original bargain  as for all this cry about aristocracy i dont understand it hugh littlepage has just as good a right to his ways as i have to mine the gentleman says he needs gold spoons and silver forks to eat with well what of that i dare say the gentleman himself finds a steel knife and fork useful and has no objection to a silver or at least to a pewter spoon now there are folks that use wooden forks or no forks and who are glad to get horn spoons and they might call that gentleman himself an aristocrat this setting of ourselves up as the standard in all things is anything but liberty if i dont like to eat my dinner with a man who uses a silver fork no man in this country can compel me on the other hand if young mr littlepage dont like a companion who chews tobacco as i do he ought to be left to follow his own inclination  then this doctrine that one mans as good as another has got two sides to it one man ought to have the same general rights as another i am ready to allow but if one man is as good as another why do we have the trouble and cost of elections we might draw lots as we do for jurors and save a good deal of time and money we all know there is chice in men and i think that so long as the people have their chice in sayin who shall and who shall not be their agents theyve got all they have any right to so long as this is done the rest of the world may be left to follow their own ways provided they obey the laws  then i am no great admirer of them that are always telling the people theyre parfect i know this county pretty well as well as most in it and if there be a parfect man in washington county i have not yet fallen in with him ten millions of imparfect men wont make one parfect man and so i dont look for perfection in the people any more than i do in princes all i look for in democracy is to keep the reins in so many hands as to prevent a few from turning everything to their own account still we mustnt forget that when a great many do go wrong it is much worse than when a few go wrong  if my son didnt inherit the property of malbone littlepage neither will malbone littlepages son inherit mine we are on a footing in that respect as to paying rent which some persons think so hard what would they do if they had no house to live in or farm to work if folks wish to purchase houses and farms no one can prevent them if they have money to do it with and if they have not is it expected other people are to provide them with such things out of their own  here the speaker was interrupted by a sudden whooping and the injins came pressing into the house in a way to drive in all the aisles before them men women and children leaped from the windows the distance being trifling while others made their escape by the two sidedoors the injins coming in only by the main entrance in less time than it takes to record the fact the audience had nearly all dispersed     end of vol i     footnotes  1 mr hugh littlepage writes a little sharply but there is truth in all he says at the bottom his tone is probably produced by the fact that there is so serious an attempt to deprive him of his old paternal estate an attempt which is receiving support in high quarters in addition to this provocation the littlepages as the manuscript shows farther on are traduced as one means of effecting the objects of the antirenters no man in any community in which it is necessary to work on public sentiment in order to accomplish such a purpose ever being wronged without being calumniated as respects the inns truth compels me as an old traveller to say that mr littlepage has much reason for what he says i have met with a better bed in the lowest french tavern i ever was compelled to use and in one instance i slept in an inn frequented by carters than in the best purely country inn in america in the way of neatness however more is usually to be found in our new york village taverns than in the public hotels of paris itself as for the hit touching the intelligence of the people it is merited for i have myself heard subtle distinctions drawn to show that the people of a former generation were not as knowing as the people of this and imputing the covenants of the older leases to that circumstance instead of imputing them to their true cause the opinions and practices of the times half a centurys experience would induce me to say that the people were never particularly dull in making a bargaineditor  2 the editor has often had occasion to explain the meaning of terms of this nature the colonists caught a great many words from the indians they first knew and used them to all other indians though not belonging to their languages and these other tribes using them as english a sort of limited lingua frança has grown up in the country that everybody understands it is believed that moccasin squaw pappoose sago tomahawk wigwam c c all belong to this class of words there can be little doubt that the sobriquet of yankees is derived from yengeese the manner in which the tribes nearest to new england pronounced the word english it is to this hour a provincialism of that part of the country to pronounce this word english instead of inglish its conventional sound the change from english to yengeese is very triflingeditor  3 as the honourable gentleman from albany does not seem to understand the precise signification of provincial i can tell him that one sign of such a character is to admire a bed at an american country inneditor  4 that mr hugh littlepage does not feel or express himself too strongly on the state of things that has now existed among us for long long years the following case but one that illustrates the melancholy truth among many will show at a time when the tenants of an extensive landlord to whom tens of thousands were owing for rent were openly resisting the law and defeating every attempt to distrain though two ordinary companies of even armed constables would have put them down the sheriff entered the house of that very landlord and levied on his furniture for debt had that gentleman on the just and pervading principle that he owed no allegiance to an authority that did not protect him resisted the sheriffs officer he would have gone to the states prison and there he might have staid until his last hour of service was expendededitor  5 absurd as this may seem it is nevertheless true and for a reason that is creditable rather than the reversea wish to help along the unfortunate it is a great mistake however as a rule to admit of any other motive for selecting for public trusts than qualificationeditor  6 this is no invented statement but strictly one that is true the writer having himself a small interest in a property so situated though he has not yet bethought him of applying to the legislature for reliefeditor
