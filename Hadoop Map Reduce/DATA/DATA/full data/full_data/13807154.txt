13807154	the poetical works of alexander pope  vol i  with memoir critical dissertation and explanatory notes  by the rev george gilfillan  mdccclvi      life of alexander pope   alexander pope was born in lombard street london on the 21st of may 1688the year of the revolution his father was a linenmerchant in thriving circumstances and said to have noble blood in his veins his mother was edith or editha turner daughter of william turner esq of york mr carruthers in his excellent life of the poet mentions that there was an alexander pope a clergyman in the remote parish of reay in caithness who rode all the way to twickenham to pay his great namesake a visit and was presented by him with a copy of the subscription edition of the odyssey in five volumes quarto which is still preserved by his descendants popes father had made about £10000 by trade but being a roman catholic and fond of a country life he retired from business shortly after the revolution at the early age of fortysix he resided first at kensington and then in binfield in the neighbourhood of windsor forest he is said to have put his money in a strong box and to have lived on the principal his great delight was in his garden and both he and his wife seem to have cherished the warmest interest in their son who was very delicate in health and their only child popes study is still preserved in binfield and on the lawn a cypresstree which he is said to have planted is pointed out  pope was a premature and precocious child his figure was deformedhis back humpedhis stature short four feethis legs and arms disproportionably long he was sometimes compared to a spider and sometimes to a windmill the only mark of genius lay in his bright and piercing eye he was sickly in constitution and required and received great tenderness and care once when three years old he narrowly escaped from an angry cow but was wounded in the throat he was remarkable as a child for his amiable temper and from the sweetness of his voice received the name of the little nightingale his aunt gave him his first lessons in reading and he soon became an enthusiastic lover of books and by copying printed characters taught himself to write when eight years old he was placed under the care of the family priest one bannister who taught him the latin and greek grammars together he was next removed to a catholic seminary at twyford near winchester and while there read ogilbys homer and sandyss ovid with great delight he had not been long at this school till he wrote a severe lampoon of two hundred lines length on his masterso truly was the boy the father of the manfor which demidunciad he was severely flogged his father offended at this removed him to a london school kept by a mr deane this man taught the poet nothing but his residence in london gave him the opportunity of attending the theatres with these he was so captivated that he wrote a kind of play which was acted by his schoolfellows consisting of speeches from ogilbys iliad tacked together with verses of his own he became acquainted with drydens works and went to willss coffeehouse to see him he says virgilium tantum vidi such transient meetings of literary orbs are among the most interesting passages in biography thus met galileo with milton milton with dryden dryden with pope and burns with scott carruthers strikingly remarks considering the perils and uncertainties of a literary lifeits precarious rewards feverish anxieties mortifications and disappointments joined to the tyranny of the tonsons and lintots and the malice and envy of dunces all of which dryden had long and bitterly experiencedthe aged poet could hardly have looked at the delicate and deformed boy whose preternatural acuteness and sensibility were seen in his dark eyes without a feeling approaching to grief had he known that he was to fight a battle like that under which he was himself then sinking even though the temple of fame should at length open to receive him at twelve he wrote the ode to solitude and shortly after his satirical piece on elkanah settle and some of his translations and imitations his next period he says was in windsor forest where for several years he did nothing but read the classics and indite poetry he wrote a tragedy a comedy and four books of an epic called alexander all of which afterwards he committed to the flames he translated also a portion of statius and cicero de senectute and thought himself the greatest genius that ever was his father encouraged him in his studies and when his verses did not please him sent him back to new turn them saying these are not good rhymes his principal favourites were virgils eclogues in latin and in english spencer waller and drydenadmiring spencer we presume for his luxuriant fancy waller for his smooth versification and dryden for his vigorous sense and vivid sarcasm in the forest he became acquainted with sir william trumbull the retired secretary of state a man of general accomplishments who read rode conversed with the youthful poet introduced him to old wycherley the dramatist and was of material service to his views with wycherley who was old doted and excessively vain pope did not continue long intimate a coldness springing from some criticisms which the youth ventured to make on the veterans poetry crept in between them walsh of abberley in worcestershire a man of good sense and taste became after a perusal of the pastorals in ms a warm friend and kind adviser of popes who has immortalised him in more than one of his poems walsh told pope that there had never hitherto appeared in britain a poet who was at once great and correct and exhorted him to aim at accuracy and elegance  when fifteen he visited london in order to acquire a more thorough knowledge of french and italian at sixteen he wrote the pastorals and a portion of windsor forest although they were not published for some time afterwards by his incessant exertions he now began to feel his constitution injured he imagined himself dying and sent farewell letters to all his friends including the abbé southcot this gentleman communicated popes case to dr ratcliffe who gave him some medical directions by following which the poet recovered he was advised to relax in his studies and to ride daily and he prudently followed the advice many years afterwards he repaid the benevolent abbé by procuring for him through sir robert walpole the nomination to an abbey in avignon this is only one of many proofs that notwithstanding his waspish temper and his no small share of malice as well as vanity there was a warm heart in our poet  in 1707 pope became acquainted with michael blount of maple durham near reading whose two sisters martha and teresa he has commemorated in various verses on his connexion with these ladies some mystery rests bowles has strongly and plausibly urged that it was not of the purest or most creditable order others have contended that it did not go further than the manners of the age sanctioned and they say a much greater license in conversation and in epistolary correspondence was permitted between the sexes than in our decorous age we are not careful to try and settle such a delicate questiononly we are inclined to suspect that when common decency quits the words of male and female parties in their mutual communications it is a very ample charity that can suppose it to adhere to their actions and nowhere do we find grosser language than in some of popes prose epistles to the blounts  his pastorals after having been handed about in ms and shewn to such reputed judges as lord halifax lord somers garth congreve c were at last in 1709 printed in the sixth volume of tonsons miscellanies like all wellfinished commonplaces they were received with instant and universal applause it is humiliating to contrast the reception of these empty echoes of inspiration these agreeable centos with that of such genuine although faulty poems as keats endymion shelleys queen mab and wordsworths lyrical ballads two years later in 1711 a far better and more characteristic production from his pen was ushered anonymously into the world this was the essay on criticism a work which he had first written in prose and which discovers a ripeness of judgment a clearness of thought a condensation of style and a command over the information he possesses worthy of any age in life and almost of any mind in time it serves indeed to shew what popes true forte was that lay not so much in poetry as in the knowledge of its principles and lawsnot so much in creation as in criticism he was no homer or shakspeare but he might have been nearly as acute a judge of poetry as aristotle and nearly as eloquent an expounder of the rules of art and the glories of genius as longinus  in the same year pope printed the rape of the lock in a volume of miscellanies lord petre had much in the way described by the poet stolen a lock of miss belle fermors haira feat which led to an estrangement between the families pope set himself to reconcile them by this beautiful poema poem which has embalmed at once the quarrel and the reconciliation to all future time in its first version the machinery was awanting the lock was a desert the rape a natural eventthe small infantry of sylphs and gnomes were slumbering uncreated in the poets mind but in the next edition he contrived to introduce them in a manner so easy and so exquisite as to remind you of the variations which occur in dreams where one wonder seems softly to slide into the bosom of another and where beautiful and fantastic fancies grow suddenly out of realities like the bud from the bough or the fairyseeming wing of the summercloud from the stern azure of the heavens  a little after this pope became acquainted with a far greater better and truer man than himself joseph addison warburton and others have sadly misrepresented the connexion between these two famous wits as well as their relative intellectual positions addison was a more amiable and childlike person than pope he had much more too of the christian he was not so elaborately polished and furbished as the author of the rape of the lock but he had naturally a finer and richer genius pope found early occasion for imagining addison his disguised enemy he gave him a hint of his intention to introduce the machinery into the rape of the lock of this addison disapproved and said it was a delicious little thing alreadymerum sal this pope and some of his friends have attributed to jealousy but it is obvious that addison could not foresee the success with which the machinery was to be managed and did foresee the difficulties connected with tinkering such an exquisite production we may allude here to the circumstances which at a later date produced an estrangement between these celebrated men when tickell addisons friend published the first book of the iliad in opposition to popes version addison gave it the preference this moved popes indignation and led him to assert that it was addisons own composition in this conjecture he was supported by edward young who had known tickell long and intimately and had never heard of him having written at college as was averred this translation it is now however we believe certain from the ms which still exists that tickell was the real author a coldness from this date began between pope and addison an attempt to reconcile them only made matters worse and at last the breach was rendered irremediable by popes writing the famous character of his rival afterwards inserted in the prologue to the satiresa portrait drawn with the perfection of polished malice and bitter sarcasm but which seems more a caricature than a likeness whatever addisons faults his conduct to pope did not deserve such a return the whole passage is only one of those painful incidents which disgrace the history of letters and prove how much spleen ingratitude and baseness often coexist with the highest parts the words of pope are as true now as ever they werethe life of a wit is a warfare upon earth and a warfare in which poisoned missiles and every variety of falsehood are still common we may also here mention that while the friendship of pope and addison lasted the former contributed the wellknown prologue to the latters cato  one of popes most intimate friends in his early days was henry cromwella distant relative of the great olivera gentleman of fortune gallantry and literary taste who became his agreeable and fascinating but somewhat dangerous companion he is supposed to have initiated pope into some of the fashionable follies of the town at this time popes popularity roused one of his most formidable foes against him this was that cobbett of criticism old john dennisa man of strong natural powers much learning and a rich coarse vein of humour but irascible vindictive vain and capricious pope had provoked him by an attack in his essay on criticism and the savage old man revenged himself by a running fire of fierce diatribes against that essay and the rape of the lock pope waited till dennis had committed himself by a powerful but furious assault on addisons cato most of which johnson has preserved in his life of pope and then partly to court addison and partly to indulge his spleen at the critic wrote a prose satire entitled the narrative of dr robert norris on the frenzy of jd in this however he overshot the mark and addison signified to him that he was displeased with the spirit of his narrativean intimation which pope keenly resented this scornful dog would not eat the dirty pudding that was graciously flung to him and pope found that without having conciliated addison he had made denniss furnace of hate against himself seven times hotter than before  in 1712 appeared the messiah the dying christian to his soul the temple of fame and the elegy on the memory of an unfortunate lady her story is still involved in mystery her name is said to have been wainsbury she was attached to a lover above her degreesome say to the duke of berry whom she had met in her early youth in france in despair of obtaining her desire she hanged herself it is curious if true that she was as deformed in person as pope himself her family seems to have been noble in 1713 he published windsor forest an ode on st cecilias day and several papers in the guardianone of them being an exquisitely ironical paper comparing phillips pastorals with his own and affecting to give them the preferencethe extracts being so selected as to damage his rivals claims this year also he wrote although he did not publish his fine epistle to jervas the painter pope was passionately fond of the art of painting and practised it a good deal under jervass instructions although he did not reach great proficiency the prodigy has yet to be born who combines the characters of a great painter and a great poet  about this time pope commenced preparations for the great work of translating homer and subscriptionpapers accordingly were issued dean swift was now in england and took a deep interest in the success of this undertaking recommending it in coffeehouses and introducing the subject and popes name to the leading tories pope met the dean for the first time in berkshire where in one of his fits of savage disgust at the conflicting parties of the period he had retired to the house of a clergyman and an intimacy commenced which was only terminated by death we have often regretted that pope had not selected some author more suitable to his genius than homer horace or lucretius or even ovid would have been more congenial his imitations of horace shew us what he might have made of a complete translation what a brilliant thing a version of lucretius in the style of the essay on man would have been and his rape of the lock proves that he had considerable sympathy with the elaborate fancy although not with the meretricious graces of ovid but with homer the severely grand the simple the warlike the lover and painter of all natures old original formsthe ocean the mountains and the starswhat thorough sympathy could a man have who never saw a real mountain or a battle and whose enthusiasm for scenery was confined to purling brooks trim gardens artificial grottos and the shades of windsor forest accordingly his homer although a beautiful and sparkling poem is not a satisfactory translation of the iliad and still less of the odyssey he has trailed along the naked lances of the homeric lines so many flowers and leaves that you can hardly recognise them and feel that their point is deadened and their power gone this at least is our opinion although many to this day continue to admire these translations and have even said that if they are not homer they are something better  the iliad took him six years and was a work which cost him much anxiety as well as labour the more as his scholarship was far from profound he was assisted in the undertaking by parnell who wrote the life of homer by broome jortin and others the first volume appeared in june 1715 and the other volumes followed at irregular intervals he began it in 1712 his twentyfifth year and finished it in 1718 his thirtieth year previous to its appearance his remuneration for his poems had been small and his circumstances were embarrassed but the result of the subscription which amounted to £5320 4s rendered him independent for life  while at binfield he had often visited london and there in the society of howe garth parnell and the rest used to indulge in occasional excesses which did his feeble constitution no good and once according to colley cibber he narrowly escaped a serious scrape in a house of a certain descriptioncolley by his own account helping out the tomtit for the sake of homer this statement indeed pope has denied but his veracity was by no means his strongest point after writing a farewell to london he retired in 1715 to twickenham along with his parents and remained there cultivating his garden digging his grottos and diversifying his walks till the end of his days  some years before he had become acquainted with lady mary wortley montague the most brilliant woman of her agewitty fascinating beautiful and accomplishedfull of enterprise and spirit too although decidedly french in her tastes manners and character pope fell violently in love with her and had her undoubtedly in his eye when writing eloisa and abelard which he did at oxford in 1716 shortly after her going abroad and which appeared the next year his passion was not requitednay was treated with contempt and ridicule and he became in after years a bitter enemy and foulmouthed detractor of the lady although after her return in 1718 she resided near him at twickenham and they seemed outwardly on good terms  in 1717 and the succeeding year pope lost successively his father parnell garth and rowe and bitterly felt their loss he finished as we have seen the iliad in 1718 but the fifth and sixth volumes which were the last did not appear till 1720 its success which at the time was triumphant roused against him the whole host of envy and detraction dennis and all grub street with him were moved to assail him pamphlets after pamphlets were published all of which after reading with writhing anguish pope had the resolution to bind up into volumesa great collection of calumny which he preserved probably for purposes of future revenge his own friends on the other hand hailed his work with applausegay writing a most graceful and elegant poem in ottava rima entitled mr popes welcome home from greece in which his different friends are pictured as receiving him home on the shores of britain after an absence of six years bentley that stern old grecian avoided the extremes of a howling grub street on the one hand and a flattering aristocracy on the other and expressed what is we think the just opinion when he said it is a pretty poem but it is not homer  in 1721 he issued a selection from the poems of parnell and prefixed a very beautiful dedication to the earl of oxford commencing with  such were the notes thy onceloved poet sung till death untimely stoppd his tuneful tongue oh just beheld and lost admired and mournd with softest manners gentlest arts adornd  in 1722 he engaged to translate the odyssey he employed broome and fenton as his assistants in the work and the portions translated by them were thought as good as his he remunerated them very handsomely of this work the first three quarto volumes appeared in 1725 and the fourth and fifth which completed the work the following year pope sold the copyright to lintot for £600  he was busy at this time too with an edition of shakspearenot quite worthy of either poet it appeared in six volumes quarto in 1725 his preface was good but he was deficient in antiquarian lore and his mortification was extreme when theobald destined to figure in the dunciad a mere plodding hack not only in his shakspeare restored exposed many blunders in popes edition but issued some years afterwards an edition of his own which was much better received by the public  in 1726 there was a great gathering of the tory wits at twickenham swift had come from ireland and resided for some time with pope bolingbroke came over occasionally from dawley and gay was often there to laugh with and be laughed at by the rest swift had gullivers travelsthe most ingenious and elaborate libel against man and god ever writtenin his pocket nearly ready for publication and we may conceive the grim sardonic smile with which he read it to his friends and their tumultuous mirth gay was projecting his beggars opera and pope preparing some of his witty miscellanies at the end of two months the dean was hurried home by the tidings of stellas illness he left the travels behind him for the copyright of which pope procured £300a sum counted then very large and which swift generously handed over to pope  in september this year when returning in lord bolingbrokes coach from dawley the poet was overturned in a little rivulet near twickenhan and nearly drowned the unfortunate little man one is reminded of gullivers accident in the brobdignagian creampot in trying to break the glasses of the coach which were down he severely cut his right hand and lost the use of two of his fingersan addition to his other deformities not very desirable and we suspect that pope thought voltaire who had met him at bolingbrokes but a miserable comforter when in a letter of pretended condolence he askedis it possible that those fingers which have written the rape of the lock and dressed homer so becomingly in an english coat should have been so barbarously treated let the hand of dennis or of your poetasters be cut off yours is sacred it was perhaps in keeping that those mutilated fingers were soon to be employed in attacking dennis and that the embittered poet was about with the half of his hand but with the whole of his heart to write the dunciad  in the end of april 1727 we find swift again in twickenham where his irritation at the continued ascendancy of sir robert walpole served to infuse more venom into the miscellanies concocted between him and popetwo volumes of which appeared in june this year gay also and the ingenious and admirable dr arbuthnot contributed their quota to these volumes swift speedily fell ill with that giddiness and deafness which were the avantcouriers of his final malady and in august he left twickenham and in october london and england for ever  in these miscellanies there appeared the famous memoirs of martinus scriblerus written chiefly by pope in which he lashed the various proficients in the bathos under the names of flying fishes swallows parrots frogs eels c and appended the initials of wellknown authors to each head this roused grub street whose malice had nearly fallen asleep into fresh fury and he was bitterly assailed in every possible form like hyder ali he nowto travesty burkein the recesses of a mind capacious of such things determined to leave all duncedom an everlasting monument of vengeance and became at length so confident of his force so collected in his might that he made no secret whatever of his dreadful resolution but compounding all the materials of fun sarcasm irony and invective into one black cloud he hung for a while on the declivities of richmond hill and whilst the authors were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its contents on the garrets of grub street then issued a scene of ludicrous woe the like of which no eye had seen no heart conceived and which no tongue can adequately tell all the horrors of literary war before known or heard ofmacflecknoe the rehearsal cwere mercy to the new tempest of havoc which burst from the brain of this remorseless poet a storm of universal laughter filled every booksellers shop and penetrated into the remotest attics the miserable dunces in part were stricken mad with ragein part dumb with consternation some fled for refuge to ale and others to ink while not a few fell or feared to fall into the jaws of famine this singular poem was written in 1727 it was first printed surreptitiously ie with the connivance of the author in dublin and then reprinted in london the first perfect edition however did not appear in london till 1729 on the day of its publication according to pope a crowd of authors besieged the publishers shop and by entreaties threats nay cries of treason tried to hinder its appearance what a scene it must have beenof teeth gnashing above ragged coats and eyes glaring through old periwigsof faces livid with famine and ferocity while to complete the confusion hawkers booksellers and even lords were mixed with the crowd clamouring for its issue and as says pope there is no stopping a torrent with a finger out it came the consequence he had foreseen a universal howl of rage and pain burst from the aggrieved dunces on whose naked sides the hot pitch had fallen they pushed their rejoinders beyond the limits of civilised literary warfare and although pope had been coarse in his language they were coarser far and their blackguardism was not redeemed by wit or genius pope felt or seemed to feel entire indifference as to these assaults on some of them indeed he could afford to look down with contempt on account of their obvious animus and gross language others again were neutralised by the fact that their authors had provoked reprisals by their previous insults or ingratitude to pope many however were too obscure for his notice and some such as aaron hill and bentley did not deserve to be classed with the theobalds and ralphs to hill he after some finessing was compelled to make an apology altogether although this production increased popes fame and the conception of his power it did not tend to shew him in the most amiable light or perhaps to promote his own comfort or peace of mind after having emptied out his bile in the dunciad he ought to have become mellower in temper and resigned satire for ever he continued on the contrary as illnatured as before and although he afterwards flew at higher game the iron had entered into his soul and he remained a satirist and therefore an unhappy man for life  in 1731 appeared an epistle on taste which was very favourably received only his enemies accused him of having satirised the duke of chandos in ita man who had befriended pope and had lent him money pope denied the charge although it is very possible both from his own temperament and from the frequent occurrence of similar cases of baseness in literary life that it may have been true nothing is more common than for those who have been most liberally helped to become first the secret and then the open enemies of their benefactors in 1732 appeared his epistle on the use of riches addressed to lord bathurst these two epistles were afterwards incorporated in his moral essays  as far back as 1725 pope had been revolving the subject of the essay on man and indeed some of its couplets remind you of pebbles which had long been rolled over and polished in the ocean of his mind it has been asserted but not proved that lord bolingbroke gave him the outline of this essay in prose it is unquestionable indeed that bolingbroke exercised influence over popes mind and may have suggested some of the thoughts in the essay but it is not probable that a man like pope would have set himself on such a subject simply to translate from anothers mind he published the first epistle of the essay in 1732 anonymously as an experiment and had the satisfaction to see it successful it was received with rapture and passed through several editions ere the author was known although we must say that the value of this reception is considerably lessened when we remember that the critics could not have been very acute who did not detect popes fine roman hand in every sentence of this brilliant but most unsatisfactory and shallow performance  in the same year died dear simpleminded gay who found in pope a sincere mourner and an elegant elegiast and on the 7th of june 1733 expired good old mrs pope at the age of ninetyfour pope who had always been a dutiful son erected an obelisk in his own grounds to her memory with a simple but striking inscription in latin during this year he published the third part of the essay on man an epistle to lord cobham on the knowledge and characters of man and an imitation of the first satire of the second book of horace in this last he attacks in the most brutal style his former love lady mary w montague who replied in a piece of coarse cleverness entitled verses to the imitator of the first satire of the second book of horaceverses in which she was assisted by lord harvey another of popes victims he wrote but was prudent enough to suppress an ironical reply  in 1734 appeared his very clever and highlyfinished epistle to dr arbuthnot now entitled the prologue to the satires who was then languishing toward death arbuthnot from his deathbed solemnly advised pope to regulate his satire and seems to have been afraid of his personal safety from his numerous foes pope replied in a manly but selfdefensive style he is said about this time to have in his walks carried arms and had a large dog as his protector but none of the dunces had courage enough to assail him dennis who was no dunce might have ventured on itbut he had become miserably infirm poor and blind and pope had heaped coals of fire on his head by contributing a prologue to a play which was acted for his behoof  our authors life becomes now little else than a record of multiplying labours and increasing infirmities in 1734 appeared the fourth part of the essay on man and the second satire of the second book of horace in 1735 were issued his characters of women an epistle to a lady martha blount in this appears his famous character of atossathe duchess of marlborough it is saidwe fear too trulythat these lines being shewn to her grace as a character of the duchess of buckingham she recognised in them her own likeness and bribed pope with a thousand pounds to suppress it he did so religiouslyas long as she was aliveand then published it in the same year he printed a second volume of his miscellaneous works in folio and quarto uniform with the iliad and odyssey including a versification of the satires of donne also anonymously a production disgraceful to his memory entitled sober advice from horace to the young gentlemen about town in which he commits many gross indecorums of language and annexes the name of the great bentley to several indecent notes it is said that bentley when he read the pamphlet cried tis an impudent dog but i talked against his homer and the portentous cub never forgives  the essay on man and the moral epistles were designed to be parts of a great system of ethics which pope had long revolved in his mind and wished to incarnate in poetry at this time occurred the strange mysterious circumstances connected with the publication of his letters it seems that in 1729 pope had recalled from his correspondents the letters he had written them of many of which he had kept no copies he was induced to this by the fact that after henry cromwells death his mistress mrs thomas who was in indigent circumstances had sold the letters which had passed between pope and her keeper to curll the bookseller who had published them without scruple when pope obtained his correspondence he according to his own statement burned a great many and laid past the others after having had a copy of them taken and deposited in lord oxfords library and his charge against curll was that he obtained surreptitiously some of these letters and published them without popes consent but ere we come to the circumstances of the publication several other things require to be noticed in 1733 curll anxious to publish a life of pope advertised for information and in consequence one pt who professed to be an old friend of popes and his fathers wrote curll a letter giving an account of popes ancestry which tallied exactly with what pope himself in a note to one of his poems furnished the following year pt in a second letter offered to the publisher a large collection of popes letters and inclosed a copy of an advertisement he had drawn out to be published by curll strange as it seems curll took no notice of the proposal till 1735 when having accidentally turned up a copy of pts advertisement he sent it to pope with a letter requesting an interview and mentioning that he had some papers of pts in reference to his family history which he would shew him pope replied by three advertisements in the papers denying all knowledge of pt or his collection of letters or mss pt then wrote curll that he had printed the letters at his own expense seeking a sum of money for them and appointing an interview at a tavern to shew him the sheets this was countermanded the next day pt professing to be afraid of pope and his bravoes although how pope was to know of this meeting was according to curll the cream of the jest  soon after a round fat man with a clergymans gown and a barristers band called on curll at ten oclock at night he said his name was smith that he was a cousin of pts and shewed the book in sheets along with about a dozen of the original letters after a good deal of negotiation with this personage curll obtained fifty copies of pts printed copies and issued a flaming advertisement announcing the publication of popes letters for thirty years and stating that the original mss were lying at his shop and might be seen by any who chosealthough not a single ms seems to have been delivered smith the day that the advertisement appeared handed over for a sum of money about three hundred volumes to curll but as in the advertisement it was stated that various letters of lords were included and as there is a law amongst regulations of the upper house that no peers letters can be published without his consent at the instance of the earl of jersey and in consequence too of an advertisement of popes the books were seized and curll and the printer of the paper where the advertisement appeared were ordered to appear at the bar for breach of privilege pt wrote curll to tell him to conceal all that passed between him and the publisher and promising him more valuable letters still curll however told the whole story and as when the books were examined not a single lords letter was found among them curll was acquitted his books restored to him the lords saying that they had been made the tools of pope and he proceeded to advertise the correspondence in terms most insulting to pope who now felt himself compelled  to print by subscription his genuine letters which when printed turned out strange to tell to be identical with those published by the rapacious bookseller on viewing the whole transaction we incline with johnson warton bowles macaulay and carruthers to look upon it as one of popes apelike stratagemsto believe that pt was himself smith his agent and that his objects were partly to outwit curll to mystify the public to gratify that strange love of manoeuvring which dwelt as strongly in him as in any matchmaking mamma and to attract interest and attention to the genuine correspondence when it should appear pope it was said could not drink tea without a stratagem and far less publish his correspondence without a series of contemptible trickstricks however in which he was true to his naturethat being a curious compound of the woman and the wit the monkey and the genius1  in 1737 four of his imitations of horace were published and in the next year appeared two dialogues each entitled 1738 which now form the epilogue to the satires one of them was issued on the same day with johnsons london in that year too he published his universal prayera singular specimen of latitudinarian thought expressed in a loose simplicity of language quite unusual with its author the next year he had intended to signalise by a third dialogue which he commenced in a vigorous style but which he did not finish owing to the dread of a prosecution before the lords and with the exception of letters one of them interesting as his last to swift his pen was altogether idle in 1740 he did nothing but edit an edition of select italian poets this year crousaz a swiss professor of note having attacked we think most justly the essay on man as a mere pagan prolusiona thin philosophical smile cast on the gordian knot of the mystery of the universe instead of a sword cutting or trying to cut it in sunderwarburton a man of much talent and learning but of more astuteness and anxiety to exalt himself came forward to the rescue and with a mixture of casuistical cunning and real ingenuity tried as some one has it to make pope a christian although even in warburtons hands like the dying donald bane in waverley he makes but a queer christian after all and his system essentially pantheistic contrives to ignore the grand scripture principles of a fall of a divine redeemer of a future world and the glorious light or darkness which these and other christian doctrines cast upon the mystery of man if however warburton with all his scholastic subtlety failed to make pope a christian he made him a warm friend allen popes acquaintance a rich fatherinlaw and himself by and by the bishop of gloucester sophistry has seldom although sometimes been thus richly rewarded  the last scene of popes tiny and tortured existence was now at hand but ere it closed it must close like drydens characteristically with an authors quarrel colley cibber had long been a favourite of popes ire and had as often retorted scorn till at last by laughing upon the stage at popes play partly gays entitled three hours after marriage he roused the bard almost to frenzy and pope set to work to remodel the dunciad and dethroning theobald set up cibber as the lawful king of the dulla most unfortunate substitution since while theobald was the ideal of stolid solemn stupidity cibber was gay light pert and clever full of pluck too and who overflowed in reply with pamphlets which gave pope both a headache and a heartache whenever he perused them  pope had never been strong and for many years the variety and multitude of his frailties had been increasing he had habitually all his life been tormented with headaches for which he found the steam of strong coffee the chief remedy he had hurt his stomach too by indulging in excess of stimulating viands such as potted lampreys and in copious and frequent drams he was assailed at last by dropsy and asthma and on the 30th of may 1744 he breathed his last fiftysix years of age he had long he said been tired of the world and died with philosophic composure and serenity he took the sacrament according to the form of the roman catholic church but merely he said because it looked right a little before his death he called for his desk and began an essay on the immortality of the soul and on those material things which tend to weaken or to strengthen it for immortality enumerating generous wines as among the latter influences and spirituous liquors among the former his last words were there is nothing that is meritorious but virtue and friendship and indeed friendship itself is only a part of virtue thus motionless and moanless without a word about christthe slightest syllable of repentanceand with a scrap of heathen morality in his mouth died the brilliant alexander pope who is ready to say may my last end be like his his favourite martha blount behaved according to some accounts with disgusting unconcern on the occasion so true it is there is no friendship among the wicked even although the heartless bolingbroke too was by and seems to have succeeded in squeezing out some crocodile tears as he bent over the dying poet and said o god what is man his remains were according to his wish deposited in twickenham church near his parents where the single letter p on the stone alone distinguishes the spot  popes character apart from his poetry which we intend criticising in our next volume was not specially interesting or elevated he was a spoiled child a small selftormentorfull to bursting with petty spites mean animosities and unfounded jealousies while he sought with the fury of a pampered slave to trample on those authors that were beneath him in rank or in popularity he could on all occasions fawn with the sycophancy of a eunuch upon the noble the rich and the powerful hazlitt speaks of moore as a pugdog barking from the lap of a lady of quality at inferior passengers the description is far more applicable to pope we have much allowance to make for the influence exerted on his mind by his singularly crooked frame and sickly habit of body by his position as belonging to a proscribed faith and by his want of training in a public school but after all these deductions we cannot but deplore the spectacle of one of the finest clearest and sharpest minds that england ever produced so frequently reminding you of a bright sting set in the body and steeped in the venom of a wasp and yet withal he possessed many virtues which endeared him to a multitude of friends he was a kind son he was a faithful and devoted friend he loved if not man yet many men with deep tenderness a keen politician he was not but so far as he went along with his party he was true to the common cause in morals he was greatly superior in point of external decorum to most of the wits of the time but in falsehood finesse treachery and envy he stood at the bottom of the list without that plea of poverty or wretchedness or despair which so many of them might have urged uneasy indeed he always and unhappy he often was but very much of his uneasiness and unhappiness sprung from his own fault he attacked others and could not bear to be attacked in return he was a bully and a coward he threw himself into a thornhedge and was amazed that he came out covered with scratches and blood while he shone in satirising many kinds of vice he laid himself open to retort by his own want of delicacy he as well as swift was fond of alluding in his verse to polluted and forbidden things there and there alone his taste deserted him and there is something disgusting and unnatural in the combination of the elegant and the obscenethe coarse in sentiment and the polished in style and whatever may be said for many of the amiable traits of the man there is very little to be said for the general tendencyso far as healthy morality and christian

expectations the first seem to fancy that the world must approve whatever they produce and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate methinks as on the one hand no single man is born with a right of controlling the opinions of all the rest so on the other the world has no title to demand that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment therefore i cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal obligations for as much fame or pleasure as each affords the other  every one acknowledges it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted by the judgment commonly passed upon poems a critic supposes he has done his part if he proves a writer to have failed in an expression or erred in any particular point and can it then be wondered at if the poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves in any error for as long as one side will make no allowances the other will be brought to no acknowledgments  i am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is illplaced poetry and criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world but only the affair of idle men who write in their closets and of idle men who read there  yet sure upon the whole a bad author deserves better usage than a bad critic for a writers endeavour for the most part is to please his readers and he fails merely through the misfortune of an ill judgment but such a critics is to put them out of humoura design he could never go upon without both that and an ill temper  i think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets what we call a genius is hard to be distinguished by a man himself from a strong inclination and if his genius be ever so great he cannot at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken the only method he has is to make the experiment by writing and appealing to the judgment of others now if he happens to write ill which is certainly no sin in itself he is immediately made an object of ridicule i wish we had the humanity to reflect that even the worst authors might in their endeavour to please us deserve something at our hands we have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances their particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere and the rest of the world in general is too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of this happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them for what is the hardest case imaginable the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world and people will establish their opinion of us from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us  on the other hand a good poet no sooner communicates his works with the same desire of information but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous if he is made to hope he may please the world he falls under very unlucky circumstances for from the moment he prints he must expect to hear no more truth than if he were a prince or a beauty if he has not very good sense and indeed there are twenty men of wit for one man of sense his living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of becoming a coxcomb if he has he will consequently have so much diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise since if it be given to his face it can scarce be distinguished from flattery and if in his absence it is hard to be certain of it were he sure to be commended by the best and most knowing he is as sure of being envied by the worst and most ignorant which are the majority for it is with a fine genius as with a fine fashion all those are displeased at it who are not able to follow it and it is to be feared that esteem will seldom do any man so much good as illwill does him harm then there is a third class of people who make the largest part of mankind those of ordinary or indifferent capacities and these to a man will hate or suspect him a hundred honest gentlemen will dread him as a wit and a hundred innocent women as a satirist in a word whatever be his fate in poetry it is ten to one but he must give up all the reasonable aims of life for it there are indeed some advantages accruing from a genius to poetry and they are all i can think of the agreeable power of selfamusement when a man is idle or alone the privilege of being admitted into the best company and the freedom of saying as many careless things as other people without being so severely remarked upon  i believe if any one early in his life should contemplate the dangerous fate of authors he would scarce be of their number on any consideration the life of a wit is a warfare upon earth and the present spirit of the learned world is such that to attempt to serve it any way one must have the constancy of a martyr and a resolution to suffer for its sake i could wish people would believe what i am pretty certain they will not that i have been much less concerned about fame than i durst declare till this occasion when methinks i should find more credit than i could heretofore since my writings have had their fate already and it is too late to think of prepossessing the reader in their favour i would plead it as some merit in me that the world has never been prepared for these trifles by prefaces biased by recommendations dazzled with the names of great patrons wheedled with fine reasons and pretences or troubled with excuses i confess it was want of consideration that made me an author i writ because it amused me i corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write and i published because i was told i might please such as it was a credit to please to what degree i have done this i am really ignorant i had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at first and too much judgment to be pleased with them at last but i have reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long or which deserves to do so for they have always fallen short not only of what i read of others but even of my own ideas of poetry  if any one should imagine i am not in earnest i desire him to reflect that the ancients to say the least of them had as much genius as we and that to take more pains and employ more time cannot fail to produce more complete pieces they constantly applied themselves not only to that art but to that single branch of an art to which their talent was most powerfully bent and it was the business of their lives to correct and finish their works for posterity if we can pretend to have used the same industry let us expect the same immortality though if we took the same care we should still lie under a further misfortune they writ in languages that became universal and everlasting while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration a mighty foundation for our pride when the utmost we can hope is but to be read in one island and to be thrown aside at the end of one age  all that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the ancients and it will be found true that in every age the highest character for sense and learning has been obtained by those who have been most indebted to them for to say truth whatever is very good sense must have been common sense in all times and what we call learning is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own because they resemble the ancients may as well say our faces are not our own because they are like our fathers and indeed it is very unreasonable that people should expect us to be scholars and yet be angry to find us so  i fairly confess that i have served myself all i could by reading that i made use of the judgment of authors dead and living that i omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors both by my friends and enemies but the true reason these pieces are not more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and i have to live one may be ashamed to consume half ones days in bringing sense and rhyme together and what critic can be so unreasonable as not to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment or more agreeable amusement  the only plea i shall use for the favour of the public is that i have as great a respect for it as most authors have for themselves and that i have sacrificed much of my own selflove for its sake in preventing not only many mean things from seeing the light but many which i thought tolerable i would not be like those authors who forgive themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole poem and vice versâ a whole poem for the sake of some particular lines i believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the power of rejecting his own thoughts and it must be this if anything that can give me a chance to be one for what i have published i can only hope to be pardoned but for what i have burned i deserve to be praised on this account the world is under some obligation to me and owes me the justice in return to look upon no verses as mine that are not inserted in this collection and perhaps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really so but to avoid the imputation of so many dull and immoral things as partly by malice and partly by ignorance have been ascribed to me i must further acquit myself of the presumption of having lent my name to recommend any miscellanies or works of other men a thing i never thought becoming a person who has hardly credit enough to answer for his own  in this office of collecting my pieces i am altogether uncertain whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument or burying the dead if time shall make it the former may these poems as long as they last remain as a testimony that their author never made his talents subservient to the mean and unworthy ends of party or selfinterest the gratification of public prejudices or private passions the flattery of the undeserving or the insult of the unfortunate if i have written well let it be considered that tis what no man can do without good sensea quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer but a good man and if i have made any acquisition in the opinion of any one under the notion of the former let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter  but if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my remains i desire it may be known that i die in charity and in my senses without any murmurs against the justice of this age or any mad appeals to posterity i declare i shall think the world in the right and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings not so much as wishing so irrational a thing as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit however i desire it may then be considered that there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of fiveandtwenty so that my youth may be made as it never fails to be in executions a case of compassion that i was never so concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print believing if any thing was good it would defend itself and what was bad could never be defended that i used no artifice to raise or continue a reputation depreciated no dead author i was obliged to bribed no living one with unjust praise insulted no adversary with ill language or when i could not attack a rivals works encouraged reports against his morals to conclude if this volume perish let it serve as a warning to the critics not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves and a memento mori to some of my vain cotemporaries the poets to teach them that when real merit is wanting it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great commended by the eminent and favoured by the public in general  november 10 1716   variations in the authors manuscript preface   after the words severely remarked on p 2 l 41 it followed thusfor my part i confess had i seen things in this view at first the public had never been troubled either with my writings or with this apology for them i am sensible how difficult it is to speak of ones self with decency but when a man must speak of himself the best way is to speak truth of himself or he may depend upon it others will do it for him ill therefore make this preface a general confession of all my thoughts of my own poetry resolving with the same freedom to expose myself as it is in the power of any other to expose them in the first place i thank god and nature that i was born with a love to poetry for nothing more conduces to fill up all the intervals of our time or if rightly used to make the whole course of life entertaining cantantes licet usque minus via laedet tis a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head the only pleasures in which a man is sufficient to himself and the only part of him which to his satisfaction he can employ all day long the muses are amicae omnium horarum and like our gay acquaintance the best company in the world as long as one expects no real service from them i confess there was a time when i was in love with myself and my first productions were the children of selflove upon innocence i had made an epic poem and panegyrics on all the princes in europe and thought myself the greatest genius that ever was i cant but regret those delightful visions of my childhood which like the fine colours we see when our eyes are shut are vanished for ever many trials and sad experience have so undeceived me by degrees that i am utterly at a loss at what rate to value myself as for fame i shall be glad of any i can get and not repine at any i miss and as for vanity i have enough to keep me from hanging myself or even from wishing those hanged who would take it away it was this that made me write the sense of my faults made me correct  after the words angry to find us so p 3 l 36 occurred the followingin the first place i own that i have used my best endeavours to the finishing these pieces that i made what advantage i could of the judgment of authors dead and living and that i omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies and that i expect no favour on account of my youth business want of health or any such idle excuses but the true reason they are not yet more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and i have to live a man that can expect but sixty years may be ashamed to employ thirty in measuring syllables and bringing sense and rhyme together to spend our youth in pursuit of riches or fame in hopes to enjoy them when we are old and when we are old we find it is too late to enjoy any thing i therefore hope the wits will pardon me if i reserve some of my time to save my soul and that some wise men will be of my opinion even if i should think a part of it better spent in the enjoyments of life than in pleasing the critics     pastorals  with a discourse on pastoral poetry3  written in the year mdcciv   rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes flumina amem sylvasque inglorius  virg    there are not i believe a greater number of any sort of verses than of those which are called pastorals nor a smaller than of those which are truly so it therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind of poem and it is my design to comprise in this short paper the substance of those numerous dissertations the critics have made on the subject without omitting any of their rules in my own favour you will also find some points reconciled about which they seem to differ and a few remarks which i think have escaped their observation  the original of poetry is ascribed to that age which succeeded the creation of the world and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind the most ancient sort of poetry was probably pastoral it is natural to imagine that the leisure of those ancient shepherds admitting and inviting some diversion none was so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as singing and that in their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity from hence a poem was invented and afterwards improved to a perfect image of that happy time which by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a former age might recommend them to the present and since the life of shepherds was attended with more tranquility than any other rural employment the poets chose to introduce their persons from whom it received the name of pastoral  a pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd or one considered under that character the form of this imitation is dramatic or narrative or mixed of both the fable simple the manners not too polite nor too rustic the thoughts are plain yet admit a little quickness and passion but that short and flowing the expression humble yet as pure as the language will afford neat but not florid easy and yet lively in short the fable manners thoughts and expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature  the complete character of this poem consists in simplicity brevity and delicacy the two first of which render an eclogue natural and the last delightful  if we would copy nature it may be useful to take this idea along with us that pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age so that we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are but as they may be conceived then to have been when the best of men followed the employment to carry this resemblance yet further it would not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy as far as it may be useful to that sort of life and an air of piety to the gods should shine through the poem which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writing the connexion should be loose the narrations and descriptions short and the periods concise yet it is not sufficient that the sentences only be brief the whole eclogue should be so too for we cannot suppose poetry in those days to have been the business of men but their recreation at vacant hours  but with respect to the present age nothing more conduces to make these composures natural than when some knowledge in rural affairs is discovered this may be made to appear rather done by chance than on design and sometimes is best shown by inference lest by too much study to seem natural we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the delight for what is inviting in this sort of poetry proceeds not so much from the idea of that business as of the tranquility of a country life  we must therefore use some illusion to render a pastoral delightful and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherds life and in concealing its miseries nor is it enough to introduce shepherds discoursing together in a natural way but a regard must be had to the subjectthat it contain some particular beauty in itself and that it be different in every eclogue besides in each of them a designed scene or prospect is to be presented to our view which should likewise have its variety this variety is obtained in a great degree by frequent comparisons drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country by interrogations to things inanimate by beautiful digressions but those short sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances and lastly by elegant turns on the words which render the numbers extremely sweet and pleasing as for the numbers themselves though they are properly of the heroic measure they should be the smoothest the most easy and flowing imaginable  it is by rules like these that we ought to judge of pastorals and since the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfection they must of necessity be derived from those in whom it is acknowledged so to be it is therefore from the practice of theocritus and virgil the only undisputed authors of pastoral that the critics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it  theocritus excels all others in nature and simplicity the subjects of his idyllia are purely pastoral but he is not so exact in his persons having introduced reapers and fishermen as well as shepherds he is apt to be too long in his descriptions of which that of the cup in the first pastoral is a remarkable instance in the manners he seems a little defective for his swains are sometimes abusive and immodest and perhaps too much inclining to rusticity for instance in his fourth and fifth idyllia but tis enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him and that his dialect alone has a secret charm in it which no other could ever attain  virgil who copies theocritus refines upon his original and in all points where judgment is principally concerned he is much superior to his master  though some of his subjects are not pastoral in themselves but only seem to be such they have a wonderful variety in them which the greek was a stranger to he exceeds him in regularity and brevity and falls short of him in nothing but simplicity and propriety of style the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age and the last of his language  among the moderns their success has been greatest who have most endeavoured to make these ancients their pattern the most considerable genius appears in the famous tasso and our spenser tasso in his aminta has as far excelled all the pastoral writers as in his gierusalemme he has outdone the epic poets of his country but as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poemthe pastoral comedyin italy it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the ancients spensers calendar in mr drydens opinion is the most complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of virgil not but that he may be thought imperfect in some few points his eclogues are somewhat too long if we compare them with the ancients he is sometimes too allegorical and treats of matters of religion in a pastoral style as the mantuan had done before him he has employed the lyric measure which is contrary to the practice of the old poets his stanza is not still the same nor always well chosen this last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough for the tetrastic has obliged him to extend his sense to the length of four lines which would have been more closely confined in the couplet  in the manners thoughts and characters he comes near to theocritus himself though notwithstanding all the care he has taken he is certainly inferior in his dialect for the doric had its beauty and propriety in the time of theocritus it was used in part of greece and frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons whereas the old english and country phrases of spenser were either entirely obsolete or spoken only by people of the lowest condition as there is a difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity so the expression of simple thoughts should be plain but not clownish the addition he has made of a calendar to his eclogues is very beautiful since by this besides the general moral of innocence and simplicity which is common to other authors of pastoral he has one peculiar to himselfhe compares human life to the several seasons and at once exposes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds in their various changes and aspects yet the scrupulous division of his pastorals into months has obliged him either to repeat the same description in other words for three months together or when it was exhausted before entirely to omit it whence it comes to pass that some of his eclogues as the sixth eighth and tenth for example have nothing but their titles to distinguish them the reason is evidentbecause the year has not that variety in it to furnish every month with a particular description as it may every season  of the following eclogues i shall only say that these four comprehend all the subjects which the critics upon theocritus and virgil will allow to be fit for pastoral that they have as much variety of description in respect of the several seasons as spensers that in order to add to this variety the several times of the day are observed the rural employments in each season or time of day and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments not without some regard to the several ages of man and the different passions proper to each age  but after all if they have any merit it is to be attributed to some good old authors whose works as i had leisure to study so i hope i have not wanted care to imitate    spring  the first pastoral or damon  to sir william trumbull4   first in these fields i try the sylvan

coming of christ and the felicities attending it i could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts and those in the pollio of virgil this will not seem surprising when we reflect that the eclogue was taken from a sibylline prophecy on the same subject one may judge that virgil did not copy it line by line but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece i have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him though without admitting anything of my own since it was written with this particular view that the reader by comparing the several thoughts might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet but as i fear i have prejudiced them by my management i shall subjoin the passages of isaiah and those of virgil under the same disadvantage of a literal translation   ye nymphs of solyma begin the song to heavenly themes

themselves excel and censure freely who have written well authors are partial to their wit tis true but are not critics to their judgment too  yet if we look more closely we shall find most have the seeds of judgment in their mind           20 nature affords at least a glimmering light the lines though touchd but faintly are drawn right but as the slightest sketch if justly traced is by ill colouring but the more disgraced so by false learning is good sense defaced some are bewilderd in the maze of schools and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools in search of wit these lose their common sense and then turn critics in their own defence each burns alike who can or cannot write              30 or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite all fools have still an itching to deride and fain would be upon the laughing side if maevius scribble in apollos spite there are who judge still worse than he can write  some have at first for wits then poets passd turnd critics next and proved plain fools at last some neither can for wits nor critics pass as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass those halflearnd witlings numerous in our isle       40 as halfformd insects on the banks of nile unfinished things one knows not what to call their generations so equivocal to tell em would a hundred tongues require or one vain wits that might a hundred tire  but you who seek to give and merit fame and justly bear a critics noble name be sure yourself and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet           50 and mark that point where sense and dulness meet  nature to all things fixd the limits fit and wisely curbd proud mans pretending wit as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy

rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools whatever nature has in worth denied she gives in large recruits of needless pride for as in bodies thus in souls we find what wants in blood and spirits swelld with wind pride where wit fails steps in to our defence and fills up all the mighty void of sense              210 if once right reason drives that cloud away truth breaks upon us with resistless day trust not yourself but your defects to know make use of every friendand every foe  a little learning is a dangerous thing drink deep or taste not the pierian spring there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain and drinking largely sobers us again fired at first sight with what the muse imparts in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts         220 while from the bounded level of our mind short views we take nor see the lengths behind but more advanced behold with strange surprise new distant scenes of endless science rise so pleased at first the towering alps we try mount oer the vales and seem to tread the sky the eternal snows appear already past and the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attaind we tremble to survey the growing labours of the lengthend way              230 the increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes hills peep oer hills and alps on alps arise  a perfect judge will read each work of wit with the same spirit that its author writ survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find where nature moves and rapture warms the mind nor lose for that malignant dull delight the generous pleasure to be charmd with wit but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow correctly cold and regularly low                      240 that shunning faults one quiet tenor keep we cannot blame indeedbut we may sleep in wit as nature what affects our hearts is not the exactness of peculiar parts tis not a lip or eye we beauty call but the joint force and full result of all thus when we view some wellproportiond dome the worlds just wonder and even thine o rome no single parts unequally surprise all comes united to th admiring eyes                  250 no monstrous height or breadth or length appear the whole at once is bold and regular  whoever thinks a faultless piece to see thinks what neer was nor is nor eer shall be in every work regard the writers end since none can compass more than they intend and if the means be just the conduct true applause in spite of trivial faults is due as men of breeding sometimes men of wit to avoid great errors must the less commit            260 neglect the rules each verbal critic lays for not to know some trifles is a praise most critics fond of some subservient art still make the whole depend upon a part they talk of principles but notions prize and all to one loved folly sacrifice  once on a time la manchas knight14 they say a certain bard encountering on the way discoursed in terms as just with looks as sage as eer could dennis of the grecian stage             270

the stagyrite               280 not so by heaven he answers in a rage knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage so vast a throng the stage can neer contain then build a new or act it in a plain  thus critics of less judgment than caprice curious not knowing not exact but nice form short ideas and offend in arts as most in manners by a love to parts  some to conceit alone their taste confine and glittering thoughts struck out at every line       290 pleased with a work where nothings just or fit one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit poets like painters thus unskilld to trace the naked nature and the living grace with gold and jewels cover every part and hide with ornaments their want of art true wit is nature to advantage dressd what oft was thought but neer so well expressd something whose truth convinced at sight we find that gives us back the image of our mind               300 as shades more sweetly recommend the light so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit for works may have more wit than does em good as bodies perish through excess of blood  others for language all their care express and value books as women men for dress their praise is stillthe style is excellent the sense they humbly take upon content words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found            310 false eloquence like the prismatic glass its gaudy colours spreads on every place the face of nature we no more survey all glares alike without distinction gay but true expression like the unchanging sun clears and improves whateer it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable a vile conceit in pompous words expressd              320 is like a clown in regal purple dressd for different styles with different subjects sort as several garbs with country town and court some by old words to fame have made pretence ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense such labourd nothings in so strange a style amaze the unlearnd and make the learnèd smile unlucky as fungoso15 in the play these sparks with awkward vanity display what the fine gentleman wore yesterday                 330 and but so mimic ancient wits at best as apes our grandsires in their doublets dressd in words as fashions the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside  but most by numbers judge a poets song and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire her voice is all these tuneful fools admire            340 who haunt parnassus but to please their ear not mend their minds as some to church repair not for the doctrine but the music there these equal syllables alone require though oft the ear the open vowels tire while expletives their feeble aid do join and ten low words oft creep in one dull line while they ring round the same unvaried chimes with sure returns of still expected rhymes whereer you find the cooling western breeze         350 in the next line it whispers through the trees if crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep the readers threatend not in vain with sleep then at the last and only couplet fraught with some unmeaning thing they call a thought a needless alexandrine ends the song that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow and praise the easy vigour of a line                   360 where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join true ease in writing comes from art not chance as those move easiest who have learnd to dance tis not enough no harshness gives offence the sound must seem an echo to the sense soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw     370 the line too labours and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies oer the unbending corn and skims along the main hear how timotheus varied lays surprise and bid alternate passions fall and rise while at each change the son of libyan jove now burns with glory and then melts with love now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow persians and greeks like turns of nature found         380 and the worlds victor stood subdued by sound the power of music all our hearts allow and what timotheus16 was is dryden now  avoid extremes and shun the fault of such who still are pleased too little or too much at every trifle scorn to take offence that always shows great pride or little sense those heads as stomachs are not sure the best which nauseate all and nothing can digest yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move             390 for fools admire but men of sense approve as things seem large which we through mists descry dulness is ever apt to magnify  some foreign writers some our own despise the ancients only or the moderns prize thus wit like faith by each man is applied to one small sect and all are damnd beside meanly they seek the blessing to confine and force that sun but on a part to shine which not alone the southern wit sublimes              400 but ripens spirits in cold northern climes which from the first has shone on ages past enlights the present and shall warm the last though each may feel increases and decays and see now clearer and now darker days regard not then if wit be old or new but blame the false and value still the true  some neer advance a judgment of their own but catch the spreading notion of the town they reason and conclude by precedent                  410 and own stale nonsense which they neer invent some judge of authors names not works and then nor praise nor blame the writings but the men of all this servile herd the worst is he that in proud dulness joins with quality a constant critic at the great mans board to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord what woful stuff this madrigal would be in some starved hackney sonnetteer or me but let a lord once own the happy lines                 420 how the wit brightens how the style refines before his sacred name flies every fault and each exalted stanza teems with thought  the vulgar thus through imitation err as oft the learnd by being singular so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng by chance go right they purposely go wrong so schismatics the plain believers quit and are but damnd for having too much wit some praise at morning what they blame at night        430 but always think the last opinion right a muse by these is like a mistress used this hour shes idolised the next abused while their weak heads like towns unfortified twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say and still tomorrows wiser than today we think our fathers fools so wise we grow our wiser sons no doubt will think us so once schooldivines this zealous isle oerspread       440

reputation safe                 450 which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh  some valuing those of their own side or mind still make themselves the measure of mankind fondly we think we honour merit then when we but praise ourselves in other men parties in wit attend on those of state and public faction doubles private hate pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of

its way reflect new glories and augment the day20  be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend short is the date alas of modern rhymes and tis but just to let them live betimes no longer now that golden age appears when patriarchwits survived a thousand years now length of fame our second life is lost           480 and bare threescore is all even that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chaucer is shall dryden be so when the faithful pencil has designd some bright idea of the masters mind where a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colours soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light when mellowing years their full perfection give        490 and each bold figure just begins to live the treacherous colours the fair art betray and all the bright creation fades away  unhappy wit like most mistaken things atones not for that envy which it brings in youth alone its empty praise we boast but soon the shortlived vanity is lost like some fair flower the early spring supplies that gaily blooms but even in blooming dies what is this wit which must our cares employ          500 the owners wife that other men enjoy then most our trouble still when most admired and still the more we give the more required whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease sure some to vex but never all to please tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun by fools tis hated and by knaves undone  if wit so much from ignorance undergo ah let not learning too

soldiers too now they who reach parnassus lofty crown employ their pains to spurn some others down and while selflove each jealous writer rules contending wits become the sport of fools but still the

spleen and sour disdain discharge that rage on more provoking crimes nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times            530 no pardon vile obscenity should find though wit and art conspire to move your mind but dulness with obscenity must prove as shameful sure as impotence in love in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease sprung the rank weed and thrived with large increase when love was all

goodhumour enough to laugh not only at their sexs little unguarded follies but at their own but as it was communicated with the air of a secret it soon found its way into the world an imperfect copy

by your sex that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms  the rosicrucians are a people i must bring you acquainted with the best account i know of them is in a french book called le comte de gabalis which both in its title and size is so like a novel that many of the fair sex have read it for one by mistake according to these gentlemen the four elements are inhabited by spirits which they call sylphs gnomes nymphs and salamanders the gnomes or demons of earth delight in mischief but the sylphs whose habitation is in the air are the bestconditioned creatures

slander sounds through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies the dire report through every region flies in every ear incessant rumours rung and gathering scandals grew on every tongue from the black trumpets rusty concave broke sulphureous flames and clouds of rolling smoke the poisonous vapour blots the purple skies            340 and withers all

they were two of the most distinguished persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passion after a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion it was many years after this separation that a letter of abelards to a friend which contained the history of his misfortune fell into the hands of eloisa this awakening all her tenderness occasioned those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion   in these deep solitudes and awful cells where heavenlypensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its longforgotten heat yet yet i lovefrom abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name  dear fatal name rest ever unreveald nor pass these lips in holy silence seald              10 hide it my heart within that close disguise where mixd with gods his loved idea lies oh write it not my handthe name appears already writtenwash it out my tears in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays her heart still dictates and her hand obeys  relentless walls whose darksome round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn ye grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thorn         20 shrines where their vigils paleeyed virgins keep and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep though cold like you unmoved and silent grown i have not yet forgot myself to stone all is not heavens while abelard has part still rebel nature holds out half my heart nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain  soon as thy letters trembling i unclose that wellknown name awakens all my woes                30 oh name for ever sad for ever dear still breathed in sighs still usherd with a tear i tremble too whereer my own i find some dire misfortune follows close behind line after line my gushing eyes oerflow led through a sad variety of woe now warm in love now withering in my bloom lost in a convents solitary gloom there stern religion quenchd the unwilling flame there died the best of passions love and fame          40  yet write oh write me all that i may join griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine nor foes nor fortune take this power away and is my abelard less kind than they tears still are mine and those i need not spare love but demands what else were shed in prayer no happier task these faded eyes pursue to read and weep is all they now can do  then share thy pain allow that sad relief ah more than share it give me all thy grief           50 heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid some banishd lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to its fires the virgins wish without her fears impart excuse the blush and pour out all the heart speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul and waft a sigh from indus to the pole  thou knowst how guiltless first i met thy flame when love approachd me under friendships name         60 my fancy formd thee of angelic kind some emanation of the allbeauteous mind those smiling eyes attempering every ray shone sweetly lambent with celestial day guiltless i gazed heaven listend while you sung and truths divine came mended from that tongue from lips like those what precept faild to move too soon they taught me twas no sin to love back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran nor wishd an angel whom i loved a man                  70 dim and remote the joys of saints i see nor envy them that heaven i lose for thee  how oft when pressd to marriage have i said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame                 80 before true passion all those views remove fame wealth and honour what are you to love the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and bids them make mistaken mortals groan who seek in love for aught but love alone should at my feet the worlds great master fall himself his throne his world id scorn them all not cæsars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love if there be yet another name more free more fond than mistress make me that to thee           90 oh happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature law all then is full possessing and possessd no craving void left aching in the breast even thought meets thought ere from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be and once the lot of abelard and me  alas how changed what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies                  100 where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had opposed the dire command barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain the crime was common common be the pain i can no more by shame by rage suppressd let tears and burning blushes speak the rest  canst thou forget that sad that solemn day when victims at yon altars foot we lay canst thou forget what tears that moment fell when warm in youth i bade the world farewell         110 as with cold lips i kissd the sacred veil the shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale heaven scarce believed the conquest it surveyd and saints with wonder heard the vows i made yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixd but you not grace or zeal love only was my call and if i lose thy love i lose my all come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe those still at least are left thee to bestow           120 still on that breast enamourd let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressd give all thou canstand let me dream the rest ah no instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god  ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care plants of thy hand and children of thy prayer         130 from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you raised these hallowd walls the desert smiled and paradise was opend in the wild no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors no silver saints by dying misers given here bribed the rage of illrequited heaven but such plain roofs as piety could raise and only vocal with the makers praise                 140 in these lone walls their days eternal bound these mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crownd where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray and gleams of glory brightend all the day but now no face divine contentment wears tis all blank sadness or continual tears see how the force of others prayers i try oh pious fraud of amorous charity                    150 but why should i on others prayers depend come thou my father brother husband friend ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move and all those tender names in onethy love the darksome pines that oer yon rocks reclined wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wandering streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinkling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze            160 no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid but oer the twilight groves and dusky caves longsounding aisles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a deathlike silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades every flower and darkens every green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods             170  yet here for ever ever must i stay sad proof how well a lover can obey death only death can break the lasting chain and here even then shall my cold dust remain here all its frailties all its flames resign and wait till tis no sin to mix with thine  ah wretch believed the spouse of god in vain confessd within the slave of love and man assist me heaven but whence arose that prayer sprung it from piety or from despair                  180 even here where frozen chastity retires love finds an altar for forbidden fires i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault i view my crime but kindle at the view repent old pleasures and solicit new now turnd to heaven i weep my past offence now think of thee and curse my innocence of all affliction taught a lover yet tis sure the hardest science to forget                190 how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense and love the offender yet detest the offence how the dear object from the crime remove or how distinguish penitence from love unequal task a passion to resign for hearts so touchd so pierced so lost as mine ere such a soul regains its peaceful state how often must it love how often hate how often hope despair resent regret conceal disdaindo all things but forget            200 but let heaven seize it all at once tis fired not touchd but rapt not wakend but inspired oh come oh teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life myselfand you fill my fond heart with god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee  how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayer accepted and each wish resignd           210 labour and rest that equal periods keep obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composed affections ever even tears that delight and sighs that waft to heaven grace shines around her with serenest beams and whispering angels prompt her golden dreams for her the unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymeneals sing                   220 to sounds of heavenly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day  far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy when at the close of each sad sorrowing day fancy restores what vengeance snatchd away then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee o curst dear horrors of allconscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight              230 provoking demons all restraint remove and stir within me every source of love i hear thee view thee gaze oer all thy charms and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms i wakeno more i hear no more i view the phantom flies me as unkind as you i call aloud it hears not what i say i stretch my empty arms it glides away to dream once more i close my willing eyes ye soft illusions dear deceits arise                 240 alas no more methinks we wandering go through dreary wastes and weep each others woe where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps and lowbrowd rocks hang nodding oer the deeps sudden you mount you beckon from the skies clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise i shriek start up the same sad prospect find and wake to all the griefs i left behind  for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain            250 thy life a long dead calm of fixd repose no pulse that riots and no blood that glows still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow or moving spirit bade the waters flow soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven and mild as opening gleams of promised heaven  come abelard for what hast thou to dread the torch of venus burns not for the dead nature stands checkd religion disapproves even thou art coldyet eloisa loves                   260 ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn to light the dead and warm the unfruitful urn  what scenes appear whereer i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee thy image steals between my god and me thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear with every bead i drop too soft a tear                 270 when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priests tapers temples swim before my sight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drownd while altars blaze and angels tremble round  while prostrate here in humble grief i lie kind virtuous drops just gathering in my eye while praying trembling in the dust i roll and dawning grace is opening on my soul                280 come if thou darst all charming as thou art oppose thyself to heaven dispute my heart come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace those sorrows and those tears take back my fruitless penitence and prayers snatch me just mounting from the blest abode assist the fiends and tear me from my god  no fly me fly me far as pole from pole rise alps between us and whole oceans roll            290 ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whateer was mine fair eyes and

methinks a spirit calls and more than echoes talk along the walls here as i watchd the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound come sister come it said or seemd to say thy place is here sad sister come away              310 once like thyself i trembled wept and prayd loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep even superstition loses every fear for god not man absolves our frailties here  i come i come prepare your roseate bowers celestial palms and everblooming flowers thither where sinners may have rest i go where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow          320 thou abelard the last sad office pay and smooth my passage to the realms of day see my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll suck my last breath and catch my flying soul ah noin sacred vestments mayst thou stand the hallowd taper trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die ah then thy onceloved eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me                 330 see from my cheek the transient roses fly see the last sparkle languish in my eye till every motion pulse and breath be oer and even my abelard be loved no more o death alleloquent you only prove what dust we doat on when tis man we love  then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy

sudden fate   when god calls virtue to the grave alike tis justice soon or late   mercy alike to kill or save  virtue unmoved can hear the call   and face the flash that melts the ball     an essay on man  in four epistles to henry st john lord bolingbroke   the design  having proposed to write some pieces on human life and manners such as to use my lord bacons expression come home to mens business and bosoms i thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering man in the abstract his nature and his state since to prove any moral duty to enforce any moral precept or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in and what is the proper end and purpose of its being  the science of human nature is like all other sciences reduced to a few clear points there are not many certain truths in this world it is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large open and perceptible parts than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation the disputes are all upon these last and i will venture to say they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of morality if i could flatter myself that this essay has any merit it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite in passing over terms utterly unintelligible and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent and a short yet not imperfect system of ethics  this i might have done in prose but i chose verse and even rhyme for two reasons the one will appear obvious that principles maxims or precepts so written both strike the reader more strongly at first and are more easily retained by him afterwards the other may seem odd but is true i found i could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself and nothing is more certain than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness i was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail without becoming dry and tedious or more poetically without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament without wandering from the precision or breaking the chain of reasoning if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them i freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity  what is now published is only to be considered as a general map of man marking out no more than the greater parts their extent their limits and their connexion but leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow consequently these epistles in their progress if i have health and leisure to make any progress will be less dry and more susceptible of poetical ornament i am here only opening the fountains and clearing the passage to deduce the rivers to follow them in their course and to observe their effects may be a task more agreeable   epistle i  argument  of the nature and state of man with respect to the universe  of man in the abstract  i that we can judge only with regard to our own system being ignorant of the relations of systems and things ver 17 c ii that man is not to be deemed imperfect but a being suited to his place and rank in the creation agreeable to the general order of things and conformable to ends and relations to him unknown ver 35 c iii that it is partly upon his ignorance of future events and partly upon the hope of a future state that all his happiness in the present depends ver 77 c iv the pride of aiming at more knowledge and pretending to more perfection the cause of mans error and misery the impiety of putting himself in the place of god and judging of the fitness or unfitness perfection or imperfection justice or injustice of his dispensations ver 109 c v the absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the creation or expecting that perfection in the moral world which is not in the natural ver 131 c vi the unreasonableness of his complaints against providence while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the angels and on the other the bodily qualifications of the brutes though to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would render him miserable ver 173 c vii that throughout the whole visible world an universal order and gradation in the sensual and mental faculties is observed which causes a subordination of creature to creature and of all creatures to man the gradations of sense instinct thought reflection reason that reason alone countervails all the other faculties ver 207 viii how much further this order and subordination of living creatures may extend above and below us were any part of which broken not that part only but the whole connected creation must be destroyed ver 233 ix the extravagance madness and pride of such a desire ver 259 x the consequence of all the absolute submission due to providence both as to our present and future state ver 281 c to the end  awake my st john leave all meaner things to low ambition and the pride of kings let us since life can little more supply than just to look about us and to die expatiate free oer all this scene of man a mighty maze but not without a plan a wild where weeds and flowers

thousand movements scarce one purpose gain in gods one single can its end produce yet serves to second too some other use so man who here seems principal alone perhaps acts second to some sphere

whereof to those who know me not a truer information may be requisite being divided between the necessity to say something of myself and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task i thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this epistle if it have anything pleasing it will be that by which i am most desirous to please the truth and the sentiment and if anything offensive it will be

their names and they may escape being laughed at if they please  i would have some of them know it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed that i make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine however i shall have this advantage and honour on my side that whereas by their proceeding any abuse may be directed at any man no injury can possibly be

                                the first epistle of the second book of horace   advertisement  the reflections of horace and the judgments past in his epistle to augustus seemed so seasonable to the present times that i could not help applying them to the use of my own country the author thought them considerable enough to address them to his prince whom he paints with all the great and good qualities of a monarch upon whom the romans depended for the increase of an absolute empire but to make the poem entirely english i was willing to add one or two of those which contribute to the happiness of a free people and are more consistent with the welfare of our neighbours  this epistle will show the learned world to have fallen into two mistakes one that augustus was a patron of poets in general whereas he not only prohibited all but the best writers to name him but recommended that care even to the civil magistrate admonebat praetores ne paterentur nomen suum obsolefieri c the other that this piece was only a general discourse of poetry whereas it was an apology for the poets in order to render augustus more their patron horace here pleads the cause of his contemporaries first against the taste of the town whose humour it was to magnify the authors of the preceding age secondly against the court and nobility who encouraged only the writers for the theatre and lastly against the emperor himself who had conceived them of little use to the government he shows by a view of the progress of learning and the change of taste among the romans that the introduction of the polite arts of greece had given the writers of his time great advantages over their predecessors that their morals were much improved and the license of those ancient poets restrained that satire and comedy were become more just and useful that whatever extravagances were left on the stage were owing to the ill taste of the nobility that poets under due regulations were in many respects useful to the state and concludes that it was upon them the emperor himself must depend for his fame with posterity  we may further learn from this epistle that horace made his court to this great prince by writing with a decent freedom toward him with a just contempt of his low flatterers and with a manly regard to his own character   to augustus142  while you great patron of mankind sustain the balanced world and open all the main your country chief in arms abroad defend at home with morals arts and laws amend how shall the muse from such a monarch steal an hour and not defraud the public weal  edward and henry now the boast of fame and virtuous alfred a more sacred name after a life of generous toils endured the gaul subdued or property secured                   10 ambition humbled
