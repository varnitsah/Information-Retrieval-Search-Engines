the pleasure of reintroducing you to prince otto whom you will remember a very little fellow no bigger in fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by your kind hand the sight of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house embowered in creepers a house that was far gone in the respectable stages of antiquity and seemed indissoluble from the green garden in which it stood and that yet was a seatraveller in its younger days and had come round the horn piecemeal in the belly of a ship and might have heard the seamen stamping and shouting and the note of the boatswains whistle it will recall to you the nondescript inhabitants now so widely scatteredthe two horses the dog and the four cats some of them still looking in your face as you read these linesthe poor lady so unfortunately married to an authorthe china boy by this time perhaps baiting his line by the banks of a river in the flowery landand in particular the scot who was then sick apparently unto death and whom you did so much to cheer and keep in good behaviour  you may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs so soon as he had his health again completely you may remember the fortune he was to earn the journeys he was to go upon the delights he was to enjoy and confer and among other matters the masterpiece he was to make of prince otto  well we will not give in that we are finally beaten we read together in those days the story of braddock and how as he was carried dying from the scene of his defeat he promised himself to do better another time a story that will always touch a brave heart and a dying speech worthy of a more fortunate commander i try to be of braddocks mind i still mean to get my health again i still purpose by hook or crook this book or the next to launch a masterpiece and i still intendsomehow some time or otherto see your face and to hold your hand  meanwhile this little paper traveller goes forth instead crosses the great seas and the long plains and the dark mountains and comes at last to your door in monterey charged with tender greetings pray you take him in he comes from a house where even as in your own there are gathered together some of the waifs of our company at oakland a housefor all its outlandish gaelic name and distant stationwhere you are wellbeloved       r l s    skerryvore bournemouth     book i  prince errant     prince otto  chapter i  in which the prince departs on an adventure   you shall seek in vain upon the map of europe for the bygone state of grünewald an independent principality an infinitesimal member of the german empire she played for several centuries her part in the discord of europe and at last in the ripeness of time and at the spiriting of several bald diplomatists vanished like a morning ghost less fortunate than poland she left not a regret behind her and the very memory of her boundaries has faded  it was a patch of hilly country covered with thick wood many streams took their beginning in the glens of grünewald turning mills for the inhabitants there was one town mittwalden and many brown wooden hamlets climbing roof above roof along the steep bottom of dells and communicating by covered bridges over the larger of the torrents the hum of watermills the splash of running water the clean odour of pine sawdust the sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerable army of the mountain pines the dropping fire of huntsmen the dull stroke of the woodaxe intolerable roads fresh trout for supper in the clean bare chamber of an inn and the song of birds and the music of the villagebellsthese were the recollections of the grünewald tourist  north and east the foothills of grünewald sank with varying profile into a vast plain on these sides many small states bordered with the principality gerolstein an extinct grand duchy among the number on the south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom of seaboard bohemia celebrated for its flowers and mountain bears and inhabited by a people of singular simplicity and tenderness of heart several intermarriages had in the course of centuries united the crowned families of grünewald and maritime bohemia and the last prince of grünewald whose history i purpose to relate drew his descent through perdita the only daughter of king florizel the first of bohemia that these intermarriages had in some degree mitigated the rough manly stock of the first grünewalds was an opinion widely held within the borders of the principality the charcoal burner the mountain sawyer the wielder of the broad axe among the congregated pines of grünewald proud of their hard hands proud of their shrewd ignorance and almost savage lore looked with an unfeigned contempt on the soft character and manners of the sovereign race  the precise year of grace in which this tale begins shall be left to the conjecture of the reader but for the season of the year which in such a story is the more important of the two it was already so far forward in the spring that when mountain people heard horns echoing all day about the northwest corner of the principality they told themselves that prince otto and his hunt were up and out for the last time till the return of autumn  at this point the borders of grünewald descend somewhat steeply here and there breaking into crags and this shaggy and trackless country stands in a bold contrast to the cultivated plain below it was traversed at that period by two roads alone one the imperial highway bound to brandenau in gerolstein descended the slope obliquely and by the easiest gradients the other ran like a fillet across the very forehead of the hills dipping into savage gorges and wetted by the spray of tiny waterfalls once it passed beside a certain tower or castle built sheer upon the margin of a formidable cliff and commanding a vast prospect of the skirts of grünewald and the busy plains of gerolstein the felsenburg so this tower was called served now as a prison now as a huntingseat and for all it stood so lonesome to the naked eye with the aid of a good glass the burghers of brandenau could count its windows from the limetree terrace where they walked at night  in the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the roads the horns continued all day long to scatter tumult and at length as the sun began to draw near to the horizon of the plain a rousing triumph announced the slaughter of the quarry the first and second huntsman had drawn somewhat aside and from the summit of a knoll gazed down before them on the drooping shoulders of the hill and across the expanse of plain they covered their eyes for the sun was in their faces the glory of its going down was somewhat pale through the confused tracery of many thousands of naked poplars the smoke of so many houses and the evening steam ascending from the fields the sails of a windmill on a gentle eminence moved very conspicuously like a donkeys ears and hard by like an open gash the imperial highroad ran straight sunward an artery of travel  there is one of natures spiritual ditties that has not yet been set to words or human music the invitation to the road an air continually sounding in the ears of gipsies and to whose inspiration our nomadic fathers journeyed all their days the hour the season and the scene all were in delicate accordance the air was full of birds of passage steering westward and northward over grünewald an army of specks to the uplooking eye and below the great practicable road was bound for the same quarter  but to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual ditty was unheard they were indeed in some concern of mind scanning every fold of the subjacent forest and betraying both anger and dismay in their impatient gestures  i do not see him kuno said the first huntsman nowherenot a trace not a hair of the mares tail no sir hes off broke cover and got away why for twopence i would hunt him with the dogs  mayhap hes gone home said kuno but without conviction  home sneered the other i give him twelve days to get home no its begun again its as it was three years ago before he married a disgrace hereditary prince hereditary fool there goes the government over the borders on a grey mare whats that no nothingno i tell you on my word i set more store by a good gelding or an english dog that for your otto  hes not my otto growled kuno  then i dont know whose he is was the retort  you would put your hand in the fire for him tomorrow said kuno facing round  me cried the huntsman i would see him hanged im a grünewald patriotenrolled and have my medal too and i would help a prince im for liberty and gondremark  well its all one said kuno if anybody said what you said you would have his blood and you know it  you have him on the brain retorted his companionthere he goes he cried the next moment  and sure enough about a mile down the mountain a rider on a white horse was seen to flit rapidly across a heathy open and vanish among the trees on the farther side  in ten minutes hell be over the border into gerolstein said kuno its past cure  well if he founders that mare ill never forgive him added the other gathering his reins  and as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades the sun dipped and disappeared and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and greyness of the early night     chapter ii  in which the prince plays harounalraschid   the night fell upon the prince while he was threading green tracks in the lower valleys of the wood and though the stars came out overhead and displayed the interminable order of the pinetree pyramids regular and dark like cypresses their light was of small service to a traveller in such lonely paths and from thenceforth he rode at random the austere face of nature the uncertain issue of his course the open sky and the free air delighted him like wine and the hoarse chafing of a river on his left sounded in his ears agreeably  it was past eight at night before his toil was rewarded and he issued at last out of the forest on the firm white highroad it lay downhill before him with a sweeping eastward trend faintly bright between the thickets and otto paused and gazed upon it so it ran league after league still joining others to the farthest ends of europe there skirting the seasurge here gleaming in the lights of cities and the innumerable army of tramps and travellers moved upon it in all lands as by a common impulse and were now in all places drawing near to the inn door and the nights rest the pictures swarmed and vanished in his brain a surge of temptation a beat of all his blood went over him to set spur to the mare and to go on into the unknown for ever and then it passed away hunger and fatigue and that habit of middling actions which we call common sense resumed their empire and in that changed mood his eye lighted upon two bright windows on his left hand between the road and river  he turned off by a byroad and in a few minutes he was knocking with his whip on the door of a large farmhouse and a chorus of dogs from the farmyard were making angry answer a very tall old whiteheaded man came shading a candle at the summons he had been of great strength in his time and of a handsome countenance but now he was fallen away his teeth were quite gone and his voice when he spoke was broken and falsetto  you will pardon me said otto i am a traveller and have entirely lost my way  sir said the old man in a very stately shaky manner you are at the river farm and i am killian gottesheim at your disposal we are here sir at about an equal distance from mittwalden in grünewald and brandenau in gerolstein six leagues to either and the road excellent but there is not a winebush not a carters alehouse anywhere between you will have to accept my hospitality for the night rough hospitality to which i make you freely welcome for sir he added with a bow it is god who sends the guest  amen and i most heartily thank you replied otto bowing in his turn  fritz said the old man turning towards the interior lead round this gentlemans horse and you sir condescend to enter  otto entered a chamber occupying the greater part of the groundfloor of the building it had probably once been divided for the farther end was raised by a long step above the nearer and the blazing fire and the white suppertable seemed to stand upon a daïs all around were dark brassmounted cabinets and cupboards dark shelves carrying ancient country crockery guns and antlers and broadside ballads on the wall a tall old clock with roses on the dial and down in one corner the comfortable promise of a winebarrel it was homely elegant and quaint  a powerful youth hurried out to attend on the grey mare and when mr killian gottesheim had presented him to his daughter ottilia otto followed to the stable as became not perhaps the prince but the good horseman when he returned a smoking omelette and some slices of homecured ham were waiting him these were followed by a ragout and a cheese and it was not until his guest had entirely satisfied his hunger and the whole party drew about the fire over the winejug that killian gottesheims elaborate courtesy permitted him to address a question to the prince  you have perhaps ridden far sir he inquired  i have as you say ridden far replied otto and as you have seen i was prepared to do justice to your daughters cookery  possibly sir from the direction of brandenau continued killian  precisely and i should have slept tonight had i not wandered in mittwalden answered the prince weaving in a patch of truth according to the habit of all liars  business leads you to mittwalden was the next question  mere curiosity said otto i have never yet visited the principality of grünewald  a pleasant state sir piped the old man nodding a very pleasant state and a fine race both pines and people we reckon ourselves part grünewalders here lying so near the borders and the river there is all good grünewald water every drop of it yes sir a fine state a man of grünewald now will swing me an axe over his head that many a man of gerolstein could hardly lift and the pines why deary me there must be more pines in that little state sir than people in this whole big world tis twenty years now since i crossed the marshes for we grow homekeepers in old age but i mind it as if it was yesterday up and down the road keeps right on from here to mittwalden and nothing all the way but the good green pinetrees big and little and waterpower waterpower at every step sir we once sold a bit of forest up there beside the highroad and the sight of minted money that we got for it has set me ciphering ever since what all the pines in grünewald would amount to  i suppose you see nothing of the prince inquired otto  no said the young man speaking for the first time nor want to  why so is he so much disliked asked otto  not what you might call disliked replied the old gentleman but despised sir  indeed said the prince somewhat faintly  yes sir despised nodded killian filling a long pipe and to my way of thinking justly despised here is a man with great opportunities and what does he do with them he hunts and he dresses very prettilywhich is a thing to be ashamed of in a manand he acts plays and if he does aught else the news of it has not come here  yet these are all innocent said otto what would you have him domake war  no sir replied the old man but here it is i have been fifty years upon this river farm and wrought in it day in day out i have ploughed and sowed and reaped and risen early and waked late and this is the upshot that all these years it has supported me and my family and been the best friend that ever i had set aside my wife and now when my time comes i leave it a better farm than when i found it so it is if a man works hearty in the order of nature he gets bread and he receives comfort and whatever he touches breeds and it humbly appears to me if that prince was to labour on his throne as i have laboured and wrought in my farm he would find both an increase and a blessing   i believe with you sir otto said and yet the parallel is inexact for the farmers life is natural and simple but the princes is both artificial and complicated it is easy to do right in the one and exceedingly difficult not to do wrong in the other if your crop is blighted you can take off your bonnet and say gods will be done but if the prince meets with a reverse he may have to blame himself for the attempt and perhaps if all the kings in europe were to confine themselves to innocent amusement the subjects would be the better off  ay said the young man fritz you are in the right of it there that was a true word spoken and i see you are like me a good patriot and an enemy to princes  otto was somewhat abashed at this deduction and he made haste to change his ground but said he you surprise me by what you say of this prince otto i have heard him i must own more favourably painted i was told he was in his heart a good fellow and the enemy of no one but himself  and so he is sir said the girl a very handsome pleasant prince and we know some who would shed their blood for him  o kuno said fritz an ignoramus  ay kuno to be sure quavered the old farmer well since this gentleman is a stranger to these parts and curious about the prince i do believe that story might divert him this kuno you must know sir is one of the hunt servants and a most ignorant intemperate man a right grünewalder as we say in gerolstein we know him well in this house for he has come as far as here after his stray dogs and i make all welcome sir without account of state or nation and indeed between gerolstein and grünewald the peace has held so long that the roads stand open like my door and a man will make no more of the frontier than the very birds themselves  ay said otto it has been a long peacea peace of centuries  centuries as you say returned killian the more the pity that it should not be for ever well sir this kuno was one day in fault and otto who has a quick temper up with his whip and thrashed him they do say soundly kuno took it as best he could but at last he broke out and dared the prince to throw his whip away and wrestle like a man for we are all great at wrestling in these parts and its so that we generally settle our disputes well sir the prince did so and being a weakly creature found the tables turned for the man whom he had just been thrashing like a negro slave lifted him with a back grip and threw him heels overhead  he broke his bridlearm cried fritzand some say his nose serve him right say i man to man which is the better at that  and then asked otto  o then kuno carried him home and they were the best of friends from that day forth i dont say its a discreditable story you observe continued mr gottesheim but its droll and thats the fact a man should think before he strikes for as my nephew says man to man was the old valuation  now if you were to ask me said otto i should perhaps surprise you i think it was the prince that conquered  and sir you would be right replied killian seriously in the eyes of god i do not question but you would be right but men sir look at these things differently and they laugh  they made a song of it observed fritz how does it go tatumtara  well interrupted otto who had no great anxiety to hear the song the prince is young he may yet mend  not so young by your leave cried fritz a man of forty  thirtysix corrected mr gottesheim  o cried ottilia in obvious disillusion a man of middle age and they said he was so handsome when he was young  and bald too added fritz  otto passed his hand among his locks at that moment he was far from happy and even the tedious evenings at mittwalden palace began to smile upon him by comparison  o sixandthirty he protested a man is not yet old at sixandthirty i am that age myself  i should have taken you for more sir piped the old farmer but if that be so you are of an age with master ottekin as people call him and i would wager a crown have done more service in your time though it seems young by comparison with men of a great age like me yet its some way through life for all that and the mere fools and fiddlers are beginning to grow weary and to look old yes sir by sixandthirty if a man be a follower of gods laws he should have made himself a home and a good name to live by he should have got a wife and a blessing on his marriage and his works as the word says should begin to follow him  ah well the prince is married cried fritz with a coarse burst of laughter  that seems to entertain you sir said otto  ay said the young boor did you not know that i thought all europe knew it and he added a pantomime of a nature to explain his accusation to the dullest  ah sir said mr gottesheim it is very plain that you are not from hereabouts but the truth is that the whole princely family and court are rips and rascals not one to mend another they live sir in idleness andwhat most commonly follows itcorruption the princess has a lover a baron as he calls himself from east prussia and the prince is so little of a man sir that he holds the candle nor is that the worst of it for this foreigner and his paramour are suffered to transact the state affairs while the prince takes the salary and leaves all things to go to wrack there will follow upon this some manifest judgment which though i am old i may survive to see  good man you are in the wrong about gondremark said fritz showing a greatly increased animation but for all the rest you speak the gods truth like a good patriot as for the prince if he would take and strangle his wife i would forgive him yet  nay fritz said the old man that would be to add iniquity to evil for you perceive sir he continued once more addressing himself to the unfortunate prince this otto has himself to thank for these disorders he has his young wife and his principality and he has sworn to cherish both  sworn at the altar echoed fritz but put your faith in princes  well sir he leaves them both to an adventurer from east prussia pursued the farmer leaves the girl to be seduced and to go on from bad to worse till her names become a taproom byword and she not yet twenty leaves the country to be overtaxed and bullied with armaments and jockied into war  war cried otto  so they say sir those that watch their ongoings say to war asseverated killian well sir that is very sad it is a sad thing for this poor wicked girl to go down to hell with peoples curses its a sad thing for a tight little happy country to be misconducted but whoever may complain i humbly conceive sir that this otto cannot what he has worked for that he has got and may god have pity on his soul for a great and a silly sinners  he has broke his oath then he is a perjurer he takes the money and leaves the work why then plainly hes a thief a cuckold he was before and a fool by birth better me that cried fritz and snapped his fingers  and now sir you will see a little continued the farmer why we think so poorly of this prince otto theres such a thing as a man being pious and honest in the private way and there is such a thing sir as a public virtue but when a man has neither the lord lighten him even this gondremark that fritz here thinks so much of  ay interrupted fritz gondremarks the man for me i would we had his like in gerolstein  he is a bad man said the old farmer shaking his head and there was never good begun by the breach of gods commandments but so far i will go with you he is a man that works for what he has  i tell you hes the hope of grünewald cried fritz he doesnt suit some of your highanddry old ancient ideas but hes a downright modern mana man of the new lights and the progress of the age he does some things wrong so they all do but he has the peoples interests next his heart and you mark meyou sir who are a liberal and the enemy of all their governments you please to mark my wordsthe day will come in grünewald when they take out that yellowheaded skulk of a prince and that doughfaced messalina of a princess march em back foremost over the borders and proclaim the baron gondremark first president ive heard them say it in a speech i was at a meeting once at brandenau and the mittwalden delegates spoke up for fifteen thousand fifteen thousand all brigaded and each man with a medal round his neck to rally by thats all gondremark  ay sir you see what it leads to wild talk today and wilder doings tomorrow said the old man for there is one thing certain that this gondremark has one foot in the court backstairs and the other in the masons lodges he gives himself out sir for what nowadays they call a patriot a man from east prussia  give himself out cried fritz he is he is to lay by his title as soon as the republic is declared i heard it in a speech  lay by baron to take up president returned killian king log king stork but youll live longer than i and you will see the fruits of it  father whispered ottilia pulling at the speakers coat surely the gentleman is ill  i beg your pardon cried the farmer rewaking to hospitable thoughts can i offer you anything  i thank you i am very weary answered otto i have presumed upon my strength if you would show me to a bed i should be grateful  ottilia a candle said the old man indeed sir you look paley a little cordial water no then follow me i beseech you and i will bring you to the strangers bed you are not the first by many who has slept well below my roof continued the old gentleman mounting the stairs before his guest for good food honest wine a grateful conscience and a little pleasant chat before a man retires are worth all the possets and apothecarys drugs see sir and here he opened a door and ushered otto into a little whitewashed sleepingroom here you are in port it is small but it is airy and the sheets are clean and kept in lavender the window too looks out above the river and theres no music like a little rivers it plays the same tune and thats the favourite over and over again and yet does not weary of it like men fiddlers it takes the mind out of doors and though we should be grateful for good houses there is after all no house like gods outofdoors and lastly sir it quiets a man down like saying his prayers so here sir i take my kind leave of you until tomorrow and it is my prayerful wish that you may slumber like a prince  and the old man with the twentieth courteous inclination left his guest alone     chapter iii  in which the prince comforts age and beauty and delivers a lecture on discretion in love   the prince was early abroad in the time of the first chorus of birds of the pure and quiet air of the slanting sunlight and the milelong shadows to one who had passed a miserable night the freshness of that hour was tonic and reviving to steal a march upon his slumbering fellows to be the adam of the coming day composed and fortified his spirits and the prince breathing deep and pausing as he went walked in the wet fields beside his shadow and was glad  a trellised path led down into the valley of the brook and he turned to follow it the stream was a breakneck bolling highland river hard by the farm it leaped a little precipice in a thick greymares tail of twisted filaments and then lay and worked and bubbled in a lynn into the middle of this quaking pool a rock protruded shelving to a cape and thither otto scrambled and sat down to ponder  soon the sun struck through the screen of branches and thin early leaves that made a hanging bower above the fall and the golden lights and flitting shadows fell upon and marbled the surface of that seething pot and rays plunged deep among the turning waters and a spark as bright as a diamond lit upon the swaying eddy it began to grow warm where otto lingered warm and heady the lights swam weaving their maze across the shaken pool on the impending rock reflections danced like butterflies and the air was fanned by the waterfall as by a swinging curtain  otto who was weary with tossing and beset with horrid phantoms of remorse and jealousy instantly fell dead in love with that sunchequered echoing corner holding his feet he stared out of a drowsy trance wondering admiring musing losing his way among uncertain thoughts there is nothing that so apes the external bearing of free will as that unconscious bustle obscurely following liquid laws with which a river contends among obstructions it seems the very play of man and destiny and as otto pored on these recurrent changes he grew by equal steps the sleepier and the more profound eddy and prince were alike jostled in their purpose alike anchored by intangible influences in one corner of the world eddy and prince were alike useless starkly useless in the cosmology of men eddy and princeprince and eddy  it is probable he had been some while asleep when a voice recalled him from oblivion sir it was saying and looking round he saw mr killians daughter terrified by her boldness and making bashful signals from the shore she was a plain honest lass healthy and happy and good and with that sort of beauty that comes of happiness and health but her confusion lent her for the moment an additional charm  goodmorning said otto rising and moving towards her i arose early and was in a dream  o sir she cried i wish to beg of you to spare my father for i assure your highness if he had known who you was he would have bitten his tongue out sooner and fritz toohow he went on but i had a notion and this morning i went straight down into the stable and there was your highnesss crown upon the stirrupirons but o sir i made certain you would spare them for they were as innocent as lambs  my dear said otto both amused and gratified you do not understand it is i who am in the wrong for i had no business to conceal my name and lead on these gentlemen to speak of me and it is i who have to beg of you that you will keep my secret and not betray the discourtesy of which i was guilty as for any fear of me your friends are safe in gerolstein and even in my own territory you must be well aware i have no power  o sir she said curtseying i would not say that the huntsmen would all die for you  happy prince said otto but although you are too courteous to avow the knowledge you have had many opportunities of learning that i am a vain show only last night we heard it very clearly stated you see the shadow flitting on this hard rock prince otto i am afraid is but the moving shadow and the name of the rock is gondremark ah if your friends had fallen foul of gondremark but happily the younger of the two admires him but as for the old gentleman your father he is a wise man and an excellent talker and i would take a long wager he is honest  o for honest your highness that he is exclaimed the girl and fritz is as honest as he and as for all they said it was just talk and nonsense when countryfolk get gossiping they go on i do assure you for the fun they dont as much as think of what they say if you went to the next farm its my belief you would hear as much against my father  nay nay said otto there you go too fast for all that was said against prince otto  o it was shameful cried the girl  not shamefultrue returned otto o yestrue i am all they said of meall that and worse  i never cried ottilia is that how you do well you would never be a soldier now if anyone accuses me i get up and give it them o i defend myself i wouldnt take a fault at another persons hands no not if i had it on my forehead and thats what you must do if you mean to live it out but indeed i never heard such nonsense i should think you was ashamed of yourself youre bald then i suppose  o no said otto fairly laughing there i acquit myself not bald  well and good pursued the girl come now you know you are good and ill make you say so your highness i beg your humble pardon but theres no disrespect intended and anyhow you know you are  why now what am i to say replied otto you are a cook and excellently well you do it i embrace the chance of thanking you for the ragout well now have you not seen good food so bedevilled by unskilful cookery that no one could be brought to eat the pudding that is me my dear i am full of good ingredients but the dish is worthless i ami give it you in one wordsugar in the salad  well i dont care youre good reiterated ottilia a little flushed by having failed to understand  i will tell you one thing replied otto you are  ah well thats what they all said of you moralised the girl such a tongue to come roundsuch a flattering tongue  o you forget i am a man of middle age the prince chuckled  well to speak to you i should think you was a boy and prince or no prince if you came worrying where i was cooking i would pin a napkin to your tails and o lord i declare i hope your highness will forgive me the girl added i cant keep it in my mind  no more can i cried otto that is just what they complain of  they made a loverlylooking couple only the heavy pouring of that horsetail of water made them raise their voices above lovers pitch but to a jealous onlooker from above their mirth and close proximity might easily give umbrage and a rough voice out of a tuft of brambles began calling on ottilia by name she changed colour at that it is fritz she said i must go  go my dear and i need not bid you go in peace for i think you have discovered that i am not formidable at close quarters said the prince and made her a fine gesture of dismissal  so ottilia skipped up the bank and disappeared into the thicket stopping once for a single blushing bobblushing because she had in the interval once more forgotten and remembered the strangers quality  otto returned to his rock promontory but his humour had in the meantime changed the sun now shone more fairly on the pool and over its brown welling surface the blue of heaven and the golden green of the spring foliage danced in fleeting arabesque the eddies laughed and brightened with essential colour and the beauty of the dell began to rankle in the princes mind it was so near to his own borders yet without he had never had much of the joy of possessorship in any of the thousand and one beautiful and curious things that were his and now he was conscious of envy for what was anothers it was indeed a smiling dilettante sort of envy but yet there it was the passion of ahab for the vineyard done in little and he was relieved when mr killian appeared upon the scene  i hope sir that you have slept well under my plain roof said the old farmer  i am admiring this sweet spot that you are privileged to dwell in replied otto evading the inquiry  it is rustic returned mr gottesheim looking around him with complacency a very rustic corner and some of the land to the west is most excellent fat land excellent deep soil you should see my wheat in the tenacre field there is not a farm in grünewald no nor many in gerolstein to match the river farm some sixtyi keep thinking when i sowsome sixty and some seventy and some an hundredfold and my own place six score but that sir is partly the farming  and the stream has fish asked otto  a fishpond said the farmer ay it is a pleasant bit it is pleasant even here if one had time with the brook drumming in that black pool and the green things hanging all about the rocks and dear heart to see the very pebbles all turned to gold and precious stones but you have come to that time of life sir when if you will excuse me you must look to have the rheumatism set in thirty to forty is as one may say their seedtime and this is a damp cold corner for the early morning and an empty stomach if i might humbly advise you sir i would be moving  with all my heart said otto gravely and so you have lived your life here he added as they turned to go  here i was born replied the farmer and here i wish i could say i was to die but fortune sir fortune turns the wheel they say she is blind but we will hope she only sees a little farther on my grandfather and my father and i we have all tilled these acres my furrow following theirs all the three names are on the garden bench two killians and one johann yes sir good men have prepared themselves for the great change in my old garden well do i mind my father in a woollen nightcap the good soul going round and round to see the last of it killian said he do you see the smoke of my tobacco why said he that is mans life it was his last pipe and i believe he knew it and it was a strange thing without doubt to leave the trees that he had planted and the son that he had begotten ay sir and even the old pipe with the turks head that he had smoked since he was a lad and went acourting but here we have no continuing city and as for the eternal its a comfortable thought that we have other merits than our own and yet you would hardly think how sore it goes against the grain with me to die in a strange bed  and must you do so for what reason otto asked  the reason the place is to be sold three thousand crowns replied mr gottesheim had it been a third of that i may say without boasting that what with my credit and my savings i could have met the sum but at three thousand unless i have singular good fortune and the new proprietor continues me in office there is nothing left me but to budge  ottos fancy for the place redoubled at the news and became joined with other feelings if all he heard were true grünewald was growing very hot for a sovereign prince it might be well to have a refuge and if so what more delightful hermitage could man imagine mr gottesheim besides had touched his sympathies every man loves in his soul to play the part of the stage deity and to step down to the aid of the old farmer who had so roughly handled him in talk was the ideal of a fair revenge ottos thoughts brightened at the prospect and he began to regard himself with a renewed respect  i can find you i believe a purchaser he said and one who would continue to avail himself of your skill  can you sir indeed said the old man well i shall be heartily obliged for i begin to find a man may practise resignation all his days as he takes physic and not come to like it in the end  if you will have the papers drawn you may even burthen the purchase with your interest said otto let it be assured to you through life  your friend sir insinuated killian would not perhaps care to make the interest reversible fritz is a good lad  fritz is young said the prince drily he must earn consideration not inherit  he has long worked upon the place sir insisted mr gottesheim and at my great age for i am seventyeight come harvest it would be a troublesome thought to the proprietor how to fill my shoes it would be a care spared to assure yourself of fritz and i believe he might be tempted by a permanency  the young man has unsettled views returned otto  possibly the purchaser began killian  a little spot of anger burned in ottos cheek i am the purchaser he said  it was what i might have guessed replied the farmer bowing with an aged obsequious dignity you have made an old man very happy and i may say indeed that i have entertained an angel unawares sir the great people of this worldand by that i mean those who are great in stationif they had only hearts like yours how they would make the fires burn and the poor sing  i would not judge them hardly sir said otto we all have our frailties  truly sir said mr gottesheim with unction and by what name sir am i to address my generous landlord  the double recollection of an english traveller whom he had received the week before at court and of an old english rogue called transome whom he had known in youth came pertinently to the princes help transome he answered is my name i am an english traveller it is today tuesday on thursday before noon the money shall be ready let us meet if you please in mittwalden at the morning star  i am in all things lawful your servant to command replied the farmer an englishman you are a great race of travellers and has your lordship some experience of land  i have had some interest of the kind before returned the prince not in gerolstein indeed but fortune as you say turns the wheel and i desire to be beforehand with her revolutions  very right sir i am sure said mr killian  they had been strolling with deliberation but they were now drawing near to the farmhouse mounting by the trellised pathway to the level of the meadow a little before them the sound of voices had been some while audible and now grew louder and more distinct with every step of their advance presently when they emerged upon the top of the bank they beheld fritz and ottilia some way off he very black and bloodshot emphasising his hoarse speech with the smacking of his fist against his palm she standing a little way off in blowsy voluble distress  dear me said mr gottesheim and made as if he would turn aside  but otto went straight towards the lovers in whose dissension he believed himself to have a share and indeed as soon as he had seen the prince fritz had stood tragic as if awaiting and defying his approach  o here you are he cried as soon as they were near enough for easy speech you are a man at least and must reply what were you after why were you two skulking in the bush god he broke out turning again upon ottilia to think that i should waste my heart on you  i beg your pardon otto cut in you were addressing me in virtue of what circumstance am i to render you an account of this young ladys conduct are you her father her brother her husband  o sir you know as well as i returned the peasant we keep company she and i i love her and she is by way of loving me but all shall be aboveboard i would have her to know i have a good pride of my own  why i perceive i must explain to you what love is said otto its measure is kindness it is very possible that you are proud but she too may have some selfesteem i do not speak for myself and perhaps if your own doings were so curiously examined you might find it inconvenient to reply  these are all setoffs said the young man you know very well that a man is a man and a woman only a woman that holds good all over up and down i ask you a question i ask it again and here i stand he drew a mark and toed it  when you have studied liberal doctrines somewhat deeper said the prince you will perhaps change your note you are a man of false weights and measures my young friend you have one scale for women another for men one for princes and one for farmerfolk on the prince who neglects his wife you can be most severe but what of the lover who insults his mistress you use the name of love i should think this lady might very fairly ask to be delivered from love of such a nature for if i a stranger had been onetenth part so gross and so discourteous you would most righteously have broke my head it would have been in your part as lover to protect her from such insolence protect her first then from yourself  ay quoth mr gottesheim who had been looking on with his hands behind his tall old back ay thats scripture truth  fritz was staggered not only by the princes imperturbable superiority of manner but by a glimmering consciousness that he himself was in the wrong the appeal to liberal doctrines had besides unmanned him  well said he if i was rude ill own to it i meant no ill and did nothing out of my just rights but i am above all these old vulgar notions too and if i spoke sharp ill ask her pardon  freely granted fritz said ottilia  but all this doesnt answer me cried fritz i ask what you two spoke about she says she promised not to tell well then i mean to know civility is civility but ill be no mans gull i have a right to common justice if i do keep company  if you will ask mr gottesheim replied otto you will find i have not spent my hours in idleness i have since i arose this morning agreed to buy the farm so far i will go to satisfy a curiosity which i condemn  o well if there was business thats another matter returned fritz though it beats me why you could not tell but of course if the gentleman is to buy the farm i suppose there would naturally be an end  to be sure said mr gottesheim with a strong accent of conviction  but ottilia was much braver there now she cried in triumph what did i tell you i told you i was fighting your battles now you see think shame of your suspicious temper you should go down upon your bended knees both to that gentleman and me     chapter iv  in which the prince collects opinions by the way   a little before noon otto by a triumph of manoeuvring effected his escape he was quit in this way of the ponderous gratitude of mr killian and of the confidential gratitude of poor ottilia but of fritz he was not quit so readily that young politician brimming with mysterious glances offered to lend his convoy as far as to the highroad and otto in fear of some residuary jealousy and for the girls sake had not the courage to gainsay him but he regarded his companion with uneasy glances and devoutly wished the business at an end for some time fritz walked by the mare in silence and they had already traversed more than half the proposed distance when with something of a blush he looked up and opened fire  are you not he asked what they call a socialist  why no returned otto not precisely what they call so why do you ask  i will tell you why said the young man i saw from the first that you were a red progressional and nothing but the fear of old killian kept you back and there sir you were right old men are always cowards but nowadays you see there are so many groups you can never tell how far the likeliest kind of man may be prepared to go and i was never sure you were one of the strong thinkers till you hinted about women and free love  indeed cried otto i never said a word of such a thing  not you cried fritz never a word to compromise you was sowing seed groundbait our president calls it but its hard to deceive me for i know all the agitators and their ways and all the doctrines and between you and me lowering his voice i am myself affiliated o yes i am a secret society man and here is my medal and drawing out a green ribbon that he wore about his neck he held up for ottos inspection a pewter medal bearing the imprint of a phoenix and the legend libertas and so now you see you may trust me added fritz i am none of your alehouse talkers i am a convinced revolutionary and he looked meltingly upon otto  i see replied the prince that is very gratifying well sir the great thing for the good of ones country is first of all to be a good man all springs from there for my part although you are right in thinking that i have to do with politics i am unfit by intellect and temper for a leading rôle i was intended i fear for a subaltern yet we have all something to command mr fritz if it be only our own temper and a man about to marry must look closely to himself the husbands like the princes is a very artificial standing and it is hard to be kind in either do you follow that  o yes i follow that replied the young man sadly chopfallen over the nature of the information he had elicited and then brightening up is it he ventured is it for an arsenal that you have bought the farm  well see about that the prince answered laughing you must not be too zealous and in the meantime if i were you i would say nothing on the subject  o trust me sir for that cried fritz as he pocketed a crown and youve let nothing out for i suspectedi might say i knew itfrom the first and mind you when a guide is required he added i know all the forest paths  otto rode away chuckling this talk with fritz had vastly entertained him nor was he altogether discontented with his bearing at the farm men he was able to tell himself had behaved worse under smaller provocation and to harmonise all the road and the april air were both delightful to his soul  up and down and to and fro ever mounting through the wooded foothills the broad white highroad wound onward into grünewald on either hand the pines stood coolly rootedgreen moss prospering springs welling forth between their knuckled spurs and though some were broad and stalwart and others spiry and slender yet all stood firm in the same attitude and with the same expression like a silent army presenting arms  the road lay all the way apart from towns and villages which it left on either hand here and there indeed in the bottom of green glens the prince could spy a few congregated roofs or perhaps above him on a shoulder the solitary cabin of a woodman but the highway was an international undertaking and with its face set for distant cities scorned the little life of grünewald hence it was exceeding solitary near the frontier otto met a detachment of his own troops marching in the hot dust and he was recognised and somewhat feebly cheered as he rode by but from that time forth and for a long while he was alone with the great woods  gradually the spell of pleasure relaxed his own thoughts returned like stinging insects in a cloud and the talk of the night before like a shower of buffets fell upon his memory he looked east and west for any comforter and presently he was aware of a crossroad coming steeply down hill and a horseman cautiously descending a human voice or presence like a spring in the desert was now welcome in itself and otto drew bridle to await the coming of this stranger he proved to be a very redfaced thicklipped countryman with a pair of fat saddlebags and a stone bottle at his waist who as soon as the prince hailed him jovially if somewhat thickly answered at the same time he gave a beery yaw in the saddle it was clear his bottle was no longer full  do you ride towards mittwalden asked the prince  as far as the crossroad to tannenbrunn the man replied will you bear company  with pleasure i have even waited for you on the chance answered otto  by this time they were close alongside and the man with the countryfolk instinct turned his cloudy vision first of all on his companions mount the devil he cried you ride a bonny mare friend and then his curiosity being satisfied about the essential he turned his attention to that merely secondary matter his companions face he started the prince he cried saluting with another yaw that came near dismounting him i beg your pardon your highness not to have reconised you at once  the prince was vexed out of his selfpossession since you know me he said it is unnecessary we should ride together i will precede you if you please and he was about to set spur to the grey mare when the halfdrunken fellow reaching over laid his hand upon the rein  hark you he said prince or no prince that is not how one man should conduct himself with another what youll ride with me incog and set me talking but if i know you youll preshede me if you please spy and the fellow crimson with drink and injured vanity almost spat the word into the princes face  a horrid confusion came over otto he perceived that he had acted rudely grossly presuming on his station and perhaps a little shiver of physical alarm mingled with his remorse for the fellow was very powerful and not more than half in the possession of his senses take your hand from my rein he said with a sufficient assumption of command and when the man rather to his wonder had obeyed you should understand sir he added that while i might be glad to ride with you as one person of sagacity with another and so receive your true opinions it would amuse me very little to hear the empty compliments you would address to me as prince  you think i would lie do you cried the man with the bottle purpling deeper  i know you would returned otto entering entirely into his selfpossession you would not even show me the medal you wear about your neck for he had caught a glimpse of a green ribbon at the fellows throat  the change was instantaneous the red face became mottled with yellow a thickfingered tottering hand made a clutch at the telltale ribbon medal the man cried wonderfully sobered i have no medal  pardon me said the prince i will even tell you what that medal bears a phoenix burning with the word libertas the medallist remaining speechless you are a pretty fellow continued otto smiling to complain of incivility from the man whom you conspire to murder  murder protested the man nay never that nothing criminal for me  you are strangely misinformed said otto conspiracy itself is criminal and ensures the pain of death nay sir death it is i will guarantee my accuracy not that you need be so deplorably affected for i am no officer but those who mingle with politics should look at both sides of the medal  your highness  began the knight of the bottle  nonsense you are a republican cried otto what have you to do with highnesses but let us continue to ride forward since you so much desire it i cannot find it in my heart to deprive you of my company and for that matter i have a question to address to you why being so great a body of menfor you are a great bodyfifteen thousand i have heard but that will be understated am i right  the man gurgled in his throat  why then being so considerable a party resumed otto do you not come before me boldly with your wantswhat do i say with your commands have i the name of being passionately devoted to my throne i can scarce suppose it come then show me your majority and i will instantly resign tell this to your friends assure them from me of my docility assure them that however they conceive of my deficiencies they cannot suppose me more unfit to be a ruler than i do myself i am one of the worst princes in europe will they improve on that  far be it from me  the man began  see now if you will not defend my government cried otto if i were you i would leave conspiracies you are as little fit to be a conspirator as i to be a king  one thing i will say out said the man it is not so much you that we complain of its your lady  not a word sir said the prince and then after a moments pause and in tones of some anger and contempt i once more advise you to have done with politics he added and when next i see you let me see you sober a morning drunkard is the last man to sit in judgment even upon the worst of princes  i have had a drop but i had not been drinking the man replied triumphing in a sound distinction and if i had what then nobody hangs by me but my mill is standing idle and i blame it on your wife am i alone in that go round and ask where are the mills where are the young men that should be working where is the currency all paralysed no sir it is not equal for i suffer for your faultsi pay for them by george out of a poor mans pocket and what have you to do with mine drunk or sober i can see my country going to hell and i can see whose fault it is and so now ive said my say and you may drag me to a stinking dungeon what care i ive spoke the truth and so ill hold hard and not intrude upon your highnesss society  and the miller reined up and clumsily enough saluted  you will observe i have not asked your name said otto i wish you a good ride and he rode on hard but let him ride as he pleased this interview with the miller was a chokepear which he could not swallow he had begun by receiving a reproof in manners and ended by sustaining a defeat in logic both from a man whom he despised all his old thoughts returned with fresher venom and by three in the afternoon coming to the crossroads for beckstein otto decided to turn aside and dine there leisurely nothing at least could be worse than to go on as he was going  in the inn at beckstein he remarked immediately upon his entrance an intelligent young gentleman dining with a book in front of him he had his own place laid close to the reader and with a proper apology broke ground by asking what he read  i am perusing answered the young gentleman the last work of the herr doctor hohenstockwitz cousin and librarian of your prince here in grünewalda man of great erudition and some lambencies of wit  i am acquainted said otto with the herr doctor though not yet with his work  two privileges that i must envy you replied the young man politely an honour in hand a pleasure in the bush  the herr doctor is a man much respected i believe for his attainments asked the prince  he is sir a remarkable instance of the force of intellect replied the reader who of our young men know anything of his cousin allreigning prince although he be who but has heard of dr gotthold but intellectual merit alone of all distinctions has its base in nature  i have the gratification of addressing a studentperhaps an author otto suggested  the young man somewhat flushed i have some claim to both distinctions sir as you suppose said he there is my card i am the licentiate roederer author of several works on the theory and practice of politics  you immensely interest me said the prince the more so as i gather that here in grünewald we are on the brink of revolution pray since these have been your special studies would you augur hopefully of such a movement  i perceive said the young author with a certain vinegary twitch that you are unacquainted with my opuscula i am a convinced authoritarian i share none of those illusory utopian fancies with which empirics blind themselves and exasperate the ignorant the day of these ideas is believe me past or at least passing  when i look about me began otto  when you look about you interrupted the licentiate you behold the ignorant but in the laboratory of opinion beside the studious lamp we begin already to discard these figments we begin to return to natures order to what i might call if i were to borrow from the language of therapeutics the expectant treatment of abuses you will not misunderstand me he continued a country in the condition in which we find grünewald a prince such as your prince otto we must explicitly condemn they are behind the age but i would look for a remedy not to brute convulsions but to the natural supervenience of a more able sovereign i should amuse you perhaps added the licentiate with a smile i think i should amuse you if i were to explain my notion of a prince we who have studied in the closet no longer in this age propose ourselves for active service the paths we have perceived are incompatible i would not have a student on the throne though i would have one near by for an adviser i would set forward as prince a man of a good medium understanding lively rather than deep a man of courtly manner possessed of the double art to ingratiate and to command receptive accommodating seductive i have been observing you since your first entrance well sir were i a subject of grünewald i should pray heaven to set upon the seat of government just such another as yourself  the devil you would exclaimed the prince  the licentiate roederer laughed most heartily i thought i should astonish you he said these are not the ideas of the masses  they are not i can assure you otto said  or rather distinguished the licentiate not today the time will come however when these ideas shall prevail  you will permit me sir to doubt it said otto  modesty is always admirable chuckled the theorist but yet i assure you a man like you with such a man as say dr gotthold at your elbow would be for all practical issues my ideal ruler  at this rate the hours sped pleasantly for otto but the licentiate unfortunately slept that night at beckstein where he was being dainty in the saddle and given to half stages and to find a convoy to mittwalden and thus mitigate the company of his own thoughts the prince had to make favour with a certain party of woodmerchants from various states of the empire who had been drinking together somewhat noisily at the far end of the apartment  the night had already fallen when they took the saddle the merchants were very loud and mirthful each had a face like a norwest moon and they played pranks with each others horses and mingled songs and choruses and alternately remembered and forgot the companion of their ride otto thus combined society and solitude hearkening now to their chattering and empty talk now to the voices of the encircling forest the starlit dark the faint wood airs the clank of the horseshoes making broken music accorded together and attuned his mind and he was still in a most equal temper when the party reached the top of that long hill that overlooks mittwalden  down in the bottom of a bowl of forest the lights of the little formal town glittered in a pattern street crossing street away by itself on the right the palace was glowing like a factory  although he knew not otto one of the woodmerchants was a native of the state there said he pointing to the palace with his whip there is jezebels inn  what do you call it that cried another laughing  ay thats what they call it returned the grünewalder and he broke into a song which the rest as people well acquainted with the words and air instantly took up in chorus her serene highness amalia seraphina princess of grünewald was the heroine gondremark the hero of this ballad shame hissed in ottos ears he reined up short and sat stunned in the saddle and the singers continued to descend the hill without him  the song went to a rough swashing popular air and long after the words became inaudible the swing of the music rising and falling echoed insult in the princes brain he fled the sounds hard by him on his right a road struck towards the palace and he followed it through the thick shadows and branching alleys of the park it was a busy place on a fine summers afternoon when the court and burghers met and saluted but at that hour of the night in the early spring it was deserted to the roosting birds hares rustled among the covert here and there a statue stood glimmering with its eternal gesture here and there the echo of an imitation temple clattered ghostly to the trampling of the mare ten minutes brought him to the upper end of his own home garden where the small stables opened over a bridge upon the park the yard clock was striking the hour of ten so was the big bell in the palace belltower and farther off the belfries of the town about the stable all else was silent but the stamping of stalled horses and the rattle of halters otto dismounted and as he did so a memory came back to him a whisper of dishonest grooms and stolen corn once heard long forgotten and now recurring in the nick of opportunity he crossed the bridge and going up to a window knocked six or seven heavy blows in a particular cadence and as he did so smiled presently a wicket was opened in the gate and a mans head appeared in the dim starlight  nothing tonight said a voice  bring a lantern said the prince  dear heart a mercy cried the groom whos that  it is i the prince replied otto bring a lantern take in the mare and let me through into the garden  the man remained silent for a while his head still projecting through the wicket  his highness he said at last and why did your highness knock so strange  it is a superstition in mittwalden answered otto that it cheapens corn  with a sound like a sob the groom fled he was very white when he returned even by the light of the lantern and his hand trembled as he undid the fastenings and took the mare  your highness he began at last for gods sake and there he paused oppressed with guilt  for gods sake what asked otto cheerfully for gods sake let us have cheaper corn say i goodnight and he strode off into the garden leaving the groom petrified once more  the garden descended by a succession of stone terraces to the level of the fishpond on the far side the ground rose again and was crowned by the confused roofs and gables of the palace the modern pillared front the ballroom the great library the princely apartments the busy and illuminated quarters of that great house all faced the town the garden side was much older and here it was almost dark only a few windows quietly lighted at various elevations the great square tower rose thinning by stages like a telescope and on the top of all the flag hung motionless  the garden as it now lay in the dusk and glimmer of the starshine breathed of april violets under nights cavern arch the shrubs obscurely bustled through the plotted terraces and down the marble stairs the prince rapidly descended fleeing before uncomfortable thoughts but alas from these there is no city of refuge and now when he was about midway of the descent distant strains of music began to fall upon his ear from the ballroom where the court was dancing they reached him faint and broken but they touched the keys of memory and through and above them otto heard the ranting melody of the woodmerchants song mere blackness seized upon his mind here he was coming home the wife was dancing the husband had been playing a trick upon a lackey and meanwhile all about them they were a byword to their subjects such a prince such a husband such a man as this otto had become and he sped the faster onward  some way below he came unexpectedly upon a sentry yet a little farther and he was challenged by a second and as he crossed the bridge over the fishpond an officer making the rounds stopped him once more the parade of watch was more than usual but curiosity was dead in ottos mind and he only chafed at the interruption the porter of the back postern admitted him and started to behold him so disordered thence hasting by private stairs and passages he came at length unseen to his own chamber tore off his clothes and threw himself upon his bed in the dark the music of the ballroom still continued to a very lively measure and still behind that he heard in spirit the chorus of the merchants clanking down the hill     book ii  of love and politics     chapter i  what happened in the library   at a quarter before six on the following morning dr gotthold was already at his desk in the library and with a small cup of black coffee at his elbow and an eye occasionally wandering to the busts and the long array of manycoloured books was quietly reviewing the labours of the day before he was a man of about forty flaxenhaired with refined features a little worn and bright eyes somewhat faded early to bed and early to rise his life was devoted to two things erudition and rhine wine an ancient friendship existed latent between him and otto they rarely met but when they did it was to take up at once the thread of their suspended intimacy gotthold the virgin priest of knowledge had envied his cousin for half a day when he was married he had never envied him his throne  reading was not a popular diversion at the court of grünewald and that great pleasant sunshiny gallery of books and statues was in practice gottholds private cabinet on this particular wednesday morning however he had not been long about his manuscript when a door opened and the prince stepped into the apartment the doctor watched him as he drew near receiving from each of the embayed windows in succession a flush of morning sun and otto looked so gay and walked so airily he was so well dressed and brushed and frizzled so pointdevice and of such a sovereign elegance that the heart of his cousin the recluse was rather moved against him  goodmorning gotthold said otto dropping in a chair  goodmorning otto returned the librarian you are an early bird is this an accident or do you begin reforming  it is about time i fancy answered the prince  i cannot imagine said the doctor i am too sceptical to be an ethical adviser and as for good resolutions i believed in them when i was young they are the colours of hopes rainbow  if you come to think of it said otto i am not a popular sovereign and with a look he changed his statement to a question  popular well there i would distinguish answered gotthold leaning back and joining the tips of his fingers there are various kinds of popularity the bookish which is perfectly impersonal as unreal as the nightmare the politicians a mixed variety and yours which is the most personal of all women take to you footmen adore you it is as natural to like you as to pat a dog and were you a sawmiller you would be the most popular citizen in grünewald as a princewell you are in the wrong trade it is perhaps philosophical to recognise it as you do  perhaps philosophical repeated otto  yes perhaps i would not be dogmatic answered gotthold  perhaps philosophical and certainly not virtuous otto resumed  not of a roman virtue chuckled the recluse  otto drew his chair nearer to the table leaned upon it with his elbow and looked his cousin squarely in the face in short he asked not manly  well gotthold hesitated not manly if you will and then with a laugh i did not know that you gave yourself out to be manly he added it was one of the points that i inclined to like about you inclined i believe to admire the names of virtues exercise a charm on most of us we must lay claim to all of them however incompatible we must all be both daring and prudent we must all vaunt our pride and go to the stake for our humility not so you without compromise you were yourself a pretty sight i have always said it none so void of all pretence as otto  pretence and effort both cried otto a dead dog in a canal is more alive and the question gotthold the question that i have to face is this can i not with effort and selfdenial can i not become a tolerable sovereign  never replied gotthold dismiss the notion and besides dear child you would not try  nay gotthold i am not to be put by said otto if i am constitutionally unfit to be a sovereign what am i doing with this money with this palace with these guards and ia thiefam i to execute the law on others  i admit the difficulty said gotthold  well can i not try continued otto am i not bound to try and with the advice and help of such a man as you  me cried the librarian now god forbid  otto though he was in no very smiling humour could not forbear to smile yet i was told last night he laughed that with a man like me to impersonate and a man like you to touch the springs a very possible government could be composed  now i wonder in what diseased imagination gotthold said that preposterous monster saw the light of day  it was one of your own tradea writer one roederer said otto  roederer an ignorant puppy cried the librarian  you are ungrateful said otto he is one of your professed admirers   is he cried gotthold obviously impressed come that is a good account of the young man i must read his stuff again it is the rather to his credit as our views are opposite the east and west are not more opposite can i have converted him but no the incident belongs to fairyland  you are not then asked the prince an authoritarian  i god bless me no said gotthold i am a red dear child  that brings me then to my next point and by a natural transition if i am so clearly unfitted for my post the prince asked if my friends admit it if my subjects clamour for my downfall if revolution is preparing at this hour must i not go forth to meet the inevitable should i not save these horrors and be done with these absurdities in a word should i not abdicate o believe me i feel the ridicule the vast abuse of language he added wincing but even a principulus like me cannot resign he must make a great gesture and come buskined forth and abdicate  ay said gotthold or else stay where he is what gnat has bitten you today do you not know that you are touching with lay hands the very holiest inwards of philosophy where madness dwells ay otto madness for in the serene temples of the wise the inmost shrine which we carefully keep locked is full of spiders webs all men all are fundamentally useless nature tolerates she does not need she does not use them sterile flowers alldown to the fellow swinking in a byre whom fools point out for the exceptionall are useless all weave ropes of sand or like a child that has breathed on a window write and obliterate write and obliterate idle words talk of it no more that way i tell you madness lies the speaker rose from his chair and then sat down again he laughed a little laugh and then changing his tone resumed yes dear child we are not here to do battle with giants we are here to be happy like the flowers if we can be it is because you could that i have always secretly admired you cling to that trade believe me it is the right one be happy be idle be airy to the devil with all casuistry and leave the state to gondremark as heretofore he does it well enough they say and his vanity enjoys the situation  gotthold cried otto what is this to me useless is not the question i cannot rest at uselessness i must be useful or i must be noxiousone or other i grant you the whole thing prince and principality alike is pure absurdity a stroke of satire and that a banker or the man who keeps an inn has graver duties but now when i have washed my hands of it three years and left alllabour responsibility and honour and enjoyment too if there be anyto gondremark and toseraphina he hesitated at the name and gotthold glanced aside well the prince continued what has come of it taxes army cannonwhy its like a box of lead soldiers and the people sick at the folly of it and fired with the injustice and war tooi hear of warwar in this teapot what a complication of absurdity and disgrace and when the inevitable end arrivesthe revolutionwho will be to blame in the sight of god who will be gibbeted in public opinion i prince puppet  i thought you had despised public opinion said gotthold  i did said otto sombrely but now i do not i am growing old and then gotthold there is seraphina she is loathed in this country that i brought her to and suffered her to spoil yes i gave it her as a plaything and she has broken it a fine prince an admirable princess even her lifei ask you gotthold is her life safe  it is safe enough today replied the librarian but since you ask me seriously i would not answer for tomorrow she is illadvised  and by whom by this gondremark to whom you counsel me to leave my country cried the prince rare advice the course that i have been following all these years to come at last to this o illadvised if that were all see now there is no sense in beating about the bush between two men you know what scandal says of her  gotthold with pursed lips silently nodded  well come you are not very cheering as to my conduct as the prince have i even done my duty as a husband otto asked  nay nay said gotthold earnestly and eagerly this is another chapter i am an old celibate an old monk i cannot advise you in your marriage  nor do i require advice said otto rising all of this must cease and he began to walk to and fro with his hands behind his back  well otto may god guide you said gotthold after a considerable silence i cannot  from what does all this spring said the prince stopping in his walk what am i to call it diffidence the fear of ridicule inverted vanity what matter names if it has brought me to this i could never bear to be bustling about nothing i was ashamed of this toy kingdom from the first i could not tolerate that people should fancy i believed in a thing so patently absurd i would do nothing that cannot be done smiling i have a sense of humour forsooth i must know better than my maker and it was the same thing in my marriage he added more hoarsely i did not believe this girl could care for me i must not intrude i must preserve the foppery of my indifference what an impotent picture  ay we have the same blood moralised gotthold you are drawing with fine strokes the character of the born sceptic  scepticcoward cried otto coward is the word a springless puttyhearted cowering coward  and as the prince rapped out the words in tones of unusual vigour a little stout old gentleman opening a door behind gotthold received them fairly in the face with his parrots beak for a nose his pursed mouth his little goggling eyes he was the picture of formality and in ordinary circumstances strutting behind the drum of his corporation he impressed the beholder with a certain air of frozen dignity and wisdom but at the smallest contrariety his trembling hands and disconnected gestures betrayed the weakness at the root and now when he was thus surprisingly received in that library of mittwalden palace which was the customary haunt of silence his hands went up into the air as if he had been shot and he cried aloud with the scream of an old woman  o he gasped recovering your highness i beg ten thousand pardons but your highness at such an hour in the librarya circumstance so unusual as your highnesss presence was a thing i could not be expected to foresee  there is no harm done herr cancellarius said otto  i came upon the errand of a moment some papers i left overnight with the herr doctor said the chancellor of grünewaldherr doctor if you will kindly give me them i will intrude no longer  gotthold unlocked a drawer and handed a bundle of manuscript to the old gentleman who prepared with fitting salutations to take his departure  herr greisengesang since we have met said otto let us talk  i am honoured by his highnesss commands replied the chancellor  all has been quiet since i left asked the prince resuming his seat  the usual business your highness answered greisengesang punctual trifles huge indeed if neglected but trifles when discharged your highness is most zealously obeyed  obeyed herr cancellarius returned the prince and when have i obliged you with an order replaced let us rather say but to touch upon these trifles instance me a few  the routine of government from which your highness has so wisely dissociated his leisure  began greisengesang  we will leave my leisure sir said otto approach the facts  the routine of business was proceeded with replied the official now visibly twittering  it is very strange herr cancellarius that you should so persistently avoid my questions said the prince you tempt me to suppose a purpose in your dulness i have asked you whether all was quiet do me the pleasure to reply  perfectlyo perfectly quiet jerked the ancient puppet with every signal of untruth  i make a note of these words said the prince gravely you assure me your sovereign that since the date of my departure nothing has occurred of which you owe me an account  i take your highness i take the herr doctor to witness cried greisengesang that i have had no such expression  halt said the prince and then after a pause herr greisengesang you are an old man and you served my father before you served me he added it consists neither with your dignity nor mine that you should babble excuses and stumble possibly upon untruths collect your thoughts and then categorically inform me of all you have been charged to hide  gotthold stooping very low over his desk appeared to have resumed his labours but his shoulders heaved with subterranean merriment the prince waited drawing his handkerchief quietly through his fingers  your highness in this informal manner said the old gentleman at last and being unavoidably deprived of documents it would be difficult it would be impossible to do justice to the somewhat grave occurrences which have transpired  i will not criticise your attitude replied the prince i desire that between you and me all should be done gently for i have not forgotten my old friend that you were kind to me from the first and for a period of years a faithful servant i will thus dismiss the matters on which you waive immediate inquiry but you have certain papers actually in your hand come herr greisengesang there is at least one point for which you have authority enlighten me on that  on that cried the old gentleman o that is a trifle a matter your highness of police a detail of a purely administrative order these are simply a selection of the papers seized upon the english traveller  seized echoed otto in what sense explain yourself  sir john crabtree interposed gotthold looking up was arrested yesterday evening  is this so herr cancellarius demanded otto sternly  it was judged right your highness protested greisengesang the decree was in due form invested with your highnesss authority by procuration i am but an agent i had no status to prevent the measure  this man my guest has been arrested said the prince on what grounds sir with what colour of pretence  the chancellor stammered  your highness will perhaps find the reason in these documents said gotthold pointing with the tail of his pen  otto thanked his cousin with a look give them to me he said addressing the chancellor  but that gentleman visibly hesitated to obey baron von gondremark he said has made the affair his own i am in this case a mere messenger and as such i am not clothed with any capacity to communicate the documents i carry herr doctor i am convinced you will not fail to bear me out  i have heard a great deal of nonsense said gotthold and most of it from you but this beats all  come sir said otto rising the papers i command  herr greisengesang instantly gave way  with your highnesss permission he said and laying at his feet my most submiss apologies i will now hasten to attend his further orders in the chancery  herr cancellarius do you see this chair said otto there is where you shall attend my further orders oh now no more he cried with a gesture as the old man opened his lips you have sufficiently marked your zeal to your employer and i begin to weary of a moderation you abuse  the chancellor moved to the appointed chair and took his seat in silence  and now said otto opening the roll what is all this it looks like the manuscript of a book  it is said gotthold the manuscript of a book of travels  you have read it dr hohenstockwitz asked the prince  nay i but saw the titlepage replied gotthold but the roll was given to me open and i heard no word of any secrecy  otto dealt the chancellor an angry glance  i see he went on the papers of an author seized at this date of the worlds history in a state so petty and so ignorant as grünewald here is indeed an ignominious folly sir to the chancellor i marvel to find you in so scurvy an employment on your conduct to your prince i will not dwell but to descend to be a spy for what else can it be called to seize the papers of this gentleman the private papers of a stranger the toil of a life perhapsto open and to read them and what have we to do with books the herr doctor might perhaps be asked for his advice but we have no index expurgatorius in grünewald had we but that we should be the most absolute parody and farce upon this tawdry earth  yet even while otto spoke he had continued to unfold the roll and now when it lay fully open his eye rested on the titlepage elaborately written in red ink it ran thus              memoirs    of a visit to the various        courts of europe               by   sir john crabtree baronet  below was a list of chapters each bearing the name of one of the european courts and among these the nineteenth and the last upon the list was dedicated to grünewald  ah the court of grünewald said otto that should be droll reading and his curiosity itched for it  a methodical dog this english baronet said gotthold each chapter written and finished on the spot i shall look for his work when it appears  it would be odd now just to glance at it said otto wavering  gottholds brow darkened and he looked out of window  but though the prince understood the reproof his weakness prevailed i will he said with an uneasy laugh i will i think just glance at it  so saying he resumed his seat and spread the travellers manuscript upon the table     chapter ii  on the court of grÜnewald being a portion of the travellers manuscript   it may well be asked it was thus the english traveller began his nineteenth chapter why i should have chosen grünewald out of so many other states equally petty formal dull and corrupt accident indeed decided and not i but i have seen no reason to regret my visit the spectacle of this small society macerating in its own abuses was not perhaps instructive but i have found it exceedingly diverting  the reigning prince otto johann friedrich a young man of imperfect education questionable valour and no scintilla of capacity has fallen into entire public contempt it was with difficulty that i obtained an interview for he is frequently absent from a court where his presence is unheeded and where his only rôle is to be a cloak for the amours of his wife at last however on the third occasion when i visited the palace i found this sovereign in the exercise of his inglorious function with the wife on one hand and the lover on the other he is not illlooking he has hair of a ruddy gold which naturally curls and his eyes are dark a combination which i always regard as the mark of some congenital deficiency physical or moral his features are irregular but pleasing the nose perhaps a little short and the mouth a little womanish his address is excellent and he can express himself with point but to pierce below these externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling quality a deliquescence of the moral nature a frivolity and inconsequence of purpose that mark the nearly perfect fruit of a decadent age he has a worthless smattering of many subjects but a grasp of none i soon weary of a pursuit he said to me laughing it would almost appear as if he took a pride in his incapacity and lack of moral courage the results of his dilettanteism are to be seen in every field he is a bad fencer a secondrate horseman dancer shot he singsi have heard himand he sings like a child he writes intolerable verses in more than doubtful french he acts like the common amateur and in short there is no end to the number of things that he does and does badly his one manly taste is for the chase in sum he is but a plexus of weaknesses the singing chambermaid of the stage tricked out in mans apparel and mounted on a circus horse i have seen this poor phantom of a prince riding out alone or with a few huntsmen disregarded by all and i have been even grieved for the bearer of so futile and melancholy an existence the last merovingians may have looked not otherwise  the princess amalia seraphina a daughter of the grandducal house of toggenburgtannhäuser would be equally inconsiderable if she were not a cutting instrument in the hands of an ambitious man she is much younger than the prince a girl of twoandtwenty sick with vanity superficially clever and fundamentally a fool she has a redbrown rolling eye too large for her face and with sparks of both levity and ferocity her forehead is high and narrow her figure thin and a little stooping her manners her conversation which she interlards with french her very tastes and ambitions are alike assumed and the assumption is ungracefully apparent hoyden playing cleopatra i should judge her to be incapable of truth in private life a girl of this description embroils the peace of families walks attended by a troop of scowling swains and passes once at least through the divorce court it is a common and except to the cynic an uninteresting type on the throne however and in the hands of a man like gondremark she may become the authoress of serious public evils  gondremark the true ruler of this unfortunate country is a more complex study his position in grünewald to which he is a foreigner is eminently false and that he should maintain it as he does a very miracle of impudence and dexterity his speech his face his policy are all double heads and tails which of the two extremes may be his actual design he were a bold man who should offer to decide yet i will hazard the guess that he follows both experimentally and awaits at the hand of destiny one of those directing hints of which she is so lavish to the wise  on the one hand as maire du palais to the incompetent otto and using the lovesick princess for a tool and mouthpiece he pursues a policy of arbitrary power and territorial aggrandisement he has called out the whole capable male population of the state to military service he has bought cannon he has tempted away promising officers from foreign armies and he now begins in his international relations to assume the swaggering port and the vague threatful language of a bully the idea of extending grünewald may appear absurd but the little state is advantageously placed its neighbours are all defenceless and if at any moment the jealousies of the greater courts should neutralise each other an active policy might double the principality both in population and extent certainly at least the scheme is entertained in the court of mittwalden nor do i myself regard it as entirely desperate the margravate of brandenburg has grown from as small beginnings to a formidable power and though it is late in the day to try adventurous policies and the age of war seems ended fortune we must not forget still blindly turns her wheel for men and nations concurrently with and tributary to these warlike preparations crushing taxes have been levied journals have been suppressed and the country which three years ago was prosperous and happy now stagnates in a forced inaction gold has become a curiosity and the mills stand idle on the mountain streams  on the other hand in his second capacity of popular tribune gondremark is the incarnation of the free lodges and sits at the centre of an organised conspiracy against the state to any such movement my sympathies were early acquired and i would not willingly let fall a word that might embarrass or retard the revolution but to show that i speak of knowledge and not as the reporter of mere gossip i may mention that i have myself been present at a meeting where the details of a republican constitution were minutely debated and arranged and i may add that gondremark was throughout referred to by the speakers as their captain in action and the arbiter of their disputes he has taught his dupes for so i must regard them that his power of resistance to the princess is limited and at each fresh stretch of authority persuades them with specious reasons to postpone the hour of insurrection thus to give some instances of his astute diplomacy he salved over the decree enforcing military service under the plea that to be well drilled and exercised in arms was even a necessary preparation for revolt and the other day when it began to be rumoured abroad that a war was being forced on a reluctant neighbour the grand duke of gerolstein and i made sure it would be the signal for an instant rising i was struck dumb with wonder to find that even this had been prepared and was to be accepted i went from one to another in the liberal camp and all were in the same story all had been drilled and schooled and fitted out with vacuous argument the lads had better see some real fighting they said and besides it will be as well to capture gerolstein we can then extend to our neighbours the blessing of liberty on the same day that we snatch it for ourselves and the republic will be all the stronger to resist if the kings of europe should band themselves together to reduce it i know not which of the two i should admire the more the simplicity of the multitude or the audacity of the adventurer but such are the subtleties such the quibbling reasons with which he blinds and leads this people how long a course so tortuous can be pursued with safety i am incapable of guessing not long one would suppose and yet this singular man has been treading the mazes for five years and his favour at court and his popularity among the lodges still endure unbroken  i have the privilege of slightly knowing him heavily and somewhat clumsily built of a vast disjointed rambling frame he can still pull himself together and figure not without admiration in the saloon or the ballroom his hue and temperament are plentifully bilious he has a saturnine eye his cheek is of a dark blue where he has been shaven essentially he is to be numbered among the manhaters a convinced contemner of his fellows yet he is himself of a most commonplace ambition and greedy of applause in talk he is remarkable for a thirst of information loving rather to hear than to communicate for sound and studious views and judging by the extreme shortsightedness of common politicians for a remarkable prevision of events all this however without grace pleasantry or charm heavily set forth with a dull countenance in our numerous conversations although he has always heard me with deference i have been conscious throughout of a sort of ponderous finessing hard to tolerate he produces none of the effect of a gentleman devoid not merely of pleasantry but of all attention or communicative warmth of bearing no gentleman besides would so parade his amours with the princess still less repay the prince for his longsuffering with the studied insolence of demeanour and the fabrication of insulting nicknames such as prince featherhead which run from ear to ear and create a laugh throughout the country gondremark has thus some of the clumsier characters of the selfmade man combined with an inordinate almost a besotted pride of intellect and birth heavy bilious selfish inornate he sits upon this court and country like an incubus  but it is probable that he preserves softer gifts for necessary purposes indeed it is certain although he vouchsafed none of it to me that this cold and stolid politician possesses to a great degree the art of ingratiation and can be all things to all men hence there has probably sprung up the idle legend that in private life he is a gross romping voluptuary nothing at least can well be more surprising than the terms of his connection with the princess older than her husband certainly uglier and according to the feeble ideas common among women in every particular less pleasing he has not only seized the complete command of all her thought and action but has imposed on her in public a humiliating part i do not here refer to the complete sacrifice of every rag of her reputation for to many women these extremities are in themselves attractive but there is about the court a certain lady of a dishevelled reputation a countess von rosen wife or widow of a cloudy count no longer in her second youth and already bereft of some of her attractions who unequivocally occupies the station of the barons mistress i had thought at first that she was but a hired accomplice a mere blind or buffer for the more important sinner a few hours acquaintance with madame von rosen for ever dispelled the illusion she is one rather to make than to prevent a scandal and she values none of those bribesmoney honours or employmentwith which the situation might be gilded indeed as a person frankly bad she pleased me in the court of grünewald like a piece of nature  the power of this man over the princess is therefore without bounds she has sacrificed to the adoration with which he has inspired her not only her marriage vow and every shred of public decency but that vice of jealousy which is so much dearer to the female sex than either intrinsic honour or outward consideration nay more a young although not a very attractive woman and a princess both by birth and fact she submits to the triumphant rivalry of one who might be her mother as to years and who is so manifestly her inferior in station this is one of the mysteries of the human heart but the rage of illicit love when it is once indulged appears to grow by feeding and to a person of the character and temperament of this unfortunate young lady almost any depth of degradation is within the reach of possibility     chapter iii  the prince and the english traveller   so far otto read with waxing indignation and here his fury overflowed he tossed the roll upon the table and stood up this man he said is a devil a filthy imagination an ear greedy of evil a ponderous malignity of thought and language i grow like him by the reading chancellor where is this fellow lodged  he was committed to the flag tower replied greisengesang in the gamiani apartment  lead me to him said the prince and then a thought striking him was it for that he asked that i found so many sentries in the garden  your highness i am unaware answered greisengesang true to his policy the disposition of the guards is a matter distinct from my functions  otto turned upon the old man fiercely but ere he had time to speak gotthold touched him on the arm he swallowed his wrath with a great effort it is well he said taking the roll follow me to the flag tower  the chancellor gathered himself together and the two set forward it was a long and complicated voyage for the library was in the wing of the new buildings and the tower which carried the flag was in the old schloss upon the garden by a great variety of stairs and corridors they came out at last upon a patch of gravelled court the garden peeped through a high grating with a flash of green tall old gabled buildings mounted on every side the flag tower climbed stage after stage into the blue and high over all among the building daws the yellow flag wavered in the wind a sentinel at the foot of the tower stairs presented arms another paced the first landing and a third was stationed before the door of the extemporised prison  we guard this mudbag like a jewel otto sneered  the gamiani apartment was so called from an italian doctor who had imposed on the credulity of a former prince the rooms were large airy pleasant and looked upon the garden but the walls were of great thickness for the tower was old and the windows were heavily barred the prince followed by the chancellor still trotting to keep up with him brushed swiftly through the little library and the long saloon and burst like a thunderbolt into the bedroom at the farther end sir john was finishing his toilet a man of fifty hard uncompromising able with the eye and teeth of physical courage he was unmoved by the irruption and bowed with a sort of sneering ease  to what am i to attribute the honour of this visit he asked  you have eaten my bread replied otto you have taken my hand you have been received under my roof when did i fail you in courtesy what have you asked that was not granted as to an honoured guest and here sir tapping fiercely on the manuscript here is your return  your highness has read my papers said the baronet i am honoured indeed but the sketch is most imperfect i shall now have much to add i can say that the prince whom i had accused of idleness is zealous in the department of police taking upon himself those duties that are most distasteful i shall be able to relate the burlesque incident of my arrest and the singular interview with which you honour me at present for the rest i have already communicated with my ambassador at vienna and unless you propose to murder me i shall be at liberty whether you please or not within the week for i hardly fancy the future empire of grünewald is yet ripe to go to war with england i conceive i am a little more than quits i owe you no explanation yours has been the wrong you if you have studied my writing with intelligence owe me a large debt of gratitude and to conclude as i have not yet finished my toilet i imagine the courtesy of a turnkey to a prisoner would induce you to withdraw  there was some paper on the table and otto sitting down wrote a passport in the name of sir john crabtree  affix the seal herr cancellarius he said in his most princely manner as he rose  greisengesang produced a red portfolio and affixed the seal in the unpoetic guise of an adhesive stamp nor did his perturbed and clumsy movements at all lessen the comedy of the performance sir john looked on with a malign enjoyment and otto chafed regretting when too late the unnecessary royalty of his command and gesture but at length the chancellor had finished his piece of prestidigitation and without waiting for an order had countersigned the passport thus regularised he returned it to otto with a bow  you will now said the prince order one of my own carriages to be prepared see it with your own eyes charged with sir johns effects and have it waiting within the hour behind the pheasant house sir john departs this morning for vienna  the chancellor took his elaborate departure  here sir is your passport said otto turning to the baronet i regret it from my heart that you have met inhospitable usage  well there will be no english war returned sir john  nay sir said otto you surely owe me your civility matters are now changed and we stand again upon the footing of two gentlemen it was not i who ordered your arrest i returned late last night from hunting and as you cannot blame me for your imprisonment you may even thank me for your freedom  and yet you read my papers said the traveller shrewdly  there sir i was wrong returned otto and for that i ask your pardon you can scarce refuse it for your own dignity to one who is a plexus of weaknesses nor was the fault entirely mine had the papers been innocent it would have been at most an indiscretion your own guilt is the sting of my offence  sir john regarded otto with an approving twinkle then he bowed but still in silence  well sir as you are now at your entire disposal i have a favour to beg of your indulgence continued the prince i have to request that you will walk with me alone into the garden so soon as your convenience permits  from the moment that i am a free man sir john replied this time with perfect courtesy i am wholly at your highnesss command and if you will excuse a rather summary toilet i will even follow you as i am  i thank you sir said otto  so without more delay the prince leading the pair proceeded down through the echoing stairway of the tower and out through the grating into the ample air and sunshine of the morning and among the terraces and flowerbeds of the garden they crossed the fishpond where the carp were leaping as thick as bees they mounted one after another the various flights of stairs snowed upon as they went with april blossoms and marching in time to the great orchestra of birds nor did otto pause till they had reached the highest terrace of the garden here was a gate into the park and hard by under a tuft of laurel a marble garden seat hence they looked down on the green tops of many elmtrees where the rooks were busy and beyond that upon the palace roof and the yellow banner flying in the blue i pray you to be seated sir said otto  sir john complied without a word and for some seconds otto walked to and fro before him plunged in angry thought the birds were all singing for a wager  sir said the prince at length turning towards the englishman you are to me except by the conventions of society a perfect stranger of your character and wishes i am ignorant i have never wittingly disobliged you there is a difference in station which i desire to waive i would if you still think me entitled to so much considerationi would be regarded simply as a gentleman now sir i did wrong to glance at these papers which i here return to you but if curiosity be undignified as i am free to own falsehood is both cowardly and cruel i opened your roll and what did i findwhat did i find about my wife lies he broke out they are lies there are not so help me god four words of truth in your intolerable libel you are a man you are old and might be the girls father you are a gentleman you are a scholar and have learned refinement and you rake together all this vulgar scandal and propose to print it in a public book such is your chivalry but thank god sir she has still a husband you say sir in that paper in your hand that i am a bad fencer i have to request from you a lesson in the art the park is close behind yonder is the pheasant house where you will find your carriage should i fall you know siryou have written it in your paperhow little my movements are regarded i am in the custom of disappearing it will be one more disappearance and long before it has awakened a remark you may be safe across the border  you will observe said sir john that what you ask is impossible  and if i struck you cried the prince with a sudden menacing flash  it would be a cowardly blow returned the baronet unmoved for it would make no change i cannot draw upon a reigning sovereign  and it is this man to whom you dare not offer satisfaction that you choose to insult cried otto  pardon me said the traveller you are unjust it is because you are a reigning sovereign that i cannot fight with you and it is for the same reason that i have a right to criticise your action and your wife you are in everything a public creature you belong to the public body and bone you have with you the law the muskets of the army and the eyes of spies we on our side have but one weapontruth  truth echoed the prince with a gesture  there was another silence  your highness said sir john at last you must not expect grapes from a thistle i am old and a cynic nobody cares a rush for me and on the whole after the present interview i scarce know anybody that i like better than yourself you see i have changed my mind and have the uncommon virtue to avow the change i tear up this stuff before you here in your own garden i ask your pardon i ask the pardon of the princess and i give you my word of honour as a gentleman and an old man that when my book of travels shall appear it shall not contain so much as the name of grünewald and yet it was a racy chapter but had your highness only read about the other courts i am a carrion crow but it is not my fault after all that the world is such a nauseous kennel  sir said otto is the eye not jaundiced  nay cried the traveller very likely i am one who goes sniffing i am no poet i believe in a better future for the world or at all accounts i do most potently disbelieve in the present rotten eggs is the burthen of my song but indeed your highness when i meet with any merit i do not think that i am slow to recognise it this is a day that i shall still recall with gratitude for i have found a sovereign with some manly virtues and for onceold courtier and old radical as i amit is from the heart and quite sincerely that i can request the honour of kissing your highnesss hand  nay sir said otto to my heart  and the englishman taken at unawares was clasped for a moment in the princes arms  and now sir added otto there is the pheasant house close behind it you will find my carriage which i pray you to accept god speed you to vienna  in the impetuosity of youth replied sir john your highness has overlooked one circumstance i am still fasting  well sir said otto smiling you are your own master you may go or stay but i warn you your friend may prove less powerful than your enemies the prince indeed is thoroughly on your side he has all the will to help but to whom do i speakyou know better than i do he is not alone in grünewald  there is a deal in position returned the traveller gravely nodding gondremark loves to temporise his policy is below ground and he fears all open courses and now that i have seen you act with so much spirit i will cheerfully risk myself on your protection who knows you may be yet the better man  do you indeed believe so cried the prince you put life into my heart  i will give up sketching portraits said the baronet i am a blind owl i had misread you strangely and yet remember this a sprint is one thing and to run all day another for i still mistrust your constitution the short nose the hair and eyes of several complexions no they are diagnostic and i must end i see as i began  i am still a singing chambermaid said otto  nay your highness i pray you to forget what i had written said sir john i am not like pilate and the chapter is no more bury it if you love me     chapter iv  while the prince is in the anteroom   greatly comforted by the exploits of the morning the prince turned towards the princesss anteroom bent on a more difficult enterprise the curtains rose before him the usher called his name and he entered the room with an exaggeration of his usual mincing and airy dignity there were about a score of persons waiting principally ladies it was one of the few societies in grünewald where otto knew himself to be popular and while a maid of honour made her exit by a side door to announce his arrival to the princess he moved round the apartment collecting homage and bestowing compliments with friendly grace had this been the sum of his duties he had been an admirable monarch lady after lady was impartially honoured by his attention  madam he said to one how does this happen i find you daily more adorable  and your highness daily browner replied the lady we began equal oh there i will be bold we have both beautiful complexions but while i study mine your highness tans himself  a perfect negro madam and what so fitlybeing beautys slave said ottomadame grafinski when is our next play i have just heard that i am a bad actor  o ciel cried madame grafinski who could venture what a bear  an excellent man i can assure you returned otto  o never o is it possible fluted the lady your highness plays like an angel  you must be right madam who could speak falsely and yet look so charming said the prince but this gentleman it seems would have preferred me playing like an actor  a sort of hum a falsetto feminine cooing greeted the tiny sally and otto expanded like a peacock this warm atmosphere of women and flattery and idle chatter pleased him to the marrow  madame von eisenthal your coiffure is delicious he remarked  everyone was saying so said one  if i have pleased prince charming and madame von eisenthal swept him a deep curtsey with a killing glance of adoration  it is new he asked vienna fashion  mint new replied the lady for your highnesss return i felt young this morning it was a premonition but why prince do you ever leave us  for the pleasure of the return said otto i am like a dog i must bury my bone and then come back to gloat upon it  o a bone fie what a comparison you have brought back the manners of the wood returned the lady  madam it is what the dog has dearest said the prince but i observe madame von rosen  and otto leaving the group to which he had been piping stepped towards the embrasure of a window where a lady stood  the countess von rosen had hitherto been silent and a thought depressed but on the approach of otto she began to brighten she was tall slim as a nymph and of a very airy carriage and her face which was already beautiful in repose lightened and changed flashed into smiles and glowed with a lovely colour at the touch of animation she was a good vocalist and even in speech her voice commanded a great range of changes the low notes rich with tenor quality the upper ringing on the brink of laughter into music a gem of many facets and variable hues of fire a woman who withheld the better portion of her beauty and then in a caressing second flashed it like a weapon full on the beholder now merely a tall figure and a sallow handsome face with the evidences of a reckless temper anon opening like a flower to life and colour mirth and tendernessmadame von rosen had always a dagger in reserve for the despatch of illassured admirers she met otto with the dart of tender gaiety  you have come to me at last prince cruel she said butterfly well and am i not to kiss your hand she added  madam it is i who must kiss yours and otto bowed and kissed it  you deny me every indulgence she said smiling  and now what news in court inquired the prince i come to you for my gazette  ditchwater she replied the world is all asleep grown grey in slumber i do not remember any waking movement since quite an eternity and the last thing in the nature of a sensation was the last time my governess was allowed to box my ears but yet i do myself and your unfortunate enchanted palace some injustice here is the lasto positively and she told him the story from behind her fan with many glances many cunning strokes of the narrators art the others had drawn away for it was understood that madame von rosen was in favour with the prince none the less however did the countess lower her voice at times to within a semitone of whispering and the pair leaned together over the narrative  do you know said otto laughing you are the only entertaining woman on this earth  o you have found out so much she cried  yes madam i grow wiser with advancing years he returned  years she repeated do you name the traitors i do not believe in years the calendar is a delusion  you must be right madam replied the prince for six years that we have been good friends i have observed you to grow younger  flatterer cried she and then with a change but why should i say so she added when i protest i think the same a week ago i had a council with my father director the glass and the glass replied not yet i confess my face in this way once a month o a very solemn moment do you know what i shall do when the mirror answers now  i cannot guess said he  no more can i returned the countess there is such a choice suicide gambling a nunnery a volume of memoirs or politicsthe last i am afraid  it is a dull trade said otto  nay she replied it is a trade i rather like it is after all first cousin to gossip which no one can deny to be amusing for instance if i were to tell you that the princess and the baron rode out together daily to inspect the cannon it is either a piece of politics or scandal as i turn my phrase i am the alchemist that makes the transmutation they have been everywhere together since you left she continued brightening as she saw otto darken that is a poor snippet of malicious gossipand they were everywhere cheeredand with that addition all becomes political intelligence  let us change the subject said otto  i was about to propose it she replied or rather to pursue the politics do you know this war is popularpopular to the length of cheering princess seraphina  all things madam are possible said the prince and this among others that we may be going into war but i give you my word of honour i do not know with whom  and you put up with it she cried i have no pretensions to morality and i confess i have always abominated the lamb and nourished a romantic feeling for the wolf o be done with lambiness let us see there is a prince for i am weary of the distaff  madam said otto i thought you were of that faction  i should be of yours mon prince if you had one she retorted is it true that you have no ambition there was a man once in england whom they call the kingmaker do you know she added i fancy i could make a prince  some day madam said otto i may ask you to help make a farmer  is that a riddle asked the countess  it is replied the prince and a very good one too  tit for tat i will ask you another she returned where is gondremark  the prime minister in the primeministry no doubt said otto  precisely said the countess and she pointed with her fan to the door of the princesss apartments you and i mon prince are in the anteroom you think me unkind she added try me and you will see set me a task put me a question there is no enormity i am not capable of doing to oblige you and no secret that i am not ready to betray  nay madam but i respect my friend too much he answered kissing her hand i would rather remain ignorant of all we fraternise like foemen soldiers at the outposts but let each be true to his own army  ah she cried if all men were generous like you it would be worth while to be a woman yet judging by her looks his generosity if anything had disappointed her she seemed to seek a remedy and having found it brightened once more and now she said may i dismiss my sovereign this is rebellion and a cas pendable but what am i to do my bear is jealous  madam enough cried otto ahasuerus reaches you the sceptre more he will obey you in all points i should have been a dog to come to whistling  and so the prince departed and fluttered round grafinski and von eisenthal but the countess knew the use of her offensive weapons and had left a pleasant arrow in the princes heart that gondremark was jealoushere was an agreeable revenge and madame von rosen as the occasion of the jealousy appeared to him in a new light     chapter v   gondremark is in my ladys chamber   the countess von rosen spoke the truth the great prime minister of grünewald was already closeted with seraphina the toilet was over and the princess tastefully arrayed sat face to face with a tall mirror sir johns description was unkindly true true in terms and yet a libel a misogynistic masterpiece her forehead was perhaps too high but it became her her figure somewhat stooped but every detail was formed and finished like a gem her hand her foot her ear the set of her comely head were all dainty and accordant if she was not beautiful she was vivid changeful coloured and pretty with a thousand various prettinesses and her eyes if they indeed rolled too consciously yet rolled to purpose they were her most attractive feature yet they continually bore eloquent false witness to her thoughts for while she herself in the depths of her immature unsoftened heart was given altogether to manlike ambition and the desire of power the eyes were by turns bold inviting fiery melting and artful like the eyes of a rapacious siren and artful in a sense she was chafing that she was not a man and could not shine by action she had conceived a womans part of answerable domination she sought to subjugate for byends to rain influence and be fancy free and while she loved not man loved to see man obey her it is a common girls ambition such was perhaps that lady of the glove who sent her lover to the lions but the snare is laid alike for male and female and the world most artfully contrived  near her in a low chair gondremark had arranged his limbs into a catlike attitude highshouldered stooping and submiss the formidable blue jowl of the man and the dull bilious eye set perhaps a higher value on his evident desire to please his face was marked by capacity temper and a kind of bold piratical dishonesty which it would be calumnious to call deceit his manners as he smiled upon the princess were overfine yet hardly elegant  possibly said the baron i should now proceed to take my leave i must not keep my sovereign in the anteroom let us come at once to a decision  it cannot cannot be put off she asked  it is impossible answered gondremark your highness sees it for herself in the earlier stages we might imitate the serpent but for the ultimatum there is no choice but to be bold like lions had the prince chosen to remain away it had been better but we have gone too far forward to delay  what can have brought him she cried today of all days  the marplot madam has the instinct of his nature returned gondremark but you exaggerate the peril think madam how far we have prospered and against what odds shall a featherheadbut no and he blew upon his fingers lightly with a laugh  featherhead she replied is still the prince of grünewald  on your sufferance only and so long as you shall please to be indulgent said the baron there are rights of nature power to the powerful is the law if he shall think to cross your destinywell you have heard of the brazen and the earthen pot  do you call me pot you are ungallant baron laughed the princess  before we are done with your glory i shall have called you by many different titles he replied  the girl flushed with pleasure but frédéric is still the prince monsieur le flatteur she said you do not propose a revolutionyou of all men  dear madam when it is already made he cried the prince reigns indeed in the almanac but my princess reigns and rules and he looked at her with a fond admiration that made the heart of seraphina swell looking on her huge slave she drank the intoxicating joys of power meanwhile he continued with that sort of massive archness that so ill became him she has but one fault there is but one danger in the great career that i foresee for her may i name it may i be so irreverent it is in herselfher heart is soft  her courage is faint baron said the princess suppose we have judged ill suppose we were defeated  defeated madam returned the baron with a touch of illhumour is the dog defeated by the hare our troops are all cantoned along the frontier in five hours the vanguard of five thousand bayonets shall be hammering on the gates of brandenau and in all gerolstein there are not fifteen hundred men who can manoeuvre it is as simple as a sum there can be no resistance  it is no great exploit she said is that what you call glory it is like beating a child  the courage madam is diplomatic he replied we take a grave step we fix the eyes of europe for the first time on grünewald and in the negotiations of the next three months mark me we stand or fall it is there madam that i shall have to depend upon your counsels he added almost gloomily if i had not seen you at work if i did not know the fertility of your mind i own i should tremble for the consequence but it is in this field that men must recognise their inability all the great negotiators when they have not been women have had women at their elbows madame de pompadour was ill served she had not found her gondremark but what a mighty politician catherine de medici too what justice of sight what readiness of means what elasticity against defeat but alas madam her featherheads were her own children and she had that one touch of vulgarity that one trait of the goodwife that she suffered family ties and affections to confine her liberty  these singular views of history strictly ad usum seraphinæ did not weave their usual soothing spell over the princess it was plain that she had taken a momentary distaste to her own resolutions for she continued to oppose her counsellor looking upon him out of halfclosed eyes and with the shadow of a sneer upon her lips what boys men are she said what lovers of big words courage indeed if you had to scour pans herr von gondremark you would call it i suppose domestic courage  i would madam said the baron stoutly if i scoured them well i would put a good name upon a virtue you will not overdo it they are not so enchanting in themselves  well but let me see she said i wish to understand your courage why we asked leave like children our grannie in berlin our uncle in vienna the whole family have patted us on the head and sent us forward courage i wonder when i hear you  my princess is unlike herself returned the baron she has forgotten where the peril lies true we have received encouragement on every hand but my princess knows too well on what untenable conditions and she knows besides how in the publicity of the diet these whispered conferences are forgotten and disowned the danger is very realhe raged inwardly at having to blow the very coal he had been quenchingnone the less real in that it is not precisely military but for that reason the easier to be faced had we to count upon your troops although i share your highnesss expectations of the conduct of alvenau we cannot forget that he has not been proved in chief command but where negotiation is concerned the conduct lies with us and with your help i laugh at danger  it may be so said seraphina sighing it is elsewhere that i see danger the people these abominable peoplesuppose they should instantly rebel what a figure we should make in the eyes of europe to have undertaken an invasion while my own throne was tottering to its fall  nay madam said gondremark smiling here you are beneath yourself what is it that feeds their discontent what but the taxes once we have seized gerolstein the taxes are remitted the sons return covered with renown the houses are adorned with pillage each tastes his little share of military glory and behold us once again a happy family ay they will say in each others long ears the princess knew what she was about she was in the right of it she has a head upon her shoulders and here we are you see better off than before but why should i say all this it is what my princess pointed out to me herself it was by these reasons that she converted me to this adventure  i think herr von gondremark said seraphina somewhat tartly you often attribute your own sagacity to your princess  for a second gondremark staggered under the shrewdness of the attack the next he had perfectly recovered do i he said it is very possible i have observed a similar tendency in your highness  it was so openly spoken and appeared so just that seraphina breathed again her vanity had been alarmed and the greatness of the relief improved her spirits well she said all this is little to the purpose we are keeping frédéric without and i am still ignorant of our line of battle come coadmiral let us consult how am i to receive him now and what are we to do if he should appear at the council  now he answered i shall leave him to my princess for just now i have seen her at work send him off to his theatricals but in all gentleness he added would it for instance would it displease my sovereign to affect a headache  never said she the woman who can manage like the man who can fight must never shrink from an encounter the knight must not disgrace his weapons  then let me pray my belle dame sans merci he returned to affect the only virtue that she lacks be pitiful to the poor young man affect an interest in his hunting be weary of politics find in his society as it were a grateful repose from dry considerations does my princess authorise the line of battle  well that is a trifle answered seraphina the councilthere is the point  the council cried gondremark permit me madam and he rose and proceeded to flutter about the room counterfeiting otto both in voice and gesture not unhappily what is there today herr von gondremark ah herr cancellarius a new wig you cannot deceive me i know every wig in grünewald i have the sovereigns eye what are these papers about o i see o certainly surely surely i wager none of you remarked that wig by all means i know nothing about that dear me are there as many as all that well you can sign them you have the procuration you see herr cancellarius i knew your wig and so concluded gondremark resuming his own voice our sovereign by the particular grace of god enlightens and supports his privy councillors  but when the baron turned to seraphina for approval he found her frozen you are pleased to be witty herr von gondremark she said and have perhaps forgotten where you are but these rehearsals are apt to be misleading your master the prince of grünewald is sometimes more exacting  gondremark cursed her in his soul of all injured vanities that of the reproved buffoon is the most savage and when grave issues are involved these petty stabs become unbearable but gondremark was a man of iron he showed nothing he did not even like the common trickster retreat because he had presumed but held to his point bravely madam he said if as you say he prove exacting we must take the bull by the horns  we shall see she said and she arranged her skirt like one about to rise temper scorn disgust all the more acrid feelings became her like jewels and she now looked her best  pray god they quarrel thought gondremark the damned minx may fail me yet unless they quarrel it is time to let him in zzfight dogs consequent on these reflections he bent a stiff knee and chivalrously kissed the princesss hand my princess he said must now dismiss her servant i have much to arrange against the hour of council  go she said and rose  and as gondremark tripped out of a private door she touched a bell and gave the order to admit the prince     chapter vi  the prince delivers a lecture on marriage with practical illustrations of divorce   with what a world of excellent intentions otto entered his wifes cabinet how fatherly how tender how morally affecting were the words he had prepared nor was seraphina unamiably inclined her usual fear of otto as a marplot in her great designs was now swallowed up in a passing distrust of the designs themselves for gondremark besides she had conceived an angry horror in her heart she did not like the baron behind his impudent servility behind the devotion which with indelicate delicacy he still forced on her attention she divined the grossness of his nature so a man may be proud of having tamed a bear and yet sicken at his captives odour and above all she had certain jealous intimations that the man was false and the deception double true she falsely trifled with his love but he perhaps was only trifling with her vanity the insolence of his late mimicry and the odium of her own position as she sat and watched it lay besides like a load upon her conscience she met otto almost with a sense of guilt and yet she welcomed him as a deliverer from ugly things  but the wheels of an interview are at the mercy of a thousand ruts and even at ottos entrance the first jolt occurred gondremark he saw was gone but there was the chair drawn close for consultation and it pained him not only that this man had been received but that he should depart with such an air of secrecy struggling with this twinge it was somewhat sharply that he dismissed the attendant who had brought him in  you make yourself at home chez moi she said a little ruffled both by his tone of command and by the glance he had thrown upon the chair  madam replied otto i am here so seldom that i have almost the rights of a stranger  you choose your own associates frédéric she said  i am here to speak of it he returned it is now four years since we were married and these four years seraphina have not perhaps been happy either for you or for me i am well aware i was unsuitable to be your husband i was not young i had no ambition i was a trifler and you despised me i dare not say unjustly but to do justice on both sides you must bear in mind how i have acted when i found it amused you to play the part of princess on this little stage did i not immediately resign to you my box of toys this grünewald and when i found i was distasteful as a husband could any husband have been less intrusive you will tell me that i have no feelings no preference and thus no credit that i go before the wind that all this was in my character and indeed one thing is truethat it is easy too easy to leave things undone but seraphina i begin to learn it is not always wise if i were too old and too uncongenial for your husband i should still have remembered that i was the prince of that country to which you came a visitor and a child in that relation also there were duties and these duties i have not performed  to claim the advantage of superior age is to give sure offence duty laughed seraphina and on your lips frédéric you make me laugh what fancy is this go flirt with the maids and be a prince in dresden china as you look enjoy yourself mon enfant and leave duty and the state to us  the plural grated on the prince i have enjoyed myself too much he said since enjoyment is the word and yet there were much to say upon the other side you must suppose me desperately fond of hunting but indeed there were days when i found a great deal of interest in what it was courtesy to call my government and i have always had some claim to taste i could tell live happiness from dull routine and between hunting and the throne of austria and your society my choice had never wavered had the choice been mine you were a girl a bud when you were given me  heavens she cried is this to be a lovescene  i am never ridiculous he said it is my only merit and you may be certain this shall be a scene of marriage à la mode but when i remember the beginning it is bare courtesy to speak in sorrow be just madam you would think me strangely uncivil to recall these days without the decency of a regret be yet a little juster and own if only in complaisance that you yourself regret that past  i have nothing to regret said the princess you surprise me i thought you were so happy  happy and happy there are so many hundred ways said otto a man may be happy in revolt he may be happy in sleep wine change and travel make him happy virtue they say will do the likei have not tried and they say also that in old quiet and habitual marriages there is yet another happiness happy yes i am happy if you like but i will tell you frankly i was happier when i brought you home  well said the princess not without constraint it seems you changed your mind  not i returned otto i never changed do you remember seraphina on our way home when you saw the roses in the lane and i got out and plucked them it was a narrow lane between great trees the sunset at the end was all gold and the rooks were flying overhead there were nine nine red roses you gave me a kiss for each and i told myself that every rose and every kiss should stand for a year of love well in eighteen months there was an end but do you fancy seraphina that my heart has altered  i am sure i cannot tell she said like an automaton  it has not the prince continued there is nothing ridiculous even from a husband in a love that owns itself unhappy and that asks no more i built on sand pardon me i do not breathe a reproachi built i suppose upon my own infirmities but i put my heart in the building and it still lies among the ruins  how very poetical she said with a little choking laugh unknown relentings unfamiliar softnesses moving within her what would you be at she added hardening her voice  i would be at this he answered and hard it is to say i would be at thisseraphina i am your husband after all and a poor fool that loves you understand he cried almost fiercely i am no suppliant husband what your love refuses i would scorn to receive from your pity i do not ask i would not take it and for jealousy what ground have i a doginthemanger jealousy is a thing the dogs may laugh at but at least in the worlds eye i am still your husband and i ask you if you treat me fairly i keep to myself i leave you free i have given you in everything your will what do you in return i find seraphina that you have been too thoughtless but between persons such as we are in our conspicuous station particular care and a particular courtesy are owing scandal is perhaps not easy to avoid but it is hard to bear  scandal she cried with a deep breath scandal it is for this you have been driving  i have tried to tell you how i feel he replied i have told you that i love youlove you in vaina bitter thing for a husband i have laid myself open that i might speak without offence and now that i have begun i will go on and finish  i demand it she said what is this about  otto flushed crimson i have to say what i would fain not he answered i counsel you to see less of gondremark  of gondremark and why she asked  your intimacy is the ground of scandal madam said otto firmly enoughof a scandal that is agony to me and would be crushing to your parents if they knew it  you are the first to bring me word of it said she i thank you  you have perhaps cause he replied perhaps i am the only one among your friends  o leave my friends alone she interrupted my friends are of a different stamp you have come to me here and made a parade of sentiment when have i last seen you i have governed your kingdom for you in the meantime and there i got no help at last when i am weary with a mans work and you are weary of your playthings you return to make me a scene of conjugal reproachesthe grocer and his wife the positions are too much reversed and you should understand at least that i cannot at the same time do your work of government and behave myself like a little girl scandal is the atmosphere in which we live we princes it is what a prince should know you play an odious part do you believe this rumour  madam should i be here said otto  it is what i want to know she cried the tempest of her scorn increasing suppose you didi say suppose you did believe it  i should make it my business to suppose the contrary he answered  i thought so o you are made of baseness said she  madam he cried roused at last enough of this you wilfully misunderstand my attitude you outwear my patience in the name of your parents in my own name i summon you to be more circumspect  is this a request monsieur mon mari she demanded  madam if i chose i might command said otto  you might sir as the law stands make me prisoner returned seraphina short of that you will gain nothing  you will continue as before he asked  precisely as before said she as soon as this comedy is over i shall request the freiherr von gondremark to visit me do you understand she added rising for my part i have done  i will then ask the favour of your hand madam said otto palpitating in every pulse with anger i have to request that you will visit in my society another part of my poor house and reassure yourselfit will not take longand it is the last obligation that you shall have the chance to lay me under  the last she cried most joyfully  she offered her hand and he took it on each side with an elaborate affectation each inwardly incandescent he led her out by the private door following where gondremark had passed they threaded a corridor or two little frequented looking on a court until they came at last into the princes suite the first room was an armoury hung all about with the weapons of various countries and looking forth on the front terrace  have you brought me here to slay me she inquired  i have brought you madam only to pass on replied otto  next they came to a library where an old chamberlain sat half asleep he rose and bowed before the princely couple asking for orders  you will attend us here said otto  the next stage was a gallery of pictures where seraphinas portrait hung conspicuous dressed for the chase red roses in her hair as otto in the first months of marriage had directed he pointed to it without a word she raised her eyebrows in silence and they passed still forward into a matted corridor where four doors opened one led to ottos bedroom one was the private door to seraphinas and here for the first time otto left her hand and stepping forward shot the bolt  it is long madam said he since it was bolted on the other side  one was effectual returned the princess is this all  shall i reconduct you he asked bowing  i should prefer she asked in ringing tones the conduct of the freiherr von gondremark  otto summoned the chamberlain if the freiherr von gondremark is in the palace he said bid him attend the princess here and when the official had departed can i do more to serve you madam the prince asked  thank you no i have been much amused she answered  i have now continued otto given you your liberty complete this has been for you a miserable marriage  miserable said she  it has been made light to you it shall be lighter still continued the prince but one thing madam you must still continue to bearmy fathers name which is now yours i leave it in your hands let me see you since you will have no advice of mine apply the more attention of your own to bear it worthily  herr von gondremark is long in coming she remarked  o seraphina seraphina he cried and that was the end of their interview  she tripped to a window and looked out and a little after the chamberlain announced the freiherr von gondremark who entered with something of a wild eye and changed complexion confounded as he was at this unusual summons the princess faced round from the window with a pearly smile nothing but her heightened colour spoke of discomposure otto was pale but he was otherwise master of himself  herr von gondremark said he oblige me so far reconduct the princess to her own apartment  the baron still all at sea offered his hand which was smilingly accepted and the pair sailed forth through the picturegallery  as soon as they were gone and otto knew the length and breadth of his miscarriage and how he had done the contrary of all that he intended he stood stupefied a fiasco so complete and sweeping was laughable even to himself and he laughed aloud in his wrath upon this mood there followed the sharpest violence of remorse and to that again as he recalled his provocation anger succeeded afresh so he was tossed in spirit now bewailing his inconsequence and lack of temper now flaming up in whitehot indignation and a noble pity for himself  he paced his apartment like a leopard there was danger in otto for a flash like a pistol he could kill at one moment and the next he might be kicked aside but just then as he walked the long floors in his alternate humours tearing his handkerchief between his hands he was strung to his top note every nerve attent the pistol you might say was charged and when jealousy from time to time fetched him a lash across the tenderest of his feeling and sent a string of her firepictures glancing before his minds eye the contraction of his face was even dangerous he disregarded jealousys inventions yet they stung in this height of anger he still preserved his faith in seraphinas innocence but the thought of her possible misconduct was the bitterest ingredient in his pot of sorrow  there came a knock at the door and the chamberlain brought him a note he took it and ground it in his hand continuing his march continuing his bewildered thoughts and some minutes had gone by before the circumstance came clearly to his mind then he paused and opened it it was a pencil scratch from gotthold thus conceived    the council is privately summoned at once       g v h  if the council was thus called before the hour and that privately it was plain they feared his interference feared here was a sweet thought gotthold toogotthold who had always used and regarded him as a mere peasant lad had now been at the pains to warn him gotthold looked for something at his hands well none should be disappointed the prince too long beshadowed by the uxorious lover should now return and shine he summoned his valet repaired the disorder of his appearance with elaborate care and then curled and scented and adorned prince charming in every line but with a twitching nostril he set forth unattended for the council     chapter vii  the prince dissolves the council   it was as gotthold wrote the liberation of sir john greisengesangs uneasy narrative last of all the scene between seraphina and the prince had decided the conspirators to take a step of bold timidity there had been a period of bustle liveried messengers speeding here and there with notes and at halfpast ten in the morning about an hour before its usual hour the council of grünewald sat around the board  it was not a large body at the instance of gondremark it had undergone a strict purgation and was now composed exclusively of tools three secretaries sat at a sidetable seraphina took the head on her right was the baron on her left greisengesang below these grafinski the treasurer count eisenthal a couple of noncombatants and to the surprise of all gotthold he had been named a privy councillor by otto merely that he might profit by the salary and as he was never known to attend a meeting it had occurred to nobody to cancel his appointment his present appearance was the more ominous coming when it did gondremark scowled upon him and the noncombatant on his right intercepting this black look edged away from one who was so clearly out of favour  the hour presses your highness said the baron may we proceed to business  at once replied seraphina  your highness will pardon me said gotthold but you are still perhaps unacquainted with the fact that prince otto has returned  the prince will not attend the council replied seraphina with a momentary blushthe despatches herr cancellarius there is one for gerolstein  a secretary brought a paper  here madam said greisengesang shall i read it  we are all familiar with its terms replied gondremark your highness approves  unhesitatingly said seraphina  it may then be held as read concluded the baron will your highness sign  the princess did so gondremark eisenthal and one of the noncombatants followed suit and the paper was then passed across the table to the librarian he proceeded leisurely to read  we have no time to spare herr doctor cried the baron brutally if you do not choose to sign on the authority of your sovereign pass it on or you may leave the table he added his temper ripping out  i decline your invitation herr von gondremark and my sovereign as i continue to observe with regret is still absent from the board replied the doctor calmly and he resumed the perusal of the paper the rest chafing and exchanging glances madam and gentlemen he said at last what i hold in my hand is simply a declaration of war  simply said seraphina flashing defiance  the sovereign of this country is under the same roof with us continued gotthold and i insist he shall be summoned it is needless to adduce my reasons you are all ashamed at heart of this projected treachery  the council waved like a sea there were various outcries  you insult the princess thundered gondremark  i maintain my protest replied gotthold  at the height of this confusion the door was thrown open an usher announced gentlemen the prince and otto with his most excellent bearing entered the apartment it was like oil upon the troubled waters every one settled instantly into his place and greisengesang to give himself a countenance became absorbed in the arrangement of his papers but in their eagerness to dissemble one and all neglected to rise  gentlemen said the prince pausing  they all got to their feet in a moment and this reproof still further demoralised the weaker brethren  the prince moved slowly towards the lower end of the table then he paused again and fixing his eye on greisengesang how comes it herr cancellarius he said that i have received no notice of the change of hour  your highness replied the chancellor her highness the princess  and there paused  i understood said seraphina taking him up that you did not purpose to be present  their eyes met for a second and seraphinas fell but her anger only burned the brighter for that private shame  and now gentlemen said otto taking his chair i pray you to be seated i have been absent there are doubtless some arrears but ere we proceed to business herr grafinski you will direct four thousand crowns to be sent to me at once make a note if you please he added as the treasurer still stared in wonder  four thousand crowns asked seraphina pray for what  madam returned otto smiling for my own purposes  gondremark spurred up grafinski underneath the table  if your highness will indicate the destination  began the puppet  you are not here sir to interrogate your prince said otto  grafinski looked for help to his commander and gondrermark came to his aid in suave and measured tones  your highness may reasonably be surprised he said and herr grafinski although i am convinced he is clear of the intention of offending would have perhaps done better to begin with an explanation the resources of the state are at the present moment entirely swallowed up or as we hope to prove wisely invested in a month from now i do not question we shall be able to meet any command your highness may lay upon us but at this hour i fear that even in so small a matter he must prepare himself for disappointment our zeal is no less although our power may be inadequate  how much herr grafinski have we in the treasury asked otto  your highness protested the treasurer we have immediate need of every crown  i think sir you evade me flashed the prince and then turning to the sidetable mr secretary he added bring me if you please the treasury docket  herr grafinski became deadly pale the chancellor expecting his own turn was probably engaged in prayer gondremark was watching like a ponderous cat gotthold on his part looked on with wonder at his cousin he was certainly showing spirit but what in such a time of gravity was all this talk of money and why should he waste his strength upon a personal issue  i find said otto with his finger on the docket that we have 20000 crowns in case  that is exact your highness replied the baron but our liabilities all of which are happily not liquid amount to a far larger sum and at the present point of time it would be morally impossible to divert a single florin essentially the case is empty we have already presented a large note for material of war  material of war exclaimed otto with an excellent assumption of surprise but if my memory serves me right we settled these accounts in january  there have been further orders the baron explained a new park of artillery has been completed five hundred stand of arms seven hundred baggage mulesthe details are in a special memorandummr secretary holtz the memorandum if you please  one would think gentlemen that we were going to war said otto  we are said seraphina  war cried the prince and gentlemen with whom the peace of grünewald has endured for centuries what aggression what insult have we suffered  here your highness said gotthold is the ultimatum it was in the very article of signature when your highness so opportunely entered  otto laid the paper before him as he read his fingers played tattoo upon the table was it proposed he inquired to send this paper forth without a knowledge of my pleasure  one of the noncombatants eager to trim volunteered an answer the herr doctor von hohenstockwitz had just entered his dissent he added  give me the rest of this correspondence said the prince it was handed to him and he read it patiently from end to end while the councillors sat foolishly enough looking before them on the table the secretaries in the background were exchanging glances of delight a row at the council was for them a rare and welcome feature  gentlemen said otto when he had finished i have read with pain this claim upon obermünsterol is palpably unjust it has not a tincture not a show of justice there is not in all this ground enough for afterdinner talk and you propose to force it as a casus belli  certainly your highness returned gondremark too wise to defend the indefensible the claim on obermünsterol is simply a pretext  it is well said the prince herr cancellarius take your pen the council he began to dictatei withhold all notice of my intervention he said in parenthesis and addressing himself more directly to his wife and i say nothing of the strange suppression by which this business has been smuggled past my knowledge i am content to be in timethe council he resumed on a further examination of the facts and enlightened by the note in the last despatch from gerolstein have the pleasure to announce that they are entirely at one both as to fact and sentiment with the grandducal court of gerolstein you have it upon these lines sir you will draw up the despatch  if your highness will allow me said the baron your highness is so imperfectly acquainted with the internal history of this correspondence that any interference will be merely hurtful such a paper as your highness proposes would be to stultify the whole previous policy of grünewald  the policy of grünewald cried the prince one would suppose you had no sense of humour would you fish in a coffee cup  with deference your highness returned the baron even in a coffee cup there may be poison the purpose of this war is not simply territorial enlargement still less is it a war of glory for as your highness indicates the state of grünewald is too small to be ambitious but the body politic is seriously diseased republicanism socialism many disintegrating ideas are abroad circle within circle a really formidable organisation has grown up about your highnesss throne  i have heard of it herr von gondremark put in the prince but i have reason to be aware that yours is the more authoritative information  i am honoured by this expression of my princes confidence returned gondremark unabashed it is therefore with a single eye to these disorders that our present external policy has been shaped something was required to divert public attention to employ the idle to popularise your highnesss rule and if it were possible to enable him to reduce the taxes at a blow and to a notable amount the proposed expeditionfor it cannot without hyperbole be called a warseemed to the council to combine the various characters required a marked improvement in the public sentiment has followed even upon our preparations and i cannot doubt that when success shall follow the effect will surpass even our boldest hopes  you are very adroit herr von gondremark said otto you fill me with admiration i had not heretofore done justice to your qualities  seraphina looked up with joy supposing otto conquered but gondremark still waited armed at every point he knew how very stubborn is the revolt of a weak character  and the territorial army scheme to which i was persuaded to consentwas it secretly directed to the same end the prince asked  i still believe the effect to have been good replied the baron discipline and mounting guard are excellent sedatives but i will avow to your highness i was unaware at the date of that decree of the magnitude of the revolutionary movement nor did any of us i think imagine that such a territorial army was a part of the republican proposals  it was asked otto strange upon what fancied grounds  the grounds were indeed fanciful returned the baron it was conceived among the leaders that a territorial army drawn from and returning to the people would in the event of any popular uprising prove lukewarm or unfaithful to the throne  i see said the prince i begin to understand  his highness begins to understand repeated gondremark with the sweetest politeness may i beg of him to complete the phrase  the history of the revolution replied otto drily and now he added what do you conclude  i conclude your highness with a simple reflection said the baron accepting the stab without a quiver the war is popular were the rumour contradicted tomorrow a considerable disappointment would be felt in many classes and in the present tension of spirits the most lukewarm sentiment may be enough to precipitate events there lies the danger the revolution hangs imminent we sit at this council board below the sword of damocles  we must then lay our heads together said the prince and devise some honourable means of safety  up to this moment since the first note of opposition fell from the librarian seraphina had uttered about twenty words with a somewhat heightened colour her eyes generally lowered her foot sometimes nervously tapping on the floor she had kept her own counsel and commanded her anger like a hero but at this stage of the engagement she lost control of her impatience  means she cried they have been found and prepared before you knew the need for them sign the despatch and let us be done with this delay  madam i said honourable returned otto bowing this war is in my eyes and by herr von gondremarks account an inadmissible expedient if we have misgoverned here in grünewald are the people of gerolstein to bleed and pay for our misdoings never madam not while i live but i attach so much importance to all that i have heard today for the first timeand why only today i do not even stop to askthat i am eager to find some plan that i can follow with credit to myself  and should you fail she asked  should i fail i will then meet the blow halfway replied the prince on the first open discontent i shall convoke the states and when it pleases them to bid me abdicate  seraphina laughed angrily this is the man for whom we have been labouring she cried we tell him of change he will devise the means he says and his device is abdication sir have you no shame to come here at the eleventh hour among those who have borne the heat and burthen of the day do you not wonder at yourself i sir was here in my place striving to uphold your dignity alone i took counsel with the wisest i could find while you were eating and hunting i have laid my plans with foresight they were ripe for action and then she chokedthen you returnfor a forenoonto ruin all tomorrow you will be once more about your pleasures you will give us leave once more to think and work for you and again you will come back and again you will thwart what you had not the industry or knowledge to conceive o it is intolerable be modest sir do not presume upon the rank you cannot worthily uphold i would not issue my commands with so much gustoit is from no merit in yourself they are obeyed what are you what have you to do in this grave council go she cried go among your equals the very people in the streets mock at you for a prince  at this surprising outburst the whole council sat aghast  madam said the baron alarmed out of his caution command yourself  address yourself to me sir cried the prince i will not bear these whisperings  seraphina burst into tears  sir cried the baron rising this lady  herr von gondremark said the prince one more observation and i place you under arrest  your highness is the master replied gondremark bowing  bear it in mind more constantly said otto herr cancellarius bring all the papers to my cabinet gentlemen the council is dissolved  and he bowed and left the apartment followed by greisengesang and the secretaries just at the moment when the princesss ladies summoned in all haste entered by another door to help her forth     chapter viii  the party of war takes action   half an hour after gondremark was once more closeted with seraphina  where is he now she asked on his arrival  madam he is with the chancellor replied the baron wonder of wonders he is at work  ah she said he was born to torture me o what a fall what a humiliation such a scheme to wreck upon so small a trifle but now all is lost  madam said gondremark nothing is lost something on the other hand is found you have found your senses you see him as he issee him as you see everything where your toogood heart is not in questionwith the judicial with the statesmans eye so long as he had a right to interfere the empire that may be was still distant i have not entered on this course without the plain foresight of its dangers and even for this i was prepared but madam i knew two things i knew that you were born to command that i was born to serve i knew that by a rare conjuncture the hand had found the tool and from the first i was confident as i am confident today that no hereditary trifler has the power to shatter that alliance  i born to command she said do you forget my tears  madam they were the tears of alexander cried the baron they touched they thrilled me i forgot myself a momenteven i but do you suppose that i had not remarked that i had not admired your previous bearing your great selfcommand ay that was princely he paused it was a thing to see i drank confidence i tried to imitate your calm and i was well inspired in my heart i think that i was well inspired that any man within the reach of argument had been convinced but it was not to be nor madam do i regret the failure let us be open let me disclose my heart i have loved two things not unworthily grünewald and my sovereign here he kissed her hand either i must resign my ministry leave the land of my adoption and the queen whom i had chosen to obeyor he paused again  alas herr von gondremark there is no or said seraphina  nay madam give me time he replied when first i saw you you were still young not every man would have remarked your powers but i had not been twice honoured by your conversation ere i had found my mistress i have madam i believe some genius and i have much ambition but the genius is of the serving kind and to offer a career to my ambition i had to find one born to rule this is the base and essence of our union each had need of the other each recognised master and servant lever and fulcrum the complement of his endowment marriages they say are made in heaven how much more these pure laborious intellectual fellowships born to found empires nor is this all we found each other ripe filled with great ideas that took shape and clarified with every word we grew togetheray madam in mind we grew together like twin children all of my life until we met was petty and groping was it noti will flatter myself openlyit was the same with you not till then had you those eagle surveys that wide and hopeful sweep of intuition thus we had formed ourselves and we were ready  it is true she cried i feel it yours is the genius your generosity confounds your insight all i could offer you was the position was this throne to be a fulcrum but i offered it without reserve i entered at least warmly into all your thoughts you were sure of mesure of my supportcertain of justice tell me tell me again that i have helped you  nay madam he said you made me in everything you were my inspiration and as we prepared our policy weighing every step how often have i had to admire your perspicacity your manlike diligence and fortitude you know that these are not the words of flattery your conscience echoes them have you spared a day have you indulged yourself in any pleasure young and beautiful you have lived a life of high intellectual effort of irksome intellectual patience with details well you have your reward with the fall of brandenau the throne of your empire is founded  what thought have you in your mind she asked is not all ruined  nay my princess the same thought is in both our minds he said  herr von gondremark she replied by all that i hold sacred i have none i do not think at all i am crushed  you are looking at the passionate side of a rich nature misunderstood and recently insulted said the baron look into your intellect and tell me  i find nothing nothing but tumult she replied  you find one word branded madam returned the baron abdication  o she cried the coward he leaves me to bear all and in the hour of trial he stabs me from behind there is nothing in him not respect not love not couragehis wife his dignity his throne the honour of his father he forgets them all  yes pursued the baron the word abdication i perceive a glimmering there  i read your fancy she returned it is mere madness midsummer madness baron i am more unpopular than he you know it they can excuse they can love his weakness but me they hate  such is the gratitude of peoples said the baron but we trifle here madam are my plain thoughts the man who in the hour of danger speaks of abdication is for me a venomous animal i speak with the bluntness of gravity madam this is no hour for mincing the coward in a station of authority is more dangerous than fire we dwell on a volcano if this man can have his way grünewald before a week will have been deluged with innocent blood you know the truth of what i say we have looked unblenching into this everpossible catastrophe to him it is nothing he will abdicate abdicate just god and this unhappy country committed to his charge and the lives of men and the honour of women his voice appeared to fail him in an instant he had conquered his emotion and resumed but you madam conceive more worthily of your responsibilities i am with you in the thought and in the face of the horrors that i see impending i say and your heart repeats itwe have gone too far to pause honour duty ay and the care of our own lives demand we should proceed  she was looking at him her brow thoughtfully knitted i feel it she said but how he has the power  the power madam the power is in the army he replied and then hastily ere she could intevene we have to save ourselves he went on i have to save my princess she has to save her minister we have both of us to save this infatuated youth from his own madness he in the outbreak would be the earliest victim i see him he cried torn in pieces and grünewald unhappy grünewald nay madam you who have the power must use it it lies hard upon your conscience  show me how she cried suppose i were to place him under some constraint the revolution would break upon us instantly  the baron feigned defeat it is true he said you see more clearly than i do yet there should there must be some way and he waited for his chance  no she said i told you from the first there is no remedy our hopes are lost lost by one miserable trifler ignorant fretful fitfulwho will have disappeared tomorrow who knows to his boorish pleasures  any peg would do for gondremark the thing he cried striking his brow fool not to have thought of it madam without perhaps knowing it you have solved our problem  what do you mean speak she said  he appeared to collect himself and then with a smile the prince he said must go once more ahunting  ay if he would cried she and stay there  and stay there echoed the baron it was so significantly said that her face changed and the schemer fearful of the sinister ambiguity of his expressions hastened to explain this time he shall go hunting in a carriage with a good escort of our foreign lancers his destination shall be the felsenburg it is healthy the rock is high the windows are small and barred it might have been built on purpose we shall entrust the captaincy to the scotsman gordon he at least will have no scruple who will miss the sovereign he is gone hunting he came home on tuesday on thursday he returned all is usual in that meanwhile the war proceeds our prince will soon weary of his solitude and about the time of our triumph or if he prove very obstinate a little later he shall be released upon a proper understanding and i see him once more directing his theatricals  seraphina sat gloomy plunged in thought yes she said suddenly and the despatch he is now writing it  it cannot pass the council before friday replied gondremark and as for any private note the messengers are all at my disposal they are picked men madam i am a person of precaution  it would appear so she said with a flash of her occasional repugnance to the man and then after a pause herr von gondremark she added i recoil from this extremity  i share your highnesss repugnance answered he but what would you have we are defenceless else  i see it but this is sudden it is a public crime she said nodding at him with a sort of horror  look but a little deeper he returned and whose is the crime  his she cried his before god and i hold him liable but still  it is not as if he would be harmed submitted gondremark  i know it she replied but it was still unheartily  and then as brave men are entitled by prescriptive right as old as the worlds history to the alliance and the active help of fortune the punctual goddess stepped down from the machine one of the princesss ladies begged to enter a man it appeared had brought a line for the freiherr von gondremark it proved to be a pencil billet which the crafty greisengesang had found the means to scribble and despatch under the very guns of otto and the daring of the act bore testimony to the terror of the actor for greisengesang had but one influential motive fear the note ran thus at the first council procuration to be withdrawncorn greis  so after three years of exercise the right of signature was to be stript from seraphina it was more than an insult it was a public disgrace and she did not pause to consider how she had earned it but morally bounded under the attack as bounds the wounded tiger  enough she said i will sign the order when shall he leave  it will take me twelve hours to collect my men and it had best be done at night tomorrow midnight if you please answered the baron  excellent she said my door is always open to you baron as soon as the order is prepared bring it me to sign  madam he said alone of all of us you do not risk your head in this adventure for that reason and to prevent all hesitation i venture to propose the order should be in your hand throughout  you are right she replied  he laid a form before her and she wrote the order in a clear hand and reread it suddenly a cruel smile came on her face i had forgotten his puppet said she they will keep each other company and she interlined and initialled the condemnation of dr gotthold  your highness has more memory than your servant said the baron and then he in his turn carefully perused the fateful paper good said he  you will appear in the drawingroom baron she asked  i thought it better said he to avoid the possibility of a public affront anything that shook my credit might hamper us in the immediate future  you are right she said and she held out her hand as to an old friend and equal     chapter ix  the price of the river farm in which vainglory goes before a fall   the pistol had been practically fired under ordinary circumstances the scene at the council table would have entirely exhausted ottos store both of energy and anger he would have begun to examine and condemn his conduct have remembered all that was true forgotten all that was unjust in seraphinas onslaught and by half an hour after would have fallen into that state of mind in which a catholic flees to the confessional and a sot takes refuge with the bottle two matters of detail preserved his spirits for first he had still an infinity of business to transact and to transact business for a man of ottos neglectful and procrastinating habits is the best anodyne for conscience all afternoon he was hard at it with the chancellor reading dictating signing and despatching papers and this kept him in a glow of selfapproval but secondly his vanity was still alarmed he had failed to get the money tomorrow before noon he would have to disappoint old killian and in the eyes of that family which counted him so little and to which he had sought to play the part of the heroic comforter he must sink lower than at first to a man of ottos temper this was death he could not accept the situation and even as he worked and worked wisely and well over the hated details of his principality he was secretly maturing a plan by which to turn the situation it was a scheme as pleasing to the man as it was dishonourable in the prince in which his frivolous nature found and took vengeance for the gravity and burthen of the afternoon he chuckled as he thought of it and greisengesang heard him with wonder and attributed his lively spirits to the skirmish of the morning  led by this idea the antique courtier ventured to compliment his sovereign on his bearing it reminded him he said of ottos father  what asked the prince whose thoughts were miles away  your highnesss authority at the board explained the flatterer  o that o yes returned otto but for all his carelessness his vanity was delicately tickled and his mind returned and dwelt approvingly over the details of his victory i quelled them all he thought  when the more pressing matters had been dismissed it was already late and otto kept the chancellor to dinner and was entertained with a leash of ancient histories and modern compliments the chancellors career had been based from the first offput on entire subserviency he had crawled into honours and employments and his mind was prostitute the instinct of the creature served him well with otto first he let fall a sneering word or two upon the female intellect thence he proceeded to a closer engagement and before the third course he was artfully dissecting seraphinas character to her approving husband of course no names were used and of course the identity of that abstract or ideal man with whom she was currently contrasted remained an open secret but this stiff old gentleman had a wonderful instinct for evil thus to wind his way into mans citadel thus to harp by the hour on the virtues of his hearer and not once alarm his selfrespect otto was all roseate in and out with flattery and tokay and an approving conscience he saw himself in the most attractive colours if even greisengesang he thought could thus espy the loose stitches in seraphinas character and thus disloyally impart them to the opposite camp he the discarded husbandthe dispossessed princecould scarce have erred on the side of severity  in this excellent frame he bade adieu to the old gentleman whose voice had proved so musical and set forth for the drawingroom already on the stair he was seized with some compunction but when he entered the great gallery and beheld his wife the chancellors abstract flatteries fell from him like rain and he reawoke to the poetic facts of life she stood a good way off below a shining lustre her back turned the bend of her waist overcame him with physical weakness this was the girlwife who had lain in his arms and whom he had sworn to cherish there was she who was better than success  it was seraphina who restored him from the blow she swam forward and smiled upon her husband with a sweetness that was insultingly artificial frédéric she lisped you are late it was a scene of high comedy such as is proper to unhappy marriages and her aplomb disgusted him  there was no etiquette at these small drawingrooms people came and went at pleasure the window embrasures became the roost of happy couples at the great chimney the talkers mostly congregated each fullcharged with scandal and down at the farther end the gamblers gambled it was towards this point that otto moved not ostentatiously but with a gentle insistence and scattering attentions as he went once abreast of the cardtable he placed himself opposite to madame von rosen and as soon as he had caught her eye withdrew to the embrasure of a window there she had speedily joined him  you did well to call me she said a little wildly these cards will be my ruin  leave them said otto  i she cried and laughed they are my destiny my only chance was to die of consumption now i must die in a garret  you are bitter tonight said otto  i have been losing she replied you do not know what greed is  i have come then in an evil hour said he  ah you wish a favour she cried brightening beautifully  madam said he i am about to found my party and i come to you for a recruit  done said the countess i am a man again  i may be wrong continued otto but i believe upon my heart you wish me no ill  i wish you so well she said that i dare not tell it you  then if i ask my favour quoth the prince  ask it mon prince she answered whatever it is it is granted  i wish you he returned this very night to make the farmer of our talk  heaven knows your meaning she exclaimed i know not neither care there are no bounds to my desire to please you call him made  i will put it in another way returned otto did you ever steal  often cried the countess i have broken all the ten commandments and if there were more tomorrow i should not sleep till i had broken these  this is a case of burglary to say the truth i thought it would amuse you said the prince  i have no practical experience she replied but o the goodwill i have broken a workbox in my time and several hearts my own included never a house but it cannot be difficult sins are so unromantically easy what are we to break  madam we are to break the treasury said otto and he sketched to her briefly wittily with here and there a touch of pathos the story of his visit to the farm of his promise to buy it and of the refusal with which his demand for money had been met that morning at the council concluding with a few practical words as to the treasury windows and the helps and hindrances of the proposed exploit  they refused you the money she said when he had done and you accepted the refusal well  they gave their reasons replied otto colouring they were not such as i could combat and i am driven to dilapidate the funds of my own country by a theft it is not dignified but it is fun  fun she said yes and then she remained silently plunged in thought for an appreciable time how much do you require she asked at length  three thousand crowns will do he answered for i have still some money of my own  excellent she said regaining her levity i am your true accomplice and where are we to meet  you know the flying mercury he answered in the park three pathways intersect there they have made a seat and raised the statue the spot is handy and the deity congenial  child she said and tapped him with her fan but do you know my prince you are an egoistyour handy trystingplace is miles from me you must give me ample time i cannot i think possibly be there before two but as the bell beats two your helper shall arrive welcome i trust staydo you bring anyone she added o it is not for a chaperoni am not a prude  i shall bring a groom of mine said otto i caught him stealing corn  his name she asked  i profess i know not i am not yet intimate with my cornstealer returned the prince it was in a professional capacity  like me flatterer she cried but oblige me in one thing let me find you waiting at the seatyes you shall await me for on this expedition it shall be no longer prince and countess it shall be the lady and the squireand your friend the thief shall be no nearer than the fountain do you promise  madam in everything you are to command you shall be captain i am but supercargo answered otto  well heaven bring all safe to port she said it is not friday  something in her manner had puzzled otto had possibly touched him with suspicion  is it not strange he remarked that i should choose my accomplice from the other camp  fool she said but it is your only wisdom that you know your friends and suddenly in the vantage of the deep window she caught up his hand and kissed it with a sort of passion now go she added go at once  he went somewhat staggered doubting in his heart that he was overbold for in that moment she had flashed upon him like a jewel and even through the strong panoply of a previous love he had been conscious of a shock next moment he had dismissed the fear  both otto and the countess retired early from the drawingroom and the prince after an elaborate feint dismissed his valet and went forth by the private passage and the back postern in quest of the groom  once more the stable was in darkness once more otto employed the talismanic knock and once more the groom appeared and sickened with terror  goodevening friend said otto pleasantly i want you to bring a corn sackempty this timeand to accompany me we shall be gone all night  your highness groaned the man i have the charge of the small stables i am here alone  come said the prince you are no such martinet in duty and then seeing that the man was shaking from head to foot otto laid a hand upon his shoulder if i meant you harm he said should i be here  the fellow became instantly reassured he got the sack and otto led him round by several paths and avenues conversing pleasantly by the way and left him at last planted by a certain fountain where a goggleeyed triton spouted intermittently into a rippling laver thence he proceeded alone to where in a round clearing a copy of gian bolognas mercury stood tiptoe in the twilight of the stars the night was warm and windless a shaving of new moon had lately arisen but it was still too small and too low down in heaven to contend with the immense host of lesser luminaries and the rough face of the earth was drenched with starlight down one of the alleys which widened as it receded he could see a part of the lamplit terrace where a sentry silently paced and beyond that a corner of the town with interlacing streetlights but all around him the young trees stood mystically blurred in the dim shine and in the stockstill quietness the upleaping god appeared alive  in this dimness and silence of the night ottos conscience became suddenly and staringly luminous like the dial of a city clock he averted the eyes of his mind but the finger rapidly travelling pointed to a series of misdeeds that took his breath away what was he doing in that place the money had been wrongly squandered but that was largely by his own neglect and he now proposed to embarrass the finances of this country which he had been too idle to govern and he now proposed to squander the money once again and this time for a private if a generous end and the man whom he had reproved for stealing corn he was now to set stealing treasure and then there was madame von rosen upon whom he looked down with some of that illfavoured contempt of the chaste male for the imperfect woman because he thought of her as one degraded below scruples he had picked her out to be still more degraded and to risk her whole irregular establishment in life by complicity in this dishonourable act it was uglier than a seduction  otto had to walk very briskly and whistle very busily and when at last he heard steps in the narrowest and darkest of the alleys it was with a gush of relief that he sprang to meet the countess to wrestle alone with ones good angel is so hard and so precious at the proper time is a companion certain to be less virtuous than oneself  it was a young man who came towards hima young man of small stature and a peculiar gait wearing a wide flapping hat and carrying with great weariness a heavy bag otto recoiled but the young man held up his hand by way of signal and coming up with a panting run as if with the last of his endurance laid the bag upon the ground threw himself upon the bench and disclosed the features of madame von rosen  you countess cried the prince  no no she panted the count von rosenmy young brother a capital fellow let him get his breath  ah madam  said he  call me count she returned respect my incognito  count be it then he replied and let me implore that gallant gentleman to set forth at once on our enterprise  sit down beside me here she returned patting the farther corner of the bench i will follow you in a moment o i am so tiredfeel how my heart leaps where is your thief  at his post replied otto shall i introduce him he seems an excellent companion  no she said do not hurry me yet i must speak to you not but i adore your thief i adore anyone who has the spirit to do wrong i never cared for virtue till i fell in love with my prince she laughed musically and even so it is not for your virtues she added  otto was embarrassed and now he asked if you are anyway rested  presently presently let me breathe she said panting a little harder than before  and what has so wearied you he asked this bag and why in the name of eccentricity a bag for an empty one you might have relied on my own foresight and this one is very far from being empty my dear count with what trash have you come laden but the shortest method is to see for myself and he put down his hand  she stopped him at once otto she said nonot that way i will tell i will make a clean breast it is done already i have robbed the treasury singlehanded there are three thousand two hundred crowns o i trust it is enough  her embarrassment was so obvious that the prince was struck into a muse gazing in her face with his hand still outstretched and she still holding him by the wrist you he said at last how and then drawing himself up o madam he cried i understand you must indeed think meanly of the prince  well then it was a lie she cried the money is mine honestly my ownnow yours this was an unworthy act that you proposed but i love your honour and i swore to myself that i should save it in your teeth i beg of you to let me save itwith a sudden lovely change of tone otto i beseech you let me save it take this dross from your poor friend who loves you  madam madam babbled otto in the extreme of misery i cannoti must go  and he half rose but she was on the ground before him in an instant clasping his knees no she gasped you shall not go do you despise me so entirely it is dross i hate it i should squander it at play and be no richer it is an investment it is to save me from ruin otto she cried as he again feebly tried to put her from him if you leave me alone in this disgrace i will die here he groaned aloud o she said think what i suffer if you suffer from a piece of delicacy think what i suffer in my shame to have my trash refused you would rather steal you think of me so basely you would rather tread my heart in pieces o unkind o my prince o otto o pity me she was still clasping him then she found his hand and covered it with kisses and at this his head began to turn o she cried again i see it o what a horror it is because i am old because i am no longer beautiful and she burst into a storm of sobs  this was the coup de grâce otto had now to comfort and compose her as he could and before many words the money was accepted between the woman and the weak man such was the inevitable end madame von rosen instantly composed her sobs she thanked him with a fluttering voice and resumed her place upon the bench at the far end from otto now you see she said why i bade you keep the thief at distance and why i came alone how i trembled for my treasure  madam said otto with a tearful whimper in his voice spare me you are too good too noble  i wonder to hear you she returned you have avoided a great folly you will be able to meet your good old peasant you have found an excellent investment for a friends money you have preferred essential kindness to an empty scruple and now you are ashamed of it you have made your friend happy and now you mourn as the dove come cheer up i know it is depressing to have done exactly right but you need not make a practice of it forgive yourself this virtue come now look me in the face and smile  he did look at her when a man has been embraced by a woman he sees her in a glamour and at such a time in the baffling glimmer of the stars she will look wildly well the hair is touched with light the eyes are constellations the face sketched in shadowsa sketch you might say by passion otto became consoled for his defeat he began to take an interest no he said i am no ingrate  you promised me fun she returned with a laugh i have given you as good we have had a stormy scena  he laughed in his turn and the sound of the laughter in either case was hardly reassuring  come what are you going to give me in exchange she continued for my excellent declamation  what you will he said  whatever i will upon your honour suppose i ask the crown she was flashing upon him beautiful in triumph  upon my honour he replied  shall i ask the crown she continued nay what should i do with it grünewald is but a petty state my ambition swells above it i shall aski find i want nothing she concluded i will give you something instead i will give you leave to kiss meonce  otto drew near and she put up her face they were both smiling both on the brink of laughter all was so innocent and playful and the prince when their lips encountered was dumfoundered by the sudden convulsion of his being both drew instantly apart and for an appreciable time sat tonguetied otto was indistinctly conscious of a peril in the silence but could find no words to utter suddenly the countess seemed to awake as for your wife she began in a clear and steady voice  the word recalled otto with a shudder from his trance i will hear nothing against my wife he cried wildly and then recovering himself and in a kindlier tone i will tell you my one secret he added i love my wife  you should have let me finish she returned smiling do you suppose i did not mention her on purpose you know you had lost your head well so had i come now do not be abashed by words she added somewhat sharply it is the one thing i despise if you are not a fool you will see that i am building fortresses about your virtue and at any rate i choose that you shall understand that i am not dying of love for you it is a very smiling business no tragedy for me and now here is what i have to say about your wife she is not and she never has been gondremarks mistress be sure he would have boasted if she had goodnight  and in a moment she was gone down the alley and otto was alone with the bag of money and the flying god     chapter x  gottholds revised opinion and the fall completed   the countess left poor otto with a caress and buffet simultaneously administered the welcome word about his wife and the virtuous ending of his interview should doubtless have delighted him but for all that as he shouldered the bag of money and set forward to rejoin his groom he was conscious of many aching sensibilities to have gone wrong and to have been set right makes but a double trial for mans vanity the discovery of his own weakness and possible unfaith had staggered him to the heart and to hear in the same hour of his wifes fidelity from one who loved her not increased the bitterness of the surprise  he was about halfway between the fountain and the flying mercury before his thoughts began to be clear and he was surprised to find them resentful he paused in a kind of temper and struck with his hand a little shrub thence there arose instantly a cloud of awakened sparrows which as instantly dispersed and disappeared into the thicket he looked at them stupidly and when they were gone continued staring at the stars i am angry by what right by none he thought but he was still angry he cursed madame von rosen and instantly repented heavy was the money on his shoulders  when he reached the fountain he did out of illhumour and parade an unpardonable act he gave the money bodily to the dishonest groom keep this for me he said until i call for it tomorrow it is a great sum and by that you will judge that i have not condemned you and he strode away ruffling as if he had done something generous it was a desperate stroke to reenter at the point of the bayonet into his selfesteem and like all such it was fruitless in the end he got to bed with the devil it appeared kicked and tumbled till the grey of the morning and then fell inopportunely into a leaden slumber and awoke to find it ten to miss the appointment with old killian after all had been too tragic a miscarriage and he hurried with all his might found the groom for a wonder faithful to his trust and arrived only a few minutes before noon in the guestchamber of the morning star killian was there in his sundays best and looking very gaunt and rigid a lawyer from brandenau stood sentinel over his outspread papers and the groom and the landlord of the inn were called to serve as witnesses the obvious deference of that great man the innkeeper plainly affected the old farmer with surprise but it was not until otto had taken the pen and signed that the truth flashed upon him fully then indeed he was beside himself  his highness he cried his highness and repeated the exclamation till his mind had grappled fairly with the facts then he turned to the witnesses gentlemen he said you dwell in a country highly favoured by god for of all generous gentlemen i will say it on my conscience this one is the king i am an old man and i have seen good and bad and the year of the great famine but a more excellent gentleman no never  we know that cried the landlord we know that well in grünewald if we saw more of his highness we should be the better pleased  it is the kindest prince began the groom and suddenly closed his mouth upon a sob so that every one turned to gaze upon his emotionotto not last otto struck with remorse to see the man so grateful  then it was the lawyers turn to pay a compliment i do not know what providence may hold in store he said but this day should be a bright one in the annals of your reign the shouts of armies could not be more eloquent than the emotion on these honest faces and the brandenau lawyer bowed skipped stepped back and took snuff with the air of a man who has found and seized an opportunity  well young gentleman said killian if you will pardon me the plainness of calling you a gentleman many a good days work you have done i doubt not but never a better or one that will be better blessed and whatever sir may be your happiness and triumph in that high sphere to which you have been called it will be none the worse sir for an old mans blessing  the scene had almost assumed the proportions of an ovation and when the prince escaped he had but one thought to go wherever he was most sure of praise his conduct at the board of council occurred to him as a fair chapter and this evoked the memory of gotthold to gotthold he would go  gotthold was in the library as usual and laid down his pen a little angrily on ottos entrance well he said here you are  well returned otto we made a revolution i believe  it is what i fear returned the doctor  how said otto fear fear is the burnt child i have learned my strength and the weakness of the others and i now mean to govern  gotthold said nothing but he looked down and smoothed his chin  you disapprove cried otto you are a weathercock  on the contrary replied the doctor my observation has confirmed my fears it will not do otto not do  what will not do demanded the prince with a sickening stab of pain  none of it answered gotthold you are unfitted for a life of action you lack the stamina the habit the restraint the patience your wife is greatly better vastly better and though she is in bad hands displays a very different aptitude she is a woman of affairs you aredear boy you are yourself i bid you back to your amusements like a smiling dominie i give you holidays for life yes he continued there is a day appointed for all when they shall turn again upon their own philosophy i had grown to disbelieve impartially in all and if in the atlas of the sciences there were two charts i disbelieved in more than all the rest they were politics and morals i had a sneaking kindness for your vices as they were negative they flattered my philosophy and i called them almost virtues well otto i was wrong i have forsworn my sceptical philosophy and i perceive your faults to be unpardonable you are unfit to be a prince unfit to be a husband and i give you my word i would rather see a man capably doing evil than blundering about good  otto was still silent in extreme dudgeon  presently the doctor resumed i will take the smaller matter first your conduct to your wife you went i hear and had an explanation that may have been right or wrong i know not at least you had stirred her temper at the council she insults you well you insult her backa man to a woman a husband to his wife in public next upon the back of this you proposethe story runs like wildfireto recall the power of signature can she ever forgive that a womana young womanambitious conscious of talents beyond yours never otto and to sum all at such a crisis in your married life you get into a window corner with that ogling dame von rosen i do not dream that there was any harm but i do say it was an idle disrespect to your wife why man the woman is not decent  gotthold said otto i will hear no evil of the countess  you will certainly hear no good of her returned gotthold and if you wish your wife to be the pink of nicety you should clear your court of demireputations  the commonplace injustice of a byword otto cried the partiality of sex she is a demirep what then is gondremark were she a man  it would be all one retorted gotthold roughly when i see a man come to years of wisdom who speaks in doublemeanings and is the braggart of his vices i spit on the other side you my friend say i are not even a gentleman well shes not even a lady  she is the best friend i have and i choose that she shall be respected otto said  if she is your friend so much the worse replied the doctor it will not stop there  ah cried otto there is the charity of virtue all evil in the spotted fruit but i can tell you sir that you do madame von rosen prodigal injustice  you can tell me said the doctor shrewdly have you tried have you been riding the marches  the blood came into ottos face  ah cried gotthold look at your wife and blush theres a wife for a man to marry and then lose shes a carnation otto the soul is in her eyes  you have changed your note for seraphina i perceive said otto  changed it cried the doctor with a flush why when was it different but i own i admired her at the council when she sat there silent tapping with her foot i admired her as i might a hurricane were i one of those who venture upon matrimony there had been the prize to tempt me she invites as mexico invited cortez the enterprise is hard the natives are unfriendlyi believe them cruel toobut the metropolis is paved with gold and the breeze blows out of paradise yes i could desire to be that conqueror but to philander with von rosen never senses i discard them what are theypruritus curiosity reach me my anatomy  to whom do you address yourself cried otto surely you of all men know that i love my wife  o love cried gotthold love is a great word it is in all the dictionaries if you had loved she would have paid you back what does she ask a little ardour  it is hard to love for two replied the prince  hard why theres the touchstone o i know my poets cried the doctor we are but dust and fire too arid to endure lifes scorching and love like the shadow of a great rock should lend shelter and refreshment not to the lover only but to his mistress and to the children that reward them and their very friends should seek repose in the fringes of that peace love is not love that cannot build a home and you call it love to grudge and quarrel and pick faults you call it love to thwart her to her face and bandy insults love  gotthold you are unjust i was then fighting for my country said the prince  ay and theres the worst of all returned the doctor you could not even see that you were wrong that being where they were retreat was ruin  why you supported me cried otto  i did i was a fool like you replied gotthold but now my eyes are open if you go on as you have started disgrace this fellow gondremark and publish the scandal of your divided house there will befall a most abominable thing in grünewald a revolution frienda revolution  you speak strangely for a red said otto  a red republican but not a revolutionary returned the doctor an ugly thing is a grünewalder drunk one man alone can save the country from this pass and that is the doubledealer gondremark with whom i conjure you to make peace it will not be you it never can be youyou who can do nothing as your wife said but trade upon your stationyou who spent the hours in begging money and in gods name what for why money what mystery of idiocy was this  it was to no ill end it was to buy a farm quoth otto sulkily  to buy a farm cried gotthold buy a farm  well what then returned otto i have bought it if you come to that  gotthold fairly bounded on his seat and how that he cried  how repeated otto startled  ay verily how returned the doctor how came you by the money  the princes countenance darkened that is my affair said he  you see you are ashamed retorted gotthold and so you bought a farm in the hour of your countrys needdoubtless to be ready for the abdication and i put it that you stole the funds there are not three ways of getting money there are but two to earn and steal and now when you have combined charles the fifth and longfingered tom you come to me to fortify your vanity but i will clear my mind upon this matter until i know the right and wrong of the transaction i put my hand behind my back a man may be the pitifullest prince he must be a spotless gentleman  the prince had gotten to his feet as pale as paper gotthold he said you drive me beyond bounds beware sir beware  do you threaten me friend otto asked the doctor grimly that would be a strange conclusion  when have you ever known me use my power in any private animosity cried otto to any private man your words were an unpardonable insult but at me you shoot in full security and i must turn aside to compliment you on your plainness i must do more than pardon i must admire because you have faced thisthis formidable monarch like a nathan before david you have uprooted an old kindness sir with an unsparing hand you leave me very bare my last bond is broken and though i take heaven to witness that i sought to do the right i have this reward to find myself alone you say i am no gentleman yet the sneers have been upon your side and though i can very well perceive where you have lodged your sympathies i will forbear the taunt  otto are you insane cried gotthold leaping up because i ask you how you came by certain moneys and because you refuse  herr von hohenstockwitz i have ceased to invite your aid in my affairs said otto i have heard all that i desire and you have sufficiently trampled on my vanity it may be that i cannot govern it may be that i cannot loveyou tell me so with every mark of honesty but god has granted me one virtue and i can still forgive i forgive you even in this hour of passion i can perceive my faults and your excuses and if i desire that in future i may be spared your conversation it is not sir from resentmentnot resentmentbut by heaven because no man on earth could endure to be so rated you have the satisfaction to see your sovereign weep and that person whom you have so often taunted with his happiness reduced to the last pitch of solitude and misery noi will hear nothing i claim the last word sir as your prince and that last word shall beforgiveness  and with that otto was gone from the apartment and dr gotthold was left alone with the most conflicting sentiments of sorrow remorse and merriment walking to and fro before his table and asking himself with hands uplifted which of the pair of them was most to blame for this unhappy rupture presently he took from a cupboard a bottle of rhine wine and a goblet of the deep bohemian ruby the first glass a little warmed and comforted his bosom with the second he began to look down upon these troubles from a sunny mountain yet a while and filled with this false comfort and contemplating life through a golden medium he owned to himself with a flush a smile and a halfpleasurable sigh that he had been somewhat over plain in dealing with his cousin he said the truth too added the penitent librarian for in my monkish fashion i adore the princess and then with a still deepening flush and a certain stealth although he sat all alone in that great gallery he toasted seraphina to the dregs     chapter xi  providence von rosen act the first she beguiles the baron   at a sufficiently late hour or to be more exact at three in the afternoon madame von rosen issued on the world she swept downstairs and out across the garden a black mantilla thrown over her head and the long train of her black velvet dress ruthlessly sweeping in the dirt  at the other end of that long garden and back to back with the villa of the countess stood the large mansion where the prime minister transacted his affairs and pleasures this distance which was enough for decency by the easy canons of mittwalden the countess swiftly traversed opened a little door with a key mounted a flight of stairs and entered unceremoniously into gondremarks study it was a large and very high apartment books all about the walls papers on the table papers on the floor here and there a picture somewhat scant of drapery a great fire glowing and flaming in the bluetiled hearth and the daylight streaming through a cupola above in the midst of this sat the great baron gondremark in his shirtsleeves his business for that day fairly at an end and the hour arrived for relaxation his expression his very nature seemed to have undergone a fundamental change gondremark at home appeared the very antipode of gondremark on duty he had an air of massive jollity that well became him grossness and geniality sat upon his features and along with his manners he had laid aside his sly and sinister expression he lolled there sunning his bulk before the fire a noble animal  hey he cried at last  the countess stepped into the room in silence threw herself on a chair and crossed her legs in her lace and velvet with a good display of smooth black stocking and of snowy petticoat and with the refined profile of her face and slender plumpness of her body she showed in singular contrast to the big black intellectual satyr by the fire  how often do you send for me she cried it is compromising  gondremark laughed speaking of that said he what in the devils name were you about you were not home till morning  i was giving alms she said  the baron again laughed loud and long for in his shirtsleeves he was a very mirthful creature it is fortunate i am not jealous he remarked but you know my way pleasure and liberty go hand in hand i believe what i believe it is not much but i believe itbut now to business have you not read my letter  no she said my head ached  ah well then i have news indeed cried gondremark i was mad to see you all last night and all this morning for yesterday afternoon i brought my long business to a head the ship has come home one more dead lift and i shall cease to fetch and carry for the princess ratafia yes tis done i have the order all in ratafias hand i carry it on my heart at the hour of twelve tonight prince featherhead is to be taken in his bed and like the bambino whipped into a chariot and by next morning he will command a most romantic prospect from the donjon of the felsenburg farewell featherhead the war goes on the girl is in my hand i have long been indispensable but now i shall be sole i have long he added exultingly long carried this intrigue upon my shoulders like samson with the gates of gaza now i discharge that burthen  she had sprung to her feet a little paler is this true she cried  i tell you a fact he asseverated the trick is played  i will never believe it she said an order in her own hand i will never believe it heinrich  i swear to you said he  o what do you care for oathsor i either what would you swear by wine women and song it is not binding she said she had come quite close up to him and laid her hand upon his arm as for the orderno heinrich never i will never believe it i will die ere i believe it you have some secret purposewhat i cannot guessbut not one word of it is true  shall i show it you he asked  you cannot she answered there is no such thing  incorrigible sadducee he cried well i will convert you you shall see the order he moved to a chair where he had thrown his coat and then drawing forth and holding out a paper read said he  she took it greedily and her eye flashed as she perused it  hey cried the baron there falls a dynasty and it was i that felled it and i and you inherit he seemed to swell in stature and next moment with a laugh he put his hand forward give me the dagger said he  but she whisked the paper suddenly behind her back and faced him lowering no no she said you and i have first a point to settle do you suppose me blind she could never have given that paper but to one man and that man her lover here you standher lover her accomplice her mastero i well believe it for i know your power but what am i she cried i whom you deceive  jealousy cried gondremark anna i would never have believed it but i declare to you by all thats credible that i am not her lover i might be i suppose but i never yet durst risk the declaration the chit is so unreal a mincing doll she will and she will not there is no counting on her by god and hitherto i have had my own way without and keep the lover in reserve and i say anna he added with severity you must break yourself of this new fit my girl there must be no combustion i keep the creature under the belief that i adore her and if she caught a breath of you and me she is such a fool prude and dog in the manger that she is capable of spoiling all  all very fine returned the lady with whom do you pass your days and which am i to believe your words or your actions  anna the devil take you are you blind cried gondremark you know me am i likely to care for such a preciosa tis hard that we should have been together for so long and you should still take me for a troubadour but if there is one thing that i despise and deprecate it is all such figures in berlin wool give me a human womanlike yourself you are my mate you were made for me you amuse me like the play and what have i to gain that i should pretend to you if i do not love you what use are you to me why none it is as clear as noonday  do you love me heinrich she asked languishing do you truly  i tell you he cried i love you next after myself i should be all abroad if i had lost you  well then said she folding up the paper and putting it calmly in her pocket i will believe you and i join the plot count upon me at midnight did you say it is gordon i see that you have charged with it excellent he will stick at nothing  gondremark watched her suspiciously why do you take the paper he demanded give it here  no she returned i mean to keep it it is i who must prepare the stroke you cannot manage it without me and to do my best i must possess the paper where shall i find gordon in his rooms she spoke with a rather feverish selfpossession  anna he said sternly the black bilious countenance of his palace rôle taking the place of the more open favour of his hours at home i ask you for that paper once twice and thrice  heinrich she returned looking him in the face take care i will put up with no dictation  both looked dangerous and the silence lasted for a measurable interval of time then she made haste to have the first word and with a laugh that rang clear and honest do not be a child she said i wonder at you if your assurances are true you can have no reason to mistrust me nor i to play you false the difficulty is to get the prince out of the palace without scandal his valets are devoted his chamberlain a slave and yet one cry might ruin all  they must be overpowered he said following her to the new ground and disappear along with him  and your whole scheme along with them she cried he does not take his servants when he goes ahunting a child could read the truth no no the plan is idiotic it must be ratafias but hear me you know the prince worships me  i know he said poor featherhead i cross his destiny  well now she continued what if i bring him alone out of the palace to some quiet corner of the parkthe flying mercury for instance gordon can be posted in the thicket the carriage wait behind the temple not a cry not a scuffle not a footfall simply the prince vanisheswhat do you say am i an able ally are my beaux yeux of service ah heinrich do not lose your annashe has power  he struck with his open hand upon the chimney witch he said there is not your match for devilry in europe service the thing runs on wheels  kiss me then and let me go i must not miss my featherhead she said  stay stay said the baron not so fast i wish upon my soul that i could trust you but you are out and in so whimsical a devil that i dare not hang it anna no its not possible  you doubt me heinrich she cried  doubt is not the word said he i know you once you were clear of me with that paper in your pocket who knows what you would do with itnot you at leastnor i you see he added shaking his head paternally upon the countess you are as vicious as a monkey  i swear to you she cried by my salvation  i have no curiosity to hear you swearing said the baron  you think that i have no religion you suppose me destitute of honour well she said see here i will not argue but i tell you once for all leave me this order and the prince shall be arrestedtake it from me and as certain as i speak i will upset the coach trust me or fear me take your choice and she offered him the paper  the baron in a great contention of mind stood irresolute weighing the two dangers once his hand advanced then dropped well he said since trust is what you call it  no more she interrupted do not spoil your attitude and now since you have behaved like a good sort of fellow in the dark i will condescend to tell you why i go to the palace to arrange with gordon but how is gordon to obey me and how can i foresee the hours it may be midnight ay and it may be nightfall alls a chance and to act i must be free and hold the strings of the adventure and now she cried your vivien goes dub me your knight and she held out her arms and smiled upon him radiant  well he said when he had kissed her every man must have his folly i thank god mine is no worse off with you i have given a child a squib     chapter xii  providence von rosen act the second she informs the prince   it was the first impulse of madame von rosen to return to her own villa and revise her toilette whatever else should come of this adventure it was her firm design to pay a visit to the princess and before that woman so little beloved the countess would appear at no disadvantage it was the work of minutes von rosen had the captains eye in matters of the toilette she was none of those who hang in fabian helplessness among their finery and after hours come forth upon the world as dowdies a glance a loosened curl a studied and admired disorder in the hair a bit of lace a touch of colour a yellow rose in the bosom and the instant picture was complete  that will do she said bid my carriage follow me to the palace in half an hour it should be there in waiting  the night was beginning to fall and the shops to shine with lamps along the treebeshadowed thoroughfares of ottos capital when the countess started on her high emprise she was jocund at heart pleasure and interest had winged her beauty and she knew it she paused before the glowing jewellers she remarked and praised a costume in the milliners window and when she reached the limetree walk with its high umbrageous arches and stir of passersby in the dim alleys she took her place upon a bench and began to dally with the pleasures of the hour it was cold but she did not feel it being warm within her thoughts in that dark corner shone like the gold and rubies at the jewellers her ears which heard the brushing of so many footfalls transposed it into music  what was she to do she held the paper by which all depended otto and gondremark and ratafia and the state itself hung light in her balances as light as dust her little finger laid in either scale would set all flying and she hugged herself upon her huge preponderance and then laughed aloud to think how giddily it might be used the vertigo of omnipotence the disease of cæsars shook her reason o the mad world she thought and laughed aloud in exultation  a child finger in mouth had paused a little way from where she sat and stared with cloudy interest upon this laughing lady she called it nearer but the child hung back instantly with that curious passion which you may see any woman in the world display on the most odd occasions for a similar end the countess bent herself with singleness of mind to overcome this diffidence and presently sure enough the child was seated on her knee thumbing and glowering at her watch  if you had a clay bear and a china monkey asked von rosen which would you prefer to break  but i have neither said the child  well she said here is a bright florin with which you may purchase both the one and the other and i shall give it you at once if you will answer my question the clay bear or the china monkeycome  but the unbreeched soothsayer only stared upon the florin with big eyes the oracle could not be persuaded to reply and the countess kissed him lightly gave him the florin set him down upon the path and resumed her way with swinging and elastic gait  which shall i break she wondered and she passed her hand with delight among the careful disarrangement of her locks which and she consulted heaven with her bright eyes do i love both or neither a littlepassionatelynot at all both or neitherboth i believe but at least i will make hay of ratafia  by the time she had passed the iron gates mounted the drive and set her foot upon the broadflagged terrace the night had come completely the palace front was thick with lighted windows and along the balustrade the lamp on every twentieth baluster shone clear a few withered tracks of sunset amber and glowworm green still lingered in the western sky and she paused once again to watch them fading  and to think she said that here am idestiny embodied a norn a fate a providenceand have no guess upon which side i shall declare myself what other woman in my place would not be prejudiced and think herself committed but thank heaven i was born just ottos windows were bright among the rest and she looked on them with rising tenderness how does it feel to be deserted she thought poor dear fool the girl deserves that he should see this order  without more delay she passed into the palace and asked for an audience of prince otto the prince she was told was in his own apartment and desired to be private she sent her name a man presently returned with word that the prince tendered his apologies but could see no one then i will write she said and scribbled a few lines alleging urgency of life and death help me my prince she added none but you can help me this time the messenger returned more speedily and begged the countess to follow him the prince was graciously pleased to receive the frau gräfin von rosen  otto sat by the fire in his large armoury weapons faintly glittering all about him in the changeful light his face was disfigured by the marks of weeping he looked sour and sad nor did he rise to greet his visitor but bowed and bade the man begone that kind of general tenderness which served the countess for both heart and conscience sharply smote her at this spectacle of grief and weakness she began immediately to enter into the spirit of her part and as soon as they were alone taking one step forward and with a magnificent gestureup she cried  madame von rosen replied otto dully you have used strong words you speak of life and death pray madam who is threatened who is there he added bitterly so destitute that even otto of grünewald can assist him  first learn said she the names of the conspirators the princess and the baron gondremark can you not guess the rest and then as he maintained his silenceyou she cried pointing at him with her finger tis you they threaten your rascal and mine have laid their heads together and condemned you but they reckoned without you and me we make a partie carrée prince in love and politics they lead an ace but we shall trump it come partner shall i draw my card  madam he said explain yourself indeed i fail to comprehend  see then said she and handed him the order  he took it looked upon it with a start and then still without speech he put his hand before his face she waited for a word in vain  what she cried do you take the thing downheartedly as well seek wine in a milkpail as love in that girls heart be done with this and be a man after the league of the lions let us have a conspiracy of mice and pull this piece of machinery to ground you were brisk enough last night when nothing was at stake and all was frolic well here is better sport here is life indeed  he got to his feet with some alacrity and his face which was a little flushed bore the marks of resolution  madame von rosen said he i am neither unconscious nor ungrateful this is the true continuation of your friendship but i see that i must disappoint your expectations you seem to expect from me some effort of resistance but why should i resist i have not much to gain and now that i have read this paper and the last of a fools paradise is shattered it would be hyperbolical to speak of loss in the same breath with otto of grünewald i have no party no policy no pride nor anything to be proud of for what benefit or principle under heaven do you expect me to contend or would you have me bite and scratch like a trapped weasel no madam signify to those who sent you my readiness to go i would at least avoid a scandal  you goof your own will you go she cried  i cannot say so much perhaps he answered but i go with good alacrity i have desired a change some time behold one offered me shall i refuse thank god i am not so destitute of humour as to make a tragedy of such a farce he flicked the order on the table you may signify my readiness he added grandly  ah she said you are more angry than you own  i madam angry he cried you rave i have no cause for anger in every way i have been taught my weakness my instability and my unfitness for the world i am a plexus of weaknesses an impotent prince a doubtful gentleman and you yourself indulgent as you are have twice reproved my levity and shall i be angry i may feel the unkindness but i have sufficient honesty of mind to see the reasons of this coup détat  from whom have you got this she cried in wonder you think you have not behaved well my prince were you not young and handsome i should detest you for your virtues you push them to the verge of commonplace and this ingratitude  understand me madame von rosen returned the prince flushing a little darker there can be here no talk of gratitude none of pride you are here by what circumstance i know not but doubtless led by your kindness mixed up in what regards my family alone you have no knowledge what my wife your sovereign may have suffered it is not for youno nor for meto judge i own myself in fault and were it otherwise a man were a very empty boaster who should talk of love and start before a small humiliation it is in all the copybooks that one should die to please his ladylove and shall a man not go to prison  love and what has love to do with being sent to gaol exclaimed the countess appealing to the walls and roof heaven knows i think as much of love as any one my life would prove it but i admit no love at least for a man that is not equally returned the rest is moonshine  i think of love more absolutely madam though i am certain no more tenderly than a lady to whom i am indebted for such kindnesses returned the prince but this is unavailing we are not here to hold a court of troubadours  still she replied there is one thing you forget if she conspires with gondremark against your liberty she may conspire with him against your honour also  my honour he repeated for a woman you surprise me if i have failed to gain her love or play my part of husband what right is left me or what honour can remain in such a scene of defeat no honour that i recognise i am become a stranger if my wife no longer loves me i will go to prison since she wills it if she love another where should i be more in place or whose fault is it but mine you speak madame von rosen like too many women with a mans tongue had i myself fallen into temptation as heaven knows i might i should have trembled but still hoped and asked for her forgiveness and yet mine had been a treason in the teeth of love but let me tell you madam he pursued with rising irritation where a husband by futility facility and illtimed humours has outwearied his wifes patience i will suffer neither man nor woman to misjudge her she is free the man has been found wanting  because she loves you not the countess cried you know she is incapable of such a feeling  rather it was i who was born incapable of inspiring it said otto  madame von rosen broke into sudden laughter fool she cried i am in love with you myself  ah madam you are most compassionate the prince retorted smiling but this is waste debate i know my purpose perhaps to equal you in frankness i know and embrace my advantage i am not without the spirit of adventure i am in a false positionso recognised by public acclamation do you grudge me then my issue  if your mind is made up why should i dissuade you said the countess i own with a bare face i am the gainer go you take my heart with you or more of it than i desire i shall not sleep at night for thinking of your misery but do not be afraid i would not spoil you you are such a fool and hero  alas madam cried the prince and your unlucky money i did amiss to take it but you are a wonderful persuader and i thank god i can still offer you the fair equivalent he took some papers from the chimney here madam are the titledeeds he said where i am going they can certainly be of no use to me and i have now no other hope of making up to you your kindness you made the loan without formality obeying your kind heart the parts are somewhat changed the sun of this prince of grünewald is upon the point of setting and i know you better than to doubt you will once more waive ceremony and accept the best that he can give you if i may look for any pleasure in the coming time it will be to remember that the peasant is secure and my most generous friend no loser  do you not understand my odious position cried the countess dear prince it is upon your fall that i begin my fortune  it was the more like you to tempt me to resistance returned otto but this cannot alter our relations and i must for the last time lay my commands upon you in the character of prince and with his loftiest dignity he forced the deeds on her acceptance  i hate the very touch of them she cried  there followed upon this a little silence at what time resumed otto if indeed you know am i to be arrested  your highness when you please exclaimed the countess or if you choose to tear that paper never  i would rather it were done quickly said the prince i shall take but time to leave a letter for the princess  well said the countess i have advised you to resist at the same time if you intend to be dumb before your shearers i must say that i ought to set about arranging your arrest i offeredshe hesitatedi offered to manage it intending my dear friendintending upon my soul to be of use to you well if you will not profit by my goodwill then be of use to me and as soon as ever you feel ready go to the flying mercury where we met last night it will be none the worse for you and to make it quite plain it will be better for the rest of us  dear madam certainly said otto if i am prepared for the chief evil i shall not quarrel with details go then with my best gratitude and when i have written a few lines of leavetaking i shall immediately hasten to keep tryst tonight i shall not meet so dangerous a cavalier he added with a smiling gallantry  as soon as madame von rosen was gone he made a great call upon his selfcommand he was face to face with a miserable passage where if it were possible he desired to carry himself with dignity as to the main fact he never swerved or faltered he had come so heartsick and so cruelly humiliated from his talk with gotthold that he embraced the notion of imprisonment with something bordering on relief here was at least a step which he thought blameless here was a way out of his troubles he sat down to write to seraphina and his anger blazed the tale of his forbearances mounted in his eyes to something monstrous still more monstrous the coldness egoism and cruelty that had required and thus requited them the pen which he had taken shook in his hand he was amazed to find his resignation fled but it was gone beyond his recall in a few whitehot words he bade adieu dubbing desperation by the name of love and calling his wrath forgiveness then he cast but one look of leavetaking on the place that had been his for so long and was now to be his no longer and hurried forthloves prisoneror prides  he took that private passage which he had trodden so often in less momentous hours the porter let him out and the bountiful cold air of the night and the pure glory of the stars received him on the threshold he looked round him breathing deep of earths plain fragrance he looked up into the great array of heaven and was quieted his little turgid life dwindled to its true proportions and he saw himself that great flamehearted martyr stand like a speck under the cool cupola of the night thus he felt his careless injuries already soothed the live air of outofdoors the quiet of the world as if by their silent music sobering and dwarfing his emotions  well i forgive her he said if it be of any use to her i forgive  and with brisk steps he crossed the garden issued upon the park and came to the flying mercury a dark figure moved forward from the shadow of the pedestal  i have to ask your pardon sir a voice observed but if i am right in taking you for the prince i was given to understand that you would be prepared to meet me  herr gordon i believe said otto  herr oberst gordon replied that officer this is rather a ticklish business for a man to be embarked in and to find that all is to go pleasantly is a great relief to me the carriage is at hand shall i have the honour of following your highness  colonel said the prince i have now come to that happy moment of my life when i have orders to receive but none to give  a most philosophical remark returned the colonel begad a very pertinent remark it might be plutarch i am not a drops blood to your highness or indeed to anyone in this principality or else i should dislike my orders but as it is and since there is nothing unnatural or unbecoming on my side and your highness takes it in good part i begin to believe we may have a capital time together sira capital time for a gaoler is only a fellowcaptive  may i inquire herr gordon asked otto what led you to accept this dangerous and i would fain hope thankless office  very natural i am sure replied the officer of fortune my pay is in the meanwhile doubled  well sir i will not presume to criticise returned the prince and i perceive the carriage  sure enough at the intersection of two alleys of the park a coach and four conspicuous by its lanterns stood in waiting and a little way off about a score of lancers were drawn up under the shadow of the trees     chapter xiii  providence von rosen act the third she enlightens seraphina   when madame von rosen left the prince she hurried straight to colonel gordon and not content with directing the arrangements she had herself accompanied the soldier of fortune to the flying mercury the colonel gave her his arm and the talk between this pair of conspirators ran high and lively the countess indeed was in a whirl of pleasure and excitement her tongue stumbled upon laughter her eyes shone the colour that was usually wanting now perfected her face it would have taken little more to bring gordon to her feetor so at least she believed disdaining the idea  hidden among some lilac bushes she enjoyed the great decorum of the arrest and heard the dialogue of the two men die away along the path soon after the rolling of a carriage and the beat of hoofs arose in the still air of the night and passed speedily farther and fainter into silence the prince was gone  madame von rosen consulted her watch she had still she thought time enough for the titbit of her evening and hurrying to the palace winged by the fear of gondremarks arrival she sent her name and a pressing request for a reception to the princess seraphina as the countess von rosen unqualified she was sure to be refused but as an emissary of the barons for so she chose to style herself she gained immediate entry  the princess sat alone at table making a feint of dining her cheeks were mottled her eyes heavy she had neither slept nor eaten even her dress had been neglected in short she was out of health out of looks out of heart and hagridden by her conscience the countess drew a swift comparison and shone brighter in beauty  you come madam de la part de monsieur le baron drawled the princess be seated what have you to say  to say repeated madame von rosen o much to say much to say that i would rather not and much to leave unsaid that i would rather say for i am like st paul your highness and always wish to do the things i should not well to be categoricalthat is the wordi took the prince your order he could not credit his senses ah he cried dear madame von rosen it is not possibleit cannot bei must hear it from your lips my wife is a poor girl misled she is only silly she is not cruel mon prince said i a girland therefore cruel youth kills flieshe had such pain to understand it  madame von rosen said the princess in most steadfast tones but with a rose of anger in her face who sent you here and for what purpose tell your errand  o madam i believe you understand me very well returned von rosen i have not your philosophy i wear my heart upon my sleeve excuse the indecency it is a very little one she laughed and i so often change the sleeve  am i to understand the prince has been arrested asked the princess rising  while you sat there dining cried the countess still nonchalantly seated  you have discharged your errand was the reply i will not detain you  o no madam said the countess with your permission i have not yet done i have borne much this evening in your service i have suffered i was made to suffer in your service she unfolded her fan as she spoke quick as her pulses beat the fan waved languidly she betrayed her emotion only by the brightness of her eyes and face and by the almost insolent triumph with which she looked down upon the princess there were old scores of rivalry between them in more than one field so at least von rosen felt and now she was to have her hour of victory in them all  you are no servant madame von rosen of mine said seraphina  no madam indeed returned the countess but we both serve the same person as you knowor if you do not then i have the pleasure of informing you your conduct is so lightso light she repeated the fan wavering higher like a butterfly that perhaps you do not truly understand the countess rolled her fan together laid it in her lap and rose to a less languorous position indeed she continued i should be sorry to see any young woman in your situation you began with every advantagebirth a suitable marriagequite pretty tooand see what you have come to my poor girl to think of it but there is nothing that does so much harm observed the countess finely as giddiness of mind and she once more unfurled the fan and approvingly fanned herself  i will no longer permit you to forget yourself cried seraphina i think you are mad  not mad returned von rosen sane enough to know you dare not break with me tonight and to profit by the knowledge i left my poor pretty prince charming crying his eyes out for a wooden doll my heart is soft i love my pretty prince you will never understand it but i long to give my prince his doll dry his poor eyes and send him off happy o you immature fool the countess cried rising to her feet and pointing at the princess the closed fan that now began to tremble in her hand o wooden doll she cried have you a heart or blood or any nature this is a man childa man who loves you o it will not happen twice it is not common beautiful and clever women look in vain for it and you you pitiful schoolgirl tread this jewel under foot you stupid with your vanity before you try to govern kingdoms you should first be able to behave yourself at home home is the womans kingdom she paused and laughed a little strangely to hear and look upon i will tell you one of the things she said that were to stay unspoken von rosen is a better woman than you my princess though you will never have the pain of understanding it and when i took the prince your order and looked upon his face my soul was meltedo i am frankhere within my arms i offered him repose she advanced a step superbly as she spoke with outstretched arms and seraphina shrank do not be alarmed the countess cried i am not offering that hermitage to you in all the world there is but one who wants to and him you have dismissed if it will give her pleasure i should wear the martyrs crown he cried i will embrace the thorns i tell youi am quite franki put the order in his power and begged him to resist you who have betrayed your husband may betray me to gondremark my prince would betray no one understand it plainly she cried tis of his pure forbearance you sit there he had the poweri gave it himto change the parts and he refused and went to prison in your place  the princess spoke with some distress your violence shocks me and pains me she began but i cannot be angry with what at least does honour to the mistaken kindness of your heart it was right for me to know this i will condescend to tell you it was with deep regret that i was driven to this step i admire in many ways the princei admit his amiability it was our great misfortune it was perhaps somewhat of my fault that we were so unsuited to each other but i have a regard a sincere regard for all his qualities as a private person i should think as you do it is difficult i know to make allowances for state considerations i have only with deep reluctance obeyed the call of a superior duty and so soon as i dare do it for the safety of the state i promise you the prince shall be released many in my situation would have resented your freedoms i am notand she looked for a moment rather piteously upon the countessi am not altogether so inhuman as you think  and you can put these troubles of the state the countess cried to weigh with a mans love  madame von rosen these troubles are affairs of life and death to many to the prince and perhaps even to yourself among the number replied the princess with dignity i have learned madam although still so young in a hard school that my own feelings must everywhere come last  o callow innocence exclaimed the other is it possible you do not know or do not suspect the intrigue in which you move i find it in my heart to pity you we are both women after allpoor girl poor girland who is born a woman is born a fool and though i hate all womencome for the common folly i forgive you your highnessshe dropped a deep stage curtsey and resumed her fani am going to insult you to betray one who is called my lover and if it pleases you to use the power i now put unreservedly into your hands to ruin my dear self o what a french comedy you betray i betray they betray it is now my cue the letter yes behold the letter madam its seal unbroken as i found it by my bed this morning for i was out of humour and i get many too many of these favours for your own sake for the sake of my prince charming for the sake of this great principality that sits so heavy on your conscience open it and read  am i to understand inquired the princess that this letter in any way regards me  you see i have not opened it replied von rosen but tis mine and i beg you to experiment  i cannot look at it till you have returned seraphina very seriously there may be matter there not meant for me to see it is a private letter  the countess tore it open glanced it through and tossed it back and the princess taking up the sheet recognised the hand of gondremark and read with a sickening shock the following lines     dearest anna come at once ratafia has done the deed her husband    is to be packed to prison this puts the minx entirely in my power    le tour est joué she will now go steady in harness or i will know    the reason why come       heinrich  command yourself madam said the countess watching with some alarm the white face of seraphina it is in vain for you to fight with gondremark he has more strings than mere court favour and could bring you down tomorrow with a word i would not have betrayed him otherwise but heinrich is a man and plays with all of you like marionettes and now at least you see for what you sacrificed my prince madam will you take some wine i have been cruel  not cruel madamsalutary said seraphina with a phantom smile no i thank you i require no attentions the first surprise affected me will you give me time a little i must think  she took her head between her hands and contemplated for a while the hurricane confusion of her thoughts  this information reaches me she said when i have need of it i would not do as you have done but yet i thank you i have been much deceived in baron gondremark  o madam leave gondremark and think upon the prince cried von rosen  you speak once more as a private person said the princess nor do i blame you but my own thoughts are more distracted however as i believe you are truly a friend to myto theas i believe she said you are a friend to otto i shall put the order for his release into your hands this moment give me the inkdish there and she wrote hastily steadying her arm upon the table for she trembled like a reed remember madam she resumed handing her the order this must not be used nor spoken of at present till i have seen the baron any hurried stepi lose myself in thinking the suddenness has shaken me  i promise you i will not use it said the countess till you give me leave although i wish the prince could be informed of it to comfort his poor heart and o i had forgotten he has left a letter suffer me madam i will bring it you this is the door i think and she sought to open it  the bolt is pushed said seraphina flushing  o o cried the countess  a silence fell between them  i will get it for myself said seraphina and in the meanwhile i beg you to leave me i thank you i am sure but i shall be obliged if you will leave me  the countess deeply curtseyed and withdrew     chapter xiv  relates the cause and outbreak of the revolution   brave as she was and brave by intellect the princess when first she was alone clung to the table for support the four corners of her universe had fallen she had never liked nor trusted gondremark completely she had still held it possible to find him false to friendship but from that to finding him devoid of all those public virtues for which she had honoured him a mere commonplace intriguer using her for his own ends the step was wide and the descent giddy light and darkness succeeded each other in her brain now she believed and now she could not she turned blindly groping for the note but von rosen who had not forgotten to take the warrant from the prince had remembered to recover her note from the princess von rosen was an old campaigner whose most violent emotion aroused rather than clouded the vigour of her reason  the thought recalled to seraphina the remembrance of the other letterottos she rose and went speedily her brain still wheeling and burst into the princes armoury the old chamberlain was there in waiting and the sight of another face prying or so she felt on her distress struck seraphina into childish anger  go she cried and then when the old man was already halfway to the door stay she added as soon as baron gondremark arrives let him attend me here  it shall be so directed said the chamberlain  there was a letter  she began and paused  her highness said the chamberlain will find a letter on the table i had received no orders or her highness had been spared this trouble  no no no she cried i thank you i desire to be alone  and then when he was gone she leaped upon the letter her mind was still obscured like the moon upon a night of clouds and wind her reason shone and was darkened and she read the words by flashes     seraphina the prince wrote i will write no syllable of reproach    i have seen your order and i go what else is left me i have wasted    my love and have no more to say that i forgive you is not needful    at least we are now separate for ever by your own act you free me    from my willing bondage i go free to prison this is the last that    you will hear of me in love or anger i have gone out of your life    you may breathe easy you have now rid yourself of the husband who    allowed you to desert him of the prince who gave you his rights and    of the married lover who made it his pride to defend you in your    absence how you have requited him your own heart more loudly tells    you than my words there is a day coming when your vain dreams will    roll away like clouds and you will find yourself alone then you    will remember       otto  she read with a great horror on her mind that day of which he wrote was come she was alone she had been false she had been cruel remorse rolled in upon her and then with a more piercing note vanity bounded on the stage of consciousness she a dupe she helpless she to have betrayed herself in seeking to betray her husband she to have lived these years upon flattery grossly swallowing the bolus like a clown with sharpers sheseraphina her swift mind drank the consequences she foresaw the coming fall her public shame she saw the odium disgrace and folly of her story flaunt through europe she recalled the scandal she had so royally braved and alas she had now no courage to confront it with to be thought the mistress of that man perhaps for that she closed her eyes on agonising vistas swift as thought she had snatched a bright dagger from the weapons that shone along the wall ay she would escape from that worldwide theatre of nodding heads and buzzing whisperers in which she now beheld herself unpitiably martyred one door stood open at any cost through any stress of suffering that greasy laughter should be stifled she closed her eyes breathed a wordless prayer and pressed the weapon to her bosom  at the astonishing sharpness of the prick she gave a cry and awoke to a sense of undeserved escape a little ruby spot of blood was the reward of that great act of desperation but the pain had braced her like a tonic and her whole design of suicide had passed away  at the same instant regular feet drew near along the gallery and she knew the tread of the big baron so often gladly welcome and even now rallying her spirits like a call to battle she concealed the dagger in the folds of her skirt and drawing her stature up she stood firmfooted radiant with anger waiting for the foe  the baron was announced and entered to him seraphina was a hated task like the schoolboy with his virgil he had neither will nor leisure to remark her beauties but when he now beheld her standing illuminated by her passion new feelings flashed upon him a frank admiration a brief sparkle of desire he noted both with joy they were means if i have to play the lover thought he for that was his constant preoccupation i believe i can put soul into it meanwhile with his usual ponderous grace he bent before the lady  i propose she said in a strange voice not known to her till then that we release the prince and do not prosecute the war  ah madam he replied tis as i knew it would be your heart i knew would wound you when we came to this distasteful but most necessary step ah madam believe me i am not unworthy to be your ally i know you have qualities to which i am a stranger and count them the best weapons in the armoury of our alliancethe girl in the queenpity love tenderness laughter the smile that can reward i can only command i am the frowner but you and you have the fortitude to command these comely weaknesses to tread them down at the call of reason how often have i not admired it even to yourself ay even to yourself he added tenderly dwelling it seemed in memory on hours of more private admiration but now madam  but now herr von gondremark the time for these declarations has gone by she cried are you true to me are you false look in your heart and answer it is your heart i want to know  it has come thought gondremark you madam he cried starting backwith fear you would have said and yet a timid joy you yourself you bid me look into my heart  do you suppose i fear she cried and looked at him with such a heightened colour such bright eyes and a smile of so abstruse a meaning that the baron discarded his last doubt  ah madam he cried plumping on his knees seraphina do you permit me have you divined my secret it is truei put my life with joy into your poweri love you love with ardour as an equal as a mistress as a brotherinarms as an adored desired sweethearted woman o bride he cried waxing dithyrambic bride of my reason and my senses have pity have pity on my love  she heard him with wonder rage and then contempt his words offended her to sickness his appearance as he grovelled bulkily upon the floor moved her to such laughter as we laugh in nightmares  o shame she cried absurd and odious what would the countess say  that great baron gondremark the excellent politician remained for some little time upon his knees in a frame of mind which perhaps we are allowed to pity his vanity within his iron bosom bled and raved if he could have blotted all if he could have withdrawn part if he had not called her bridewith a roaring in his ears he thus regretfully reviewed his declaration he got to his feet tottering and then in that first moment when a dumb agony finds a vent in words and the tongue betrays the inmost and worst of a man he permitted himself a retort which for six weeks to follow he was to repent at leisure  ah said he the countess now i perceive the reason of your highnesss disorder  the lackeylike insolence of the words was driven home by a more insolent manner there fell upon seraphina one of those stormclouds which had already blackened upon her reason she heard herself cry out and when the cloud dispersed flung the bloodstained dagger on the floor and saw gondremark reeling back with open mouth and clapping his hand upon the wound the next moment with oaths that she had never heard he leaped at her in savage passion clutched her as she recoiled and in the very act stumbled and drooped she had scarce time to fear his murderous onslaught ere he fell before her feet  he rose upon one elbow she still staring upon him white with horror  anna he cried anna help  and then his utterance failed him and he fell back to all appearance dead  seraphina ran to and fro in the room she wrung her hands and cried aloud within she was all one uproar of terror and conscious of no articulate wish but to awake  there came a knocking at the door and she sprang to it and held it panting like a beast and with the strength of madness in her arms till she had pushed the bolt at this success a certain calm fell upon her reason she went back and looked upon her victim the knocking growing louder o yes he was dead she had killed him he had called upon von rosen with his latest breath ah who would call on seraphina she had killed him she whose irresolute hand could scarce prick blood from her own bosom had found strength to cast down that great colossus at a blow  all this while the knocking was growing more uproarious and more unlike the staid career of life in such a palace scandal was at the door with what a fatal following she dreaded to conceive and at the same time among the voices that now began to summon her by name she recognised the chancellors he or another somebody must be the first  is herr von greisengesang without she called  your highnessyes the old gentleman answered we have heard cries a fall is anything amiss  nothing replied seraphina i desire to speak with you send off the rest she panted between each phrase but her mind was clear she let the looped curtain down upon both sides before she drew the bolt and thus secure from any sudden eyeshot from without admitted the obsequious chancellor and again made fast the door  greisengesang clumsily revolved among the wings of the curtain so that she was clear of it as soon as he  my god he cried the baron  i have killed him she said o killed him  dear me said the old gentleman this is most unprecedented lovers quarrels he added ruefully redintegratio and then paused but my dear madam he broke out again in the name of all that is practical what are we to do this is exceedingly grave morally madam it is appalling i take the liberty your highness for one moment of addressing you as a daughter a loved although respected daughter and i must say that i cannot conceal from you that this is morally most questionable and o dear me we have a dead body  she had watched him closely hope fell to contempt she drew away her skirts from his weakness and in the act her own strength returned to her  see if he be dead she said not one word of explanation or defence she had scorned to justify herself before so poor a creature see if he be dead was all  with the greatest compunction the chancellor drew near and as he did so the wounded baron rolled his eyes  he lives cried the old courtier turning effusively to seraphina madam he still lives  help him then returned the princess standing fixed bind up his wound  madam i have no means protested the chancellor  can you not take your handkerchief your neckcloth anything she cried and at the same moment from her light muslin gown she rent off a flounce and tossed it on the floor take that she said and for the first time directly faced greisengesang  but the chancellor held up his hands and turned away his head in agony the grasp of the falling baron had torn down the dainty fabric of the bodice ando highness cried greisengesang appalled the terrible disorder of your toilette  take up that flounce she said the man may die  greisengesang turned in a flutter to the baron and attempted some innocent and bungling measures he still breathes he kept saying all is not yet over he is not yet gone  and now said she if that is all you can do begone and get some porters he must instantly go home  madam cried the chancellor if this most melancholy sight was seen in towno dear the state would fall he piped  there is a litter in the palace she replied it is your part to see him safe i lay commands upon you on your life it stands  i see it dear highness he jerked clearly i see it but how what men the princes servantsyes they had a personal affection they will be true if any  o not them she cried take sabra my own man  sabra the grandmason returned the chancellor aghast if he but saw this he would sound the tocsinwe should all be butchered  she measured the depth of her abasement steadily take whom you must she said and bring the litter here  once she was alone she ran to the baron and with a sickening heart sought to allay the flux of blood the touch of the skin of that great charlatan revolted her to the toes the wound in her ignorant eyes looked deathly yet she contended with her shuddering and with more skill at least than the chancellors staunched the welling injury an eye unprejudiced with hate would have admired the baron in his swoon he looked so great and shapely it was so powerful a machine that lay arrested and his features cleared for the moment both of temper and dissimulation were seen to be so purely modelled but it was not thus with seraphina her victim as he lay outspread twitching a little his big chest unbared fixed her with his ugliness and her mind flitted for a glimpse to otto  rumours began to sound about the palace of feet running and of voices raised the echoes of the great arched staircase were voluble of some confusion and then the gallery jarred with a quick and heavy tramp it was the chancellor followed by four of ottos valets and a litter the servants when they were admitted stared at the dishevelled princess and the wounded man speech was denied them but their thoughts were riddled with profanity gondremark was bundled in the curtains of the litter were lowered the bearers carried it forth and the chancellor followed behind with a white face  seraphina ran to the window pressing her face upon the pane she could see the terrace where the lights contended thence the avenue of lamps that joined the palace and town and overhead the hollow night and the larger stars presently the small procession issued from the palace crossed the parade and began to thread the glittering alley the swinging couch with its four porters the muchpondering chancellor behind she watched them dwindle with strange thoughts her eyes fixed upon the scene her mind still glancing right and left on the overthrow of her life and hopes there was no one left in whom she might confide none whose hand was friendly or on whom she dared to reckon for the barest loyalty with the fall of gondremark her party her brief popularity had fallen so she sat crouched upon the windowseat her brow to the cool pane her dress in tatters barely shielding her her mind revolving bitter thoughts  meanwhile consequences were fast mounting and in the deceptive quiet of the night downfall and red revolt were brewing the litter had passed forth between the iron gates and entered on the streets of the town by what flying panic by what thrill of air communicated who shall say but the passing bustle in the palace had already reached and reechoed in the region of the burghers rumour with her loud whisper hissed about the town men left their homes without knowing why knots formed along the boulevard under the rare lamps and the great limes the crowd grew blacker  and now through the midst of that expectant company the unusual sight of a closed litter was observed approaching and trotting hard behind it that great dignitary cancellarius greisengesang silence looked on as it went by and as soon as it was passed the whispering seethed over like a boiling pot the knots were sundered and gradually one following another the whole mob began to form into a procession and escort the curtained litter soon spokesmen a little bolder than their mates began to ply the chancellor with questions never had he more need of that great art of falsehood by whose exercise he had so richly lived and yet now he stumbled the master passion fear betraying him he was pressed he became incoherent and then from the jolting litter came a groan in the instant hubbub and the gathering of the crowd as to a natural signal the cleareyed quavering chancellor heard the catch of the clock before it strikes the hour of doom and for ten seconds he forgot himself this shall atone for many sins he plucked a bearer by the sleeve bid the princess flee all is lost he whispered and the next moment he was babbling for his life among the multitude  five minutes later the wildeyed servant burst into the armoury all is lost he cried the chancellor bids you flee and at the same time looking through the window seraphina saw the black rush of the populace begin to invade the lamplit avenue  thank you georg she said i thank you go and as the man still lingered i bid you go she added save yourself  down by the private passage and just some two hours later amalia seraphina the last princess followed otto johann friedrich the last prince of grünewald     book iii  fortunate misfortune     chapter i  princess cinderella   the porter drawn by the growing turmoil had vanished from the postern and the door stood open on the darkness of the night as seraphina fled up the terraces the cries and loud footing of the mob drew nearer the doomed palace the rush was like the rush of cavalry the sound of shattering lamps tingled above the rest and overtowering all she heard her own name bandied among the shouters a bugle sounded at the door of the guardroom one gun was fired and then with the yell of hundreds mittwalden palace was carried at a rush  sped by these dire sounds and voices the princess scaled the long garden skimming like a bird the starlit stairways crossed the park which was in that place narrow and plunged upon the farther side into the rude shelter of the forest so at a bound she left the discretion and the cheerful lamps of palace evenings ceased utterly to be a sovereign lady and falling from the whole height of civilisation ran forth into the woods a ragged cinderella  she went direct before her through an open tract of the forest full of brush and birches and where the starlight guided her and beyond that again must thread the columned blackness of a pine grove joining overhead the thatch of its long branches at that hour the place was breathless a horror of night like a presence occupied that dungeon of the wood and she went groping knocking against the bolesher ear betweenwhiles strained to aching and yet unrewarded  but the slope of the ground was upward and encouraged her and presently she issued on a rocky hill that stood forth above the sea of forest all around were other hilltops big and little sable vales of forest between overhead the open heaven and the brilliancy of countless stars and along the western sky the dim forms of mountains the glory of the great night laid hold upon her her eyes shone with stars she dipped her sight into the coolness and brightness of the sky as she might have dipped her wrist into a spring and her heart at that ethereal shock began to move more soberly the sun that sails overhead ploughing into gold the fields of daylight azure and uttering the signal to mans myriads has no word apart for man the individual and the moon like a violin only praises and laments our private destiny the stars alone cheerful whisperers confer quietly with each of us like friends they give ear to our sorrows smilingly like wise old men rich in tolerance and by their double scale so small to the eye so vast to the imagination they keep before the mind the double character of mans nature and fate  there sat the princess beautifully looking upon beauty in council with these glad advisers bright like pictures clear like a voice in the porches of her ear memory reenacted the tumult of the evening the countess and the dancing fan the big baron on his knees the blood on the polished floor the knocking the swing of the litter down the avenue of lamps the messenger the cries of the charging mob and yet all were far away and phantasmal and she was still healingly conscious of the peace and glory of the night she looked towards mittwalden and above the hilltop which already hid it from her view a throbbing redness hinted of fire better so better so that she should fall with tragic greatness lit by a blazing palace she felt not a trace of pity for gondremark or of concern for grünewald that period of her life was closed for ever a wrench of wounded vanity alone surviving she had but one clear idea to fleeand another obscure and halfrejected although still obeyed to flee in the direction of the felsenburg she had a duty to perform she must free ottoso her mind said very coldly but her heart embraced the notion of that duty even with ardour and her hands began to yearn for the grasp of kindness  she rose with a start of recollection and plunged down the slope into the covert the woods received and closed upon her once more she wandered and hasted in a blot uncheered unpiloted here and there indeed through rents in the woodroof a glimmer attracted her here and there a tree stood out among its neighbours by some force of outline here and there a brushing among the leaves a notable blackness a dim shine relieved only to exaggerate the solid oppression of the night and silence and betweenwhiles the unfeatured darkness would redouble and the whole ear of night appear to be gloating on her steps now she would stand still and the silence would grow and grow till it weighed upon her breathing and then she would address herself again to run stumbling falling and still hurrying the more and presently the whole wood rocked and began to run along with her the noise of her own mad passage through the silence spread and echoed and filled the night with terror panic hunted her panic from the trees reached forth with clutching branches the darkness was lit up and peopled with strange forms and faces she strangled and fled before her fears and yet in the last fortress reason blown upon by these gusts of terror still shone with a troubled light she knew yet could not act upon her knowledge she knew that she must stop and yet she still ran  she was already near madness when she broke suddenly into a narrow clearing at the same time the din grew louder and she became conscious of vague forms and fields of whiteness and with that the earth gave way she fell and found her feet again with an incredible shock to her senses and her mind was swallowed up  when she came again to herself she was standing to the midleg in an icy eddy of a brook and leaning with one hand on the rock from which it poured the spray had wet her hair she saw the white cascade the stars wavering in the shaken pool foam flitting and high overhead the tall pines on either hand serenely drinking starshine and in the sudden quiet of her spirit she heard with joy the firm plunge of the cataract in the pool she scrambled forth dripping in the face of her proved weakness to adventure again upon the horror of blackness in the groves were a suicide of life or reason but here in the alley of the brook with the kind stars above her and the moon presently swimming into sight she could await the coming of day without alarm  this lane of pinetrees ran very rapidly down hill and wound among the woods but it was a wider thoroughfare than the brook needed and here and there were little dimpling lawns and coves of the forest where the starshine slumbered such a lawn she paced taking patience bravely and now she looked up the hill and saw the brook coming down to her in a series of cascades and now approached the margin where it welled among the rushes silently and now gazed at the great company of heaven with an enduring wonder the early evening had fallen chill but the night was now temperate out of the recesses of the wood there came mild airs as from a deep and peaceful breathing and the dew was heavy on the grass and the tightshut daisies this was the girls first night under the naked heaven and now that her fears were overpast she was touched to the soul by its serene amenity and peace kindly the host of heaven blinked down upon that wandering princess and the honest brook had no words but to encourage her  at last she began to be aware of a wonderful revolution compared to which the fire of mittwalden palace was but the crack and flash of a percussioncap the countenance with which the pines regarded her began insensibly to change the grass too short as it was and the whole winding staircase of the brooks course began to wear a solemn freshness of appearance and this slow transfiguration reached her heart and played upon it and transpierced it with a serious thrill she looked all about the whole face of nature looked back brimful of meaning finger on lip leaking its glad secret she looked up heaven was almost emptied of stars such as still lingered shone with a changed and waning brightness and began to faint in their stations and the colour of the sky itself was the most wonderful for the rich blue of the night had now melted and softened and brightened and there had succeeded in its place a hue that has no name and that is never seen but as the herald of morning o she cried joy catching at her voice o it is the dawn  in a breath she passed over the brook and looped up her skirts and fairly ran in the dim alleys as she ran her ears were aware of many pipings more beautiful than music in the small dishshaped houses in the fork of giant arms where they had lain all night lover by lover warmly pressed the brighteyed bighearted singers began to awaken for the day her heart melted and flowed forth to them in kindness and they from their small and high perches in the clerestories of the wood cathedral peered down sidelong at the ragged princess as she flitted below them on the carpet of the moss and tassel  soon she had struggled to a certain hilltop and saw far before her the silent inflooding of the day out of the east it welled and whitened the darkness trembled into light and the stars were extinguished like the streetlamps of a human city the whiteness brightened into silver the silver warmed into gold the gold kindled into pure and living fire and the face of the east was barred with elemental scarlet the day drew its first long breath steady and chill and for leagues around the woods sighed and shivered and then at one bound the sun had floated up and her startled eyes received days first arrow and quailed under the buffet on every side the shadows leaped from their ambush and fell prone the day was come plain and garish and up the steep and solitary eastern heaven the sun victorious over his competitors continued slowly and royally to mount  seraphina drooped for a little leaning on a pine the shrill joy of the woodlands mocking her the shelter of the night the thrilling and joyous changes of the dawn were over and now in the hot eye of the day she turned uneasily and looked sighingly about her some way off among the lower woods a pillar of smoke was mounting and melting in the gold and blue there surely enough were human folk the hearthsurrounders mans fingers had laid the twigs it was mans breath that had quickened and encouraged the baby flames and now as the fire caught it would be playing ruddily on the face of its creator at the thought she felt acold and little and lost in that great outofdoors the electric shock of the young sunbeams and the unhuman beauty of the woods began to irk and daunt her the covert of the house the decent privacy of rooms the swept and regulated fire all that denotes or beautifies the home life of man began to draw her as with cords the pillar of smoke was now risen into some stream of moving air it began to lean out sideways in a pennon and thereupon as though the change had been a summons seraphina plunged once more into the labyrinth of the wood  she left day upon the high ground in the lower groves there still lingered the blue early twilight and the seizing freshness of the dew but here and there above this field of shadow the head of a great outspread pine was already glorious with day and here and there through the breaches of the hills the sunbeams made a great and luminous entry here seraphina hastened along forest paths she had lost sight of the pilot smoke which blew another way and conducted herself in that great wilderness by the direction of the sun but presently fresh signs bespoke the neighbourhood of man felled trunks white slivers from the axe bundles of green boughs and stacks of firewood these guided her forward until she came forth at last upon the clearing whence the smoke arose a hut stood in the clear shadow hard by a brook which made a series of inconsiderable falls and on the threshold the princess saw a sunburnt and hardfeatured woodman standing with his hands behind his back and gazing skyward  she went to him directly a beautiful brighteyed and haggard vision splendidly arrayed and pitifully tattered the diamond eardrops still glittering in her ears and with the movement of her coming one small breast showing and hiding among the ragged covert of the laces at that ambiguous hour and coming as she did from the great silence of the forest the man drew back from the princess as from something elfin  i am cold she said and weary let me rest beside your fire  the woodman was visibly commoved but answered nothing  i will pay she said and then repented of the words catching perhaps a spark of terror from his frightened eyes but as usual her courage rekindled brighter for the check she put him from the door and entered and he followed her in superstitious wonder  within the hut was rough and dark but on the stone that served as hearth twigs and a few dry branches burned with the brisk sounds and all the variable beauty of fire the very sight of it composed her she crouched hard by on the earth floor and shivered in the glow and looked upon the eating blaze with admiration the woodman was still staring at his guest at the wreck of the rich dress the bare arms the bedraggled laces and the gems he found no word to utter  give me food said shehere by the fire  he set down a pitcher of coarse wine bread a piece of cheese and a handful of raw onions the bread was hard and sour the cheese like leather even the onion which ranks with the truffle and the nectarine in the chief place of honour of earths fruits is not perhaps a dish for princesses when raw but she ate if not with appetite with courage and when she had eaten did not disdain the pitcher in all her life before she had not tasted of gross food nor drunk after another but a brave woman far more readily accepts a change of circumstances than the bravest man all that while the woodman continued to observe her furtively many low thoughts of fear and greed contending in his eyes she read them clearly and she knew she must be gone  presently she arose and offered him a florin  will that repay you she asked  but here the man found his tongue i must have more than that said he  it is all i have to give you she returned and passed him by serenely  yet her heart trembled for she saw his hand stretched forth as if to arrest her and his unsteady eyes wandering to his axe a beaten path led westward from the clearing and she swiftly followed it she did not glance behind her but as soon as the least turning of the path had concealed her from the woodmans eyes she slipped among the trees and ran till she deemed herself in safety  by this time the strong sunshine pierced in a thousand places the pinethatch of the forest fired the red boles irradiated the cool aisles of shadow and burned in jewels on the grass the gum of these trees was dearer to the senses than the gums of araby each pine in the lusty morning sunlight burned its own woodincense and now and then a breeze would rise and toss these rooted censers and send shade and sungem flitting swift as swallows thick as bees and wake a brushing bustle of sounds that murmured and went by  on she passed and up and down in sun and shadow now aloft on the bare ridge among the rocks and birches with the lizards and the snakes and anon in the deep grove among sunless pillars now she followed wandering woodpaths in the maze of valleys and again from a hilltop beheld the distant mountains and the great birds circling under the sky she would see afar off a nestling hamlet and go round to avoid it below she traced the course of the foam of mountain torrents nearer hand she saw where the tender springs welled up in silence or oozed in green moss or in the more favoured hollows a whole family of infant rivers would combine and tinkle in the stones and lie in pools to be a bathingplace for sparrows or fall from the sheer rock in rods of crystal upon all these things as she still sped along in the bright air she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful fainting of the heart they seemed so novel they touched so strangely home they were so hued and scented they were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue air of heaven  at length when she was well weary she came upon a wide and shallow pool stones stood in it like islands bulrushes fringed the coast the floor was paved with the pine needles and the pines themselves whose roots made promontories looked down silently on their green images she crept to the margin and beheld herself with wonder a hollowand brighteyed phantom in the ruins of her palace robe the breeze now shook her image now it would be marred with flies and at that she smiled and from the fading circles her counterpart smiled back to her and looked kind she sat long in the warm sun and pitied her bare arms that were all bruised and marred with falling and marvelled to see that she was dirty and could not grow to believe that she had gone so long in such a strange disorder  then with a sigh she addressed herself to make a toilet by that forest mirror washed herself pure from all the stains of her adventure took off her jewels and wrapped them in her handkerchief rearranged the tatters of her dress and took down the folds of her hair she shook it round her face and the pool repeated her thus veiled her hair had smelt like violets she remembered otto saying and so now she tried to smell it and then shook her head and laughed a little sadly to herself  the laugh was returned upon her in a childish echo she looked up and lo two children looking ona small girl and a yet smaller boy standing like playthings by the pool below a spreading pine seraphina was not fond of children and now she was startled to the heart  who are you she cried hoarsely  the mites huddled together and drew back and seraphinas heart reproached her that she should have frightened things so quaint and little and yet alive with senses she thought upon the birds and looked again at her two visitors so little larger and so far more innocent on their clear faces as in a pool she saw the reflection of their fears with gracious purpose she arose  come she said do not be afraid of me and took a step towards them  but alas at the first moment the two poor babes in the wood turned and ran helterskelter from the princess  the most desolate pang was struck into the girls heart here she was twentytwosoon twentythreeand not a creature loved her none but otto and would even he forgive if she began weeping in these woods alone it would mean death or madness hastily she trod the thoughts out like a burning paper hastily rolled up her locks and with terror dogging her and her whole bosom sick with grief resumed her journey  past ten in the forenoon she struck a highroad marching in that place uphill between two stately groves a river of sunlight and here dead weary careless of consequences and taking some courage from the human and civilised neighbourhood of the road she stretched herself on the green margin in the shadow of a tree sleep closed on her at first with a horror of fainting but when she ceased to struggle kindly embracing her so she was taken home for a little from all her toils and sorrows to her fathers arms and there in the meanwhile her body lay exposed by the highwayside in tattered finery and on either hand from the woods the birds came flying by and calling upon others and debated in their own tongue this strange appearance  the sun pursued his journey the shadow flitted from her feet shrank higher and higher and was upon the point of leaving her altogether when the rumble of a coach was signalled to and fro by the birds the road in that part was very steep the rumble drew near with great deliberation and ten minutes passed before a gentleman appeared walking with a sober elderly gait upon the grassy margin of the highway and looking pleasantly around him as he walked from time to time he paused took out his notebook and made an entry with a pencil and any spy who had been near enough would have heard him mumbling words as though he were a poet testing verses the voice of the wheels was still faint and it was plain the traveller had far outstripped his carriage  he had drawn very near to where the princess lay asleep before his eye alighted on her but when it did he started pocketed his notebook and approached there was a milestone close to where she lay and he sat down on that and coolly studied her she lay upon one side all curled and sunken her brow on one bare arm the other stretched out limp and dimpled her young body like a thing thrown down had scarce a mark of life her breathing stirred her not the deadliest fatigue was thus confessed in every language of the sleeping flesh the traveller smiled grimly as though he had looked upon a statue he made a grudging inventory of her charms the figure in that touching freedom of forgetfulness surprised him the flush of slumber became her like a flower  upon my word he thought i did not think the girl could be so pretty and to think he added that i am under obligation not to use one word of this  he put forth his stick and touched her and at that she awoke sat up with a cry and looked upon him wildly  i trust your highness has slept well he said nodding  but she only uttered sounds  compose yourself said he giving her certainly a brave example in his own demeanour my chaise is close at hand and i shall have i trust the singular entertainment of abducting a sovereign princess  sir john she said at last  at your highnesss disposal he replied  she sprang to her feet o she cried have you come from mittwalden  this morning he returned i left it and if there is anyone less likely to return to it than yourself behold him  the baron she began and paused  madam he answered it was well meant and you are quite a judith but after the hours that have elapsed you will probably be relieved to hear that he is fairly well i took his news this morning ere i left doing fairly well they said but suffering acutely heyacutely they could hear his groans in the next room  and the prince she asked is anything known of him  it is reported replied sir john with the same pleasurable deliberation that upon that point your highness is the best authority  sir john she said eagerly you were generous enough to speak about your carriage will you i beseech you will you take me to the felsenburg i have business there of an extreme importance  i can refuse you nothing replied the old gentleman gravely and seriously enough whatever madam it is in my power to do for you that shall be done with pleasure as soon as my chaise shall overtake us it is yours to carry you where you will but added he reverting to his former manner i observe you ask me nothing of the palace  i do not care she said i thought i saw it burning  prodigious said the baronet you thought and can the loss of forty toilettes leave you cold well madam i admire your fortitude and the state too as i left the government was sittingthe new government of which at least two members must be known to you by name sabra who had i believe the benefit of being formed in your employmenta footmanam i rightand our old friend the chancellor in something of a subaltern position but in these convulsions the last shall be first and the first last  sir john she said with an air of perfect honesty i am sure you mean most kindly but these matters have no interest for me  the baronet was so utterly discountenanced that he hailed the appearance of his chaise with welcome and by way of saying something proposed that they should walk back to meet it so it was done and he helped her in with courtesy mounted to her side and from various receptacles for the chaise was most completely fitted out produced fruits and truffled liver beautiful white bread and a bottle of delicate wine with these he served her like a father coaxing and praising her to fresh exertions and during all that time as though silenced by the laws of hospitality he was not guilty of the shadow of a sneer indeed his kindness seemed so genuine that seraphina was moved to gratitude  sir john she said you hate me in your heart why are you so kind to me  ah my good lady said he with no disclaimer of the accusation i have the honour to be much your husbands friend and somewhat his admirer  you she cried they told me you wrote cruelly of both of us  such was the strange path by which we grew acquainted said sir john i had written madam with particular cruelty since that shall be the phrase of your fair self your husband set me at liberty gave me a passport ordered a carriage and then with the most boyish spirit challenged me to fight knowing the nature of his married life i thought the dash and loyalty he showed delightful do not be afraid says he if i am killed there is nobody to miss me it appears you subsequently thought of that yourself but i digress i explained to him it was impossible that i could fight not if i strike you says he very droll i wish i could have put it in my book however i was conquered took the young gentleman to my high favour and tore up my bits of scandal on the spot that is one of the little favours madam that you owe your husband  seraphina sat for some while in silence she could bear to be misjudged without a pang by those whom she contemned she had none of ottos eagerness to be approved but went her own way straight and head in air to sir john however after what he had said and as her husbands friend she was prepared to stoop  what do you think of me she asked abruptly  i have told you already said sir john i think you want another glass of my good wine  come she said this is unlike you you are not wont to be afraid you say that you admire my husband in his name be honest  i admire your courage said the baronet beyond that as you have guessed and indeed said our natures are not sympathetic  you spoke of scandal pursued seraphina was the scandal great  it was considerable said sir john  and you believed it she demanded  o madam said sir john the question  thank you for that answer cried seraphina and now here i will tell you upon my honour upon my soul in spite of all the scandal in this world i am as true a wife as ever stood  we should probably not agree upon a definition observed sir john  o she cried i have abominably used himi know that it is not that i mean but if you admire my husband i insist that you shall understand me i can look him in the face without a blush  it may be madam said sir john or have i presumed to think the contrary  you will not believe me she cried you think i am a guilty wife you think he was my lover  madam returned the baronet when i tore up my papers i promised your good husband to concern myself no more with your affairs and i assure you for the last time that i have no desire to judge you  but you will not acquit me ah she cried he willhe knows me better  sir john smiled  you smile at my distress asked seraphina  at your womans coolness said sir john a man would scarce have had the courage of that cry which was for all that very natural and i make no doubt quite true but remark madamsince you do me the honour to consult me gravelyi have no pity for what you call your distresses you have been completely selfish and now reap the consequence had you once thought of your husband instead of singly thinking of yourself you would not now have been alone a fugitive with blood upon your hands and hearing from a morose old englishman truth more bitter than scandal  i thank you she said quivering this is very true will you stop the carriage  no child said sir john not until i see you mistress of yourself  there was a long pause during which the carriage rolled by rock and woodland  and now she resumed with perfect steadiness will you consider me composed i request you as a gentleman to let me out  i think you do unwisely he replied continue if you please to use my carriage  sir john she said if death were sitting on that pile of stones i would alight i do not blame i thank you i now know how i appear to others but sooner than draw breath beside a man who can so think of me i would o she cried and was silent  sir john pulled the string alighted and offered her his hand but she refused the help  the road had now issued from the valleys in which it had been winding and come to that part of its course where it runs like a cornice along the brow of the steep northward face of grünewald the place where they had alighted was at a salient angle a bold rock and some windtortured pinetrees overhung it from above far below the blue plains lay forth and melted into heaven and before them the road by a succession of bold zigzags was seen mounting to where a tower upon a tall cliff closed the view  there said the baronet pointing to the tower you see the felsenburg your goal i wish you a good journey and regret i cannot be of more assistance  he mounted to his place and gave a signal and the carriage rolled away  seraphina stood by the wayside gazing before her with blind eyes sir john she had dismissed already from her mind she hated him that was enough for whatever seraphina hated or contemned fell instantly to lilliputian smallness and was thenceforward steadily ignored in thought and now she had matter for concern indeed her interview with otto which she had never yet forgiven him began to appear before her in a very different light he had come to her still thrilling under recent insult and not yet breathed from fighting her own cause and how that knowledge changed the value of his words yes he must have loved her this was a brave feelingit was no mere weakness of the will and she was she incapable of love it would appear so and she swallowed her tears and yearned to see otto to explain all to ask pity upon her knees for her transgressions and if all else were now beyond the reach of reparation to restore at least the liberty of which she had deprived him  swiftly she sped along the highway and as the road wound out and in about the bluffs and gullies of the mountain saw and lost by glimpses the tall tower that stood before and above her purpled by the mountain air     chapter ii  treats of a christian virtue   when otto mounted to his rolling prison he found another occupant in a corner of the front seat but as this person hung his head and the brightness of the carriagelamps shone outward the prince could only see it was a man the colonel followed his prisoner and clappedto the door and at that the four horses broke immediately into a swinging trot  gentlemen said the colonel after some little while had passed if we are to travel in silence we might as well be at home i appear of course in an invidious character but i am a man of taste fond of books and solidly informing talk and unfortunately condemned for life to the guardroom gentlemen this is my chance dont spoil it for me i have here the pick of the whole court barring lovely woman i have a great author in the person of the doctor  gotthold cried otto  it appears said the doctor bitterly that we must go together your highness had not calculated upon that  what do you infer cried otto that i had you arrested  the inference is simple said the doctor  colonel gordon said the prince oblige me so far and set me right with herr von hohenstockwitz  gentlemen said the colonel you are both arrested on the same warrant in the name of the princess seraphina acting regent countersigned by prime minister freiherr von gondremark and dated the day before yesterday the twelfth i reveal to you the secrets of the prisonhouse he added  otto said gotthold i ask you to pardon my suspicions  gotthold said the prince i am not certain i can grant you that  your highness is i am sure far too magnanimous to hesitate said the colonel but allow me we speak at home in my religion of the means of grace and i now propose to offer them so saying the colonel lighted a bright lamp which he attached to one side of the carriage and from below the front seat produced a goodly basket adorned with the long necks of bottles tu spem reducishow does it go doctor he asked gaily i am in a sense your host and i am sure you are both far too considerate of my embarrassing position to refuse to do me honour gentlemen i drink to the prince  colonel said otto we have a jovial entertainer i drink to colonel gordon  thereupon all three took their wine very pleasantly and even as they did so the carriage with a lurch turned into the highroad and began to make better speed  all was bright within the wine had coloured gottholds cheek dim forms of forest trees dwindling and spiring scarves of the starry sky now wide and now narrow raced past the windows through one that was left open the air of the woods came in with a nocturnal raciness and the roll of wheels and the tune of the trotting horses sounded merrily on the ear toast followed toast glass after glass was bowed across and emptied by the trio and presently there began to fall upon them a luxurious spell under the influence of which little but the sound of quiet and confidential laughter interrupted the long intervals of meditative silence  otto said gotthold after one of these seasons of quiet i do not ask you to forgive me were the parts reversed i could not forgive you  well said otto it is a phrase we use i do forgive you but your words and your suspicions rankle and not yours alone it is idle colonel gordon in view of the order you are carrying out to conceal from you the dissensions of my family they have gone so far that they are now public property well gentlemen can i forgive my wife i can of course and do but in what sense i would certainly not stoop to any revenge as certainly i could not think of her but as one changed beyond my recognition  allow me returned the colonel you will permit me to hope that i am addressing christians we are all conscious i trust that we are miserable sinners  i disown the consciousness said gotthold warmed with this good fluid i deny your thesis  how sir you never did anything wrong and i heard you asking pardon but this moment not of your god sir but of a common fellowworm the colonel cried  i own you have me you are expert in argument herr oberst said the doctor  begad sir i am proud to hear you say so said the colonel i was well grounded indeed at aberdeen and as for this matter of forgiveness it comes sir of loose views and what is if anything more dangerous a regular life a sound creed and a bad morality thats the root of wisdom you two gentlemen are too good to be forgiving  the paradox is somewhat forced said gotthold  pardon me colonel said the prince i readily acquit you of any design of offence but your words bite like satire is this a time do you think when i can wish to hear myself called good now that i am paying the penalty and am willing like yourself to think it just of my prolonged misconduct  o pardon me cried the colonel you have never been expelled from the divinity hall you have never been broke i was broke for a neglect of military duty to tell you the open truth your highness i was the worse of drink its a thing i never do now he added taking out his glass but a man you see who has really tasted the defects of his own character as i have and has come to regard himself as a kind of blind teetotum knocking about life begins to learn a very different view about forgiveness i will talk of not forgiving others sir when i have made out to forgive myself and not before and the date is like to be a long one my father the reverend alexander gordon was a good man and damned hard upon others i am what they call a bad one and that is just the difference the man who cannot forgive any mortal thing is a green hand in life  and yet i have heard of you colonel as a duellist said gotthold  a different thing sir replied the soldier professional etiquette and i trust without unchristian feeling  presently after the colonel fell into a deep sleep and his companions looked upon each other smiling  an odd fish said gotthold  and a strange guardian said the prince yet what he said was true  rightly looked upon mused gotthold it is ourselves that we cannot forgive when we refuse forgiveness to our friend some strand of our own misdoing is involved in every quarrel  are there not offences that disgrace the pardoner asked otto are there not bounds of selfrespect  otto said gotthold does any man respect himself to this poor waif of a soldier of fortune we may seem respectable gentlemen but to ourselves what are we unless a pasteboard portico and a deliquium of deadly weaknesses within  i yes said otto but you gottholdyou with your interminable industry your keen mind your booksserving mankind scorning pleasures and temptations you do not know how i envy you  otto said the doctor in one word and a bitter one to say i am a secret tippler yes i drink too much the habit has robbed these very books to which you praise my devotion of the merits that they should have had it has spoiled my temper when i spoke to you the other day how much of my warmth was in the cause of virtue how much was the fever of last nights wine ay as my poor fellowsot there said and as i vaingloriously denied we are all miserable sinners put here for a moment knowing the good choosing the evil standing naked and ashamed in the eye of god  is it so said otto why then what are we are the very best  there is no best in man said gotthold i am not better it is likely i am not worse than you or that poor sleeper i was a sham and now you know me that is all  and yet it has not changed my love returned otto softly our misdeeds do not change us gotthold fill your glass let us drink to what is good in this bad business let us drink to our old affection and when we have done so forgive your too just grounds of offence and drink with me to my wife whom i have so misused who has so misused me and whom i have left i fear i greatly fear in danger what matters it how bad we are if others can still love us and we can still love others  ay replied the doctor it is very well said it is the true answer to the pessimist and the standing miracle of mankind so you still love me and so you can forgive your wife why then we may bid conscience down dog like an illtrained puppy yapping at shadows  the pair fell into silence the doctor tapping on his empty glass  the carriage swung forth out of the valleys on that open balcony of highroad that runs along the front of grünewald looking down on gerolstein far below a white waterfall was shining to the stars from the falling skirts of forest and beyond that the night stood naked above the plain on the other hand the lamplight skimmed the face of the precipices and the dwarf pinetrees twinkled with all their needles and were gone again into the wake the granite roadway thundered under wheels and hoofs and at times by reason of its continual winding otto could see the escort on the other side of a ravine riding well together in the night presently the felsenburg came plainly in view some way above them on a bold projection of the mountain and planting its bulk against the starry sky  see gotthold said the prince our destination  gotthold awoke as from a trance  i was thinking said he if there is any danger why did you not resist i was told you came of your free will but should you not be there to help her  the colour faded from the princes cheeks     chapter iii  providence von rosen act the last in which she gallops off   when the busy countess came forth from her interview with seraphina it is not too much to say that she was beginning to be terribly afraid she paused in the corridor and reckoned up her doings with an eye to gondremark the fan was in requisition in an instant but her disquiet was beyond the reach of fanning the girl has lost her head she thought and then dismally i have gone too far she instantly decided on secession now the mons sacer of the frau von rosen was a certain rustic villa in the forest called by herself in a smart attack of poesy tannen zauber and by everybody else plain kleinbrunn  thither upon the thought she furiously drove passing gondremark at the entrance to the palace avenue but feigning not to observe him and as kleinbrunn was seven good miles away and in the bottom of a narrow dell she passed the night without any rumour of the outbreak reaching her and the glow of the conflagration was concealed by intervening hills frau von rosen did not sleep well she was seriously uneasy as to the results of her delightful evening and saw herself condemned to quite a lengthy sojourn in her deserts and a long defensive correspondence ere she could venture to return to gondremark on the other hand she examined by way of pastime the deeds she had received from otto and even here saw cause for disappointment in these troublous days she had no taste for landed property and she was convinced besides that otto had paid dearer than the farm was worth lastly the order for the princes release fairly burned her meddling fingers  all things considered the next day beheld an elegant and beautiful lady in a ridinghabit and a flapping hat draw bridle at the gate of the felsenburg not perhaps with any clear idea of her purpose but with her usual experimental views on life governor gordon summoned to the gate welcomed the omnipotent countess with his most gallant bearing though it was wonderful how old he looked in the morning  ah governor she said we have surprises for you sir and nodded at him meaningly  eh madam leave me my prisoners he said and if you will but join the band begad ill be happy for life  you would spoil me would you not she asked  i would try i would try returned the governor and he offered her his arm  she took it picked up her skirt and drew him close to her i have come to see the prince she said now infidel on business a message from that stupid gondremark who keeps me running like a courier do i look like one herr gordon and she planted her eyes in him  you look like an angel maam returned the governor with a great air of finished gallantry  the countess laughed an angel on horseback she said quick work  you came you saw you conquered flourished gordon in high good humour with his own wit and grace we toasted you madam in the carriage in an excellent good glass of wine toasted you fathom deep the finest woman with begad the finest eyes in grünewald i never saw the like of them but once in my own country when i was a young fool at college thomasina haig her name was i give you my word of honour she was as like you as two peas  and so you were merry in the carriage asked the countess gracefully dissembling a yawn  we were we had a very pleasant conversation but we took perhaps a glass more than that fine fellow of a prince has been accustomed to said the governor and i observe this morning that he seems a little off his mettle well get him mellow again ere bedtime this is his door  well she whispered let me get my breath no no wait have the door ready to open and the countess standing like one inspired shook out her fine voice in lascia chio pianga and when she had reached the proper point and lyrically uttered forth her sighings after liberty the door at a sign was flung wide open and she swam into the princes sight brighteyed and with her colour somewhat freshened by the exercise of singing it was a great dramatic entrance and to the somewhat doleful prisoner within the sight was sunshine  ah madam he cried running to heryou here  she looked meaningly at gordon and as soon as the door was closed she fell on ottos neck to see you here she moaned and clung to him  but the prince stood somewhat stiffly in that enviable situation and the countess instantly recovered from her outburst  poor child she said poor child sit down beside me here and tell me all about it my heart really bleeds to see you how does time go  madam replied the prince sitting down beside her his gallantry recovered the time will now go all too quickly till you leave but i must ask you for the news i have most bitterly condemned myself for my inertia of last night you wisely counselled me it was my duty to resist you wisely and nobly counselled me i have since thought of it with wonder you have a noble heart  otto she said spare me was it even right i wonder i have duties too you poor child and when i see you they all meltall my good resolutions fly away  and mine still come too late he replied sighing o what would i not give to have resisted what would i not give for freedom  well what would you give she asked and the red fan was spread only her eyes as if from over battlements brightly surveyed him  i what do you mean madam you have some news for me he cried  o o said madam dubiously  he was at her feet do not trifle with my hopes he pleaded tell me dearest madame von rosen tell me you cannot be cruel it is not in your nature give i can give nothing i have nothing i can only plead in mercy  do not she said it is not fair otto you know my weakness spare me be generous  o madam he said it is for you to be generous to have pity he took her hand and pressed it he plied her with caresses and appeals the countess had a most enjoyable sham siege and then relented she sprang to her feet she tore her dress open and all warm from her bosom threw the order on the floor  there she cried i forced it from her use it and i am ruined and she turned away as if to veil the force of her emotions  otto sprang upon the paper read it and cried out aloud o god bless her he said god bless her and he kissed the writing  von rosen was a singularly goodnatured woman but her part was now beyond her ingrate she cried i wrung it from her i betrayed my trust to get it and tis she you thank  can you blame me said the prince i love her  i see that she said and i  you madame von rosen you are my dearest my kindest and most generous of friends he said approaching her you would be a perfect friend if you were not so lovely you have a great sense of humour you cannot be unconscious of your charm and you amuse yourself at times by playing on my weakness and at times i can take pleasure in the comedy but not today today you will be the true the serious the manly friend and you will suffer me to forget that you are lovely and that i am weak come dear countess let me today repose in you entirely  he held out his hand smiling and she took it frankly i vow you have bewitched me she said and then with a laugh i break my staff she added and i must pay you my best compliment you made a difficult speech you are as adroit dear prince as i amcharming and as she said the word with a great curtsey she justified it  you hardly keep the bargain madam when you make yourself so beautiful said the prince bowing  it was my last arrow she returned i am disarmed blank cartridge o mon prince and now i tell you if you choose to leave this prison you can and i am ruined choose  madame von rosen replied otto i choose and i will go my duty points me duty still neglected by this featherhead but do not fear to be a loser i propose instead that you should take me with you a bear in chains to baron gondremark i am become perfectly unscrupulous to save my wife i will do all all he can ask or fancy he shall be filled were he huge as leviathan and greedy as the grave i will content him and you the fairy of our pantomime shall have the credit  done she cried admirable prince charming no longerprince sorcerer prince solon let us go this moment stay she cried pausing i beg dear prince to give you back these deeds twas you who liked the farmi have not seen it and it was you who wished to benefit the peasants and besides she added with a comical change of tone i should prefer the ready money  both laughed here i am once more a farmer said otto accepting the papers but overwhelmed in debt  the countess touched a bell and the governor appeared  governor she said i am going to elope with his highness the result of our talk has been a thorough understanding and the coup détat is over here is the order  colonel gordon adjusted silver spectacles upon his nose yes he said the princess very right but the warrant madam was countersigned  by heinrich said von rosen well and here am i to represent him  well your highness resumed the soldier of fortune i must congratulate you upon my loss you have been cut out by beauty and i am left lamenting the doctor still remains to me probus doctus lepidus jucundus a man of books  ay there is nothing about poor gotthold said the prince  the governors consolation would you leave him bare asked von rosen  and your highness resumed gordon may i trust that in the course of this temporary obscuration you have found me discharge my part with suitable respect and i may add tact i adopted purposely a cheerfulness of manner mirth it appeared to me and a good glass of wine were the fit alleviations  colonel said otto holding out his hand your society was of itself enough i do not merely thank you for your pleasant spirits i have to thank you besides for some philosophy of which i stood in need i trust i do not see you for the last time and in the meanwhile as a memento of our strange acquaintance let me offer you these verses on which i was but now engaged i am so little of a poet and was so ill inspired by prison bars that they have some claim to be at least a curiosity  the colonels countenance lighted as he took the paper the silver spectacles were hurriedly replaced ha he said alexandrines the tragic metre i shall cherish this your highness like a relic no more suitable offering although i say it could be made dieux de limmense plaine et des vastes forêts very good he said very good indeed et du geôlier luimême apprendre des leçons most handsome begad  come governor cried the countess you can read his poetry when we are gone open your grudging portals  i ask your pardon said the colonel to a man of my character and tastes these verses this handsome referencemost moving i assure you can i offer you an escort  no no replied the countess we go incogniti as we arrived we ride together the prince will take my servants horse hurry and privacy herr oberst that is all we seek and she began impatiently to lead the way  but otto had still to bid farewell to dr gotthold and the governor following with his spectacles in one hand and the paper in the other had still to communicate his treasured verses piece by piece as he succeeded in deciphering the manuscript to all he came across and still his enthusiasm mounted i declare he cried at last with the air of one who has at length divined a mystery they remind me of robbie burns  but there is an end to all things and at length otto was walking by the side of madame von rosen along that mountain wall her servant following with both the horses and all about them sunlight and breeze and flying bird and the vast regions of the air and the capacious prospect wildwood and climbing pinnacle and the sound and voice of mountain torrents at their hand and far below them green melting into sapphire on the plains  they walked at first in silence for ottos mind was full of the delight of liberty and nature and still betweenwhiles he was preparing his interview with gondremark but when the first rough promontory of the rock was turned and the felsenburg concealed behind its bulk the lady paused  here she said i will dismount poor karl and you and i must ply our spurs i love a wild ride with a good companion  as she spoke a carriage came into sight round the corner next below them in the order of the road it came heavily creaking and a little ahead of it a traveller was soberly walking notebook in hand  it is sir john cried otto and he hailed him  the baronet pocketed his notebook stared through an eyeglass and then waved his stick and he on his side and the countess and the prince on theirs advanced with somewhat quicker steps they met at the reentrant angle where a thin stream sprayed across a boulder and was scattered in rain among the brush and the baronet saluted the prince with much punctilio to the countess on the other hand he bowed with a kind of sneering wonder  is it possible madam that you have not heard the news he asked  what news she cried  news of the first order returned sir john a revolution in the state a republic declared the palace burned to the ground the princess in flight gondremark wounded  heinrich wounded she screamed  wounded and suffering acutely said sir john his groans  there fell from the ladys lips an oath so potent that in smoother hours it would have made her hearers jump she ran to her horse scrambled to the saddle and yet halfseated dashed down the road at full gallop the groom after a pause of wonder followed her the rush of her impetuous passage almost scared the carriagehorses over the verge of the steep hill and still she clattered further and the crags echoed to her flight and still the groom flogged vainly in pursuit of her at the fourth corner a woman trailing slowly up leaped back with a cry and escaped death by a handsbreadth but the countess wasted neither glance nor thought upon the incident out and in about the bluffs of the mountain wall she fled loosereined and still the groom toiled in her pursuit  a most impulsive lady said sir john who would have thought she cared for him and before the words were uttered he was struggling in the princes grasp  my wife the princess what of her  she is down the road he gasped i left her twenty minutes back  and next moment the choked author stood alone and the prince on foot was racing down the hill behind the countess     chapter iv  babes in the wood   while the feet of the prince continued to run swiftly his heart which had at first by far outstripped his running soon began to linger and hang back not that he ceased to pity the misfortune or to yearn for the sight of seraphina but the memory of her obdurate coldness awoke within him and woke in turn his own habitual diffidence of self had sir john been given time to tell him all had he even known that she was speeding to the felsenburg he would have gone to her with ardour as it was he began to see himself once more intruding profiting perhaps by her misfortune and now that she was fallen proffering unloved caresses to the wife who had spurned him in prosperity the sore spots upon his vanity began to burn once more his anger assumed the carriage of a hostile generosity he would utterly forgive indeed he would help save and comfort his unloving wife but all with distant selfdenial imposing silence on his heart respecting seraphinas disaffection as he would the innocence of a child so when at length he turned a corner and beheld the princess it was his first thought to reassure her of the purity of his respect and he at once ceased running and stood still she upon her part began to run to him with a little cry then seeing him pause she paused also smitten with remorse and at length with the most guilty timidity walked nearly up to where he stood  otto she said i have ruined all  seraphina he cried with a sob but did not move partly withheld by his resolutions partly struck stupid at the sight of her weariness and disorder had she stood silent they had soon been locked in an embrace but she too had prepared herself against the interview and must spoil the golden hour with protestations  all she went on i have ruined all but otto in kindness you must hear menot justify but own my faults i have been taught so cruelly i have had such time for thought and see the world so changed i have been blind stoneblind i have let all true good go by me and lived on shadows but when this dream fell and i had betrayed you and thought i had killed she paused i thought i had killed gondremark she said with a deep flush and i found myself alone as you said  the mention of the name of gondremark pricked the princes generosity like a spur well he cried and whose fault was it but mine it was my duty to be beside you loved or not but i was a skulker in the grain and found it easier to desert than to oppose you i could never learn that better part of love to fight loves battles but yet the love was there and now when this toy kingdom of ours has fallen first of all by my demerits and next by your inexperience and we are here alone together as poor as job and merely a man and a womanlet me conjure you to forgive the weakness and to repose in the love do not mistake me he cried seeing her about to speak and imposing silence with uplifted hand my love is changed it is purged of any conjugal pretension it does not ask does not hope does not wish for a return in kind you may forget for ever that part in which you found me so distasteful and accept without embarrassment the affection of a brother  you are too generous otto she said i know that i have forfeited your love i cannot take this sacrifice you had far better leave me o go away and leave me to my fate  o no said otto we must first of all escape out of this hornets nest to which i led you my honour is engaged i said but now we were as poor as job and behold not many miles from here i have a house of my own to which i will conduct you otto the prince being down we must try what luck remains to otto the hunter come seraphina show that you forgive me and let us set about this business of escape in the best spirits possible you used to say my dear that except as a husband and a prince i was a pleasant fellow i am neither now and you may like my company without remorse come then it were idle to be captured can you still walk forth then said he and he began to lead the way  a little below where they stood a goodsized brook passed below the road which overleapt it in a single arch on one bank of that loquacious water a footpath descended a green dell here it was rocky and stony and lay on the steep scarps of the ravine here it was choked with brambles and there in fairy haughs it lay for a few paces evenly on the green turf like a sponge the hillside oozed with wellwater the burn kept growing both in force and volume at every leap it fell with heavier plunges and span more widely in the pool great had been the labours of that stream and great and agreeable the changes it had wrought it had cut through dykes of stubborn rock and now like a blowing dolphin spouted through the orifice along all its humble coasts it had undermined and rafteddown the goodlier timber of the forest and on these rough clearings it now set and tended primrose gardens and planted woods of willow and made a favourite of the silver birch through all these friendly features the path its human acolyte conducted our two wanderers downwardotto before still pausing at the more difficult passages to lend assistance the princess following from time to time when he turned to help her her face would lighten upon hisher eyes half desperately woo him he saw but dare not understand she does not love me he told himself with magnanimity this is remorse or gratitude i were no gentleman no nor yet a man if i presumed upon these pitiful concessions  some way down the glen the stream already grown to a good bulk of water was rudely dammed across and about a third of it abducted in a wooden trough gaily the pure water airs first cousin fleeted along the rude aqueduct whose sides and floor it had made green with grasses the path bearing it close company threaded a wilderness of briar and wildrose and presently a little in front the brown top of a mill and the tall millwheel spraying diamonds arose in the narrows of the glen at the same time the snoring music of the saws broke the silence  the miller hearing steps came forth to his door and both he and otto started  good morning miller said the prince you were right it seems and i was wrong i give you the news and bid you to mittwalden my throne has fallengreat was the fall of itand your good friends of the phoenix bear the rule  the redfaced miller looked supreme astonishment and your highness he gasped  my highness is running away replied otto straight for the frontier  leaving grünewald cried the man your fathers son its not to be permitted  do you arrest us friend asked otto smiling  arrest you i exclaimed the man for what does your highness take me why sir i make sure there is not a man in grünewald would lay hands upon you  o many many said the prince but from you who were bold with me in my greatness i should even look for aid in my distress  the miller became the colour of beetroot you may say so indeed said he and meanwhile will you and your lady step into my house  we have not time for that replied the prince but if you would oblige us with a cup of wine without here you will give a pleasure and a service both in one  the miller once more coloured to the nape he hastened to bring forth wine in a pitcher and three bright crystal tumblers your highness must not suppose he said as he filled them that i am an habitual drinker the time when i had the misfortune to encounter you i was a trifle overtaken i allow but a more sober man than i am in my ordinary i do not know where you are to look for and even this glass that i drink to you and to the lady is quite an unusual recreation  the wine was drunk with due rustic courtesies and then refusing further hospitality otto and seraphina once more proceeded to descend the glen which now began to open and to be invaded by the taller trees  i owed that man a reparation said the prince for when we met i was in the wrong and put a sore affront upon him i judge by myself perhaps but i begin to think that no one is the better for a humiliation  but some have to be taught so she replied  well well he said with a painful embarrassment well well but let us think of safety my miller is all very good but i do not pin my faith to him to follow down this stream will bring us but after innumerable windings to my house here up this glade there lies a crosscutthe worlds end for solitudethe very deer scarce visit it are you too tired or could you pass that way  choose the path otto i will follow you she said  no he replied with a singular imbecility of manner and appearance but i meant the path was rough it lies all the way by glade and dingle and the dingles are both deep and thorny  lead on she said are you not otto the hunter  they had now burst across a veil of underwood and were come into a lawn among the forest very green and innocent and solemnly surrounded by trees otto paused on the margin looking about him with delight then his glance returned to seraphina as she stood framed in that silvan pleasantness and looking at her husband with undecipherable eyes a weakness both of the body and mind fell on him like beginnings of sleep the cords of his activity were relaxed his eyes clung to her let us rest he said and he made her sit down and himself sat down beside her on the slope of an inconsiderable mound  she sat with her eyes downcast her slim hand dabbling in grass like a maid waiting for loves summons the sound of the wind in the forest swelled and sank and drew near them with a running rush and died away and away in the distance into fainting whispers nearer hand a bird out of the deep covert uttered broken and anxious notes all this seemed but a halting prelude to speech to otto it seemed as if the whole frame of nature were waiting for his words and yet his pride kept him silent the longer he watched that slender and pale hand plucking at the grasses the harder and rougher grew the fight between pride and its kindly adversary  seraphina he said at last it is right you should know one thing i never he was about to say doubted you but was that true and if true was it generous to speak of it silence succeeded  i pray you tell it me she said tell it me in pity  i mean only this he resumed that i understand all and do not blame you i understand how the brave woman must look down on the weak man i think you were wrong in some things but i have tried to understand it and i do i do not need to forget or to forgive seraphina for i have understood  i know what i have done she said i am not so weak that i can be deceived with kind speeches i know what i have beeni see myself i am not worth your anger how much less to be forgiven in all this downfall and misery i see only me and you you as you have been always me as i wasme above all o yes i see myself and what can i think  ah then let us reverse the parts said otto it is ourselves we cannot forgive when we deny forgiveness to anotherso a friend told me last night on these terms seraphina you see how generously i have forgiven myself but am not i to be forgiven come then forgive yourselfand me  she did not answer in words but reached out her hand to him quickly he took it and as the smooth fingers settled and nestled in his love ran to and fro between them in tender and transforming currents  seraphina he cried o forget the past let me serve and help you let me be your servant it is enough for me to serve you and to be near you let me be near you deardo not send me away he hurried his pleading like the speech of a frightened child it is not love he went on i do not ask for love my love is enough  otto she said as if in pain  he looked up into her face it was wrung with the very ecstasy of tenderness and anguish on her features and most of all in her changed eyes there shone the very light of love  seraphina he cried aloud and with a sudden tuneless voice seraphina  look round you at this glade she cried and where the leaves are coming on young trees and the flowers begin to blossom this is where we meet meet for the first time it is so much better to forget and to be born again o what a pit there is for sinsgods mercy mans oblivion  seraphina he said let it be so indeed let all that was be merely the abuse of dreaming let me begin again a stranger i have dreamed in a long dream that i adored a girl unkind and beautiful in all things my superior but still cold like ice and again i dreamed and thought she changed and melted glowed and turned to me and iwho had no merit but a love slavish and unerectlay close and durst not move for fear of waking  lie close she said with a deep thrill of speech  so they spake in the spring woods and meanwhile in mittwalden rathhaus the republic was declared     bibliographical postscript to complete the story   the reader well informed in modern history will not require details as to the fate of the republic the best account is to be found in the memoirs of herr greisengesang 7 bände leipzig by our passing acquaintance the licentiate roederer herr roederer with too much of an authors licence makes a great figure of his heroposes him indeed to be the centrepiece and cloudcompeller of the whole but with due allowance for this bias the book is able and complete  the reader is of course acquainted with the vigorous and bracing pages of sir john 2 vols london longman hurst rees orme and brown sir john who plays but a toothcomb in the orchestra of this historical romance blows in his own book the big bassoon his character is there drawn at large and the sympathy of landor has countersigned the admiration of the public one point however calls for explanation the chapter on grünewald was torn by the hand of the author in the palace gardens how comes it then to figure at full length among my more modest pages the lion of the caravan that eminent literatus was a man of method juvenal by double entry he was once profanely called and when he tore the sheets in question it was rather as he has since explained in the search for some dramatic evidence of his sincerity than with the thought of practical deletion at that time indeed he was possessed of two blotted scrolls and a fair copy in double but the chapter as the reader knows was honestly omitted from the famous memoirs on the various courts of europe it has been mine to give it to the public  bibliography still helps us with a further glimpse of our characters i have here before me a small volume printed for private circulation no printers name nd poésies par frédéric et amélie mine is a presentation copy obtained for me by mr bain in the haymarket and the name of the first owner is written on the flyleaf in the hand of prince otto himself the modest epigraphle rime nest pas richemay be attributed with a good show of likelihood to the same collaborator it is strikingly appropriate and i have found the volume very dreary those pieces in which i seem to trace the hand of the princess are particularly dull and conscientious but the booklet had a fair success with that public for which it was designed and i have come across some evidences of a second venture of the same sort now unprocurable here at least we may take leave of otto and seraphinawhat do i say of frédéric and amélieageing together peaceably at the court of the wifes father jingling french rhymes and correcting joint proofs  still following the booklists i perceive that mr swinburne has dedicated a rousing lyric and some vigorous sonnets to the memory of gondremark that

the volume in the readers hand the authors can but add that one of them is old enough to be ashamed of himself and the other young enough to learn better       r l s      l o     the wrong box  chapter i  in which morris suspects   how very little does the amateur dwelling at home at ease comprehend the labours and perils of the author and when he smilingly skims the surface of a work of fiction how little does he consider the hours of toil consultation of authorities researches in the bodleian correspondence with learned and illegible germansin one word the vast scaffolding that was first built up and then knocked down to while away an hour for him in a railway train thus i might begin this tale with a biography of tontibirthplace parentage genius probably inherited from his mother remarkable instance of precocity etcand a complete treatise on the system to which he bequeathed his name the material is all beside me in a pigeonhole but i scorn to appear vainglorious tonti is dead and i never saw anyone who even pretended to regret him and as for the tontine system a word will suffice for all the purposes of this unvarnished narrative  a number of sprightly youths the more the merrier put up a certain sum of money which is then funded in a pool under trustees coming on for a century later the proceeds are fluttered for a moment in the face of the last survivor who is probably deaf so that he cannot even hear of his successand who is certainly dying so that he might just as well have lost the peculiar poetry and even humour of the scheme is now apparent since it is one by which nobody concerned can possibly profit but its fine sportsmanlike character endeared it to our grandparents  when joseph finsbury and his brother masterman were little lads in whitefrilled trousers their fathera welltodo merchant in cheapsidecaused them to join a small but rich tontine of sevenandthirty lives a thousand pounds was the entrance fee and joseph finsbury can remember to this day the visit to the lawyers where the members of the tontineall children like himselfwere assembled together and sat in turn in the big office chair and signed their names with the assistance of a kind old gentleman in spectacles and wellington boots he remembers playing with the children afterwards on the lawn at the back of the lawyers house and a battleroyal that he had with a brother tontiner who had kicked his shins the sound of war called forth the lawyer from where he was dispensing cake and wine to the assembled parents in the office and the combatants were separated and josephs spirit for he was the smaller of the two commended by the gentleman in the wellington boots who vowed he had been just such another at the same age joseph wondered to himself if he had worn at that time little wellingtons and a little bald head and when in bed at night he grew tired of telling himself stories of seafights he used to dress himself up as the old gentleman and entertain other little boys and girls with cake and wine  in the year 1840 the thirtyseven were all alive in 1850 their number had decreased by six in 1856 and 1857 business was more lively for the crimea and the mutiny carried off no less than nine there remained in 1870 but five of the original members and at the date of my story including the two finsburys but three  by this time masterman was in his seventythird year he had long complained of the effects of age had long since retired from business and now lived in absolute seclusion under the roof of his son michael the wellknown solicitor joseph on the other hand was still up and about and still presented but a semivenerable figure on the streets in which he loved to wander this was the more to be deplored because masterman had led even to the least particular a model british life industry regularity respectability and a preference for the four per cents are understood to be the very foundations of a green old age all these masterman had eminently displayed and here he was ab agendo at seventythree while joseph barely two years younger and in the most excellent preservation had disgraced himself through life by idleness and eccentricity embarked in the leather trade he had early wearied of business for which he was supposed to have small parts a taste for general information not promptly checked had soon begun to sap his manhood there is no passion more debilitating to the mind unless perhaps it be that itch of public speaking which it not infrequently accompanies or begets the two were conjoined in the case of joseph the acute stage of this double malady that in which the patient delivers gratuitous lectures soon declared itself with severity and not many years had passed over his head before he would have travelled thirty miles to address an infant school he was no student his reading was confined to elementary textbooks and the daily papers he did not even fly as high as cyclopædias life he would say was his volume his lectures were not meant he would declare for college professors they were addressed direct to the great heart of the people and the heart of the people must certainly be sounder than its head for his lucubrations were received with favour that entitled how to live cheerfully on forty pounds a year created a sensation among the unemployed education its aims objects purposes and desirability gained him the respect of the shallowminded as for his celebrated essay on life insurance regarded in its relation to the masses read before the working mens mutual improvement society isle of dogs it was received with a literal ovation by an unintelligent audience of both sexes and so marked was the effect that he was next year elected honorary president of the institution an office of less than no emolumentsince the holder was expected to come down with a donationbut one which highly satisfied his selfesteem  while joseph was thus building himself up a reputation among the more cultivated portion of the ignorant his domestic life was suddenly overwhelmed by orphans the death of his younger brother jacob saddled him with the charge of two boys morris and john and in the course of the same year his family was still further swelled by the addition of a little girl the daughter of john henry hazeltine esq a gentleman of small property and fewer friends he had met joseph only once at a lecturehall in holloway but from that formative experience he returned home to make a new will and consign his daughter and her fortune to the lecturer joseph had a kindly disposition and yet it was not without reluctance that he accepted this new responsibility advertised for a nurse and purchased a secondhand perambulator morris and john he made more readily welcome not so much because of the tie of consanguinity as because the leather business in which he hastened to invest their fortune of thirty thousand pounds had recently exhibited inexplicable symptoms of decline a young but capable scot was chosen as manager to the enterprise and the cares of business never again afflicted joseph finsbury leaving his charges in the hands of the capable scot who was married he began his extensive travels on the continent and in asia minor  with a polyglot testament in one hand and a phrasebook in the other he groped his way among the speakers of eleven european languages the first of these guides is hardly applicable to the purposes of the philosophic traveller and even the second is designed more expressly for the tourist than for the expert in life but he pressed interpreters into his servicewhenever he could get their services for nothingand by one means and another filled many notebooks with the results of his researches  in these wanderings he spent several years and only returned to england when the increasing age of his charges needed his attention the two lads had been placed in a good but economical school where they had received a sound commercial education which was somewhat awkward as the leather business was by no means in a state to court inquiry in fact when joseph went over his accounts preparatory to surrendering his trust he was dismayed to discover that his brothers fortune had not increased by his stewardship even by making over to his two wards every penny he had in the world there would still be a deficit of seven thousand eight hundred pounds when these facts were communicated to the two brothers in the presence of a lawyer morris finsbury threatened his uncle with all the terrors of the law and was only prevented from taking extreme steps by the advice of the professional man  you cannot get blood from a stone observed the lawyer  and morris saw the point and came to terms with his uncle on the one side joseph gave up all that he possessed and assigned to his nephew his contingent interest in the tontine already quite a hopeful speculation on the other morris agreed to harbour his uncle and miss hazeltine who had come to grief with the rest and to pay to each of them one pound a month as pocketmoney the allowance was amply sufficient for the old man it scarce appears how miss hazeltine contrived to dress upon it but she did and what is more she never complained she was indeed sincerely attached to her incompetent guardian he had never been unkind his age spoke for him loudly there was something appealing in his wholesouled quest of knowledge and innocent delight in the smallest mark of admiration and though the lawyer had warned her she was being sacrificed julia had refused to add to the perplexities of uncle joseph  in a large dreary house in john street bloomsbury these four dwelt together a family in appearance in reality a financial association julia and uncle joseph were of course slaves john a gentleman with a taste for the banjo the musichall the gaiety bar and the sporting papers must have been anywhere a secondary figure and the cares and delights of empire devolved entirely upon morris that these are inextricably intermixed is one of the commonplaces with which the bland essayist consoles the incompetent and the obscure but in the case of morris the bitter must have largely outweighed the sweet he grudged no trouble to himself he spared none to others he called the servants in the morning he served out the stores with his own hand he took soundings of the sherry he numbered the remainder biscuits painful scenes took place over the weekly bills and the cook was frequently impeached and the tradespeople came and hectored with him in the back parlour upon a question of three farthings the superficial might have deemed him a miser in his own eyes he was simply a man who had been defrauded the world owed him seven thousand eight hundred pounds and he intended that the world should pay  but it was in his dealings with joseph that morriss character particularly shone his uncle was a rather gambling stock in which he had invested heavily and he spared no pains in nursing the security the old man was seen monthly by a physician whether he was well or ill his diet his raiment his occasional outings now to brighton now to bournemouth were doled out to him like pap to infants in bad weather he must keep the house in good weather by halfpast nine he must be ready in the hall morris would see that he had gloves and that his shoes were sound and the pair would start for the leather business arm in arm the way there was probably dreary enough for there was no pretence of friendly feeling morris had never ceased to upbraid his guardian with his defalcation and to lament the burthen of miss hazeltine and joseph though he was a mild enough soul regarded his nephew with something very near akin to hatred but the way there was nothing to the journey back for the mere sight of the place of business as well as every detail of its transactions was enough to poison life for any finsbury  josephs name was still over the door it was he who still signed the cheques but this was only policy on the part of morris and designed to discourage other members of the tontine in reality the business was entirely his and he found it an inheritance of sorrows he tried to sell it and the offers he received were quite derisory he tried to extend it and it was only the liabilities he succeeded in extending to restrict it and it was only the profits he managed to restrict nobody had ever made money out of that concern except the capable scot who retired after his discharge to the neighbourhood of banff and built a castle with his profits the memory of this fallacious caledonian morris would revile daily as he sat in the private office opening his mail with old joseph at another table sullenly awaiting orders or savagely affixing signatures to he knew not what and when the man of the heather pushed cynicism so far as to send him the announcement of his second marriage to davida eldest daughter of the rev alexander mccraw it was really supposed that morris would have had a fit  business hours in the finsbury leather trade had been cut to the quick even morriss strong sense of duty to himself was not strong enough to dally within those walls and under the shadow of that bankruptcy and presently the manager and the clerks would draw a long breath and compose themselves for another day of procrastination raw haste on the authority of my lord tennyson is halfsister to delay but the business habits are certainly her uncles meanwhile the leather merchant would lead his living investment back to john street like a puppy dog and having there immured him in the hall would depart for the day on the quest of seal rings the only passion of his life joseph had more than the vanity of man he had that of lecturers he owned he was in fault although more sinned against by the capable scot than sinning but had he steeped his hands in gore he would still not deserve to be thus dragged at the chariotwheels of a young man to sit a captive in the halls of his own leather business to be entertained with mortifying comments on his whole careerto have his costume examined his collar pulled up the presence of his mittens verified and to be taken out and brought home in custody like an infant with a nurse at the thought of it his soul would swell with venom and he would make haste to hang up his hat and coat and the detested mittens and slink upstairs to julia and his notebooks the drawingroom at least was sacred from morris it belonged to the old man and the young girl it was there that she made her dresses it was there that he inked his spectacles over the registration of disconnected facts and the calculation of insignificant statistics  here he would sometimes lament his connection with the tontine if it were not for that he cried one afternoon he would not care to keep me i might be a free man julia and i could so easily support myself by giving lectures  to be sure you could said she and i think it one of the meanest things he ever did to deprive you of that amusement there were those nice people at the isle of cats wasnt it who wrote and asked you so very kindly to give them an address i did think he might have let you go to the isle of cats  he is a man of no intelligence cried joseph he lives here literally surrounded by the absorbing spectacle of life and for all the good it does him he might just as well be in his coffin think of his opportunities the heart of any other young man would burn within him at the chance the amount of information that i have it in my power to convey if he would only listen is a thing that beggars language julia  whatever you do my dear you mustnt excite yourself said julia for you know if you look at all ill the doctor will be sent for  that is very true returned the old man humbly i will compose myself with a little study he thumbed his gallery of notebooks i wonder he said i wonder since i see your hands are occupied whether it might not interest you  why of course it would cried julia read me one of your nice stories theres a dear  he had the volume down and his spectacles upon his nose instanter as though to forestall some possible retractation what i propose to read to you said he skimming through the pages is the notes of a highly important conversation with a dutch courier of the name of david abbas which is the latin for abbot its results are well worth the money it cost me for as abbas at first appeared somewhat impatient i was induced to what is i believe singularly called stand him drink it runs only to about fiveandtwenty pages yes here it is he cleared his throat and began to read  mr finsbury according to his own report contributed about four hundred and ninetynine fivehundredths of the interview and elicited from abbas literally nothing it was dull for julia who did not require to listen for the dutch courier who had to answer it must have been a perfect nightmare it would seem as if he had consoled himself by frequent appliances to the bottle it would even seem that toward the end he had ceased to depend on josephs frugal generosity and called for the flagon on his own account the effect at least of some mellowing influence was visible in the record abbas became suddenly a willing witness he began to volunteer disclosures and julia had just looked up from her seam with something like a smile when morris burst into the house eagerly calling for his uncle and the next instant plunged into the room waving in the air the evening paper  it was indeed with great news that he came charged the demise was announced of lieutenantgeneral sir glasgow biggar kcsi kcmg etc and the prize of the tontine now lay between the finsbury brothers here was morriss opportunity at last the brothers had never it is true been cordial when word came that joseph was in asia minor masterman had expressed himself with irritation i call it simply indecent he had said mark my wordswe shall hear of him next at the north pole and these bitter expressions had been reported to the traveller on his return what was worse masterman had refused to attend the lecture on education its aims objects purposes and desirability although invited to the platform since then the brothers had not met on the other hand they never had openly quarrelled joseph by morriss orders was prepared to waive the advantage of his juniority masterman had enjoyed all through life the reputation of a man neither greedy nor unfair here then were all the elements of compromise assembled and morris suddenly beholding his seven thousand eight hundred pounds restored to him and himself dismissed from the vicissitudes of the leather trade hastened the next morning to the office of his cousin michael  michael was something of a public character launched upon the law at a very early age and quite without protectors he had become a trafficker in shady affairs he was known to be the man for a lost cause it was known he could extract testimony from a stone and interest from a gold mine and his office was besieged in consequence by all that numerous class of persons who have still some reputation to lose and find themselves upon the point of losing it by those who have made undesirable acquaintances who have mislaid a compromising correspondence or who are blackmailed by their own butlers in private life michael was a man of pleasure but it was thought his dire experience at the office had gone far to sober him and it was known that in the matter of investments he preferred the solid to the brilliant what was yet more to the purpose he had been all his life a consistent scoffer at the finsbury tontine  it was therefore with little fear for the result that morris presented himself before his cousin and proceeded feverishly to set forth his scheme for near upon a quarter of an hour the lawyer suffered him to dwell upon its manifest advantages uninterrupted then michael rose from his seat and ringing for his clerk uttered a single clause  it wont do morris  it was in vain that the leather merchant pleaded and reasoned and returned day after day to plead and reason it was in vain that he offered a bonus of one thousand of two thousand of three thousand pounds in vain that he offered in josephs name to be content with only onethird of the pool still there came the same answer it wont do  i cant see the bottom of this he said at last you answer none of my arguments you havent a word to say for my part i believe its malice  the lawyer smiled at him benignly you may believe one thing said he whatever else i do i am not going to gratify any of your curiosity you see i am a trifle more communicative today because this is our last interview upon the subject  our last interview cried morris  the stirrupcup dear boy returned michael i cant have my business hours encroached upon and by the by have you no business of your own are there no convulsions in the leather trade  i believe it to be malice repeated morris doggedly you always hated and despised me from a boy  no nonot hated returned michael soothingly i rather like you than otherwise theres such a permanent surprise about you you look so dark and attractive from a distance do you know that to the naked eye you look romanticlike what they call a man with a history and indeed from all that i can hear the history of the leather trade is full of incident  yes said morris disregarding these remarks its no use coming here i shall see your father  o no you wont said michael nobody shall see my father  i should like to know why cried his cousin  i never make any secret of that replied the lawyer he is too ill  if he is as ill as you say cried the other the more reason for accepting my proposal i will see him  will you said michael and he rose and rang for his clerk  it was now time according to sir faraday bond the medical baronet whose name is so familiar at the foot of bulletins that joseph the poor golden goose should be removed into the purer air of bournemouth and for that uncharted wilderness of villas the family now shook off the dust of bloomsbury julia delighted because at bournemouth she sometimes made acquaintances john in despair for he was a man of city tastes joseph indifferent where he was so long as there was pen and ink and daily papers and he could avoid martyrdom at the office morris himself perhaps not displeased to pretermit these visits to the city and have a quiet time for thought he was prepared for any sacrifice all he desired was to get his money again and clear his feet of leather and it would be strange since he was so modest in his desires and the pool amounted to upward of a hundred and sixteen thousand poundsit would be strange indeed if he could find no way of influencing michael if i could only guess his reason he repeated to himself and by day as he walked in branksome woods and by night as he turned upon his bed and at mealtimes when he forgot to eat and in the bathing machine when he forgot to dress himself that problem was constantly before him why had michael refused  at last one night he burst into his brothers room and woke him  whats all this asked john  julia leaves this place tomorrow replied morris she must go up to town and get the house ready and find servants we shall all follow in three days  oh brayvo cried john but why  ive found it out john returned his brother gently  it what inquired john  why michael wont compromise said morris its because he cant its because mastermans dead and hes keeping it dark  golly cried the impressionable john but whats the use why does he do it anyway  to defraud us of the tontine said his brother  he couldnt you have to have a doctors certificate objected john  did you never hear of venal doctors inquired morris theyre as common as blackberries you can pick em up for threepoundten a head  i wouldnt do it under fifty if i were a sawbones ejaculated john  and then michael continued morris is in the very thick of it all his clients have come to grief his whole business is rotten eggs if any man could arrange it he could and depend upon it he has his plan all straight and depend upon it its a good one for hes clever and be damned to him but im clever too and im desperate i lost seven thousand eight hundred pounds when i was an orphan at school  o dont be tedious interrupted john youve lost far more already trying to get it back     chapter ii  in which morris takes action   some days later accordingly the three males of this depressing family might have been observed by a reader of g p r james taking their departure from the east station of bournemouth the weather was raw and changeable and joseph was arrayed in consequence according to the principles of sir faraday bond a man no less strict as is well known on costume than on diet there are few polite invalids who have not lived or tried to live by that punctilious physicians orders avoid tea madam the reader has doubtless heard him say avoid tea fried liver antimonial wine and bakers bread retire nightly at 1045 and clothe yourself if you please throughout in hygienic flannel externally the fur of the marten is indicated do not forget to procure a pair of health boots at messrs dall and crumbies and he has probably called you back even after you have paid your fee to add with stentorian emphasis i had forgotten one caution avoid kippered sturgeon as you would the very devil the unfortunate joseph was cut to the pattern of sir faraday in every button he was shod with the health boot his suit was of genuine ventilating cloth his shirt of hygienic flannel a somewhat dingy fabric and he was draped to the knees in the inevitable greatcoat of martens fur the very railway porters at bournemouth which was a favourite station of the doctors marked the old gentleman for a creature of sir faraday there was but one evidence of personal taste a vizarded foragecap from this form of headpiece since he had fled from a dying jackal on the plains of ephesus and weathered a bora in the adriatic nothing could divorce our traveller  the three finsburys mounted into their compartment and fell immediately to quarrelling a step unseemly in itself and in this case highly unfortunate for morris had he lingered a moment longer by the window this tale need never have been written for he might then have observed as the porters did not fail to do the arrival of a second passenger in the uniform of sir faraday bond but he had other matters on hand which he judged god knows how erroneously to be more important  i never heard of such a thing he cried resuming a discussion which had scarcely ceased all morning the bill is not yours it is mine  it is payable to me returned the old gentleman with an air of bitter obstinacy i will do what i please with my own property  the bill was one for eight hundred pounds which had been given him at breakfast to endorse and which he had simply pocketed  hear him johnny cried morris his property the very clothes upon his back belong to me  let him alone said john i am sick of both of you  that is no way to speak of your uncle sir cried joseph i will not endure this disrespect you are a pair of exceedingly forward impudent and ignorant young men and i have quite made up my mind to put an end to the whole business  o skittles said the graceful john  but morris was not so easy in his mind this unusual act of insubordination had already troubled him and these mutinous words now sounded ominously in his ears he looked at the old gentleman uneasily upon one occasion many years before when joseph was delivering a lecture the audience had revolted in a body finding their entertainer somewhat dry they had taken the question of amusement into their own hands and the lecturer along with the board schoolmaster the baptist clergyman and a workingmans candidate who made up his bodyguard was ultimately driven from the scene morris had not been present on that fatal day if he had he would have recognised a certain fighting glitter in his uncles eye and a certain chewing movement of his lips as old acquaintances but even to the inexpert these symptoms breathed of something dangerous  well well said morris i have no wish to bother you further till we get to london  joseph did not so much as look at him in answer with tremulous hands he produced a copy of the british mechanic and ostentatiously buried himself in its perusal  i wonder what can make him so cantankerous reflected the nephew i dont like the look of it at all and he dubiously scratched his nose  the train travelled forth into the world bearing along with it the customary freight of obliterated voyagers and along with these old joseph affecting immersion in his paper and john slumbering over the columns of the pink un and morris revolving in his mind a dozen grudges and suspicions and alarms it passed christ church by the sea herne with its pinewoods ringwood on its mazy river a little behind time but not much for the southwestern it drew up at the platform of a station in the midst of the new forest the real name of which in case the railway company might have the law of me i shall veil under the alias of browndean  many passengers put their heads to the window and among the rest an old gentleman on whom i willingly dwell for i am nearly done with him now and in the whole course of the present narrative i am not in the least likely to meet another character so decent his name is immaterial not so his habits he had passed his life wandering in a tweed suit on the continent of europe and years of galignanis messenger having at length undermined his eyesight he suddenly remembered the rivers of assyria and came to london to consult an oculist from the oculist to the dentist and from both to the physician the step appears inevitable presently he was in the hands of sir faraday robed in ventilating cloth and sent to bournemouth and to that domineering baronet who was his only friend upon his native soil he was now returning to report the case of these tweedsuited wanderers is unique we have all seen them entering the table dhôte at spezzia or grätz or venice with a genteel melancholy and a faint appearance of having been to india and not succeeded in the offices of many hundred hotels they are known by name and yet if the whole of this wandering cohort were to disappear tomorrow their absence would be wholly unremarked how much more if only onesay this one in the ventilating clothshould vanish he had paid his bills at bournemouth his worldly effects were all in the van in two portmanteaux and these after the proper interval would be sold as unclaimed baggage to a jew sir faradays butler would be a halfcrown poorer at the years end and the hotelkeepers of europe about the same date would be mourning a small but quite observable decline in profits and that would be literally all perhaps the old gentleman thought something of the sort for he looked melancholy enough as he pulled his bare grey head back into the carriage and the train smoked under the bridge and forth with ever quickening speed across the mingled heaths and woods of the new forest  not many hundred yards beyond browndean however a sudden jarring of brakes set everybodys teeth on edge and there was a brutal stoppage morris finsbury was aware of a confused uproar of voices and sprang to the window women were screaming men were tumbling from the windows on the track the guard was crying to them to stay where they were at the same time the train began to gather way and move very slowly backward toward browndean and the next moment all these various sounds were blotted out in the apocalyptic whistle and the thundering onslaught of the down express  the actual collision morris did not hear perhaps he fainted he had a wild dream of having seen the carriage double up and fall to pieces like a pantomime trick and sure enough when he came to himself he was lying on the bare earth and under the open sky his head ached savagely he carried his hand to his brow and was not surprised to see it red with blood the air was filled with an intolerable throbbing roar which he expected to find die away with the return of consciousness and instead of that it seemed but to swell the louder and to pierce the more cruelly through his ears it was a raging bellowing thunder like a boilerriveting factory  and now curiosity began to stir and he sat up and looked about him the track at this point ran in a sharp curve about a wooded hillock all of the near side was heaped with the wreckage of the bournemouth train that of the express was mostly hidden by the trees and just at the turn under clouds of vomiting steam and piled about with cairns of living coal lay what remained of the two engines one upon the other on the heathy margin of the line were many people running to and fro and crying aloud as they ran and many others lying motionless like sleeping tramps  morris suddenly drew an inference there has been an accident thought he and was elated at his perspicacity almost at the same time his eye lighted on john who lay close by as white as paper poor old john poor old cove he thought the schoolboy expression popping forth from some forgotten treasury and he took his brothers hand in his with childish tenderness it was perhaps the touch that recalled him at least john opened his eyes sat suddenly up and after several ineffectual movements of his lips whats the row said he in a phantom voice  the din of that devils smithy still thundered in their ears let us get away from that morris cried and pointed to the vomit of steam that still spouted from the broken engines and the pair helped each other up and stood and quaked and wavered and stared about them at the scene of death  just then they were approached by a party of men who had already organised themselves for the purposes of rescue  are you hurt cried one of these a young fellow with the sweat streaming down his pallid face and who by the way he was treated was evidently the doctor  morris shook his head and the young man nodding grimly handed him a bottle of some spirit  take a drink of that he said your friend looks as if he needed it badly we want every man we can get he added theres terrible work before us and nobody should shirk if you can do no more you can carry a stretcher  the doctor was hardly gone before morris under the spur of the dram awoke to the full possession of his wits  my god he cried uncle joseph  yes said john where can he be he cant be far off i hope the old party isnt damaged  come and help me to look said morris with a snap of savage determination strangely foreign to his ordinary bearing and then for one moment he broke forth if hes dead he cried and shook his fist at heaven  to and fro the brothers hurried staring in the faces of the wounded or turning the dead upon their backs they must have thus examined forty people and still there was no word of uncle joseph but now the course of their search brought them near the centre of the collision where the boilers were still blowing off steam with a deafening clamour it was a part of the field not yet gleaned by the rescuing party the ground especially on the margin of the wood was full of inequalitieshere a pit there a hillock surmounted with a bush of furze it was a place where many bodies might lie concealed and they beat it like pointers after game suddenly morris who was leading paused and reached forth his index with a tragic gesture john followed the direction of his brothers hand  in the bottom of a sandy hole lay something that had once been human the face had suffered severely and it was unrecognisable but that was not required the snowy hair the coat of marten the ventilating cloth the hygienic flanneleverything down to the health boots from messrs dall and crumbies identified the body as that of uncle joseph only the foragecap must have been lost in the convulsion for the dead man was bareheaded  the poor old beggar said john with a touch of natural feeling i would give ten pounds if we hadnt chivied him in the train  but there was no sentiment in the face of morris as he gazed upon the dead gnawing his nails with introverted eyes his brow marked with the stamp of tragic indignation and tragic intellectual effort he stood there silent here was a last injustice he had been robbed while he was an orphan at school he had been lashed to a decadent leather business he had been saddled with miss hazeltine his cousin had been defrauding him of the tontine and he had borne all this we might almost say with dignity and now they had gone and killed his uncle  here he said suddenly take his heels we must get him into the woods im not going to have anybody find this  o fudge said john wheres the use  do what i tell you spirted morris as he took the corpse by the shoulders am i to carry him myself  they were close upon the borders of the wood in ten or twelve paces they were under cover and a little farther back in a sandy clearing of the trees they laid their burthen down and stood and looked at it with loathing  what do you mean to do whispered john  bury him to be sure responded morris and he opened his pocketknife and began feverishly to dig  youll never make a hand of it with that objected the other  if you wont help me you cowardly shirk screamed morris you can go to the devil  its the childishest folly said john but no man shall call me a coward and he began to help his brother grudgingly  the soil was sandy and light but matted with the roots of the surrounding firs gorse tore their hands and as they baled the sand from the grave it was often discoloured with their blood an hour passed of unremitting energy upon the part of morris of lukewarm help on that of john and still the trench was barely nine inches in depth into this the body was rudely flung sand was piled upon it and then more sand must be dug and gorse had to be cut to pile on that and still from one end of the sordid mound a pair of feet projected and caught the light upon their patentleather toes but by this time the nerves of both were shaken even morris had enough of his grisly task and they skulked off like animals into the thickest of the neighbouring covert  its the best that we can do said morris sitting down  and now said john perhaps youll have the politeness to tell me what its all about  upon my word cried morris if you do not understand for yourself i almost despair of telling you  o of course its some rot about the tontine returned the other but its the merest nonsense weve lost it and theres an end  i tell you said morris uncle masterman is dead i know it theres a voice that tells me so  well and so is uncle joseph said john  hes not dead unless i choose returned morris  and come to that cried john if youre right and uncle mastermans been dead ever so long all we have to do is to tell the truth and expose michael  you seem to think michael is a fool sneered morris cant you understand hes been preparing this fraud for years he has the whole thing ready the nurse the doctor the undertaker all bought the certificate all ready but the date let him get wind of this business and you mark my words uncle masterman will die in two days and be buried in a week but see here johnny what michael can do i can do if he plays a game of bluff so can i if his father is to live for ever by god so shall my uncle  its illegal aint it said john  a man must have some moral courage replied morris with dignity  and then suppose youre wrong suppose uncle mastermans alive and kicking  well even then responded the plotter we are no worse off than we were before in fact were better uncle masterman must die some day as long as uncle joseph was alive he might have died any day but were out of all that trouble now theres no sort of limit to the game that i proposeit can be kept up till kingdom come  if i could only see how you meant to set about it sighed john but you know morris you always were such a bungler  id like to know what i ever bungled cried morris i have the best collection of signet rings in london  well you know theres the leather business suggested the other thats considered rather a hash  it was a mark of singular selfcontrol in morris that he suffered this to pass unchallenged and even unresented  about the business in hand said he once we can get him up to bloomsbury theres no sort of trouble we bury him in the cellar which seems made for it and then all i have to do is to start out and find a venal doctor  why cant we leave him where he is asked john  because we know nothing about the country retorted morris this wood may be a regular lovers walk turn your mind to the real difficulty how are we to get him up to bloomsbury  various schemes were mooted and rejected the railway station at browndean was of course out of the question for it would now be a centre of curiosity and gossip and of all things they would be least able to despatch a dead body without remark john feebly proposed getting an alecask and sending it as beer but the objections to this course were so overwhelming that morris scorned to answer the purchase of a packingcase seemed equally hopeless for why should two gentlemen without baggage of any kind require a packingcase they would be more likely to require clean linen  we are working on wrong lines cried morris at last the thing must be gone about more carefully suppose now he added excitedly speaking by fits and starts as if he were thinking aloud suppose we rent a cottage by the month a householder can buy a packingcase without remark then suppose we clear the people out today get the packingcase tonight and tomorrow i hire a carriageor a cart that we could drive ourselvesand take the box or whatever we get to ringwood or lyndhurst or somewhere we could label it specimens dont you see johnny i believe ive hit the nail at last  well it sounds more feasible admitted john  of course we must take assumed names continued morris it would never do to keep our own what do you say to masterman itself it sounds quiet and dignified  i will not take the name of masterman returned his brother you may if you like i shall call myself vancethe great vance positively the last six nights theres some go in a name like that  vance cried morris do you think we are playing a pantomime for our amusement there was never anybody named vance who wasnt a musichall singer  thats the beauty of it returned john it gives you some standing at once you may call yourself fortescue till alls blue and nobody cares but to be vance gives a man a natural nobility  but theres lots of other theatrical names cried morris leybourne irving brough toole  devil a one will i take returned his brother i am going to have my little lark out of this as well as you  very well said morris who perceived that john was determined to carry his point i shall be robert vance  and i shall be george vance cried john the only original george vance rally round the only original  repairing as well as they were able the disorder of their clothes finsbury brothers returned to browndean by a circuitous route in quest of luncheon and a suitable cottage it is not always easy to drop at a moments notice on a furnished residence in a retired locality but fortune presently introduced our adventurers to a deaf carpenter a man rich in cottages of the required description and unaffectedly eager to supply their wants the second place they visited standing as it did about a mile and a half from any neighbours caused them to exchange a glance of hope on a nearer view the place was not without depressing features it stood in a marshylooking hollow of a heath tall trees obscured its windows the thatch visibly rotted on the rafters and the walls were stained with splashes of unwholesome green the rooms were small the ceilings low the furniture merely nominal a strange chill and a haunting smell of damp pervaded the kitchen and the bedroom boasted only of one bed  morris with a view to cheapening the place remarked on this defect  well returned the man if you cant sleep two abed youd better take a villa residence  and then pursued morris theres no water how do you get your water  we fill that from the spring replied the carpenter pointing to a big barrel that stood beside the door the spring aint so very far off after all and its easy brought in buckets theres a bucket there  morris nudged his brother as they examined the waterbutt it was new and very solidly constructed for its office if anything had been wanting to decide them this eminently practical barrel would have turned the scale a bargain was promptly struck the months rent was paid upon the nail and about an hour later finsbury brothers might have been observed returning to the blighted cottage having along with them the key which was the symbol of their tenancy a spiritlamp with which they fondly told themselves they would be able to cook a pork pie of suitable dimensions and a quart of the worst whisky in hampshire nor was this all they had effected already under the plea that they were landscapepainters they had hired for dawn on the morrow a light but solid twowheeled cart so that when they entered in their new character they were able to tell themselves that the back of the business was already broken  john proceeded to get tea while morris foraging about the house was presently delighted by discovering the lid of the waterbutt upon the kitchen shelf here then was the packingcase complete in the absence of straw the blankets which he himself at least had not the smallest intention of using for their present purpose would exactly take the place of packing and morris as the difficulties began to vanish from his path rose almost to the brink of exultation there was however one difficulty not yet faced one upon which his whole scheme depended would john consent to remain alone in the cottage he had not yet dared to put the question  it was with high goodhumour that the pair sat down to the deal table and proceeded to fallto on the pork pie morris retailed the discovery of the lid and the great vance was pleased to applaud by beating on the table with his fork in true musichall style  thats the dodge he cried i always said a waterbutt was what you wanted for this business  of course said morris thinking this a favourable opportunity to prepare his brother of course you must stay on in this place till i give the word ill give out that uncle is resting in the new forest it would not do for both of us to appear in london we could never conceal the absence of the old man  johns jaw dropped  o come he cried you can stay in this hole yourself i wont  the colour came into morriss cheeks he saw that he must win his brother at any cost  you must please remember johnny he said the amount of the tontine if i succeed we shall have each fifty thousand to place to our bank account ay and nearer sixty  but if you fail returned john what then whatll be the colour of our bank account in that case  i will pay all expenses said morris with an inward struggle you shall lose nothing  well said john with a laugh if the exs are yours and halfprofits mine i dont mind remaining here for a couple of days  a couple of days cried morris who was beginning to get angry and controlled himself with difficulty why you would do more to win five pounds on a horserace  perhaps i would returned the great vance its the artistic temperament  this is monstrous burst out morris i take all risks i pay all expenses i divide profits and you wont take the slightest pains to help me its not decent its not honest its not even kind  but suppose objected john who was considerably impressed by his brothers vehemence suppose that uncle masterman is alive after all and lives ten years longer must i rot here all that time  of course not responded morris in a more conciliatory tone i only ask a month at the outside and if uncle masterman is not dead by that time you can go abroad  go abroad repeated john eagerly why shouldnt i go at once tell em that joseph and i are seeing life in paris  nonsense said morris  well but look here said john its this house its such a pigsty its so dreary and damp you said yourself that it was damp  only to the carpenter morris distinguished and that was to reduce the rent but really you know now were in it ive seen worse  and what am i to do complained the victim how can i entertain a friend  my dear johnny if you dont think the tontine worth a little trouble say so and ill give the business up  youre dead certain of the figures i suppose asked john wellwith a deep sighsend me the pink un and all the comic papers regularly ill face the music  as afternoon drew on the cottage breathed more thrillingly of its native marsh a creeping chill inhabited its chambers the fire smoked and a shower of rain coming up from the channel on a slant of wind tingled on the windowpanes at intervals when the gloom deepened toward despair morris would produce the whiskybottle and at first john welcomed the diversionnot for long it has been said this spirit was the worst in hampshire only those acquainted with the county can appreciate the force of that superlative and at length even the great vance who was no connoisseur waved the decoction from his lips the approach of dusk feebly combated with a single tallow candle added a touch of tragedy and john suddenly stopped whistling through his fingersan art to the practice of which he had been reducedand bitterly lamented his concessions  i cant stay here a month he cried no one could the things nonsense morris the parties that lived in the bastille would rise against a place like this  with an admirable affectation of indifference morris proposed a game of pitchandtoss to what will not the diplomatist condescend it was johns favourite game indeed his only gamehe had found all the rest too intellectualand he played it with equal skill and good fortune to morris himself on the other hand the whole business was detestable he was a bad pitcher he had no luck in tossing and he was one who suffered torments when he lost but john was in a dangerous humour and his brother was prepared for any sacrifice  by seven oclock morris with incredible agony had lost a couple of halfcrowns even with the tontine before his eyes this was as much as he could bear and remarking that he would take his revenge some other time he proposed a bit of supper and a grog  before they had made an end of this refreshment it was time to be at work a bucket of water for present necessities was withdrawn from the waterbutt which was then emptied and rolled before the kitchen fire to dry and the two brothers set forth on their adventure under a starless heaven     chapter iii  the lecturer at large   whether mankind is really partial to happiness is an open question not a month passes by but some cherished son runs off into the merchant service or some valued husband decamps to texas with a lady help clergymen have fled from their parishioners and even judges have been known to retire to an open mind it will appear upon the whole less strange that joseph finsbury should have been led to entertain ideas of escape his lot i think we may say was not a happy one my friend mr morris with whom i travel up twice or thrice a week from snaresbrook park is certainly a gentleman whom i esteem but he was scarce a model nephew as for john he is of course an excellent fellow but if he was the only link that bound one to a home i think the most of us would vote for foreign travel in the case of joseph john if he were a link at all was not the only one endearing bonds had long enchained the old gentleman to bloomsbury and by these expressions i do not in the least refer to julia hazeltine of whom however he was fond enough but to that collection of manuscript notebooks in which his life lay buried that he should ever have made up his mind to separate himself from these collections and go forth upon the world with no other resources than his memory supplied is a circumstance highly pathetic in itself and but little creditable to the wisdom of his nephews  the design or at least the temptation was already some months old and when a bill for eight hundred pounds payable to himself was suddenly placed in josephs hand it brought matters to an issue he retained that bill which to one of his frugality meant wealth and he promised himself to disappear among the crowds at waterloo or if that should prove impossible to slink out of the house in the course of the evening and melt like a dream into the millions of london by a peculiar interposition of providence and railway mismanagement he had not so long to wait  he was one of the first to come to himself and scramble to his feet after the browndean catastrophe and he had no sooner remarked his prostrate nephews than he understood his opportunity and fled a man of upwards of seventy who has just met with a railway accident and who is cumbered besides with the full uniform of sir faraday bond is not very likely to flee far but the wood was close at hand and offered the fugitive at least a temporary covert hither then the old gentleman skipped with extraordinary expedition and being somewhat winded and a good deal shaken here he lay down in a convenient grove and was presently overwhelmed by slumber the way of fate is often highly entertaining to the lookeron and it is certainly a pleasant circumstance that while morris and john were delving in the sand to conceal the body of a total stranger their uncle lay in dreamless sleep a few hundred yards deeper in the wood  he was awakened by the jolly note of a bugle from the neighbouring high road where a charàbanc was bowling by with some belated tourists the sound cheered his old heart it directed his steps into the bargain and soon he was on the highway looking east and west from under his vizor and doubtfully revolving what he ought to do a deliberate sound of wheels arose in the distance and then a cart was seen approaching well filled with parcels driven by a goodnatured looking man on a double bench and displaying on a board the legend i chandler carrier in the infamously prosaic mind of mr finsbury certain streaks of poetry survived and were still efficient they had carried him to asia minor as a giddy youth of forty and now in the first hours of his recovered freedom they suggested to him the idea of continuing his flight in mr chandlers cart it would be cheap properly broached it might even cost nothing and after years of mittens and hygienic flannel his heart leaped out to meet the notion of exposure  mr chandler was perhaps a little puzzled to find so old a gentleman so strangely clothed and begging for a lift on so retired a roadside but he was a goodnatured man glad to do a service and so he took the stranger up and he had his own idea of civility and so he asked no questions silence in fact was quite good enough for mr chandler but the cart had scarcely begun to move forward ere he found himself involved in a onesided conversation  i can see began mr finsbury by the mixture of parcels and boxes that are contained in your cart each marked with its individual label and by the good flemish mare you drive that you occupy the post of carrier in that great english system of transport which with all its defects is the pride of our country  yes sir returned mr chandler vaguely for he hardly knew what to reply them parcels posts has done us carriers a world of harm  i am not a prejudiced man continued joseph finsbury as a young man i travelled much nothing was too small or too obscure for me to acquire at sea i studied seamanship learned the complicated knots employed by mariners and acquired the technical terms at naples i would learn the art of making macaroni at nice the principles of making candied fruit i never went to the opera without first buying the book of the piece and making myself acquainted with the principal airs by picking them out on the piano with one finger  you must have seen a deal sir remarked the carrier touching up his horse i wish i could have had your advantages  do you know how often the word whip occurs in the old testament continued the old gentleman one hundred and if i remember exactly fortyseven times  do it indeed sir said mr chandler i never should have thought it  the bible contains three million five hundred and one thousand two hundred and fortynine letters of verses i believe there are upward of eighteen thousand there have been many editions of the bible wiclif was the first to introduce it into england about the year 1300 the paragraph bible as it is called is a wellknown edition and is so called because it is divided into paragraphs the breeches bible is another wellknown instance and gets its name either because it was printed by one breeches or because the place of publication bore that name  the carrier remarked drily that he thought that was only natural and turned his attention to the more congenial task of passing a cart of hay it was a matter of some difficulty for the road was narrow and there was a ditch on either hand  i perceive began mr finsbury when they had successfully passed the cart that you hold your reins with one hand you should employ two  well i like that cried the carrier contemptuously why  you do not understand continued mr finsbury what i tell you is a scientific fact and reposes on the theory of the lever a branch of mechanics there are some very interesting little shilling books upon the field of study which i should think a man in your station would take a pleasure to read but i am afraid you have not cultivated the art of observation at least we have now driven together for some time and i cannot remember that you have contributed a single fact this is a very false principle my good man for instance i do not know if you observed that as you passed the haycart man you took your left  of course i did cried the carrier who was now getting belligerent hed have the law on me if i hadnt  in france now resumed the old man and also i believe in the united states of america you would have taken the right  i would not cried mr chandler indignantly i would have taken the left  i observe again continued mr finsbury scorning to reply that you mend the dilapidated parts of your harness with string i have always protested against this carelessness and slovenliness of the english poor in an essay that i once read before an appreciative audience  it aint string said the carrier sullenly its packthread  i have always protested resumed the old man that in their private and domestic life as well as in their labouring career the lower classes of this country are improvident thriftless and extravagant a stitch in time  who the devil are the lower classes cried the carrier you are the lower classes yourself if i thought you were a blooming aristocrat i shouldnt have given you a lift  the words were uttered with undisguised illfeeling it was plain the pair were not congenial and further conversation even to one of mr finsburys pathetic loquacity was out of the question with an angry gesture he pulled down the brim of the foragecap over his eyes and producing a notebook and a blue pencil from one of his innermost pockets soon became absorbed in calculations  on his part the carrier fell to whistling with fresh zest and if now and again he glanced at the companion of his drive it was with mingled feelings of triumph and alarmtriumph because he had succeeded in arresting that prodigy of speech and alarm lest by any accident it should begin again even the shower which presently overtook and passed them was endured by both in silence and it was still in silence that they drove at length into southampton  dusk had fallen the shop windows glimmered forth into the streets of the old seaport in private houses lights were kindled for the evening meal and mr finsbury began to think complacently of his nights lodging he put his papers by cleared his throat and looked doubtfully at mr chandler  will you be civil enough said he to recommend me to an inn  mr chandler pondered for a moment  well he said at last i wonder how about the tregonwell arms  the tregonwell arms will do very well returned the old man if its clean and cheap and the people civil  i wasnt thinking so much of you returned mr chandler thoughtfully i was thinking of my friend watts as keeps the ouse hes a friend of mine you see and he helped me through my trouble last year and i was thinking would it be fairlike on watts to saddle him with an old party like you who might be the death of him with general information would it be fair to the ouse inquired mr chandler with an air of candid appeal  mark me cried the old gentleman with spirit it was kind in you to bring me here for nothing but it gives you no right to address me in such terms heres a shilling for your trouble and if you do not choose to set me down at the tregonwell arms i can find it for myself  chandler was surprised and a little startled muttering something apologetic he returned the shilling drove in silence through several intricate lanes and small streets drew up at length before the bright windows of an inn and called loudly for mr watts  is that you jem cried a hearty voice from the stableyard come in and warm yourself  i only stopped here mr chandler explained to let down an old gent that wants food and lodging mind i warn you agin him hes worse nor a temperance lecturer  mr finsbury dismounted with difficulty for he was cramped with his long drive and the shaking he had received in the accident the friendly mr watts in spite of the carters scarcely agreeable introduction treated the old gentleman with the utmost courtesy and led him into the back parlour where there was a big fire burning in the grate presently a table was spread in the same room and he was invited to seat himself before a stewed fowlsomewhat the worse for having seen service beforeand a big pewter mug of ale from the tap  he rose from supper a giant refreshed and changing his seat to one nearer the fire began to examine the other guests with an eye to the delights of oratory there were near a dozen present all men and as joseph exulted to perceive all working men often already had he seen cause to bless that appetite for disconnected fact and rotatory argument which is so marked a character of the mechanic but even an audience of working men has to be courted and there was no man more deeply versed in the necessary arts than joseph finsbury he placed his glasses on his nose drew from his pocket a bundle of papers and spread them before him on a table he crumpled them he smoothed them out now he skimmed them over apparently well pleased with their contents now with tapping pencil and contracted brows he seemed maturely to consider some particular statement a stealthy glance about the room assured him of the success of his manoeuvres all eyes were turned on the performer mouths were open pipes hung suspended the birds were charmed at the same moment the entrance of mr watts afforded him an opportunity  i observe said he addressing the landlord but taking at the same time the whole room into his confidence with an encouraging look i observe that some of these gentlemen are looking with curiosity in my direction and certainly it is unusual to see anyone immersed in literary and scientific labours in the public apartment of an inn i have here some calculations i made this morning upon the cost of living in this and other countriesa subject i need scarcely say highly interesting to the working classes i have calculated a scale of living for incomes of eighty one hundred and sixty two hundred and two hundred and forty pounds a year i must confess that the income of eighty pounds has somewhat baffled me and the others are not so exact as i could wish for the price of washing varies largely in foreign countries and the different cokes coals and firewoods fluctuate surprisingly i will read my researches and i hope you wont scruple to point out to me any little errors that i may have committed either from oversight or ignorance i will begin gentlemen with the income of eighty pounds a year  whereupon the old gentleman with less compassion than he would have had for brute beasts delivered himself of all his tedious calculations as he occasionally gave nine versions of a single income placing the imaginary person in london paris bagdad spitzbergen bassorah heligoland the scilly islands brighton cincinnati and nijninovgorod with an appropriate outfit for each locality it is no wonder that his hearers look back on that evening as the most tiresome they ever spent  long before mr finsbury had reached nijninovgorod with the income of one hundred and sixty pounds the company had dwindled and faded away to a few old topers and the bored but affable watts there was a constant stream of customers from the outer world but so soon as they were served they drank their liquor quickly and departed with the utmost celerity for the next publichouse  by the time the young man with two hundred a year was vegetating in the scilly islands mr watts was left alone with the economist and that imaginary person had scarce commenced life at brighton before the last of his pursuers desisted from the chase  mr finsbury slept soundly after the manifold fatigues of the day he rose late and after a good breakfast ordered the bill then it was that he made a discovery which has been made by many others both before and since that it is one thing to order your bill and another to discharge it the items were moderate and what does not always follow the total small but after the most sedulous review of all his pockets one and nine pence halfpenny appeared to be the total of the old gentlemans available assets he asked to see mr watts  here is a bill on london for eight hundred pounds said mr finsbury as that worthy appeared i am afraid unless you choose to discount it yourself it may detain me a day or two till i can get it cashed  mr watts looked at the bill turned it over and dogseared it with his fingers it will keep you a day or two he said repeating the old mans words you have no other money with you  some trifling change responded joseph nothing to speak of  then you can send it me i should be pleased to trust you  to tell the truth answered the old gentleman i am more than half inclined to stay i am in need of funds  if a loan of ten shillings would help you it is at your service responded watts with eagerness  no i think i would rather stay said the old man and get my bill discounted  you shall not stay in my house cried mr watts this is the last time you shall have a bed at the tregonwell arms  i insist upon remaining replied mr finsbury with spirit i remain by act of parliament turn me out if you dare  then pay your bill said mr watts  take that cried the old man tossing him the negotiable bill  it is not legal tender replied mr watts you must leave my house at once  you cannot appreciate the contempt i feel for you mr watts said the old gentleman resigning himself to circumstances but you shall feel it in one way i refuse to pay my bill  i dont care for your bill responded mr watts what i want is your absence  that you shall have said the old gentleman and taking up his foragecap as he spoke he crammed it on his head perhaps you are too insolent he added to inform me of the time of the next london train  it leaves in threequarters of an hour returned the innkeeper with alacrity you can easily catch it  josephs position was one of considerable weakness on the one hand it would have been well to avoid the direct line of railway since it was there he might expect his nephews to lie in wait for his recapture on the other it was highly desirable it was even strictly needful to get the bill discounted ere it should be stopped to london therefore he decided to proceed on the first train and there remained but one point to be considered how to pay his fare  josephs nails were never clean he ate almost entirely with his knife i doubt if you could say he had the manners of a gentleman but he had better than that a touch of genuine dignity was it from his stay in asia minor was it from a strain in the finsbury blood sometimes alluded to by customers at least when he presented himself before the stationmaster his salaam was truly oriental palmtrees appeared to crowd about the little office and the simoom or the bulbulbut i leave this image to persons better acquainted with the east his appearance besides was highly in his favour the uniform of sir faraday however inconvenient and conspicuous was at least a costume in which no swindler could have hoped to prosper and the exhibition of a valuable watch and a bill for eight hundred pounds completed what deportment had begun a quarter of an hour later when the train came up mr finsbury was introduced to the guard and installed in a firstclass compartment the stationmaster smilingly assuming all responsibility  as the old gentleman sat waiting the moment of departure he was the witness of an incident strangely connected with the fortunes of his house a packingcase of cyclopean bulk was borne along the platform by some dozen of tottering porters and ultimately to the delight of a considerable crowd hoisted on board the van it is often the cheering task of the historian to direct attention to the designs and if it may be reverently said the artifices of providence in the luggage van as joseph was borne out of the station of southampton east upon his way to london the egg of his romance lay so to speak unhatched the huge packingcase was directed to lie at waterloo till called for and addressed to one william dent pitman and the very next article a goodly barrel jammed into the corner of the van bore the superscription m finsbury 16 john street bloomsbury carriage paid  in this juxtaposition the train of powder was prepared and there was now wanting only an idle hand to fire it off     chapter iv  the magistrate in the luggage van   the city of winchester is famed for a cathedral a bishopbut he was unfortunately killed some years ago while ridinga public school a considerable assortment of the military and the deliberate passage of the trains of the london and southwestern line these and many similar associations would have doubtless crowded on the mind of joseph finsbury but his spirit had at that time flitted from the railway compartment to a heaven of populous lecturehalls and endless oratory his body in the meanwhile lay doubled on the cushions the foragecap rakishly tilted back after the fashion of those that lie in wait for nurserymaids the poor old face quiescent one arm clutching to his heart lloyds weekly newspaper  to him thus unconscious enter and exeunt again a pair of voyagers these two had saved the train and no more a tandem urged to its last speed an act of something closely bordering on brigandage at the ticket office and a spasm of running had brought them on the platform just as the engine uttered its departing snort there was but one carriage easily within their reach and they had sprung into it and the leader and elder already had his feet upon the floor when he observed mr finsbury  good god he cried uncle joseph thisll never do  and he backed out almost upsetting his companion and once more closed the door upon the sleeping patriarch  the next moment the pair had jumped into the baggage van  whats the row about your uncle joseph inquired the younger traveller mopping his brow does he object to smoking  i dont know that theres anything the row with him returned the other hes by no means the first comer my uncle joseph i can tell you very respectable old gentleman interested in leather been to asia minor no family no assetsand a tongue my dear wickham sharper than a serpents tooth  cantankerous old party eh suggested wickham  not in the least cried the other only a man with a solid talent for being a bore rather cheery i dare say on a desert island but on a railway journey insupportable you should hear him on tonti the ass that started tontines hes incredible on tonti  by jove cried wickham then youre one of these finsbury tontine fellows i hadnt a guess of that  ah said the other do you know that old boy in the carriage is worth a hundred thousand pounds to me there he was asleep and nobody there but you but i spared him because im a conservative in politics  mr wickham pleased to be in a luggage van was flitting to and fro like a gentlemanly butterfly  by jingo he cried heres something for you m finsbury 16 john street bloomsbury london m stands for michael you sly dog you keep two establishments do you  o thats morris responded michael from the other end of the van where he had found a comfortable seat upon some sacks hes a little cousin of mine i like him myself because hes afraid of me hes one of the ornaments of bloomsbury and has a collection of some kindbirds eggs or something thats supposed to be curious i bet its nothing to my clients  what a lark it would be to play billy with the labels chuckled mr wickham by george heres a tackhammer we might send all these things skipping about the premises like whatshisname  at this moment the guard surprised by the sound of voices opened the door of his little cabin  you had best step in here gentlemen said he when he had heard their story  wont you come wickham asked michael  catch mei want to travel in a van replied the youth  and so the door of communication was closed and for the rest of the run mr wickham was left alone over his diversions on the one side and on the other michael and the guard were closeted together in familiar talk  i can get you a compartment here sir observed the official as the train began to slacken speed before bishopstoke station you had best get out at my door and i can bring your friend  mr wickham whom we left as the reader has shrewdly suspected beginning to play billy with the labels in the van was a young gentleman of much wealth a pleasing but sandy exterior and a highly vacant mind not many months before he had contrived to get himself blackmailed by the family of a wallachian hospodar resident for political reasons in the gay city of paris a common friend to whom he had confided his distress recommended him to michael and the lawyer was no sooner in possession of the facts than he instantly assumed the offensive fell on the flank of the wallachian forces and in the inside of three days had the satisfaction to behold them routed and fleeing for the danube it is no business of ours to follow them on this retreat over which the police were so obliging as to preside paternally thus relieved from what he loved to refer to as the bulgarian atrocity mr wickham returned to london with the most unbounded and embarrassing gratitude and admiration for his saviour these sentiments were not repaid either in kind or degree indeed michael was a trifle ashamed of his new clients friendship it had taken many invitations to get him to winchester and wickham manor but he had gone at last and was now returning it has been remarked by some judicious thinker possibly jf smith that providence despises to employ no instrument however humble and it is now plain to the dullest that both mr wickham and the wallachian hospodar were liquid lead and wedges in the hand of destiny  smitten with the desire to shine in michaels eyes and show himself a person of original humour and resources the young gentleman who was a magistrate more by token in his native county was no sooner alone in the van than he fell upon the labels with all the zeal of a reformer and when he rejoined the lawyer at bishopstoke his face was flushed with his exertions and his cigar which he had suffered to go out was almost bitten in two  by george but this has been a lark he cried ive sent the wrong thing to everybody in england these cousins of yours have a packingcase as big as a house ive muddled the whole business up to that extent finsbury that if it were to get out its my belief we should get lynched  it was useless to be serious with mr wickham take care said michael i am getting tired of your perpetual scrapes my reputation is beginning to suffer  your reputation will be all gone before you finish with me replied his companion with a grin clap it in the bill my boy for total loss of reputation six and eightpence but continued mr wickham with more seriousness could i be bowled out of the commission for this little jest i know its small but i like to be a jp speaking as a professional man do you think theres any risk  what does it matter responded michael theyll chuck you out sooner or later somehow you dont give the effect of being a good magistrate  i only wish i was a solicitor retorted his companion instead of a poor devil of a country gentleman suppose we start one of those tontine affairs ourselves i to pay five hundred a year and you to guarantee me against every misfortune except illness or marriage  it strikes me remarked the lawyer with a meditative laugh as he lighted a cigar it strikes me that you must be a cursed nuisance in this world of ours  do you really think so finsbury responded the magistrate leaning back in his cushions delighted with the compliment yes i suppose i am a nuisance but mind you i have a stake in the country dont forget that dear boy     chapter v  mr gideon forsyth and the gigantic box   it has been mentioned that at bournemouth julia sometimes made acquaintances it is true she had but a glimpse of them before the doors of john street closed again upon its captives but the glimpse was sometimes exhilarating and the consequent regret was tempered with hope among those whom she had thus met a year before was a young barrister of the name of gideon forsyth  about three oclock of the eventful day when the magistrate tampered with the labels a somewhat moody and distempered ramble had carried mr forsyth to the corner of john street and about the same moment miss hazeltine was called to the door of no 16 by a thundering double knock  mr gideon forsyth was a happy enough young man he would have been happier if he had had more money and less uncle one hundred and twenty pounds a year was all his store but his uncle mr edward hugh bloomfield supplemented this with a handsome allowance and a great deal of advice couched in language that would probably have been judged intemperate on board a pirate ship mr bloomfield was indeed a figure quite peculiar to the days of mr gladstone what we may call for the lack of an accepted expression a squirradical having acquired years without experience he carried into the radical side of politics those noisy afterdinnertable passions which we are more accustomed to connect with toryism in its severe and senile aspects to the opinions of mr bradlaugh in fact he added the temper and the sympathies of that extinct animal the squire he admired pugilism he carried a formidable oaken staff he was a reverent churchman and it was hard to know which would have more volcanically stirred his cholera person who should have defended the established church or one who should have neglected to attend its celebrations he had besides some levelling catchwords justly dreaded in the family circle and when he could not go so far as to declare a step unenglish he might still and with hardly less effect denounce it as unpractical it was under the ban of this lesser excommunication that gideon had fallen his views on the study of law had been pronounced unpractical and it had been intimated to him in a vociferous interview punctuated with the oaken staff that he must either take a new start and get a brief or two or prepare to live on his own money  no wonder if gideon was moody he had not the slightest wish to modify his present habits but he would not stand on that since the recall of mr bloomfields allowance would revolutionise them still more radically he had not the least desire to acquaint himself with law he had looked into it already and it seemed not to repay attention but upon this also he was ready to give way in fact he would go as far as he could to meet the views of his uncle the squirradical but there was one part of the programme that appeared independent of his will how to get a brief there was the question and there was another and a worse suppose he got one should he prove the better man  suddenly he found his way barred by a crowd a garishly illuminated van was backed against the kerb from its open stern half resting on the street half supported by some glistening athletes the end of the largest packingcase in the county of middlesex might have been seen protruding while on the steps of the house the burly person of the driver and the slim figure of a young girl stood as upon a stage disputing  it is not for us the girl was saying i beg you to take it away it couldnt get into the house even if you managed to get it out of the van  i shall leave it on the pavement then and m finsbury can arrange with the vestry as he likes said the vanman  but i am not m finsbury expostulated the girl  it doesnt matter who you are said the vanman  you must allow me to help you miss hazeltine said gideon putting out his hand  julia gave a little cry of pleasure o mr forsyth she cried i am so glad to see you we must get this horrid thing which can only have come here by mistake into the house the man says well have to take off the door or knock two of our windows into one or be fined by the vestry or custom house or something for leaving our parcels on the pavement  the men by this time had successfully removed the box from the van had plumped it down on the pavement and now stood leaning against it or gazing at the door of no 16 in visible physical distress and mental embarrassment the windows of the whole street had filled as if by magic with interested and entertained spectators  with as thoughtful and scientific an expression as he could assume gideon measured the doorway with his cane while julia entered his observations in a drawingbook he then measured the box and upon comparing his data found that there was just enough space for it to enter next throwing off his coat and waistcoat he assisted the men to take the door from its hinges and lastly all bystanders being pressed into the service the packingcase mounted the steps upon some fifteen pairs of wavering legsscraped loudly grinding through the doorwayand was deposited at length with a formidable convulsion in the far end of the lobby which it almost blocked the artisans of this victory smiled upon each other as the dust subsided it was true they had smashed a bust of apollo and ploughed the wall into deep ruts but at least they were no longer one of the public spectacles of london  well sir said the vanman i never see such a job  gideon eloquently expressed his concurrence in this sentiment by pressing a couple of sovereigns in the mans hand  make it three sir and ill stand sam to everybody here cried the latter and this having been done the whole body of volunteer porters swarmed into the van which drove off in the direction of the nearest reliable publichouse gideon closed the door on their departure and turned to julia their eyes met the most uncontrollable mirth seized upon them both and they made the house ring with their laughter then curiosity awoke in julias mind and she went and examined the box and more especially the label  this is the strangest thing that ever happened she said with another burst of laughter it is certainly morriss handwriting and i had a letter from him only this morning telling me to expect a barrel is there a barrel coming too do you think mr forsyth  statuary with care fragile read gideon aloud from the painted warning on the box then you were told nothing about this  no responded julia o mr forsyth dont you think we might take a peep at it  yes indeed cited gideon just let me have a hammer  come down and ill show you where it is cried julia the shelf is too high for me to reach and opening the door of the kitchen stair she bade gideon follow her they found both the hammer and a chisel but gideon was surprised to see no sign of a servant he also discovered that miss hazeltine had a very pretty little foot and ankle and the discovery embarrassed him so much that he was glad to fall at once upon the packingcase  he worked hard and earnestly and dealt his blows with the precision of a blacksmith julia the while standing silently by his side and regarding rather the workman than the work he was a handsome fellow she told herself she had never seen such beautiful arms and suddenly as though he had overheard these thoughts gideon turned and smiled to her she too smiled and coloured and the double change became her so prettily that gideon forgot to turn away his eyes and swinging the hammer with a will discharged a smashing blow on his own knuckles with admirable presence of mind he crushed down an oath and substituted the harmless comment butter fingers but the pain was sharp his nerve was shaken and after an abortive trial he found he must desist from further operations  in a moment julia was off to the pantry in a moment she was back again with a basin of water and a sponge and had begun to bathe his wounded hand  i am dreadfully sorry said gideon apologetically if i had had any manners i should have opened the box first and smashed my hand afterward it feels much better he added i assure you it does  and now i think you are well enough to direct operations said she tell me what to do and ill be your workman  a very pretty workman said gideon rather forgetting himself she turned and looked at him with a suspicion of a frown and the indiscreet young man was glad to direct her attention to the packingcase the bulk of the work had been accomplished and presently julia had burst through the last barrier and disclosed a zone of straw in a moment they were kneeling side by side engaged like haymakers the next they were rewarded with a glimpse of something white and polished and the next again laid bare an unmistakable marble leg  he is surely a very athletic person said julia  i never saw anything like it responded gideon his muscles stand out like penny rolls  another leg was soon disclosed and then what seemed to be a third this resolved itself however into a knotted club resting upon a pedestal  it is a hercules cried gideon i might have guessed that from his calf im supposed to be rather partial to statuary but when it comes to hercules the police should interfere i should say he added glancing with disaffection at the swollen leg that this was about the biggest and the worst in europe what in heavens name can have induced him to come here  i suppose nobody else would have a gift of him said julia and for that matter i think we could have done without the monster very well  o dont say that returned gideon this has been one of the most amusing experiences of my life  i dont think youll forget it very soon said julia your hand will remind you  well i suppose i must be going said gideon reluctantly  no pleaded julia why should you stay and have tea with me  if i thought you really wished me to stay said gideon looking at his hat of course i should only be too delighted  what a silly person you must take me for returned the girl why of course i do and besides i want some cakes for tea and ive nobody to send here is the latchkey  gideon put on his hat with alacrity and casting one look at miss hazeltine and another at the legs of hercules threw open the door and departed on his errand  he returned with a large bag of the choicest and most tempting of cakes and tartlets and found julia in the act of spreading a small teatable in the lobby  the rooms are all in such a state she cried that i thought we should be more cosy and comfortable in our own lobby and under our own vine and statuary  ever so much better cried gideon delightedly  o what adorable cream tarts said julia opening the bag and the dearest little cherry tartlets with all the cherries spilled out into the cream  yes said gideon concealing his dismay i knew they would mix beautifully the woman behind the counter told me so  now said julia as they began their little festival i am going to show you morriss letter read it aloud please perhaps theres something i have missed  gideon took the letter and spreading it out on his knee read as follows     dear juliai write you from browndean where we are stopping over    for a few days uncle was much shaken in that dreadful accident of    which i dare say you have seen the account tomorrow i leave him    here with john and come up alone but before that you will have    received a barrel containing specimens for a friend do not open it    on any account but leave it in the lobby till i come      yours in haste      m finsbury     psbe sure and leave the barrel in the lobby  no said gideon there seems to be nothing about the monument and he nodded as he spoke at the marble legs miss hazeltine he continued would you mind me asking a few questions  certainly not replied julia and if you can make me understand why morris has sent a statue of hercules instead of a barrel containing specimens for a friend i shall be grateful till my dying day and what are specimens for a friend  i havent a guess said gideon specimens are usually bits of stone but rather smaller than our friend the monument still that is not the point are you quite alone in this big house  yes i am at present returned julia i came up before them to prepare the house and get another servant but i couldnt get one i liked  then you are utterly alone said gideon in amazement are you not afraid  no responded julia stoutly i dont see why i should be more afraid than you would be i am weaker of course but when i found i must sleep alone in the house i bought a revolver wonderfully cheap and made the man show me how to use it  and how do you use it demanded gideon much amused at her courage  why said she with a smile you pull the little trigger thing on top and then pointing it very low for it springs up as you fire you pull the underneath little trigger thing and it goes off as well as if a man had done it  and how often have you used it asked gideon  o i have not used it yet said the determined young lady but i know how and that makes me wonderfully courageous especially when i barricade my door with a chest of drawers  im awfully glad they are coming back soon said gideon this business strikes me as excessively unsafe if it goes on much longer i could provide you with a maiden aunt of mine or my landlady if you preferred  lend me an aunt cried julia o what generosity i begin to think it must have been you that sent the hercules  believe me cried the young man i admire you too much to send you such an infamous work of art  julia was beginning to reply when they were both startled by a knocking at the door  o mr forsyth  dont be afraid my dear girl said gideon laying his hand tenderly on her arm  i know its the police she whispered they are coming to complain about the statue  the knock was repeated it was louder than before and more impatient  its morris cried julia in a startled voice and she ran to the door and opened it  it was indeed morris that stood before them not the morris of ordinary days but a wildlooking fellow pale and haggard with bloodshot eyes and a twodays beard upon his chin  the barrel he cried wheres the barrel that came this morning and he stared about the lobby his eyes as they fell upon the legs of hercules literally goggling in his head what is that he screamed what is that waxwork speak you fool what is that and wheres the barrelthe waterbutt  no barrel came morris responded julia coldly this is the only thing that has arrived  this shrieked the miserable man i never heard of it  it came addressed in your hand replied julia we had nearly to pull the house down to get it in that is all that i can tell you  morris gazed at her in utter bewilderment he passed his hand over his forehead he leaned against the wall like a man about to faint then his tongue was loosed and he overwhelmed the girl with torrents of abuse such fire such directness such a choice of ungentlemanly language none had ever before suspected morris to possess and the girl trembled and shrank before his fury  you shall not speak to miss hazeltine in that way said gideon sternly it is what i will not suffer  i shall speak to the girl as i like returned morris with a fresh outburst of anger ill speak to the hussy as she deserves  not a word more sir not one word cried gideon miss hazeltine he continued addressing the young girl you cannot stay a moment longer in the same house with this unmanly fellow here is my arm let me take you where you will be secure from insult  mr forsyth returned julia you are right i cannot stay here longer and i am sure i trust myself to an honourable gentleman  pale and resolute gideon offered her his arm and the pair descended the steps followed by morris clamouring for the latchkey  julia had scarcely handed the key to morris before an empty hansom drove smartly into john street it was hailed by both men and as the cabman drew up his restive horse morris made a dash into the vehicle  sixpence above fare he cried recklessly waterloo station for your life sixpence for yourself  make it a shilling guvner said the man with a grin the other parties were first  a shilling then cried morris with the inward reflection that he would reconsider it at waterloo the man whipped up his horse and the hansom vanished from john street     chapter vi  the tribulations of morris part the first   as the hansom span through the streets of london morris sought to rally the forces of his mind the waterbutt with the dead body had miscarried and it was essential to recover it so much was clear and if by some blest good fortune it was still at the station all might be well if it had been sent out however if it were already in the hands of some wrong person matters looked more ominous people who receive unexplained packages are usually keen to have them open the example of miss hazeltine whom he cursed again was there to remind him of the circumstance and if anyone had opened the waterbutto lord cried morris at the thought and carried his hand to his damp forehead the private conception of any breach of law is apt to be inspiriting for the scheme while yet inchoate wears dashing and attractive colours not so in the least that part of the criminals later reflections which deal with the police that useful corps as morris now began to think had scarce been kept sufficiently in view when he embarked upon his enterprise i must play devilish close he reflected and he was aware of an exquisite thrill of fear in the region of the spine  main line or loop inquired the cabman through the scuttle  main line replied morris and mentally decided that the man should have his shilling after all it would be madness to attract attention thought he but what this thing will cost me first and last begins to be a nightmare  he passed through the bookingoffice and wandered disconsolately on the platform it was a breathingspace in the days traffic there were few people there and these for the most part quiescent on the benches morris seemed to attract no remark which was a good thing but on the other hand he was making no progress in his quest something must be done something must be risked every passing instant only added to his dangers summoning all his courage he stopped a porter and asked him if he remembered receiving a barrel by the morning train he was anxious to get information for the barrel belonged to a friend it is a matter of some moment he added for it contains specimens  i was not here this morning sir responded the porter somewhat reluctantly but ill ask bill do you recollect bill to have got a barrel from bournemouth this morning containing specimens  i dont know about specimens replied bill but the party as received the barrel i mean raised a sight of trouble  whats that cried morris in the agitation of the moment pressing a penny into the mans hand  you see sir the barrel arrived at onethirty no one claimed it till about three when a small sicklylooking gentleman probably a curate came up and sez he have you got anything for pitman or willm bent pitman if i recollect right i dont exactly know sez i but i rather fancy that there barrel bears that name the little man went up to the barrel and seemed regularly all took aback when he saw the address and then he pitched into us for not having brought what he wanted i dont care a damn what you want sez i to him but if you are willm bent pitman theres your barrel  well and did he take it cried the breathless morris  well sir returned bill it appears it was a packingcase he was after the packingcase came thats sure enough because it was about the biggest packingcase ever i clapped eyes on and this pitman he seemed a good deal cut up and he had the superintendent out and they got hold of the vanmanhim as took the packingcase well sir continued bill with a smile i never see a man in such a state everybody about that van was mortal bar the horses some genleman as well as i could make out had given the vanman a sov and so that was where the trouble come in you see  but what did he say gasped morris  i dont know as he said much sir said bill but he offered to fight this pitman for a pot of beer he had lost his book too and the receipts and his men were all as mortal as himself o they were all likeand bill paused for a similelike lords the superintendent sacked them on the spot  o come but thats not so bad said morris with a bursting sigh he couldnt tell where he took the packingcase then  not he said bill nor yet nothink else  and whatwhat did pitman do asked morris  o he went off with the barrel in a fourwheeler very trembling like replied bill i dont believe hes a gentleman as has good health  well so the barrels gone said morris half to himself  you may depend on that sir returned the porter but you had better see the superintendent  not in the least its of no account said morris it only contained specimens and he walked hastily away  ensconced once more in a hansom he proceeded to reconsider his position suppose he thought suppose he should accept defeat and declare his uncles death at once he should lose the tontine and with that the last hope of his seven thousand eight hundred pounds but on the other hand since the shilling to the hansom cabman he had begun to see that crime was expensive in its course and since the loss of the waterbutt that it was uncertain in its consequences quietly at first and then with growing heat he reviewed the advantages of backing out it involved a loss but come to think of it no such great loss after all only that of the tontine which had been always a tossup which at bottom he had never really expected he reminded himself of that eagerly he congratulated himself upon his constant moderation he had never really expected the tontine he had never even very definitely hoped to recover his seven thousand eight hundred pounds he had been hurried into the whole thing by michaels obvious dishonesty yes it would probably be better to draw back from this highflying venture settle back on the leather business  great god cried morris bounding in the hansom like a jackinabox i have not only not gained the tontinei have lost the leather business  such was the monstrous fact he had no power to sign he could not draw a cheque for thirty shillings until he could produce legal evidence of his uncles death he was a penniless outcastand as soon as he produced it he had lost the tontine there was no hesitation on the part of morris to drop the tontine like a hot chestnut to concentrate all his forces on the leather business and the rest of his small but legitimate inheritance was the decision of a single instant and the next the full extent of his calamity was suddenly disclosed to him declare his uncles death he couldnt since the body was lost joseph had in a legal sense become immortal  there was no created vehicle big enough to contain morris and his woes he paid the hansom off and walked on he knew not whither  i seem to have gone into this business with too much precipitation he reflected with a deadly sigh i fear it seems too ramified for a person of my powers of mind  and then a remark of his uncles flashed into his memory if you want to think clearly put it all down on paper well the old boy knew a thing or two said morris i will try but i dont believe the paper was ever made that will clear my mind  he entered a place of public entertainment ordered bread and cheese and writing materials and sat down before them heavily he tried the pen it was an excellent pen but what was he to write i have it cried morris robinson crusoe and the double columns he prepared his paper after that classic model and began as follows                   bad                            good    1 i have lost my uncles body   1 but then pitman has found it   stop a bit said morris i am letting the spirit of antithesis run away with me lets start again                   bad                             good    1 i have lost my uncles body    1 but then i no longer require                                           to bury it    2 i have lost the tontine        2 but i may still save that if                                           pitman disposes of the                                           body and if i can find a                                           physician who will stick at                                           nothing    3 i have lost the leather         3 but not if pitman gives the        business and the rest of           body up to the police        my uncles succession  o but in that case i go to gaol i had forgot that thought morris indeed i dont know that i had better dwell on that hypothesis at all its all very well to talk of facing the worst but in a case of this kind a mans first duty is to his own nerve is there any answer to no 3 is there any possible good side to such a beastly bungle there must be of course or where would be the use of this doubleentry business andby george i have it he exclaimed its exactly the same as the last and he hastily rewrote the passage                   bad                             good    3 i have lost the leather         3 but not if i can find a physician        business and the rest of           who will stick at nothing        my uncles succession  this venal doctor seems quite a desideratum he reflected i want him first to give me a certificate that my uncle is dead so that i may get the leather business and then that hes alivebut here we are again at the incompatible interests and he returned to his tabulation                   bad                             good    4 i have almost no money         4 but there is plenty in the bank    5 yes but i cant get the        5 butwell that seems unhappily        money in the bank                 to be the case    6 i have left the bill for        6 but if pitman is only a dishonest        eighthundred pounds in             man the presence of this bill        uncle josephs pocket             may lead him to keep the whole                                           thing dark and throw the body                                           into the new cut    7 yes but if pitman is           7 yes but if i am right about        dishonest and finds the            uncle masterman i can blackmail        bill he will know who             michael        joseph is and he may        blackmail me    8 but i cant blackmail michael   8 worse luck        which is besides a very        dangerous thing to do        until i find out    9 the leather business will soon  9 but the leather business is a        want money for current             sinking ship        expenses and i have none        to give   10 yes but its all the ship i   10 a fact        have   11 john will soon want money     11        and i have none to give   12 and the venal doctor will      12        want money down   13 and if pitman is dishonest     13        and dont send me to gaol        he will want a fortune  o this seems to be a very onesided business exclaimed morris theres not so much in this method as i was led to think he crumpled the paper up and threw it down and then the next moment picked it up again and ran it over it seems its on the financial point that my position is weakest he reflected is there positively no way of raising the wind in a vast city like this and surrounded by all the resources of civilisation it seems not to be conceived let us have no more precipitation is there nothing i can sell my collection of signet but at the thought of scattering these loved treasures the blood leaped into morriss cheek i would rather die he exclaimed and cramming his hat upon his head strode forth into the streets  i must raise funds he thought my uncle being dead the money in the bank is mine or would be mine but for the cursed injustice that has pursued me ever since i was an orphan in a commercial academy i know what any other man would do any other man in christendom would forge although i dont know why i call it forging either when josephs dead and the funds are my own when i think of that when i think that my uncle is really as dead as mutton and that i cant prove it my gorge rises at the injustice of the whole affair i used to feel bitterly about that seven thousand eight hundred pounds it seems a trifle now dear me why the day before yesterday i was comparatively happy  and morris stood on the sidewalk and heaved another sobbing sigh  then theres another thing he resumed can i am i able why didnt i practise different handwritings while i was young how a fellow regrets those lost opportunities when he grows up but theres one comfort its not morally wrong i can try it on with a clear conscience and even if i was found out i wouldnt greatly caremorally i mean and then if i succeed and if pitman is staunchtheres nothing to do but find a venal doctor and that ought to be simple enough in a place like london by all accounts the towns alive with them it wouldnt do of course to advertise for a corrupt physician that would be impolitic no i suppose a fellow has simply to spot along the streets for a red lamp and herbs in the window and then you go in andandand put it to him plainly though it seems a delicate step  he was near home now after many devious wanderings and turned up john street as he thrust his latchkey in the lock another mortifying reflection struck him to the heart  not even this house is mine till i can prove him dead he snarled and slammed the door behind him so that the windows in the attic rattled  night had long fallen long ago the lamps and the shopfronts had begun to glitter down the endless streets the lobby was pitchdark and as the devil would have it morris barked his shins and sprawled all his length over the pedestal of hercules the pain was sharp his temper was already thoroughly undermined by a last misfortune his hand closed on the hammer as he fell and in a spasm of childish irritation he turned and struck at the offending statue there was a splintering crash  o lord what have i done next wailed morris and he groped his way to find a candle yes he reflected as he stood with the light in his hand and looked upon the mutilated leg from which about a pound of muscle was detached yes i have destroyed a genuine antique i may be in for thousands and then there sprung up in his bosom a sort of angry hope let me see he thought julias got rid of theres nothing to connect me with that beast forsyth the men were all drunk and whats better theyve been all discharged o come i think this is another case of moral courage ill deny all knowledge of the thing  a moment more and he stood again before the hercules his lips sternly compressed the coalaxe and the meatcleaver under his arm the next he had fallen upon the packingcase this had been already seriously undermined by the operations of gideon a few welldirected blows and it already quaked and gaped yet a few more and it fell about morris in a shower of boards followed by an avalanche of straw  and now the leathermerchant could behold the nature of his task and at the first sight his spirit quailed it was indeed no more ambitious a task for de lesseps with all his men and horses to attack the hills of panama than for a single slim young gentleman with no previous experience of labour in a quarry to measure himself against that bloated monster on his pedestal and yet the pair were well encountered on the one side bulkon the other genuine heroic fire  down you shall come you great big ugly brute cried morris aloud with something of that passion which swept the parisian mob against the walls of the bastille down you shall come this night ill have none of you in my lobby  the face from its indecent expression had particularly animated the zeal of our iconoclast and it was against the face that he began his operations the great height of the demigodfor he stood a fathom and half in his stockingfeetoffered a preliminary obstacle to this attack but here in the first skirmish of the battle intellect already began to triumph over matter by means of a pair of library steps the injured householder gained a posture of advantage and with great swipes of the coalaxe proceeded to decapitate the brute  two hours later what had been the erect image of a gigantic coalporter turned miraculously white was now no more than a medley of disjected members the quadragenarian torso prone against the pedestal the lascivious countenance leering down the kitchen stair the legs the arms the hands and even the fingers scattered broadcast on the lobby floor half an hour more and all the débris had been laboriously carted to the kitchen and morris with a gentle sentiment of triumph looked round upon the scene of his achievements yes he could deny all knowledge of it now the lobby beyond the fact that it was partly ruinous betrayed no trace of the passage of hercules but it was a weary morris that crept up to bed his arms and shoulders ached the palms of his hands burned from the rough kisses of the coalaxe and there was one smarting finger that stole continually to his mouth sleep long delayed to visit the dilapidated hero and with the first peep of day it had again deserted him  the morning as though to accord with his disastrous fortunes dawned inclemently an easterly gale was shouting in the streets flaws of rain angrily assailed the windows and as morris dressed the draught from the fireplace vividly played about his legs  i think he could not help observing bitterly that with all i have to bear they might have given me decent weather  there was no bread in the house for miss hazeltine like all women left to themselves had subsisted entirely upon cake but some of this was found and along with what the poets call a glass of fair cold water made up a semblance of a morning meal and then down he sat undauntedly to his delicate task  nothing can be more interesting than the study of signatures written as they are before meals and after during indigestion and intoxication written when the signer is trembling for the life of his child or has come from winning the derby in his lawyers office or under the bright eyes of his sweetheart to the vulgar these seem never the same but to the expert the bank clerk or the lithographer they are constant quantities and as recognisable as the north star to the nightwatch on deck  to all this morris was alive in the theory of that graceful art in which he was now embarking our spirited leathermerchant was beyond all reproach but happily for the investor forgery is an affair of practice and as morris sat surrounded by examples of his uncles signature and of his own incompetence insidious depression stole upon his spirits from time to time the wind wuthered in the chimney at his back from time to time there swept over bloomsbury a squall so dark that he must rise and light the gas about him was the chill and the mean disorder of a house out of commissionthe floor bare the sofa heaped with books and accounts enveloped in a dirty tablecloth the pens rusted the paper glazed with a thick film of dust and yet these were but adminicles of misery and the true root of his depression lay round him on the table in the shape of misbegotten forgeries  its one of the strangest things i ever heard of he complained it almost seems as if it was a talent that i didnt possess he went once more minutely through his proofs a clerk would simply gibe at them said he well theres nothing else but tracing possible  he waited till a squall had passed and there came a blink of scowling daylight then he went to the window and in the face of all john street traced his uncles signature it was a poor thing at the best but it must do said he as he stood gazing woefully on his handiwork hes dead anyway and he filled up the cheque for a couple of hundred and sallied forth for the anglopatagonian bank  there at the desk at which he was accustomed to transact business and with as much indifference as he could assume morris presented the forged cheque to the big redbearded scots teller the teller seemed to view it with surprise and as he turned it this way and that and even scrutinised the signature with a magnifyingglass his surprise appeared to warm into disfavour begging to be excused for a moment he passed away into the rearmost quarters of the bank whence after an appreciable interval he returned again in earnest talk with a superior an oldish and a baldish but a very gentlemanly man  mr morris finsbury i believe said the gentlemanly man fixing morris with a pair of double eyeglasses  that is my name said morris quavering is there anything wrong  well the fact is mr finsbury you see we are rather surprised at receiving this said the other flicking at the cheque there are no effects  no effects cried morris why i know myself there must be eightandtwenty hundred pounds if theres a penny  two seven six four i think replied the gentlemanly man but it was drawn yesterday  drawn cried morris  by your uncle himself sir continued the other not only that but we discounted a bill for him forlet me seehow much was it for mr bell  eight hundred mr judkin replied the teller  dent pitman cried morris staggering back  i beg your pardon said mr judkin  itsits only an expletive said morris  i hope theres nothing wrong mr finsbury said mr bell  all i can tell you said morris with a harsh laugh is that the whole things impossible my uncle is at bournemouth unable to move  really cried mr bell and he recovered the cheque from mr judkin but this cheque is dated in london and today he observed how dye account for that sir  o that was a mistake said morris and a deep tide of colour dyed his face and neck  no doubt no doubt said mr judkin but he looked at his customer inquiringly  andand resumed morris even if there were no effectsthis is a very trifling sum to overdrawour firmthe name of finsbury is surely good enough for such a wretched sum as this  no doubt mr finsbury returned mr judkin and if you insist i will take it into consideration but i hardly thinkin short mr finsbury if there had been nothing else the signature seems hardly all that we could wish  thats of no consequence replied morris nervously ill get my uncle to sign another the fact is he went on with a bold stroke my uncle is so far from well at present that he was unable to sign this cheque without assistance and i fear that my holding the pen for him may have made the difference in the signature  mr judkin shot a keen glance into morriss face and then turned and looked at mr bell  well he said it seems as if we had been victimised by a swindler pray tell mr finsbury we shall put detectives on at once as for this cheque of yours i regret that owing to the way it was signed the bank can hardly consider itwhat shall i saybusinesslike and he returned the cheque across the counter  morris took it up mechanically he was thinking of something very different  in a case of this kind he began i believe the loss falls on us i mean upon my uncle and myself  it does not sir replied mr bell the bank is responsible and the bank will either recover the money or refund it you may depend on that  morriss face fell then it was visited by another gleam of hope  ill tell you what he said you leave this entirely in my hands ill sift the matter ive an idea at any rate and detectives he added appealingly are so expensive  the bank would not hear of it returned mr judkin the bank stands to lose between three and four thousand pounds it will spend as much more if necessary an undiscovered forger is a permanent danger we shall clear it up to the bottom mr finsbury set your mind at rest on that  then ill stand the loss said morris boldly i order you to abandon the search he was determined that no inquiry should be made  i beg your pardon returned mr judkin but we have nothing to do with you in this matter which is one between your uncle and ourselves if he should take this opinion and will either come here himself or let me see him in his sickroom  quite impossible cried morris  well then you see said mr judkin how my hands are tied the whole affair must go at once into the hands of the police  morris mechanically folded the cheque and restored it to his pocketbook  goodmorning said he and scrambled somehow out of the bank  i dont know what they suspect he reflected i cant make them out their whole behaviour is thoroughly unbusinesslike but it doesnt matter alls up with everything the money has been paid the police are on the scent in two hours that idiot pitman will be nabbedand the whole story of the dead body in the evening papers  if he could have heard what passed in the bank after his departure he would have been less alarmed perhaps more mortified  that was a curious affair mr bell said mr judkin  yes sir said mr bell but i think we have given him a fright  o we shall hear no more of mr morris finsbury returned the other it was a first attempt and the house have dealt with us so long that i was anxious to deal gently but i suppose mr bell there can be no mistake about yesterday it was old mr finsbury himself  there could be no possible doubt of that said mr bell with a chuckle he explained to me the principles of banking  well well said mr judkin the next time he calls ask him to step into my room it is only proper he should be warned     chapter vii  in which william dent pitman takes legal advice   norfolk street kings roadjocularly known among mr pitmans lodgers as norfolk islandis neither a long a handsome nor a pleasing thoroughfare dirty undersized maidsofallwork issue from it in pursuit of beer or linger on its sidewalk listening to the voice of love the catsmeat man passes twice a day an occasional organgrinder wanders in and wanders out again disgusted in holidaytime the street is the arena of the young bloods of the neighbourhood and the householders have an opportunity of studying the manly art of selfdefence and yet norfolk street has one claim to be respectable for it contains not a single shopunless you count the publichouse at the corner which is really in the kings road  the door of no 7 bore a brass plate inscribed with the legend wd pitman artist it was not a particularly clean brass plate nor was no 7 itself a particularly inviting place of residence and yet it had a character of its own such as may well quicken the pulse of the readers curiosity for here was the home of an artistand a distinguished artist too highly distinguished by his illsuccesswhich had never been made the subject of an article in the illustrated magazines no woodengraver had ever reproduced a corner in the back drawingroom or the studio mantelpiece of no 7 no young lady author had ever commented on the unaffected simplicity with which mr pitman received her in the midst of his treasures it is an omission i would gladly supply but our business is only with the backward parts and abject rear of this æsthetic dwelling  here was a garden boasting a dwarf fountain that never played in the centre a few grimylooking flowers in pots two or three newlyplanted trees which the spring of chelsea visited without noticeable consequence and two or three statues after the antique representing satyrs and nymphs in the worst possible style of sculptured art on one side the garden was overshadowed by a pair of crazy studios usually hired out to the more obscure and youthful practitioners of british art opposite these another lofty outbuilding somewhat more carefully finished and boasting of a communication with the house and a private door on the back lane enshrined the multifarious industry of mr pitman all day it is true he was engaged in the work of education at a seminary for young ladies but the evenings at least were his own and these he would prolong far into the night now dashing off a landscape with waterfall in oil now a volunteer bust in marble as he would gently but proudly observe of some public character now stooping his chisel to a mere nymph for a gasbracket on a stair sir  or a lifesize infant samuel for a religious nursery mr pitman had studied in paris and he had studied in rome supplied with funds by a fond parent who went subsequently bankrupt in consequence of a fall in corsets and though he was never thought to have the smallest modicum of talent it was at one time supposed that he had learned his business eighteen years of what is called tuition had relieved him of the dangerous knowledge his artist lodgers would sometimes reason with him they would point out to him how impossible it was to paint by gaslight or to sculpture lifesized nymphs without a model  i know that he would reply no one in norfolk street knows it better and if i were rich i should certainly employ the best models in london but being poor i have taught myself to do without them an occasional model would only disturb my ideal conception of the figure and be a positive impediment in my career as for painting by an artificial light he would continue that is simply a knack i have found it necessary to acquire my days being engrossed in the work of tuition  at the moment when we must present him to our readers pitman was in his studio alone by the dying light of the october day he sat sure enough with unaffected simplicity in a windsor chair his lowcrowned black felt hat by his side a dark weak harmless pathetic little man clad in the hue of mourning his coat longer than is usual with the laity his neck enclosed in a collar without a parting his neckcloth pale in hue and simply tied the whole outward man except for a pointed beard tentatively clerical there was a thinning on the top of pitmans head there were silver hairs at pitmans temple poor gentleman he was no longer young and years and poverty and humble ambition thwarted make a cheerless lot  in front of him in the corner by the door there stood a portly barrel and let him turn them where he might it was always to the barrel that his eyes and his thoughts returned  should i open it should i return it should i communicate with mr semitopolis at once he wondered no he concluded finally nothing without mr finsburys advice and he arose and produced a shabby leathern desk it opened without the formality of unlocking and displayed the thick creamcoloured notepaper on which mr pitman was in the habit of communicating with the proprietors of schools and the parents of his pupils he placed the desk on the table by the window and taking a saucer of indian ink from the chimneypiece laboriously composed the following letter  my dear mr finsbury it ran would it be presuming on your kindness if i asked you to pay me a visit here this evening it is in no trifling matter that i invoke your valuable assistance for need i say more than it concerns the welfare of mr semitopoliss statue of hercules i write you in great agitation of mind for i have made all inquiries and greatly fear that this work of ancient art has been mislaid i labour besides under another perplexity not unconnected with the first pray excuse the inelegance of this scrawl and believe me yours in haste william d pitman  armed with this he set forth and rang the bell of no 233 kings road the private residence of michael finsbury he had met the lawyer at a time of great public excitement in chelsea michael who had a sense of humour and a great deal of careless kindness in his nature followed the acquaintance up and having come to laugh remained to drop into a contemptuous kind of friendship by this time which was four years after the first meeting pitman was the lawyers dog  no said the elderly housekeeper who opened the door in person mr michaels not in yet but yere looking terribly poorly mr pitman take a glass of sherry sir to cheer ye up  no i thank you maam replied the artist it is very good in you but i scarcely feel in sufficient spirits for sherry just give mr finsbury this note and ask him to look roundto the door in the lane you will please tell him i shall be in the studio all evening  and he turned again into the street and walked slowly homeward a hairdressers window caught his attention and he stared long and earnestly at the proud highborn waxen lady in evening dress who circulated in the centre of the show the artist woke in him in spite of his troubles  it is all very well to run down the men who make these things he cried but theres a somethingtheres a haughty indefinable something about that figure its what i tried for in my empress eugénie he added with a sigh  and he went home reflecting on the quality they dont teach you that direct appeal in paris he thought its british come i am going to sleep i must wake up i must aim higheraim higher cried the little artist to himself all through his tea and afterward as he was giving his eldest boy a lesson on the fiddle his mind dwelt no longer on his troubles but he was rapt into the better land and no sooner was he at liberty than he hastened with positive exhilaration to his studio  not even the sight of the barrel could entirely cast him down he flung himself with rising zest into his worka bust of mr gladstone from a photograph turned with extraordinary success the difficulty of the back of the head for which he had no documents beyond a hazy recollection of a public meeting delighted himself by his treatment of the collar and was only recalled to the cares of life by michael finsburys rattle at the door  well whats wrong said michael advancing to the grate where knowing his friends delight in a bright fire mr pitman had not spared the fuel i suppose you have come to grief somehow  there is no expression strong enough said the artist mr semitopoliss statue has not turned up and i am afraid i shall be answerable for the money but i think nothing of thatwhat i fear my dear mr finsbury what i fearalas that i should have to say itis exposure the hercules was to be smuggled out of italy a thing positively wrong a thing of which a man of my principles and in my responsible position should have taken as i now see too late no part whatever  this sounds like very serious work said the lawyer it will require a great deal of drink pitman  i took the liberty ofin short of being prepared for you replied the artist pointing to a kettle a bottle of gin a lemon and glasses   michael mixed himself a grog and offered the artist a cigar  no thank you said pitman i used occasionally to be rather partial to it but the smell is so disagreeable about the clothes  all right said the lawyer i am comfortable now unfold your tale  at some length pitman set forth his sorrows he had gone today to waterloo expecting to receive the colossal hercules and he had received instead a barrel not big enough to hold discobolus yet the barrel was addressed in the hand with which he was perfectly acquainted of his roman correspondent what was stranger still a case had arrived by the same train large enough and heavy enough to contain the hercules and this case had been taken to an address now undiscoverable the vanman i regret to say it had been drinking and his language was such as i could never bring myself to repeat he was at once discharged by the superintendent of the line who behaved most properly throughout and is to make inquiries at southampton in the meanwhile what was i to do i left my address and brought the barrel home but remembering an old adage i determined not to open it except in the presence of my lawyer  is that all asked michael i dont see any cause to worry the hercules has stuck upon the road it will drop in tomorrow or the day after and as for the barrel depend upon it its a testimonial from one of your young ladies and probably contains oysters  o dont speak so loud cried the little artist it would cost me my place if i were heard to speak lightly of the young ladies and besides why oysters from italy and why should they come to me addressed in signor ricardis hand  well lets have a look at it said michael lets roll it forward to the light  the two men rolled the barrel from the corner and stood it on end before the fire  its heavy enough to be oysters remarked michael judiciously  shall we open it at once inquired the artist who had grown decidedly cheerful under the combined effects of company and gin and without waiting for a reply he began to strip as if for a prizefight tossed his clerical collar in the wastepaper basket hung his clerical coat upon a nail and with a chisel in one hand and a hammer in the other struck the first blow of the evening  thats the style william dent cried michael theres fire for your money it may be a romantic visit from one of the young ladiesa sort of cleopatra business have a care and dont stave in cleopatras head  but the sight of pitmans alacrity was infectious the lawyer could sit still no longer tossing his cigar into the fire he snatched the instrument from the unwilling hands of the artist and fell to himself soon the sweat stood in beads upon his large fair brow his stylish trousers were defaced with iron rust and the state of his chisel testified to misdirected energies  a cask is not an easy thing to open even when you set about it in the right way when you set about it wrongly the whole structure must be resolved into its elements such was the course pursued alike by the artist and the lawyer presently the last hoop had been removeda couple of smart blows tumbled the staves upon the groundand what had once been a barrel was no more than a confused heap of broken and distorted boards  in the midst of these a certain dismal something swathed in blankets remained for an instant upright and then toppled to one side and heavily collapsed before the fire even as the thing subsided an eyeglass tingled to the floor and rolled toward the screaming pitman  hold your tongue said michael he dashed to the house door and locked it then with a pale face and bitten lip he drew near pulled aside a corner of the swathing blanket and recoiled shuddering  there was a long silence in the studio  now tell me said michael in a low voice had you any hand in it and he pointed to the body  the little artist could only utter broken and disjointed sounds  michael poured some gin into a glass drink that he said dont be afraid of me im your friend through thick and thin  pitman put the liquor down untasted  i swear before god he said this is another mystery to me in my worst fears i never dreamed of such a thing i would not lay a finger on a sucking infant  thats all square said michael with a sigh of huge relief i believe you old boy and he shook the artist warmly by the hand i thought for a moment he added with rather a ghastly smile i thought for a moment you might have made away with mr semitopolis  it would make no difference if i had groaned pitman all is at an end for me theres the writing on the wall  to begin with said michael lets get him out of sight for to be quite plain with you pitman i dont like your friends appearance and with that the lawyer shuddered where can we put it  you might put it in the closet thereif you could bear to touch it answered the artist  somebody has to do it pitman returned the lawyer and it seems as if it had to be me you go over to the table turn your back and mix me a grog thats a fair division of labour  about ninety seconds later the closetdoor was heard to shut  there observed michael thats more homelike you can turn now my pallid pitman is this the grog he ran on heaven forgive you its a lemonade  but o finsbury what are we to do with it wailed the artist laying a clutching hand upon the lawyers arm  do with it repeated michael bury it in one of your flowerbeds and erect one of your own statues for a monument i tell you we should look devilish romantic shovelling out the sod by the moons pale ray here put some gin in this  i beg of you mr finsbury do not trifle with my misery cried pitman you see before you a man who has been all his lifei do not hesitate to say iteminently respectable even in this solemn hour i can lay my hand upon my heart without a blush except on the really trifling point of the smuggling of the hercules and even of that i now humbly repent my life has been entirely fit for publication i never feared the light cried the little man and nownow  cheer up old boy said michael i assure you we should count this little contretemps a trifle at the office its the sort of thing that may occur to any one and if youre perfectly sure you had no hand in it  what language am i to find began pitman  o ill do that part of it interrupted michael you have no experience but the point is this ifor rather sinceyou know nothing of the crime since thethe party in the closetis neither your father nor your brother nor your creditor nor your motherinlaw nor what they call an injured husband  o my dear sir interjected pitman horrified  since in short continued the lawyer you had no possible interest in the crime we have a perfectly free field before us and a safe game to play indeed the problem is really entertaining it is one i have long contemplated in the light of an a b case here it is at last under my hand in specie and i mean to pull you through do you hear thati mean to pull you through let me see its a long time since i have had what i call a genuine holiday ill send an excuse tomorrow to the office we had best be lively he added significantly for we must not spoil the market for the other man  what do you mean inquired pitman what other man the inspector of police  damn the inspector of police remarked his companion if you wont take the short cut and bury this in your back garden we must find some one who will bury it in his we must place the affair in short in the hands of some one with fewer scruples and more resources  a private detective perhaps suggested pitman  there are times when you fill me with pity observed the lawyer by the way pitman he added in another key i have always regretted that you have no piano in this den of yours even if you dont play yourself your friends might like to entertain themselves with a little music while you were mudding  i shall get one at once if you like said pitman nervously anxious to please i play the fiddle a little as it is  i know you do said michael but whats the fiddleabove all as you play it what you want is polyphonic music and ill tell you what it issince its too late for you to buy a piano ill give you mine  thank you said the artist blankly you will give me yours i am sure its very good in you  yes ill give you mine continued michael for the inspector of police to play on while his men are digging up your back garden  pitman stared at him in pained amazement  no im not insane michael went on im playful but quite coherent see here pitman follow me one half minute i mean to profit by the refreshing fact that we are really and truly innocent nothing but the presence of theyou know whatconnects us with the crime once let us get rid of it no matter how and there is no possible clue to trace us by well i give you my piano well bring it round this very night tomorrow we rip the fittings out deposit theour friendinside plump the whole on a cart and carry it to the chambers of a young gentleman whom i know by sight  whom do you know by sight repeated pitman  and what is more to the purpose continued michael whose chambers i know better than he does himself a friend of minei call him my friend for brevity he is now i understand in demerara and most likely in gaolwas the previous occupant i defended him and i got him off tooall saved but honour his assets were nil but he gave me what he had poor gentleman and along with the restthe key of his chambers its there that i propose to leave the piano and shall we say cleopatra  it seems very wild said pitman and what will become of the poor young gentleman whom you know by sight  it will do him good said michael cheerily just what he wants to steady him  but my dear sir he might be involved in a charge ofa charge of murder gulped the artist  well hell be just where we are returned the lawyer hes innocent you see what hangs people my dear pitman is the unfortunate circumstance of guilt  but indeed indeed pleaded pitman the whole scheme appears to me so wild would it not be safer after all just to send for the police  and make a scandal inquired michael the chelsea mystery alleged innocence of pitman how would that do at the seminary  it would imply my discharge admitted the drawingmaster i cannot deny that  and besides said michael i am not going to embark in such a business and have no fun for my money  o my dear sir is that a proper spirit cried pitman  o i only said that to cheer you up said the unabashed michael nothing like a little judicious levity but its quite needless to discuss if you mean to follow my advice come on and let us get the piano at once if you dont just drop me the word and ill leave you to deal with the whole thing according to your better judgment  you know perfectly well that i depend on you entirely returned pitman but o what a night is before me with thathorror in my studio how am i to think of it on my pillow  well you know my piano will be there too said michael thatll raise the average  an hour later a cart came up the lane and the lawyers pianoa momentous broadwood grandwas deposited in mr pitmans studio     chapter viii  in which michael finsbury enjoys a holiday   punctually at eight oclock next morning the lawyer rattled according to previous appointment on the studio door he found the artist sadly altered for the worsebleached bloodshot and chalkya man upon wires the tail of his haggard eye still wandering to the closet nor was the professor of drawing less inclined to wonder at his friend michael was usually attired in the height of fashion with a certain mercantile brilliancy best described perhaps as stylish nor could anything be said against him as a rule but that he looked a trifle too like a wedding guest to be quite a gentleman today he had fallen altogether from these heights he wore a flannel shirt of washedout shepherds tartan and a suit of reddish tweeds of the colour known to tailors as heather mixture his neckcloth was black and tied loosely in a sailors knot a rusty ulster partly concealed these advantages and his feet were shod with rough walking boots his hat was an old soft felt which he removed with a flourish as he entered  here i am william dent he cried and drawing from his pocket two little wisps of reddish hair he held them to his cheeks like sidewhiskers and danced about the studio with the filmy graces of a balletgirl  pitman laughed sadly i should never have known you said he  nor were you intended to returned michael replacing his false whiskers in his pocket now we must overhaul you and your wardrobe and disguise you up to the nines  disguise cried the artist must i indeed disguise myself has it come to that  my dear creature returned his companion disguise is the spice of life what is life passionately exclaimed a french philosopher without the pleasures of disguise i dont say its always good taste and i know its unprofessional but whats the odds downhearted drawingmaster it has to be we have to leave a false impression on the minds of many persons and in particular on the mind of mr gideon forsyththe young gentleman i know by sightif he should have the bad taste to be at home  if he be at home faltered the artist that would be the end of all  wont matter a d returned michael airily let me see your clothes and ill make a new man of you in a jiffy  in the bedroom to which he was at once conducted michael examined pitmans poor and scanty wardrobe with a humorous eye picked out a short jacket of black alpaca and presently added to that a pair of summer trousers which somehow took his fancy as incongruous then with the garments in his hand he scrutinised the artist closely  i dont like that clerical collar he remarked have you nothing else  the professor of drawing pondered for a moment and then brightened i have a pair of lownecked shirts he said that i used to wear in paris as a student they are rather loud  the very thing ejaculated michael youll look perfectly beastly here are spats too he continued drawing forth a pair of those offensive little gaiters must have spats and now you jump into these and whistle a tune at the window for say threequarters of an hour after that you can rejoin me on the field of glory  so saying michael returned to the studio it was the morning of the easterly gale the wind blew shrilly among the statues in the garden and drove the rain upon the skylight in the studio ceiling and at about the same moment of the time when morris attacked the hundredth version of his uncles signature in bloomsbury michael in chelsea began to rip the wires out of the broadwood grand  threequarters of an hour later pitman was admitted to find the closetdoor standing open the closet untenanted and the piano discreetly shut  its a remarkably heavy instrument observed michael and turned to consider his friends disguise you must shave off that beard of yours he said  my beard cried pitman i cannot shave my beard i cannot tamper with my appearancemy principals would object they hold very strong views as to the appearance of the professorsyoung ladies are considered so romantic my beard was regarded as quite a feature when i went about the place it was regarded said the artist with rising colour it was regarded as unbecoming  you can let it grow again returned michael and then youll be so precious ugly that theyll raise your salary  but i dont want to be ugly cried the artist  dont be an ass said michael who hated beards and was delighted to destroy one off with it like a man  of course if you insist said pitman and then he sighed fetched some hot water from the kitchen and setting a glass upon his easel first clipped his beard with scissors and then shaved his chin he could not conceal from himself as he regarded the result that his last claims to manhood had been sacrificed but michael seemed delighted  a new man i declare he cried when i give you the windowglass spectacles i have in my pocket youll be the beauidéal of a french commercial traveller  pitman did not reply but continued to gaze disconsolately on his image in the glass  do you know asked michael what the governor of south carolina said to the governor of north carolina its a long time between drinks observed that powerful thinker and if you will put your hand into the top lefthand pocket of my ulster i have an impression you will find a flask of brandy thank you pitman he added as he filled out a glass for each now you will give me news of this  the artist reached out his hand for the waterjug but michael arrested the movement  not if you went upon your knees he cried this is the finest liqueur brandy in great britain  pitman put his lips to it set it down again and sighed  well i must say youre the poorest companion for a holiday cried michael if thats all you know of brandy you shall have no more of it and while i finish the flask you may as well begin business come to think of it he broke off i have made an abominable error you should have ordered the cart before you were disguised why pitman what the devils the use of you why couldnt you have reminded me of that  i never even knew there was a cart to be ordered said the artist but i can take off the disguise again he suggested eagerly  you would find it rather a bother to put on your beard observed the lawyer no its a false step the sort of thing that hangs people he continued with eminent cheerfulness as he sipped his brandy and it cant be retraced now off to the mews with you make all the arrangements theyre to take the piano from here cart it to victoria and despatch it thence by rail to cannon street to lie till called for in the name of fortuné du boisgobey  isnt that rather an awkward name pleaded pitman  awkward cried michael scornfully it would hang us both brown is both safer and easier to pronounce call it brown  i wish said pitman for my sake i wish you wouldnt talk so much of hanging  talking about its nothing my boy returned michael but take your hat and be off and mind and pay everything beforehand  left to himself the lawyer turned his attention for some time exclusively to the liqueur brandy and his spirits which had been pretty fair all morning now prodigiously rose he proceeded to adjust his whiskers finally before the glass devilish rich he remarked as he contemplated his reflection i look like a pursers mate and at that moment the windowglass spectacles which he had hitherto destined for pitman flashed into his mind he put them on and fell in love with the effect just what i required he said i wonder what i look like now a humorous novelist i should think and he began to practise divers characters of walk naming them to himself as he proceeded walk of a humorous novelistbut that would require an umbrella walk of a pursers mate walk of an australian colonist revisiting the scenes of childhood walk of sepoy colonel ditto ditto and in the midst of the sepoy colonel which was an excellent assumption although inconsistent with the style of his makeup his eye lighted on the piano this instrument was made to lock both at the top and at the keyboard but the key of the latter had been mislaid michael opened it and ran his fingers over the dumb keys fine instrumentfull rich tone he observed and he drew in a seat  when mr pitman returned to the studio he was appalled to observe his guide philosopher and friend performing miracles of execution on the silent grand  heaven help me thought the little man i fear he has been drinking mr finsbury he said aloud and michael without rising turned upon him a countenance somewhat flushed encircled with the bush of the red whiskers and bestridden by the spectacles capriccio in bflat on the departure of a friend said he continuing his noiseless evolutions  indignation awoke in the mind of pitman those spectacles were to be mine he cried they are an essential part of my disguise  i am going to wear them myself replied michael and he added with some show of truth there would be a devil of a lot of suspicion aroused if we both wore spectacles  o well said the assenting pitman i rather counted on them but of course if you insist and at any rate here is the cart at the door  while the men were at work michael concealed himself in the closet among the debris of the barrel and the wires of the piano and as soon as the coast was clear the pair sallied forth by the lane jumped into a hansom in the kings road and were driven rapidly toward town it was still cold and raw and boisterous the rain beat strongly in their faces but michael refused to have the glass let down he had now suddenly donned the character of cicerone and pointed out and lucidly commented on the sights of london as they drove my dear fellow he said you dont seem to know anything of your native city suppose we visited the tower no well perhaps its a trifle out of our way but anywayhere cabby drive round by trafalgar square and on that historic battlefield he insisted on drawing up while he criticised the statues and gave the artist many curious details quite new to history of the lives of the celebrated men they represented  it would be difficult to express what pitman suffered in the cab cold wet terror in the capital degree a grounded distrust of the commander under whom he served a sense of imprudency in the matter of the lownecked shirt a bitter sense of the decline and fall involved in the deprivation of his beard all these were among the ingredients of the bowl to reach the restaurant for which they were deviously steering was the first relief to hear michael bespeak a private room was a second and a still greater nor as they mounted the stair under the guidance of an unintelligible alien did he fail to note with gratitude the fewness of the persons present or the still more cheering fact that the greater part of these were exiles from the land of france it was thus a blessed thought that none of them would be connected with the seminary for even the french professor though admittedly a papist he could scarce imagine frequenting so rakish an establishment  the alien introduced them into a small bare room with a single table a sofa and a dwarfish fire and michael called promptly for more coals and a couple of brandies and sodas  o no said pitman surely notno more to drink  i dont know what you would be at said michael plaintively its positively necessary to do something and one shouldnt smoke before mealsi thought that was understood you seem to have no idea of hygiene and he compared his watch with the clock upon the chimneypiece  pitman fell into bitter musing here he was ridiculously shorn absurdly disguised in the company of a drunken man in spectacles and waiting for a champagne luncheon in a restaurant painfully foreign what would his principals think if they could see him what if they knew his tragic and deceitful errand  from these reflections he was aroused by the entrance of the alien with the brandies and sodas michael took one and bade the waiter pass the other to his friend  pitman waved it from him with his hand dont let me lose all selfrespect he said  anything to oblige a friend returned michael but im not going to drink alone here he added to the waiter you take it and then touching glasses the health of mr gideon forsyth said he  meestare gidden borsye replied the waiter and he tossed off the liquor in four gulps  have another said michael with undisguised interest i never saw a man drink faster it restores ones confidence in the human race  but the waiter excused himself politely and assisted by some one from without began to bring in lunch  michael made an excellent meal which he washed down with a bottle of heidsiecks dry monopole as for the artist he was far too uneasy to eat and his companion flatly refused to let him share in the champagne unless he did  one of us must stay sober remarked the lawyer and i wont give you champagne on the strength of a leg of grouse i have to be cautious he added confidentially one drunken man excellent businesstwo drunken men all my eye  on the production of coffee and departure of the waiter michael might have been observed to make portentous efforts after gravity of mien he looked his friend in the face one eye perhaps a trifle off and addressed him thickly but severely  enough of this fooling was his not inappropriate exordium to business mark me closely i am an australian my name is john dickson though you mightnt think it from my unassuming appearance you will be relieved to hear that i am rich sir very rich you cant go into this sort of thing too thoroughly pitman the whole secret is preparation and i can get up my biography from the beginning and i could tell it you now only i have forgotten it  perhaps im stupid began pitman  thats it cried michael very stupid but rich tooricher than i am i thought you would enjoy it pitman so ive arranged that you were to be literally wallowing in wealth but then on the other hand youre only an american and a maker of indiarubber overshoes at that and the worst of it iswhy should i conceal it from youthe worst of it is that youre called ezra thomas now said michael with a really appalling seriousness of manner tell me who we are  the unfortunate little man was crossexamined till he knew these facts by heart  there cried the lawyer our plans are laid thoroughly consistentthats the great thing  but i dont understand objected pitman  o youll understand right enough when it comes to the point said michael rising  there doesnt seem any story to it said the artist  we can invent one as we go along returned the lawyer  but i cant invent protested pitman i never could invent in all my life  youll find youll have to my boy was michaels easy comment and he began calling for the waiter with whom he at once resumed a sparkling conversation  it was a downcast little man that followed him of course he is very clever but can i trust him in such a state he asked himself and when they were once more in a hansom he took heart of grace  dont you think he faltered it would be wiser considering all things to put this business off  put off till tomorrow what can be done today cried michael with indignation never heard of such a thing cheer up its all right go in and wintheres a lionhearted pitman  at cannon street they inquired for mr browns piano which had duly arrived drove thence to a neighbouring mews where they contracted for a cart and while that was being got ready took shelter in the harnessroom beside the stove here the lawyer presently toppled against the wall and fell into a gentle slumber so that pitman found himself launched on his own resources in the midst of several staring loafers such as love to spend unprofitable days about a stable  rough day sir observed one do you go far  yes its arather a rough day said the artist and then feeling that he must change the conversation my friend is an australian he is very impulsive he added  an australian said another ive a brother myself in melbourne does your friend come from that way at all  no not exactly replied the artist whose ideas of the geography of new holland were a little scattered he lives immensely far inland and is very rich  the loafers gazed with great respect upon the slumbering colonist  well remarked the second speaker its a mighty big place is australia do you come from thereaway too  no i do not said pitman i do not and i dont want to he added irritably and then feeling some diversion needful he fell upon michael and shook him up  hullo said the lawyer whats wrong  the cart is nearly ready said pitman sternly i will not allow you to sleep  all rightno offence old man replied michael yawning a little sleep never did anybody any harm i feel comparatively sober now but whats all the hurry he added looking round him glassily i dont see the cart and ive forgotten where we left the piano  what more the lawyer might have said in the confidence of the moment is with pitman a matter of tremulous conjecture to this day but by the most blessed circumstance the cart was then announced and michael must bend the forces of his mind to the more difficult task of rising  of course youll drive he remarked to his companion as he clambered on the vehicle  i drive cried pitman i never did such a thing in my life i cannot drive  very well responded michael with entire composure neither can i see but just as you like anything to oblige a friend  a glimpse of the ostlers darkening countenance decided pitman all right he said desperately you drive ill tell you where to go  on michael in the character of charioteer since this is not intended to be a novel of adventure it would be superfluous to dwell at length pitman as he sat holding on and gasping counsels sole witness of this singular feat knew not whether most to admire the drivers valour or his undeserved good fortune but the latter at least prevailed the cart reached cannon street without disaster and mr browns piano was speedily and cleverly got on board  well sir said the leading porter smiling as he mentally reckoned up a handful of loose silver thats a mortal heavy piano  its the richness of the tone returned michael as he drove away  it was but a little distance in the rain which now fell thick and quiet to the neighbourhood of mr gideon forsyths chambers in the temple there in a deserted bystreet michael drew up the horses and gave them in charge to a blighted shoeblack and the pair descending from the cart whereon they had figured so incongruously set forth on foot for the decisive scene of their adventure for the first time michael displayed a shadow of uneasiness  are my whiskers right he asked it would be the devil and all if i was spotted  they are perfectly in their place returned pitman with scant attention but is my disguise equally effective there is nothing more likely than that i should meet some of my patrons  o nobody could tell you without your beard said michael all you have to do is to remember to speak slow you speak through your nose already  i only hope the young man wont be at home sighed pitman  and i only hope hell be alone returned the lawyer it will save a precious sight of manoeuvring  and sure enough when they had knocked at the door gideon admitted them in person to a room warmed by a moderate fire framed nearly to the roof in works connected with the bench of british themis and offering except in one particular eloquent testimony to the legal zeal of the proprietor the one particular was the chimneypiece which displayed a varied assortment of pipes tobacco cigarboxes and yellowbacked french novels  mr forsyth i believe it was michael who thus opened the engagement we have come to trouble you with a piece of business i fear its scarcely professional  i am afraid i ought to be instructed through a solicitor replied gideon  well well you shall name your own and the whole affair can be put on a more regular footing tomorrow replied michael taking a chair and motioning pitman to do the same but you see we didnt know any solicitors we did happen to know of you and time presses  may i inquire gentlemen asked gideon to whom it was i am indebted for a recommendation  you may inquire returned the lawyer with a foolish laugh but i was invited not to tell youtill the thing was done  my uncle no doubt was the barristers conclusion  my name is john dickson continued michael a pretty wellknown name in ballarat and my friend here is mr ezra thomas of the united states of america a wealthy manufacturer of indiarubber overshoes  stop one moment till i make a note of that said gideon any one might have supposed he was an old practitioner  perhaps you wouldnt mind my smoking a cigar asked michael he had pulled himself together for the entrance now again there began to settle on his mind clouds of irresponsible humour and incipient slumber and he hoped as so many have hoped in the like case that a cigar would clear him  oh certainly cried gideon blandly try one of mine i can confidently recommend them and he handed the box to his client  in case i dont make myself perfectly clear observed the australian its perhaps best to tell you candidly that ive been lunching its a thing that may happen to any one  o certainly replied the affable barrister but please be under no sense of hurry i can give you he added thoughtfully consulting his watchyes i can give you the whole afternoon  the business that brings me here resumed the australian with gusto is devilish delicate i can tell you my friend mr thomas being an american of portuguese extraction unacquainted with our habits and a wealthy manufacturer of broadwood pianos  broadwood pianos cried gideon with some surprise dear me do i understand mr thomas to be a member of the firm  o pirated broadwoods returned michael my friends the american broadwood  but i understood you to say objected gideon i certainly have it so in my notesthat your friend was a manufacturer of indiarubber overshoes  i know its confusing at first said the australian with a beaming smile but hein short he combines the two professions and many others besidesmany many many others repeated mr dickson with drunken solemnity mr thomass cottonmills are one of the sights of tallahassee mr thomass tobaccomills are the pride of richmond va in short hes one of my oldest friends mr forsyth and i lay his case before you with emotion  the barrister looked at mr thomas and was agreeably prepossessed by his open although nervous countenance and the simplicity and timidity of his manner what a people are these americans he thought look at this nervous weedy simple little bird in a lownecked shirt and think of him wielding and directing interests so extended and seemingly incongruous but had we not better he observed aloud had we not perhaps better approach the facts  man of business i perceive sir said the australian lets approach the facts its a breach of promise case  the unhappy artist was so unprepared for this view of his position that he could scarce suppress a cry  dear me said gideon they are apt to be very troublesome tell me everything about it he added kindly if you require my assistance conceal nothing  you tell him said michael feeling apparently that he had done his share my friend will tell you all about it he added to gideon with a yawn excuse my closing my eyes a moment ive been sitting up with a sick friend  pitman gazed blankly about the room rage and despair seethed in his innocent spirit thoughts of flight thoughts even of suicide came and went before him and still the barrister patiently waited and still the artist groped in vain for any form of words however insignificant  its a breach of promise case he said at last in a low voice ii am threatened with a breach of promise case here in desperate quest of inspiration he made a clutch at his beard his fingers closed upon the unfamiliar smoothness of a shaven chin and with that hope and courage if such expressions could ever have been appropriate in the case of pitman conjointly fled he shook michael roughly wake up he cried with genuine irritation in his tones i cannot do it and you know i cant  you must excuse my friend said michael hes no hand as a narrator of stirring incident the case is simple he went on my friend is a man of very strong passions and accustomed to a simple patriarchal style of life you see the thing from here unfortunate visit to europe followed by unfortunate acquaintance with sham foreign count who has a lovely daughter mr thomas was quite carried away he proposed he was accepted and he wrotewrote in a style which i am sure he must regret today if these letters are produced in court sir mr thomass character is gone  am i to understand began gideon  my dear sir said the australian emphatically it isnt possible to understand unless you saw them  that is a painful circumstance said gideon he glanced pityingly in the direction of the culprit and observing on his countenance every mark of confusion pityingly withdrew his eyes  and that would be nothing continued mr dickson sternly but i wishi wish from my heart sir i could say that mr thomass hands were clean he has no excuse for he was engaged at the timeand is still engagedto the belle of constantinople ga my friends conduct was unworthy of the brutes that perish  ga repeated gideon inquiringly  a contraction in current use said michael ga for georgia in the same way as co for company  i was aware it was sometimes so written returned the barrister but not that it was so pronounced  fact i assure you said michael you now see for yourself sir that if this unhappy person is to be saved some devilish sharp practice will be needed theres money and no desire to spare it mr thomas could write a cheque tomorrow for a hundred thousand and mr forsyth theres better than money the foreign countcount tarnow he calls himselfwas formerly a tobacconist in bayswater and passed under the humble but expressive name of schmidt his daughterif she is his daughtertheres another pointmake a note of that mr forsythhis daughter at that time actually served in the shopand she now proposes to marry a man of the eminence of mr thomas now do you see our game we know they contemplate a move and we wish to forestall em down you go to hampton court where they live and threaten or bribe or both until you get the letters if you cant god help us we must go to court and thomas must be exposed ill be done with him for one added the unchivalrous friend  there seem some elements of success said gideon was schmidt at all known to the police  we hope so said michael we have every ground to think so mark the neighbourhoodbayswater doesnt bayswater occur to you as very suggestive  for perhaps the sixth time during this remarkable interview gideon wondered if he were not becoming lightheaded i suppose its just because he has been lunching he thought and then added aloud to what figure may i go  perhaps five thousand would be enough for today said michael and now sir do not let me detain you any longer the afternoon wears on there are plenty of trains to hampton court and i neednt try to describe to you the impatience of my friend here is a fivepound note for current expenses and here is the address and michael began to write paused tore up the paper and put the pieces in his pocket i will dictate he said my writing is so uncertain  gideon took down the address count tarnow kurnaul villa hampton court then he wrote something else on a sheet of paper you said you had not chosen a solicitor he said for a case of this sort here is the best man in london and he handed the paper to michael  god bless me ejaculated michael as he read his own address  o i daresay you have seen his name connected with some rather painful cases said gideon but he is himself a perfectly honest man and his capacity is recognised and now gentlemen it only remains for me to ask where i shall communicate with you  the langham of course returned michael till tonight  till tonight replied gideon smiling i suppose i may knock you up at a late hour  any hour any hour cried the vanishing solicitor  now theres a young fellow with a head upon his shoulders he said to pitman as soon as they were in the street  pitman was indistinctly heard to murmur perfect fool  not a bit of him returned michael he knows whos the best solicitor in london and its not every man can say the same but i say didnt i pitch it in hot  pitman returned no answer  hullo said the lawyer pausing whats wrong with the longsuffering pitman  you had no right to speak of me as you did the artist broke out your language was perfectly unjustifiable you have wounded me deeply  i never said a word about you replied michael i spoke of ezra thomas and do please remember that theres no such party  its just as hard to bear said the artist  but by this time they had reached the corner of the bystreet and there was the faithful shoeblack standing by the horses heads with a splendid assumption of dignity and there was the piano figuring forlorn upon the cart while the rain beat upon its unprotected sides and trickled down its elegantly varnished legs  the shoeblack was again put in requisition to bring five or six strong fellows from the neighbouring publichouse and the last battle of the campaign opened it is probable that mr gideon forsyth had not yet taken his seat in the train for hampton court before michael opened the door of the chambers and the grunting porters deposited the broadwood grand in the middle of the floor  and now said the lawyer after he had sent the men about their business one more precaution we must leave him the key of the piano and we must contrive that he shall find it let me see and he built a square tower of cigars upon the top of the instrument and dropped the key into the middle  poor young man said the artist as they descended the stairs  he is in a devil of a position assented michael drily itll brace him up  and that reminds me observed the excellent pitman that i fear i displayed a most ungrateful temper i had no right i see to resent expressions wounding as they were which were in no sense directed  thats all right cried michael getting on the cart not a word more pitman very proper feeling on your part no man of selfrespect can stand by and hear his alias insulted  the rain had now ceased michael was fairly sober the body had been disposed of and the friends were reconciled the return to the mews was therefore in comparison with previous stages of the days adventures quite a holiday outing and when they had returned the cart and walked forth again from the stableyard unchallenged and even unsuspected pitman drew a deep breath of joy  and now he said we can go home  pitman said the lawyer stopping short your recklessness fills me with concern what we have been wet through the greater part of the day and you propose in cold blood to go home no sirhot scotch  and taking his friends arm he led him sternly towards the nearest publichouse nor was pitman i regret to say wholly unwilling now that peace was restored and the body gone a certain innocent skittishness began to appear in the manners of the artist and when he touched his steaming glass to michaels he giggled aloud like a venturesome schoolgirl at a picnic     chapter ix  glorious conclusion of michael finsburys holiday   i know michael finsbury personally my businessi know the awkwardness of having such a man for a lawyerstill its an old story now and there is such a thing as gratitude and in short my legal business although now i am thankful to say of quite a placid character remains entirely in michaels hands but the trouble is i have no natural talent for addresses i learn one for every manthat is friendships offering and the friend who subsequently changes his residence is dead to me memory refusing to pursue him thus it comes about that as i always write to michael at his office i cannot swear to his number in the kings road of course like my neighbours i have been to dinner there of late years since his accession to wealth neglect of business and election to the club these little festivals have become common he picks up a few fellows in the smokingroomall men of attic witmyself for instance if he has the luck to find me disengaged a string of hansoms may be observed by her majesty bowling gaily through st jamess park and in a quarter of an hour the party surrounds one of the best appointed boards in london  but at the time of which we write the house in the kings road let us still continue to call it no 233 was kept very quiet when michael entertained guests it was at the halls of nichol or verrey that he would convene them and the door of his private residence remained closed against his friends the upper story which was sunny was set apart for his father the drawingroom was never opened the diningroom was the scene of michaels life it is in this pleasant apartment sheltered from the curiosity of kings road by wire blinds and entirely surrounded by the lawyers unrivalled library of poetry and criminal trials that we find him sitting down to his dinner after his holiday with pitman a spare old lady with very bright eyes and a mouth humorously compressed waited upon the lawyers needs in every line of her countenance she betrayed the fact that she was an old retainer in every word that fell from her lips she flaunted the glorious circumstance of a scottish origin and the fear with which this powerful combination fills the boldest was obviously no stranger to the bosom of our friend the hot scotch having somewhat warmed up the embers of the heidsieck it was touching to observe the masters eagerness to pull himself together under the servants eye and when he remarked i think teena ill take a brandy and soda he spoke like a man doubtful of his elocution and not half certain of obedience  no such a thing mr michael was the prompt return clart and water  well well teena i daresay you know best said the master very fatiguing day at the office though  what said the retainer ye never were near the office  o yes i was though i was repeatedly along fleet street returned michael  pretty pliskies yeve been at this day cried the old lady with humorous alacrity and then take caredont break my crystal she cried as the lawyer came within an ace of knocking the glasses off the table  and how is he keeping asked michael  o just the same mr michael just the way hell be till the end worthy man was the reply but yell not be the first thats asked me that the day  no said the lawyer who else  ay thats a joke too said teena grimly a friend of yours mr morris  morris what was the little beggar wanting here inquired michael  wantin to see him replied the housekeeper completing her meaning by a movement of the thumb toward the upper story thats by his way of it but ive an idee of my own he tried to bribe me mr michael bribeme she repeated with inimitable scorn thats no kind of a young gentleman  did he so said michael i bet he didnt offer much  no more he did replied teena nor could any subsequent questioning elicit from her the sum with which the thrifty leather merchant had attempted to corrupt her but i sent him about his business she said gallantly hell not come here again in a hurry  he mustnt see my father you know mind that said michael im not going to have any public exhibition to a little beast like him  no fear of me lettin him replied the trusty one but the joke is this mr michaelsee yere upsettin the sauce thats a clean tablecloththe best of the joke is that he thinks your fathers dead and youre keepin it dark  michael whistled set a thief to catch a thief said he  exacly what i told him cried the delighted dame  ill make him dance for that said michael  couldnt ye get the law of him some way suggested teena truculently  no i dont think i could and im quite sure i dont want to replied michael but i say teena i really dont believe this clarets wholesome its not a sound reliable wine give us a brandy and soda theres a good soul teenas face became like adamant well then said the lawyer fretfully i wont eat any more dinner  ye can please yourself about that mr michael said teena and began composedly to take away  i do wish teena wasnt a faithful servant sighed the lawyer as he issued into kings road  the rain had ceased the wind still blew but only with a pleasant freshness the town in the clear darkness of the night glittered with streetlamps and shone with glancing rainpools come this is better thought the lawyer to himself and he walked on eastward lending a pleased ear to the wheels and the million footfalls of the city  near the end of the kings road he remembered his brandy and soda and entered a flaunting publichouse a good many persons were present a waterman from a cabstand half a dozen of the chronically unemployed a gentleman in one corner trying to sell æsthetic photographs out of a leather case to another and very youthful gentleman with a yellow goatee and a pair of lovers debating some fine shade in the other but the centrepiece and great attraction was a little old man in a black readymade surtout which was obviously a recent purchase on the marble table in front of him beside a sandwich and a glass of beer there lay a battered foragecap his hand fluttered abroad with oratorical gestures his voice naturally shrill was plainly tuned to the pitch of the lectureroom and by arts comparable to those of the ancient mariner he was now holding spellbound the barmaid the waterman and four of the unemployed  i have examined all the theatres in london he was saying and pacing the principal entrances i have ascertained them to be ridiculously disproportionate to the requirements of their audiences the doors opened the wrong wayi forget at this moment which it is but have a note of it at home they were frequently locked during the performance and when the auditorium was literally thronged with english people you have probably not had my opportunities of comparing distant lands but i can assure you this has been long ago recognised as a mark of aristocratic government do you suppose in a country really selfgoverned such abuses could exist your own intelligence however uncultivated tells you they could not take austria a country even possibly more enslaved than england i have myself conversed with one of the survivors of the ring theatre and though his colloquial german was not very good i succeeded in gathering a pretty clear idea of his opinion of the case but what will perhaps interest you still more here is a cutting on the subject from a vienna newspaper which i will now read to you translating as i go you can see for yourselves it is printed in the german character and he held the cutting out for verification much as a conjurer passes a trick orange along the front bench  hullo old gentleman is this you said michael laying his hand upon the orators shoulder  the figure turned with a convulsion of alarm and showed the countenance of mr joseph finsbury  you michael he cried theres no one with you is there  no replied michael ordering a brandy and soda theres nobody with me whom do you expect  i thought of morris or john said the old gentleman evidently greatly relieved  what the devil would i be doing with morris or john cried the nephew  there is something in that returned joseph and i believe i can trust you i believe you will stand by me  i hardly know what you mean said the lawyer but if you are in need of money i am flush  its not that my dear boy said the uncle shaking him by the hand ill tell you all about it afterwards  all right responded the nephew i stand treat uncle joseph what will you have  in that case replied the old gentleman ill take another sandwich i daresay i surprise you he went on with my presence in a publichouse but the fact is i act on a sound but littleknown principle of my own  o its better known than you suppose said michael sipping his brandy and soda i always act on it myself when i want a drink  the old gentleman who was anxious to propitiate michael laughed a cheerless laugh you have such a flow of spirits said he i am sure i often find it quite amusing but regarding this principle of which i was about to speak it is that of accommodating onesself to the manners of any land however humble in which our lot may be cast now in france for instance every one goes to a café for his meals in america to what is called a twobit house in england the people resort to such an institution as the present for refreshment with sandwiches tea and an occasional glass of bitter beer a man can live luxuriously in london for fourteen pounds twelve shillings per annum  yes i know returned michael but thats not including clothes washing or boots the whole thing with cigars and occasional sprees costs me over seven hundred a year  but this was michaels last interruption he listened in goodhumoured silence to the remainder of his uncles lecture which speedily branched to political reform thence to the theory of the weatherglass with an illustrative account of a bora in the adriatic thence again to the best manner of teaching arithmetic to the deafanddumb and with that the sandwich being then no more explicuit valde feliciter a moment later the pair issued forth on the kings road  michael said his uncle the reason that i am here is because i cannot endure those nephews of mine i find them intolerable  i daresay you do assented michael i never could stand them for a moment  they wouldnt let me speak continued the old gentleman bitterly i never was allowed to get a word in edgewise i was shut up at once with some impertinent remark they kept me on short allowance of pencils when i wished to make notes of the most absorbing interest the daily newspaper was guarded from me like a young baby from a gorilla now you know me michael i live for my calculations i live for my manifold and everchanging views of life pens and paper and the productions of the popular press are to me as important as food and drink and my life was growing quite intolerable when in the confusion of that fortunate railway accident at browndean i made my escape they must think me dead and are trying to deceive the world for the chance of the tontine  by the way how do you stand for money asked michael kindly  pecuniarily speaking i am rich returned the old man with cheerfulness i am living at present at the rate of one hundred a year with unlimited pens and paper the british museum at which to get books and all the newspapers i choose to read but its extraordinary how little a man of intellectual interest requires to bother with books in a progressive age the newspapers supply all the conclusions  ill tell you what said michael come and stay with me  michael said the old gentleman its very kind of you but you scarcely understand what a peculiar position i occupy there are some little financial complications as a guardian my efforts were not altogether blessed and not to put too fine a point upon the matter i am absolutely in the power of that vile fellow morris  you should be disguised cried michael eagerly i will lend you a pair of windowglass spectacles and some red sidewhiskers  i had already canvassed that idea replied the old gentleman but feared to awaken remark in my unpretentious lodgings the aristocracy i am well aware  but see here interrupted michael how do you come to have any money at all dont make a stranger of me uncle joseph i know all about the trust and the hash you made of it and the assignment you were forced to make to morris  joseph narrated his dealings with the bank  o but i say this wont do cried the lawyer youve put your foot in it you had no right to do what you did  the whole thing is mine michael protested the old gentleman i founded and nursed that business on principles entirely of my own  thats all very fine said the lawyer but you made an assignment you were forced to make it too even then your position was extremely shaky but now my dear sir it means the dock  it isnt possible cried joseph the law cannot be so unjust as that  and the cream of the thing interrupted michael with a sudden shout of laughter the cream of the thing is this that of course youve downed the leather business i must say uncle joseph you have strange ideas of law but i like your taste in humour  i see nothing to laugh at observed mr finsbury tartly  and talking of that has morris any power to sign for the firm asked michael  no one but myself replied joseph  poor devil of a morris o poor devil of a morris cried the lawyer in delight and his keeping up the farce that youre at home o morris the lord has delivered you into my hands let me see uncle joseph what do you suppose the leather business worth  it was worth a hundred thousand said joseph bitterly when it was in my hands but then there came a scotsmanit is supposed he had a certain talentit was entirely directed to bookkeepingno accountant in london could understand a word of any of his books and then there was morris who is perfectly incompetent and now it is worth very little morris tried to sell it last year and pogram and jarris offered only four thousand  i shall turn my attention to leather said michael with decision  you asked joseph i advise you not there is nothing in the whole field of commerce more surprising than the fluctuations of the leather market its sensitiveness may be described as morbid  and now uncle joseph what have you done with all that money asked the lawyer  paid it into a bank and drew twenty pounds answered mr finsbury promptly why  very well said michael tomorrow i shall send down a clerk with a cheque for a hundred and hell draw out the original sum and return it to the anglopatagonian with some sort of explanation which i will try to invent for you that will clear your feet and as morris cant touch a penny of it without forgery it will do no harm to my little scheme  but what am i to do asked joseph i cannot live upon nothing  dont you hear returned michael i send you a cheque for a hundred which leaves you eighty to go along upon and when thats done apply to me again  i would rather not be beholden to your bounty all the same said joseph biting at his white moustache i would rather live on my own money since i have it  michael grasped his arm will nothing make you believe he cried that i am trying to save you from dartmoor  his earnestness staggered the old man i must turn my attention to law he said it will be a new field for though of course i understand its general principles i have never really applied my mind to the details and this view of yours for example comes on me entirely by surprise but you may be right and of course at my time of lifefor i am no longer youngany really long term of imprisonment would be highly prejudicial but my dear nephew i have no claim on you you have no call to support me  thats all right said michael ill probably get it out of the leather business  and having taken down the old gentlemans address michael left him at the corner of a street  what a wonderful old muddler he reflected and what a singular thing is life i seem to be condemned to be the instrument of providence let me see what have i done today disposed of a dead body saved pitman saved my uncle joseph brightened up forsyth and drunk a devil of a lot of most indifferent liquor lets top off with a visit to my cousins and be the instrument of providence in earnest tomorrow i can turn my attention to leather tonight ill just make it lively for em in a friendly spirit  about a quarter of an hour later as the clocks were striking eleven the instrument of providence descended from a hansom and bidding the driver wait rapped at the door of no 16 john street  it was promptly opened by morris  o its you michael he said carefully blocking up the narrow opening its very late  michael without a word reached forth grasped morris warmly by the hand and gave it so extreme a squeeze that the sullen householder fell back profiting by this movement the lawyer obtained a footing in the lobby and marched into the diningroom with morris at his heels  wheres my uncle joseph demanded michael sitting down in the most comfortable chair  hes not been very well lately replied morris hes staying at browndean john is nursing him and i am alone as you see  michael smiled to himself i want to see him on particular business he said  you cant expect to see my uncle when you wont let me see your father returned morris  fiddlestick said michael my father is my father but joseph is just as much my uncle as hes yours and you have no right to sequestrate his person  i do no such thing said morris doggedly he is not well he is dangerously ill and nobody can see him  ill tell you what then said michael ill make a clean breast of it i have come down like the opossum morris i have come to compromise  poor morris turned as pale as death and then a flush of wrath against the injustice of mans destiny dyed his very temples what do you mean he cried i dont believe a word of it and when michael had assured him of his seriousness well then he cried with another deep flush i wont so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it  oho said michael queerly you say your uncle is dangerously ill and you wont compromise theres something very fishy about that  what do you mean cried morris hoarsely  i only say its fishy returned michael that is pertaining to the finny tribe  do you mean to insinuate anything cried morris stormily trying the high hand  insinuate repeated michael o dont lets begin to use awkward expressions let us drown our differences in a bottle like two affable kinsmen the two affable kinsmen sometimes attributed to shakespeare he added  morriss mind was labouring like a mill does he suspect or is this chance and stuff should i soap or should i bully soap he concluded it gains time well said he aloud and with rather a painful affectation of heartiness its long since we have had an evening together michael and though my habits as you know are very temperate i may as well make an exception excuse me one moment till i fetch a bottle of whisky from the cellar  no whisky for me said michael a little of the old still champagne or nothing  for a moment morris stood irresolute for the wine was very valuable the next he had quitted the room without a word his quick mind had perceived his advantage in thus dunning him for the cream of the cellar michael was playing into his hand one bottle he thought by george ill give him two this is no moment for economy and once the beast is drunk its strange if i dont wring his secret out of him  with two bottles accordingly he returned glasses were produced and morris filled them with hospitable grace  i drink to you cousin he cried gaily dont spare the winecup in my house  michael drank his glass deliberately standing at the table filled it again and returned to his chair carrying the bottle along with him  the spoils of war he said apologetically the weakest goes to the wall science morris science morris could think of no reply and for an appreciable interval silence reigned but two glasses of the still champagne produced a rapid change in michael  theres a want of vivacity about you morris he observed you may be deep but ill be hanged if youre vivacious  what makes you think me deep asked morris with an air of pleased simplicity  because you wont compromise said the lawyer youre deep dog morris very deep dog not t compromiseremarkable deep dog and a very good glass of wine its the only respectable feature in the finsbury family this wine rarer thing than a titlemuch rarer now a man with glass wine like this in cellar i wonder why wont compromise  well you wouldnt compromise before you know said the smiling morris turn about is fair play  i wonder why i wouldn compromise i wonder why you wouldn inquired michael i wonder why we each think the other wouldn s quite a remarrableremarkable problem he added triumphing over oral obstacles not without obvious pride wonder what we each thinkdont you  what do you suppose to have been my reason asked morris adroitly  michael looked at him and winked thats cool said he next thing youll ask me to help you out of the muddle i know im emissary of providence but not that kind you get out of it yourself like Æsop and the other fellow must be dreadful muddle for young orphan o forty leather business and all  i am sure i dont know what you mean said morris  not sure i know myself said michael this is exclent vintage sirexclent vintage nothing against the tipple only thing heres a valuable uncle disappeared now what i want to know wheres valuable uncle  i have told you he is at browndean answered morris furtively wiping his brow for these repeated hints began to tell upon him cruelly  very easy say brownbrowndeeno so easy after all cried michael easy say anythings easy say when you can say it what i don likes total disappearance of an uncle not businesslike and he wagged his head  it is all perfectly simple returned morris with laborious calm there is no mystery he stays at browndean where he got a shake in the accident  ah said michael got devil of a shake  why do you say that cried morris sharply  best possible authority told me so yourself said the lawyer but if you tell me contrary now of course im bound to believe either the one story or the other point isive upset this bottle still champagnes exclent thing carpetpoint is is valuable uncle deadanbury  morris sprang from his seat whats that you say he gasped  i say its exclent thing carpet replied michael rising exclent thing promote healthy action of the skin well its all one anyway give my love to uncle champagne  youre not going away said morris  awfly sorry ole man got to sit up sick friend said the wavering michael  you shall not go till you have explained your hints returned morris fiercely what do you mean what brought you here  no offence i trust said the lawyer turning round as he opened the door only doing my duty as shemishery of providence  groping his way to the frontdoor he opened it with some difficulty and descended the steps to the hansom the tired driver looked up as he approached and asked where he was to go next  michael observed that morris had followed him to the steps a brilliant inspiration came to him anything t give pain he reflected drive shcotlan yard he added aloud holding to the wheel to steady himself theres something devilish fishy cabby about those cousins mush be cleared up drive shcotlan yard  you dont mean that sir said the man with the ready sympathy of the lower orders for an intoxicated gentleman i had better take you home sir you can go to scotland yard tomorrow  is it as friend or as perfessional man you advise me not to go shcotlan yard tnight inquired michael all righ never min shcotlan yard drive gaiety bar  the gaiety bar is closed said the man  then home said michael with the same cheerfulness  where to sir  i dont remember im sure said michael entering the vehicle drive shcotlan yard and ask  but youll have a card said the man through the little aperture in the top give me your cardcase  what imagiimagination in a cabby cried the lawyer producing his cardcase and handing it to the driver  the man read it by the light of the lamp mr michael finsbury 233 kings road chelsea is that it sir  right you are cried michael drive there if you can see way     chapter x  gideon forsyth and the broadwood grand   the reader has perhaps read that remarkable work who put back the clock by e h b which appeared for several days upon the railway bookstalls and then vanished entirely from the face of the earth whether eating time makes the chief of his diet out of old editions whether providence has passed a special enactment on behalf of authors or whether these last have taken the law into their own hand bound themselves into a dark conspiracy with a password which i would die rather than reveal and night after night sally forth under some vigorous leader such as mr james payn or mr walter besant on their task of secret spoliationcertain it is at least that the old editions pass giving place to new to the proof it is believed there are now only three copies extant of who put back the clock one in the british museum successfully concealed by a wrong entry in the catalogue another in one of the cellars the cellar where the music accumulates of the advocates library at edinburgh and a third bound in morocco in the possession of gideon forsyth to account for the very different fate attending this third exemplar the readiest theory is to suppose that gideon admired the tale how to explain that admiration might appear to those who have perused the work more difficult but the weakness of a parent is extreme and gideon and not his uncle whose initials he had humorously borrowed was the author of who put back the clock he had never acknowledged it or only to some intimate friends while it was still in proof after its appearance and alarming failure the modesty of the novelist had become more pressing and the secret was now likely to be better kept than that of the authorship of waverley  a copy of the work for the date of my tale is already yesterday still figured in dusty solitude in the bookstall at waterloo and gideon as he passed with his ticket for hampton court smiled contemptuously at the creature of his thoughts what an idle ambition was the authors how far beneath him was the practice of that childish art with his hand closing on his first brief he felt himself a man at last and the muse who presides over the police romance a lady presumably of french extraction fled his neighbourhood and returned to join the dance round the springs of helicon among her grecian sisters  robust practical reflection still cheered the young barrister upon his journey again and again he selected the little countryhouse in its islet of great oaks which he was to make his future home like a prudent householder he projected improvements as he passed to one he added a stable to another a tenniscourt a third he supplied with a becoming rustic boathouse  how little a while ago he could not but reflect i was a careless young dog with no thought but to be comfortable i cared for nothing but boating and detective novels i would have passed an oldfashioned countryhouse with large kitchengarden stabling boathouse and spacious offices without so much as a look and certainly would have made no inquiry as to the drains how a man ripens with the years  the intelligent reader will perceive the ravages of miss hazeltine gideon had carried julia straight to mr bloomflelds house and that gentleman having been led to understand she was the victim of oppression had noisily espoused her cause he worked himself into a fine breathing heat in which to a man of his temperament action became needful  i do not know which is the worse he cried the fraudulent old villain or the unmanly young cub i will write to the pall mall and expose them nonsense sir they must be exposed its a public duty did you not tell me the fellow was a tory o the uncle is a radical lecturer is he no doubt the uncle has been grossly wronged but of course as you say that makes a change it becomes scarce so much a public duty  and he sought and instantly found a fresh outlet for his alacrity miss hazeltine he now perceived must be kept out of the way his houseboat was lying readyhe had returned but a day or two before from his usual cruise there was no place like a houseboat for concealment and that very morning in the teeth of the easterly gale mr and mrs bloomfield and miss julia hazeltine had started forth on their untimely voyage gideon pled in vain to be allowed to join the party no gid said his uncle you will be watched you must keep away from us nor had the barrister ventured to contest this strange illusion for he feared if he rubbed off any of the romance that mr bloomfield might weary of the whole affair and his discretion was rewarded for the squirradical laying a heavy hand upon his nephews shoulder had added these notable expressions i see what you are after gid but if youre going to get the girl you have to work sir  these pleasing sounds had cheered the barrister all day as he sat reading in chambers they continued to form the groundbase of his manly musings as he was whirled to hampton court even when he landed at the station and began to pull himself together for his delicate interview the voice of uncle ned and the eyes of julia were not forgotten  but now it began to rain surprises in all hampton court there was no kurnaul villa no count tarnow and no count this was strange but viewed in the light of the incoherency of his instructions not perhaps inexplicable mr dickson had been lunching and he might have made some fatal oversight in the address what was the thoroughly prompt manly and businesslike step thought gideon and he answered himself at once a telegram very laconic speedily the wires were flashing the following very important missive dickson langham hotel villa and persons both unknown here suppose erroneous address follow self next trainforsyth and at the langham hotel sure enough with a brow expressive of despatch and intellectual effort gideon descended not long after from a smoking hansom  i do not suppose that gideon will ever forget the langham hotel no count tarnow was one thing no john dickson and no ezra thomas quite another how why and what next danced in his bewildered brain from every centre of what we playfully call the human intellect incongruous messages were telegraphed and before the hubbub of dismay had quite subsided the barrister found himself driving furiously for his chambers there was at least a cave of refuge it was at least a place to think in and he climbed the stair put his key in the lock and opened the door with some approach to hope  it was all dark within for the night had some time fallen but gideon knew his room he knew where the matches stood on the end of the chimneypiece and he advanced boldly and in so doing dashed himself against a heavy body where slightly altering the expressions of the song no heavy body should have been there had been nothing there when gideon went out he had locked the door behind him he had found it locked on his return no one could have entered the furniture could not have changed its own position and yet undeniably there was a something there he thrust out his hands in the darkness yes there was something something large something smooth something cold  heaven forgive me said gideon it feels like a piano  and the next moment he remembered the vestas in his waistcoatpocket and had struck a light  it was indeed a piano that met his doubtful gaze a vast and costly instrument stained with the rains of the afternoon and defaced with recent scratches the light of the vesta was reflected from the varnished sides like a star in quiet water and in the farther end of the room the shadow of that strange visitor loomed bulkily and wavered on the wall  gideon let the match burn to his fingers and the darkness closed once more on his bewilderment then with trembling hands he lit the lamp and drew near near or far there was no doubt of the fact the thing was a piano there where by all the laws of god and man it was impossible that it should bethere the thing impudently stood gideon threw open the keyboard and struck a chord not a sound disturbed the quiet of the room is there anything wrong with me he thought with a pang and drawing in a seat obstinately persisted in his attempts to ravish silence now with sparkling arpeggios now with a sonata of beethovens which in happier days he knew to be one of the loudest pieces of that powerful composer still not a sound he gave the broadwood two great bangs with his clenched first all was still as the grave  the young barrister started to his feet  i am starkstaring mad he cried aloud and no one knows it but myself gods worst curse has fallen on me  his fingers encountered his watchchain instantly he had plucked forth his watch and held it to his ear he could hear it ticking  i am not deaf he said aloud i am only insane my mind has quitted me for ever  he looked uneasily about the room and gazed with lacklustre eyes at the chair in which mr dickson had installed himself the end of a cigar lay near on the fender  no he thought i dont believe that was a dream but god knows my mind is failing rapidly i seem to be hungry for instance its probably another hallucination still i might try i shall have one more good meal i shall go to the café royal and may possibly be removed from there direct to the asylum  he wondered with morbid interest as he descended the stairs how he would first betray his terrible conditionwould he attack a waiter or eat glassand when he had mounted into a cab he bade the man drive to nichols with a lurking fear that there was no such place  the flaring gassy entrance of the café speedily set his mind at rest he was cheered besides to recognise his favourite waiter his orders appeared to be coherent the dinner when it came was quite a sensible meal and he ate it with enjoyment upon my word he reflected i am about tempted to indulge a hope have i been hasty have i done what robert skill would have done robert skill i need scarcely mention was the name of the principal character in who put back the clock it had occurred to the author as a brilliant and probable invention to readers of a critical turn robert appeared scarce upon a level with his surname but it is the difficulty of the police romance that the reader is always a man of such vastly greater ingenuity than the writer in the eyes of his creator however robert skill was a word to conjure with the thought braced and spurred him what that brilliant creature would have done gideon would do also this frame of mind is not uncommon the distressed general the baited divine the hesitating author decide severally to do what napoleon what st paul what shakespeare would have done and there remains only the minor question what is that in gideons case one thing was clear skill was a man of singular decision he would have taken some step whatever it was at once and the only step that gideon could think of was to return to his chambers  this being achieved all further inspiration failed him and he stood pitifully staring at the instrument of his confusion to touch the keys again was more than he durst venture on whether they had maintained their former silence or responded with the tones of the last trump it would have equally dethroned his resolution it may be a practical jest he reflected though it seems elaborate and costly and yet what else can it be it must be a practical jest and just then his eye fell upon a feature which seemed corroborative of that view the pagoda of cigars which michael had erected ere he left the chambers why that reflected gideon it seems entirely irresponsible and drawing near he gingerly demolished it a key he thought why that and why so conspicuously placed he made the circuit of the instrument and perceived the keyhole at the back aha this is what the key is for said he they wanted me to look inside stranger and stranger and with that he turned the key and raised the lid  in what antics of agony in what fits of flighty resolution in what collapses of despair gideon consumed the night it would be ungenerous to inquire too closely  that trill of tiny song with which the eavesbirds of london welcome the approach of day found him limp and rumpled and bloodshot and with a mind still vacant of resource he rose and looked forth unrejoicingly on blinded windows an empty street and the grey daylight dotted with the yellow lamps there are mornings when the city seems to awake with a sick headache this was one of them and still the twittering reveillé of the sparrows stirred in gideons spirit  day here he thought and i still helpless this must come to an end and he locked up the piano put the key in his pocket and set forth in quest of coffee as he went his mind trudged for the hundredth time a certain millroad of terrors misgivings and regrets to call in the police to give up the body to cover london with handbills describing john dickson and ezra thomas to fill the papers with paragraphs mysterious occurrence in the templemr forsyth admitted to bail this was one course an easy course a safe course but not the more he reflected on it not a pleasant one for was it not to publish abroad a number of singular facts about himself a child ought to have seen through the story of these adventurers and he had gaped and swallowed it a barrister of the least selfrespect should have refused to listen to clients who came before him in a manner so irregular and he had listened and o if he had only listened but he had gone upon their errandhe a barrister uninstructed even by the shadow of a solicitorupon an errand fit only for a private detective and alasand for the hundredth time the blood surged to his browhe had taken their money no said he the thing is as plain as st pauls i shall be dishonoured i have smashed my career for a fivepound note  between the possibility of being hanged in all innocence and the certainty of a public and merited disgrace no gentleman of spirit could long hesitate after three gulps of that hot snuffy and muddy beverage that passes on the streets of london for a decoction of the coffee berry gideons mind was made up he would do without the police he must face the other side of the dilemma and be robert skill in earnest what would robert skill have done how does a gentleman dispose of a dead body honestly come by he remembered the inimitable story of the hunchback reviewed its course and dismissed it for a worthless guide it was impossible to prop a corpse on the corner of tottenham court road without arousing fatal curiosity in the bosoms of the passersby as for lowering it down a london chimney the physical obstacles were insurmountable to get it on board a train and drop it out or on the top of an omnibus and drop it off were equally out of the question to get it on a yacht and drop it overboard was more conceivable but for a man of moderate means it seemed extravagant the hire of the yacht was in itself a consideration the subsequent support of the whole crew which seemed a necessary consequence was simply not to be thought of his uncle and the houseboat here occurred in very luminous colours to his mind a musical composer say of the name of jimson might very well suffer like hogarths musician before him from the disturbances of london he might very well be pressed for time to finish an operasay the comic opera orange pekoeorange pekoe music by jimsonthis young maëstro one of the most promising of our recent english schoolvigorous entrance of the drums etcthe whole character of jimson and his music arose in bulk before the mind of gideon what more likely than jimsons arrival with a grand piano say at padwick and his residence in a houseboat alone with the unfinished score of orange pekoe his subsequent disappearance leaving nothing behind but an empty piano case it might be more difficult to account for and yet even that was susceptible of explanation for suppose jimson had gone mad over a fugal passage and had thereupon destroyed the accomplice of his infamy and plunged into the welcome river what end on the whole more probable for a modern musician  by jove ill do it cried gideon jimson is the boy     chapter xi  the maËstro jimson   mr edward hugh bloomfield having announced his intention to stay in the neighbourhood of maidenhead what more probable than that the maëstro jimson should turn his mind toward padwick near this pleasant riverside village he remembered to have observed an ancient weedy houseboat lying moored beside a tuft of willows it had stirred in him in his careless hours as he pulled down the river under a more familiar name a certain sense of the romantic and when the nice contrivance of his story was already complete in his mind he had come near pulling it all down again like an ungrateful clock in order to introduce a chapter in which richard skill who was always being decoyed somewhere should be decoyed on board that lonely hulk by lord bellew and the american desperado gin sling it was fortunate he had not done so he reflected since the hulk was now required for very different purposes  jimson a man of inconspicuous costume but insinuating manners had little difficulty in finding the hireling who had charge of the houseboat and still less in persuading him to resign his care the rent was almost nominal the entry immediate the key was exchanged against a suitable advance in money and jimson returned to town by the afternoon train to see about despatching his piano  i will be down tomorrow he had said reassuringly my opera is waited for with such impatience you know  and sure enough about the hour of noon on the following day jimson might have been observed ascending the riverside road that goes from padwick to great haverham carrying in one hand a basket of provisions and under the other arm a leather case containing it is to be conjectured the score of orange pekoe it was october weather the stonegrey sky was full of larks the leaden mirror of the thames brightened with autumnal foliage and the fallen leaves of the chestnuts chirped under the composers footing there is no time of the year in england more courageous and jimson though he was not without his troubles whistled as he went  a little above padwick the river lies very solitary on the opposite shore the trees of a private park enclose the view the chimneys of the mansion just pricking forth above their clusters on the near side the path is bordered by willows close among these lay the houseboat a thing so soiled by the tears of the overhanging willows so grown upon with parasites so decayed so battered so neglected such a haunt of rats so advertised a storehouse of rheumatic agonies that the heart of an intending occupant might well recoil a plank by way of flying drawbridge joined it to the shore and it was a dreary moment for jimson when he pulled this after him and found himself alone on this unwholesome fortress he could hear the rats scuttle and flop in the abhorred interior the key cried among the wards like a thing in pain the sittingroom was deep in dust and smelt strong of bilgewater it could not be called a cheerful spot even for a composer absorbed in beloved toil how much less for a young gentleman haunted by alarms and awaiting the arrival of a corpse  he sat down cleared away a piece of the table and attacked the cold luncheon in his basket in case of any subsequent inquiry into the fate of jimson it was desirable he should be little seen in other words that he should spend the day entirely in the house to this end and further to corroborate his fable he had brought in the leather case not only writing materials but a ream of largesize music paper such as he considered suitable for an ambitious character like jimsons  and now to work said he when he had satisfied his appetite we must leave traces of the wretched mans activity and he wrote in bold characters        orange pekoe         op 17       j b jimson   vocal and p f score  i suppose they never do begin like this reflected gideon but then its quite out of the question for me to tackle a full score and jimson was so unconventional a dedication would be found convincing i believe dedicated to let me see to william ewart gladstone by his obedient servant the composer and now some music i had better avoid the overture it seems to present difficulties lets give an air for the tenor keyo something modernseven sharps and he made a businesslike signature across the staves and then paused and browsed for a while on the handle of his pen melody with no better inspiration than a sheet of paper is not usually found to spring unbidden in the mind of the amateur nor is the key of seven sharps a place of much repose to the untried he cast away that sheet it will help to build up the character of jimson gideon remarked and again waited on the muse in various keys and on divers sheets of paper but all with results so inconsiderable that he stood aghast its very odd thought he i seem to have less fancy than i thought or this is an offday with me yet jimson must leave something and again he bent himself to the task  presently the penetrating chill of the houseboat began to attack the very seat of life he desisted from his unremunerative trial and to the audible annoyance of the rats walked briskly up and down the cabin still he was cold this is all nonsense said he i dont care about the risk but i will not catch a catarrh i must get out of this den  he stepped on deck and passing to the bow of his embarkation looked for the first time up the river he started only a few hundred yards above another houseboat lay moored among the willows it was very spickandspan an elegant canoe hung at the stern the windows were concealed by snowy curtains a flag floated from a staff the more gideon looked at it the more there mingled with his disgust a sense of impotent surprise it was very like his uncles houseboat it was exceedingly likeit was identical but for two circumstances he could have sworn it was the same the first that his uncle had gone to maidenhead might be explained away by that flightiness of purpose which is so common a trait among the more than usually manly the second however was conclusive it was not in the least like mr bloomfield to display a banner on his floating residence and if he ever did it would certainly be dyed in hues of emblematical propriety now the squirradical like the vast majority of the more manly had drawn knowledge at the wells of cambridgehe was wooden spoon in the year 1850 and the flag upon the houseboat streamed on the afternoon air with the colours of that seat of toryism that cradle of puseyism that home of the inexact and the effeteoxford  still it was strangely like thought gideon  and as he thus looked and thought the door opened and a young lady stepped forth on deck the barrister dropped and fled into his cabinit was julia hazeltine through the window he watched her draw in the canoe get on board of it cast off and come dropping down stream in his direction  well all is up now said he and he fell on a seat  goodafternoon miss said a voice on the water gideon knew it for the voice of his landlord  goodafternoon replied julia but i dont know who you are do i o yes i do though you are the nice man that gave us leave to sketch from the old houseboat  gideons heart leaped with fear  thats it returned the man and what i wanted to say was as you couldnt do it any more you see ive let it  let it cried julia  let it for a month said the man seems strange dont it cant see what the party wants with it  it seems very romantic of him i think said julia what sort of a person is he  julia in her canoe the landlord in his wherry were close alongside and holding on by the gunwale of the houseboat so that not a word was lost on gideon  hes a musicman said the landlord or at least thats what he told me miss come down here to write an opra  really cried julia i never heard of anything so delightful why we shall be able to slip down at night and hear him improvise what is his name  jimson said the man  jimson repeated julia and interrogated her memory in vain but indeed our rising school of english music boasts so many professors that we rarely hear of one till he is made a baronet are you sure you have it right  made him spell it to me replied the landlord jimsonjimson and his opras calledsome kind of tea  some kind of tea cried the girl what a very singular name for an opera what can it be about and gideon heard her pretty laughter flow abroad we must try to get acquainted with this mr jimson i feel sure he must be nice  well miss im afraid i must be going on ive got to be at haverham you see  o dont let me keep you you kind man said julia goodafternoon  goodafternoon to you miss  gideon sat in the cabin a prey to the most harrowing thoughts here he was anchored to a rotting houseboat soon to be anchored to it still more emphatically by the presence of the corpse and here was the country buzzing about him and young ladies already proposing pleasure parties to surround his house at night well that meant the gallows and much he cared for that what troubled him now was julias indescribable levity that girl would scrape acquaintance with anybody she had no reserve none of the enamel of the lady she was familiar with a brute like his landlord she took an immediate interest which she lacked even the delicacy to conceal in a creature like jimson he could conceive her asking jimson to have tea with her and it was for a girl like this that a man like gideon down manly heart  he was interrupted by a sound that sent him whipping behind the door in a trice miss hazeltine had stepped on board the houseboat her sketch was promising judging from the stillness she supposed jimson not yet come and she had decided to seize occasion and complete the work of art down she sat therefore in the bow produced her block and watercolours and was soon singing over what used to be called the ladylike accomplishment now and then indeed her song was interrupted as she searched in her memory for some of the odious little receipts by means of which the game is practisedor used to be practised in the brave days of old they say the world and those ornaments of the world young ladies are become more sophisticated now but julia had probably studied under pitman and she stood firm in the old ways  gideon meanwhile stood behind the door afraid to move afraid to breathe afraid to think of what must follow racked by confinement and borne to the ground with tedium this particular phase he felt with gratitude could not last for ever whatever impended even the gallows he bitterly and perhaps erroneously reflected could not fail to be a relief to calculate cubes occurred to him as an ingenious and even profitable refuge from distressing thoughts and he threw his manhood into that dreary exercise  thus then were these two young persons occupiedgideon attacking the perfect number with resolution julia vigorously stippling incongruous colours on her block when providence despatched into these waters a steamlaunch asthmatically panting up the thames all along the banks the water swelled and fell and the reeds rustled the houseboat itself that ancient stationary creature became suddenly imbued with life and rolled briskly at her moorings like a seagoing ship when she begins to smell the harbour bar the wash had nearly died away and the quick panting of the launch sounded already faint and far off when gideon was startled by a cry from julia peering through the window he beheld her staring disconsolately down stream at the fastvanishing canoe the barrister whatever were his faults displayed on this occasion a promptitude worthy of his hero robert skill with one effort of his mind he foresaw what was about to follow with one movement of his body he dropped to the floor and crawled under the table  julia on her part was not yet alive to her position she saw she had lost the canoe and she looked forward with something less than avidity to her next interview with mr bloomfield but she had no idea that she was imprisoned for she knew of the plank bridge  she made the circuit of the house and found the door open and the bridge withdrawn it was plain then that jimson must have come plain too that he must be on board he must be a very shy man to have suffered this invasion of his residence and made no sign and her courage rose higher at the thought he must come now she must force him from his privacy for the plank was too heavy for her single strength so she tapped upon the open door then she tapped again  mr jimson she cried mr jimson here comeyou must come you know sooner or later for i cant get off without you o dont be so exceedingly silly o please come  still there was no reply  if he is here he must be mad she thought with a little fear and the next moment she remembered he had probably gone aboard like herself in a boat in that case she might as well see the houseboat and she pushed open the door and stepped in under the table where he lay smothered with dust gideons heart stood still  there were the remains of jimsons lunch he likes rather nice things to eat she thought o i am sure he is quite a delightful man i wonder if he is as goodlooking as mr forsyth mrs jimsoni dont believe it sounds as nice as mrs forsyth but then gideon is so really odious and here is some of his music too this is delightful orange pekoeo thats what he meant by some kind of tea and she trilled with laughter adagio molto espressivo sempre legato she read next for the literary part of a composers business gideon was well equipped how very strange to have all these directions and only three or four notes o heres another with some more andante patetico and she began to glance over the music o dear me she thought he must be terribly modern it all seems discords to me lets try the air it is very strange it seems familiar she began to sing it and suddenly broke off with laughter why its tommy make room for your uncle she cried aloud so that the soul of gideon was filled with bitterness andante patetico indeed the man must be a mere impostor  and just at this moment there came a confused scuffling sound from underneath the table a strange note like that of a barndoor fowl ushered in a most explosive sneeze the head of the sufferer was at the same time brought smartly in contact with the boards above and the sneeze was followed by a hollow groan  julia fled to the door and there with the salutary instinct of the brave turned and faced the danger there was no pursuit the sounds continued below the table a crouching figure was indistinctly to be seen jostled by the throes of a sneezingfit and that was all  surely thought julia this is most unusual behaviour he cannot be a man of the world  meanwhile the dust of years had been disturbed by the young barristers convulsions and the sneezingfit was succeeded by a passionate access of coughing  julia began to feel a certain interest i am afraid you are really quite ill she said drawing a little nearer please dont let me put you out and do not stay under that table mr jimson indeed it cannot be good for you  mr jimson only answered by a distressing cough and the next moment the girl was on her knees and their faces had almost knocked together under the table  o my gracious goodness exclaimed miss hazeltine and sprang to her feet mr forsyth gone mad  i am not mad said the gentleman ruefully extricating himself from his position dearest miss hazeltine i vow to you upon my knees i am not mad  you are not she cried panting  i know he said that to a superficial eye my conduct may appear unconventional  if you are not mad it was no conduct at all cried the girl with a flash of colour and showed you did not care one penny for my feelings  this is the very devil and all i knowi admit that cried gideon with a great effort of manly candour  it was abominable conduct said julia with energy  i know it must have shaken your esteem said the barrister but dearest miss hazeltine i beg of you to hear me out my behaviour strange as it may seem is not unsusceptible of explanation and i positively cannot and will not consent to continue to try to exist withoutwithout the esteem of one whom i admirethe moment is ill chosen i am well aware of that but i repeat the expressionone whom i admire  a touch of amusement appeared on miss hazeltines face very well said she come out of this dreadfully cold place and let us sit down on deck the barrister dolefully followed her now said she making herself comfortable against the end of the house go on i will hear you out and then seeing him stand before her with so much obvious disrelish to the task she was suddenly overcome with laughter julias laugh was a thing to ravish lovers she rolled her mirthful descant with the freedom and the melody of a blackbirds song upon the river and repeated by the echoes of the farther bank it seemed a thing in its own place and a sound native to the open air there was only one creature who heard it without joy and that was her unfortunate admirer  miss hazeltine he said in a voice that tottered with annoyance i speak as your sincere wellwisher but this can only be called levity  julia made great eyes at him  i cant withdraw the word he said already the freedom with which i heard you hobnobbing with a boatman gave me exquisite pain then there was a want of reserve about jimson  but jimson appears to be yourself objected julia  i am far from denying that cried the barrister but you did not know it at the time what could jimson be to you who was jimson miss hazeltine it cut me to the heart  really this seems to me to be very silly returned julia with severe decision you have behaved in the most extraordinary manner you pretend you are able to explain your conduct and instead of doing so you begin to attack me  i am well aware of that replied gideon ii will make a clean breast of it when you know all the circumstances you will be able to excuse me  and sitting down beside her on the deck he poured forth his miserable history  o mr forsyth she cried when he had done i amsosorry i wish i hadnt laughed at youonly you know you really were so exceedingly funny but i wish i hadnt and i wouldnt either if i had only known and she gave him her hand  gideon kept it in his own you do not think the worse of me for this he asked tenderly  because you have been so silly and got into such dreadful trouble you poor boy no cried julia and in the warmth of the moment reached him her other hand you may count on me she added  really said gideon  really and really replied the girl  i do then and i will cried the young man i admit the moment is not well chosen but i have no friendsto speak of  no more have i said julia but dont you think its perhaps time you gave me back my hands  la ci darem la mano said the barrister the merest moment more i have so few friends he added  i thought it was considered such a bad account of a young man to have no friends observed julia  o but i have crowds of friends cried gideon thats not what i mean i feel the moment is ill chosen but o julia if you could only see yourself  mr forsyth  dont call me by that beastly name cried the youth call me gideon  o never that from julia besides we have known each other such a short time  not at all protested gideon we met at bournemouth ever so long ago i never forgot you since say you never forgot me say you never forgot me and call me gideon  isnt this rathera want of reserve about jimson inquired the girl  o i know i am an ass cried the barrister and i dont care a halfpenny i know im an ass and you may laugh at me to your hearts delight and as julias lips opened with a smile he once more dropped into music theres the land of cherry isle he sang courting her with his eyes  its like an opera said julia rather faintly  what should it be said gideon am i not jimson it would be strange if i did not serenade my love o yes i mean the word my julia and i mean to win you i am in dreadful trouble and i have not a penny of my own and i have cut the silliest figure and yet i mean to win you julia look at me if you can and tell me no  she looked at him and whatever her eyes may have told him it is to be supposed he took a pleasure in the message for he read it a long while  and uncle ned will give us some money to go on upon in the meanwhile he said at last  well i call that cool said a cheerful voice at his elbow  gideon and julia sprang apart with wonderful alacrity the latter annoyed to observe that although they had never moved since they sat down they were now quite close together both presenting faces of a very heightened colour to the eyes of mr edward hugh bloomfield that gentleman coming up the river in his boat had captured the truant canoe and divining what had happened had thought to steal a march upon miss hazeltine at her sketch he had unexpectedly brought down two birds with one stone and as he looked upon the pair of flushed and breathless culprits the pleasant human instinct of the matchmaker softened his heart  well i call that cool he repeated you seem to count very securely upon uncle ned but look here gid i thought i had told you to keep away  to keep away from maidenhead replied gid but how should i expect to find you here  there is something in that mr bloomfield admitted you see i thought it better that even you should be ignorant of my address those rascals the finsburys would have wormed it out of you and just to put them off the scent i hoisted these abominable colours but that is not all gid you promised me to work and here i find you playing the fool at padwick  please mr bloomfield you must not be hard on mr forsyth said julia poor boy he is in dreadful straits  whats this gid inquired the uncle have you been fighting or is it a bill  these in the opinion of the squirradical were the two misfortunes incident to gentlemen and indeed both were culled from his own career he had once put his name as a matter of form on a friends paper it had cost him a cool thousand and the friend had gone about with the fear of death upon him ever since and never turned a corner without scouting in front of him for mr bloomfield and the oaken staff as for fighting the squirradical was always on the brink of it and once when in the character of president of a radical club he had cleared out the hall of his opponents things had gone even further mr holtum the conservative candidate who lay so long on the bed of sickness was prepared to swear to mr bloomfield i will swear to it in any courtit was the hand of that brute that struck me down he was reported to have said and when he was thought to be sinking it was known that he had made an antemortem statement in that sense it was a cheerful day for the squirradical when holtum was restored to his brewery  its much worse than that said gideon a combination of circumstances really providentially unjustain fact a syndicate of murderers seem to have perceived my latent ability to rid them of the traces of their crime its a legal study after all you see and with these words gideon for the second time that day began to describe the adventures of the broadwood grand  i must write to the times cried mr bloomfield  do you want to get me disbarred asked gideon  disbarred come it cant be as bad as that said his uncle its a good honest liberal government thats in and they would certainly move at my request thank god the days of tory jobbery are at an end  it wouldnt do uncle ned said gideon  but youre not mad enough cried mr bloomfield to persist in trying to dispose of it yourself  there is no other path open to me said gideon  its not commonsense and i will not hear of it cried mr bloomfield i command you positively gid to desist from this criminal interference  very well then i hand it over to you said gideon and you can do what you like with the dead body  god forbid ejaculated the president of the radical club ill have nothing to do with it  then you must allow me to do the best i can returned his nephew believe me i have a distinct talent for this sort of difficulty  we might forward it to that pesthouse the conservative club observed mr bloomfield it might damage them in the eyes of their constituents and it could be profitably worked up in the local journal  if you see any political capital in the thing said gideon you may have it for me  no no gidno no i thought you might i will have no hand in the thing on reflection its highly undesirable that either i or miss hazeltine should linger here we might be observed said the president looking up and down the river and in my public position the consequences would be painful for the party and at any rate its dinnertime  what cried gideon plunging for his watch and so it is great heaven the piano should have been here hours ago  mr bloomfield was clambering back into his boat but at these words he paused  i saw it arrive myself at the station i hired a carrier man he had a round to make but he was to be here by four at the latest cried the barrister no doubt the piano is open and the body found  you must fly at once cried mr bloomfield its the only manly step  but suppose its all right wailed gideon suppose the piano comes and i am not here to receive it i shall have hanged myself by my cowardice no uncle ned inquiries must be made in padwick i dare not go of course but you mayyou could hang about the police office dont you see  no gidno my dear nephew said mr bloomfield with the voice of one on the rack i regard you with the most sacred affection and i thank god i am an englishmanand all that but notnot the police gid  then you desert me said gideon say it plainly  far from it far from it protested mr bloomfield i only propose caution commonsense gid should always be an englishmans guide  will you let me speak said julia i think gideon had better leave this dreadful houseboat and wait among the willows over there if the piano comes then he could step out and take it in and if the police come he could slip into our houseboat and there neednt be any more jimson at all he could go to bed and we could burn his clothes couldnt we in the steamlaunch and then really it seems as if it would be all right mr bloomfield is so respectable you know and such a leading character it would be quite impossible even to fancy that he could be mixed up with it  this young lady has strong commonsense said the squirradical  o i dont think im at all a fool said julia with conviction  but what if neither of them come asked gideon what shall i do then  why then said she you had better go down to the village after dark and i can go with you and then i am sure you could never be suspected and even if you were i could tell them it was altogether a mistake  i will not permit thati will not suffer miss hazeltine to go cried mr bloomfield  why asked julia  mr bloomfield had not the least desire to tell her why for it was simply a craven fear of being drawn himself into the imbroglio but with the usual tactics of a man who is ashamed of himself he took the high hand god forbid my dear miss hazeltine that i should dictate to a lady on the question of propriety he began  o is that all interrupted julia then we must go all three  caught thought the squirradical     chapter xii  positively the last appearance of the broadwood grand   england is supposed to be unmusical but without dwelling on the patronage extended to the organgrinder without seeking to found any argument on the prevalence of the jews trump there is surely one instrument that may be said to be national in the fullest acceptance of the word the herdboy in the broom already musical in the days of father chaucer startles and perhaps pains the lark with this exiguous pipe and in the hands of the skilled bricklayer    the thing becomes a trumpet whence he blows  as a general rule either the british grenadiers or cherry ripe the latter air is indeed the shibboleth and diploma piece of the penny whistler i hazard a guess it was originally composed for this instrument it is singular enough that a man should be able to gain a livelihood or even to tide over a period of unemployment by the display of his proficiency upon the penny whistle still more so that the professional should almost invariably confine himself to cherry ripe but indeed singularities surround the subject thick like blackberries why for instance should the pipe be called a penny whistle i think no one ever bought it for a penny why should the alternative name be tin whistle i am grossly deceived if it be made of tin lastly in what deaf catacomb in what earless desert does the beginner pass the excruciating interval of his apprenticeship we have all heard people learning the piano the fiddle and the cornet but the young of the penny whistler like that of the salmon is occult from observation he is never heard until proficient and providence perhaps alarmed by the works of mr mallock defends human hearing from his first attempts upon the upper octave  a really noteworthy thing was taking place in a green lane not far from padwick on the bench of a carriers cart there sat a towheaded lanky modestlooking youth the reins were on his lap the whip lay behind him in the interior of the cart the horse proceeded without guidance or encouragement the carrier or the carriers man rapt into a higher sphere than that of his daily occupations his looks dwelling on the skies devoted himself wholly to a brandnew d penny whistle whence he diffidently endeavoured to elicit that pleasing melody the ploughboy to any observant person who should have chanced to saunter in that lane the hour would have been thrilling here at last he would have said is the beginner  the towheaded youth whose name was harker had just encored himself for the nineteenth time when he was struck into the extreme of confusion by the discovery that he was not alone  there you have it cried a manly voice from the side of the road thats as good as i want to hear perhaps a leetle oilier in the run the voice suggested with meditative gusto give it us again  harker glanced from the depths of his humiliation at the speaker he beheld a powerful sunbrown cleanshaven fellow about forty years of age striding beside the cart with a noncommissioned military bearing and as he strode spinning in the air a cane the fellows clothes were very bad but he looked clean and selfreliant  im only a beginner gasped the blushing harker i didnt think anybody could hear me  well i like that returned the other youre a pretty old beginner come ill give you a lead myself give us a seat here beside you  the next moment the military gentleman was perched on the cart pipe in hand he gave the instrument a knowing rattle on the shaft mouthed it appeared to commune for a moment with the muse and dashed into the girl i left behind me he was a great rather than a fine performer he lacked the birdlike richness he could scarce have extracted all the honey out of cherry ripe he did not fearhe even ostentatiously displayed and seemed to revel inthe shrillness of the instrument but in fire speed precision evenness and fluency in linked agility of jimmya technical expression by your leave answering to warblers on the bagpipe and perhaps above all in that inspiring sideglance of the eye with which he followed the effect and as by a human appeal eked out the insufficiency of his performance in these the fellow stood without a rival harker listened the girl i left behind me filled him with despair the soldiers joy carried him beyond jealousy into generous enthusiasm  turn about said the military gentleman offering the pipe  o not after you cried harker youre a professional  no said his companion an amatyure like yourself thats one style of play yours is the other and i like it best but i began when i was a boy you see before my taste was formed when youre my age youll play that thing like a cornetàpiston give us that air again how does it go and he affected to endeavour to recall the ploughboy  a timid insane hope sprang in the breast of harker was it possible was there something in his playing it had indeed seemed to him at times as if he got a kind of a richness out of it was he a genius meantime the military gentleman stumbled over the air  no said the unhappy harker thats not quite it it goes this wayjust to show you and taking the pipe between his lips he sealed his doom when he had played the air and then a second time and a third when the military gentleman had tried it once more and once more failed when it became clear to harker that he the blushing débutant was actually giving a lesson to this fullgrown flutistand the flutist under his care was not very brilliantly progressinghow am i to tell what floods of glory brightened the autumnal countryside how unless the reader were an amateur himself describe the heights of idiotic vanity to which the carrier climbed one significant fact shall paint the situation thenceforth it was harker who played and the military gentleman listened and approved  as he listened however he did not forget the habit of soldierly precaution looking both behind and before he looked behind and computed the value of the carriers load divining the contents of the brownpaper parcels and the portly hamper and briefly setting down the grand piano in the brandnew pianocase as difficult to get rid of he looked before and spied at the corner of the green lane a little country publichouse embowered in roses ill have a shy at it concluded the military gentleman and roundly proposed a glass  well im not a drinking man said harker  look here now cut in the other ill tell you who i am im coloursergeant brand of the blankth thatll tell you if im a drinking man or not it might and it might not thus a greek chorus would have intervened and gone on to point out how very far it fell short of telling why the sergeant was tramping a country lane in tatters or even to argue that he must have pretermitted some while ago his labours for the general defence and in the interval possibly turned his attention to oakum but there was no greek chorus present and the man of war went on to contend that drinking was one thing and a friendly glass another  in the blue lion which was the name of the country publichouse coloursergeant brand introduced his new friend mr harker to a number of ingenious mixtures calculated to prevent the approaches of intoxication these he explained to be rekisite in the service so that a selfrespecting officer should always appear upon parade in a condition honourable to his corps the most efficacious of these devices was to lace a pint of mild ale with twopenceworth of london gin i am pleased to hand in this recipe to the discerning reader who may find it useful even in civil station for its effect upon mr harker was revolutionary he must be helped on board his own waggon where he proceeded to display a spirit entirely given over to mirth and music alternately hooting with laughter to which the sergeant hastened to bear chorus and incoherently tootling on the pipe the man of war meantime unostentatiously possessed himself of the reins it was plain he had a taste for the secluded beauties of an english landscape for the cart although it wandered under his guidance for some time was never observed to issue on the dusty highway journeying between hedge and ditch and for the most part under overhanging boughs it was plain besides he had an eye to the true interests of mr harker for though the cart drew up more than once at the doors of publichouses it was only the sergeant who set foot to ground and being equipped himself with a quart bottle once more proceeded on his rural drive  to give any idea of the complexity of the sergeants course a map of that part of middlesex would be required and my publisher is averse from the expense suffice it that a little after the night had closed the cart was brought to a standstill in a woody road where the sergeant lifted from among the parcels and tenderly deposited upon the wayside the inanimate form of harker  if you cometo before daylight thought the sergeant i shall be surprised for one  from the various pockets of the slumbering carrier he gently collected the sum of seventeen shillings and eightpence sterling and getting once more into the cart drove thoughtfully away  if i was exactly sure of where i was it would be a good job he reflected anyway heres a corner  he turned it and found himself upon the riverside a little above him the lights of a houseboat shone cheerfully and already close at hand so close that it was impossible to avoid their notice three persons a lady and two gentlemen were deliberately drawing near the sergeant put his trust in the convenient darkness of the night and drove on to meet them one of the gentlemen who was of a portly figure walked in the midst of the fairway and presently held up a staff by way of signal  my man have you seen anything of a carriers cart he cried  dark as it was it seemed to the sergeant as though the slimmer of the two gentlemen had made a motion to prevent the other speaking and finding himself too late had skipped aside with some alacrity at another season sergeant brand would have paid more attention to the fact but he was then immersed in the perils of his own predicament  a carriers cart said he with a perceptible uncertainty of voice no sir  ah said the portly gentleman and stood aside to let the sergeant pass the lady appeared to bend forward and study the cart with every mark of sharpened curiosity the slimmer gentleman still keeping in the rear  i wonder what the devil they would be at thought sergeant brand and looking fearfully back he saw the trio standing together in the midst of the way like folk consulting the bravest of military heroes are not always equal to themselves as to their reputation and fear on some singular provocation will find a lodgment in the most unfamiliar bosom the word detective might have been heard to gurgle in the sergeants throat and vigorously applying the whip he fled up the riverside road to great haverham at the gallop of the carriers horse the lights of the houseboat flashed upon the flying waggon as it passed the beat of hoofs and the rattle of the vehicle gradually coalesced and died away and presently to the trio on the riverside silence had redescended  its the most extraordinary thing cried the slimmer of the two gentlemen but thats the cart  and i know i saw a piano said the girl  o its the cart certainly and the extraordinary thing is its not the man added the first  it must be the man gid it must be said the portly one  well then why is he running away asked gideon  his horse bolted i suppose said the squirradical  nonsense i heard the whip going like a flail said gideon it simply defies the human reason  ill tell you broke in the girl he came round that corner suppose we went andwhat do you call it in booksfollowed his trail there may be a house there or somebody who saw him or something  well suppose we did for the fun of the thing said gideon  the fun of the thing it would appear consisted in the extremely close juxtaposition of himself and miss hazeltine to uncle ned who was excluded from these simple pleasures the excursion appeared hopeless from the first and when a fresh perspective of darkness opened up dimly contained between park palings on the one side and a hedge and ditch upon the other the whole without the smallest signal of human habitation the squirradical drew up  this is a wildgoose chase said he  with the cessation of the footfalls another sound smote upon their ears  o whats that cried julia  i cant think said gideon  the squirradical had his stick presented like a sword gid he began gid i  o mr forsyth cried the girl o dont go forward you dont know what it might beit might be something perfectly horrid  it may be the devil itself said gideon disengaging himself but i am going to see it  dont be rash gid cried his uncle  the barrister drew near to the sound which was certainly of a portentous character in quality it appeared to blend the strains of the cow the foghorn and the mosquito and the startling manner of its enunciation added incalculably to its terrors a dark object not unlike the human form divine appeared on the brink of the ditch  its a man said gideon its only a man he seems to be asleep and snoringhullo he added a moment after there must be something wrong with him he wont waken  gideon produced his vestas struck one and by its light recognised the tow head of harker  this is the man said he as drunk as belial i see the whole story and to his two companions who had now ventured to rejoin him he set forth a theory of the divorce between the carrier and his cart which was not unlike the truth  drunken brute said uncle ned lets get him to a pump and give him what he deserves  not at all said gideon it is highly undesirable he should see us together and really do you know i am very much obliged to him for this is about the luckiest thing that could have possibly occurred it seems to meuncle ned i declare to heaven it seems to meim clear of it  clear of what asked the squirradical  the whole affair cried gideon that man has been ass enough to steal the cart and the dead body what he hopes to do with it i neither know nor care my hands are free jimson ceases down with jimson shake hands with me uncle nedjulia darling girl julia i  gideon gideon said his uncle  o its all right uncle when were going to be married so soon said gideon you know you said so yourself in the houseboat  did i said uncle ned i am certain i said no such thing  appeal to him tell him he did get on his soft side cried gideon hes a real brick if you get on his soft side  dear mr bloomfield said julia i know gideon will be such a very good boy and he has promised me to do such a lot of law and i will see that he does too and you know it is so very steadying to young men everybody admits that though of course i know i have no money mr bloomfield she added  my dear young lady as this rapscallion told you today on the boat uncle ned has plenty said the squirradical and i can never forget that you have been shamefully defrauded so as theres nobody looking you had better give your uncle ned a kiss there you rogue resumed mr bloomfield when the ceremony had been daintily performed this very pretty young lady is yours and a vast deal more than you deserve but now let us get back to the houseboat get up steam on the launch and away back to town  thats the thing cried gideon and tomorrow there will be no houseboat and no jimson and no carriers cart and no piano and when harker awakes on the ditchside he may tell himself the whole affair has been a dream  aha said uncle ned but theres another man who will have a different awakening that fellow in the cart will find he has been too clever by half  uncle ned and julia said gideon i am as happy as the king of tartary my heart is like a threepennybit my heels are like feathers i am out of all my troubles julias hand is in mine is this a time for anything but handsome sentiments why theres not room in me for anything thats not angelic and when i think of that poor unhappy devil in the cart i stand here in the night and cry with a single heartgod help him  amen said uncle ned     chapter xiii  the tribulations of morris part the second   in a really polite age of literature i would have scorned to cast my eye again on the contortions of morris but the study is in the spirit of the day it presents besides features of a high almost a repulsive morality and if it should prove the means of preventing any respectable and inexperienced gentleman from plunging lightheartedly into crime even political crime this work will not have been penned in vain  he rose on the morrow of his night with michael rose from the leaden slumber of distress to find his hand tremulous his eyes closed with rheum his throat parched and his digestion obviously paralysed lord knows its not from eating morris thought and as he dressed he reconsidered his position under several heads nothing will so well depict the troubled seas in which he was now voyaging as a review of these various anxieties i have thrown them for the readers convenience into a certain order but in the mind of one poor human equal they whirled together like the dust of hurricanes with the same obliging preoccupation i have put a name to each of his distresses and it will be observed with pity that every individual item would have graced and commended the cover of a railway novel  anxiety the first where is the body or the mystery of bent pitman it was now manifestly plain that bent pitman as was to be looked for from his ominous appellation belonged to the darker order of the criminal class an honest man would not have cashed the bill a humane man would not have accepted in silence the tragic contents of the waterbutt a man who was not already up to the hilts in gore would have lacked the means of secretly disposing them this process of reasoning left a horrid image of the monster pitman doubtless he had long ago disposed of the bodydropping it through a trapdoor in his back kitchen morris supposed with some hazy recollection of a picture in a penny dreadful and doubtless the man now lived in wanton splendour on the proceeds of the bill so far all was peace but with the profligate habits of a man like bent pitman who was no doubt a hunchback in the bargain eight hundred pounds could be easily melted in a week when they were gone what would he be likely to do next a helllike voice in morriss own bosom gave the answer blackmail me  anxiety the second the fraud of the tontine or is my uncle dead this on which all morriss hopes depended was yet a question he had tried to bully teena he had tried to bribe her and nothing came of it he had his moral conviction still but you cannot blackmail a sharp lawyer on a moral conviction and besides since his interview with michael the idea wore a less attractive countenance was michael the man to be blackmailed and was morris the man to do it grave considerations its not that im afraid of him morris so far condescended to reassure himself but i must be very certain of my ground and the deuce of it is i see no way how unlike is life to novels i wouldnt have even begun this business in a novel but what id have met a dark slouching fellow in the oxford road whod have become my accomplice and known all about how to do it and probably broken into michaels house at night and found nothing but a waxwork image and then blackmailed or murdered me but here in real life i might walk the streets till i dropped dead and none of the criminal classes would look near me though to be sure there is always pitman he added thoughtfully  anxiety the third the cottage at browndean or the underpaid accomplice for he had an accomplice and that accomplice was blooming unseen in a damp cottage in hampshire with empty pockets what could be done about that he really ought to have sent him something if it was only a postoffice order for five bob enough to prove that he was kept in mind enough to keep him in hope beer and tobacco but what would you have thought morris and ruefully poured into his hand a halfcrown a florin and eightpence in small change for a man in morriss position at war with all society and conducting with the hand of inexperience a widely ramified intrigue the sum was already a derision john would have to be doing no mistake of that but then asked the helllike voice how long is john likely to stand it  anxiety the fourth the leather business or the shutters at last a tale of the city on this head morris had no news he had not yet dared to visit the family concern yet he knew he must delay no longer and if anything had been wanted to sharpen this conviction michaels references of the night before rang ambiguously in his ear well and good to visit the city might be indispensable but what was he to do when he was there he had no right to sign in his own name and with all the will in the world he seemed to lack the art of signing with his uncles under these circumstances morris could do nothing to procrastinate the crash and when it came when prying eyes began to be applied to every joint of his behaviour two questions could not fail to be addressed sooner or later to a speechless and perspiring insolvent where is mr joseph finsbury and how about your visit to the bank questions how easy to putye gods how impossible to answer the man to whom they should be addressed went certainly to gaol andeh what was thispossibly to the gallows morris was trying to shave when this idea struck him and he laid the razor down here in michaels words was the total disappearance of a valuable uncle here was a time of inexplicable conduct on the part of a nephew who had been in bad blood with the old man any time these seven years what a chance for a judicial blunder but no thought morris they cannot they dare not make it murder not that but honestly and speaking as a man to a man i dont see any other crime in the calendar except arson that i dont seem somehow to have committed and yet im a perfectly respectable man and wished nothing but my due law is a pretty business  with this conclusion firmly seated in his mind morris finsbury descended to the hall of the house in john street still halfshaven there was a letter in the box he knew the handwriting john at last  well i think i might have been spared this he said bitterly and tore it open     dear morris it ran what the dickens do you mean by it im in an    awful hole down here i have to go on tick and the parties on the    spot dont cotton to the idea they couldnt because it is so plain    im in a stait of destitution ive got no bedclothes think of    that i must have coins the hole things a mockry i wont stand it    nobody would i would have come away before only i have no money for    the railway fare dont be a lunatic morris you dont seem to    understand my dredful situation i have to get the stamp on tick a    factever your affte brother       j finsbury  cant even spell morris reflected as he crammed the letter in his pocket and left the house what can i do for him i have to go to the expense of a barber im so shattered how can i send anybody coins its hard lines i daresay but does he think im living on hot muffins one comfort was his grim reflection he cant cut and runhes got to stay hes as helpless as the dead and then he broke forth again complains does he and hes never even heard of bent pitman if he had what i have on my mind he might complain with a good grace  but these were not honest arguments or not wholly honest there was a struggle in the mind of morris he could not disguise from himself that his brother john was miserably situated at browndean without news without money without bedclothes without society or any entertainment and by the time he had been shaved and picked a hasty breakfast at a coffee tavern morris had arrived at a compromise  poor johnny he said to himself hes in an awful box i cant send him coins but ill tell you what ill do ill send him the pink unitll cheer john up and besides itll do his credit good getting anything by post  accordingly on his way to the leather business whither he proceeded according to his thrifty habit on foot morris purchased and despatched a single copy of that enlivening periodical to which in a sudden pang of remorse he added at random the athenæum the revivalist and the penny pictorial weekly so there was john set up with literature and morris had laid balm upon his conscience  as if to reward him he was received in his place of business with good news orders were pouring in there was a run on some of the back stock and the figure had gone up even the manager appeared elated as for morris who had almost forgotten the meaning of good news he longed to sob like a little child he could have caught the manager a pallid man with startled eyebrows to his bosom he could have found it in his generosity to give a cheque for a small sum to every clerk in the countinghouse as he sat and opened his letters a chorus of airy vocalists sang in his brain to most exquisite music this whole concern may be profitable yet profitable yet profitable yet  to him in this sunny moment of relief enter a mr rodgerson a creditor but not one who was expected to be pressing for his connection with the firm was old and regular  o finsbury said he not without embarrassment its of course only fair to let you knowthe fact is money is a trifle tighti have some paper outfor that matter every ones complainingand in short  it has never been our habit rodgerson said morris turning pale but give me time to turn round and ill see what i can do i daresay we can let you have something to account  well thats just where it is replied rodgerson i was tempted ive let the credit out of my hands  out of your hands repeated morris thats playing rather fast and loose with us mr rodgerson  well i got cent for cent for it said the other on the nail in a certified cheque  cent for cent cried morris why thats something like thirty per cent bonus a singular thing whos the party  dont know the man was the reply name of moss  a jew morris reflected when his visitor was gone and what could a jew want with a claim ofhe verified the amount in the booksa claim of three five eight nineteen ten against the house of finsbury and why should he pay cent for cent the figure proved the loyalty of rodgersoneven morris admitted that but it proved unfortunately something elsethe eagerness of moss the claim must have been wanted instantly for that day for that morning even why the mystery of moss promised to be a fit pendant to the mystery of pitman  and just when all was looking well too cried morris smiting his hand upon the desk and almost at the same moment mr moss was announced  mr moss was a radiant hebrew brutally handsome and offensively polite he was acting it appeared for a third party he understood nothing of the circumstances his client desired to have his position regularised but he would accept an antedated chequeantedated by two months if mr finsbury chose  but i dont understand this said morris what made you pay cent per cent for it today  mr moss had no idea only his orders  the whole thing is thoroughly irregular said morris it is not the custom of the trade to settle at this time of the year what are your instructions if i refuse  i am to see mr joseph finsbury the head of the firm said mr moss i was directed to insist on that it was implied you had no status herethe expressions are not mine  you cannot see mr joseph he is unwell said morris  in that case i was to place the matter in the hands of a lawyer let me see said mr moss opening a pocketbook with perhaps suspicious care at the right placeyesof mr michael finsbury a relation perhaps in that case i presume the matter will be pleasantly arranged  to pass into the hands of michael was too much for morris he struck his colours a cheque at two months was nothing after all in two months he would probably be dead or in a gaol at any rate he bade the manager give mr moss a chair and the paper im going over to get a cheque signed by mr finsbury said he who is lying ill at john street  a cab there and a cab back here were inroads on his wretched capital he counted the cost when he was done with mr moss he would be left with twelvepencehalfpenny in the world what was even worse he had now been forced to bring his uncle up to bloomsbury no use for poor johnny in hampshire now he reflected and how the farce is to be kept up completely passes me at browndean it was just possible in bloomsbury it seems beyond human ingenuitythough i suppose its what michael does but then he has accomplicesthat scotsman and the whole gang ah if i had accomplices  necessity is the mother of the arts under a spur so immediate morris surprised himself by the neatness and despatch of his new forgery and within threefourths of an hour had handed it to mr moss  that is very satisfactory observed that gentleman rising i was to tell you it will not be presented but you had better take care  the room swam round morris whatwhats that he cried grasping the table he was miserably conscious the next moment of his shrill tongue and ashen face what do you meanit will not be presented why am i to take care what is all this mummery  i have no idea mr finsbury replied the smiling hebrew it was a message i was to deliver the expressions were put into my mouth  what is your clients name asked morris  that is a secret for the moment answered mr moss  morris bent toward him its not the bank he asked hoarsely  i have no authority to say more mr finsbury returned mr moss i will wish you a good morning if you please  wish me a good morning thought morris and the next moment seizing his hat he fled from his place of business like a madman three streets away he stopped and groaned lord i should have borrowed from the manager he cried but its too late now it would look dicky to go back im pennilesssimply pennilesslike the unemployed  he went home and sat in the dismantled diningroom with his head in his hands newton never thought harder than this victim of circumstances and yet no clearness came it may be a defect in my intelligence he cried rising to his feet but i cannot see that i am fairly used the bad luck ive had is a thing to write to the times about its enough to breed a revolution and the plain english of the whole thing is that i must have money at once im done with all morality now im long past that stage money i must have and the only chance i see is bent pitman bent pitman is a criminal and therefore his positions weak he must have some of that eight hundred left if he has ill force him to go shares and even if he hasnt ill tell him the tontine affair and with a desperate man like pitman at my back itll be strange if i dont succeed  well and good but how to lay hands upon bent pitman except by advertisement was not so clear and even so in what terms to ask a meeting on what grounds and where not at john street for it would never do to let a man like bent pitman know your real address nor yet at pitmans house some dreadful place in holloway with a trapdoor in the back kitchen a house which you might enter in a light summer overcoat and varnished boots to come forth again piecemeal in a marketbasket that was the drawback of a really efficient accomplice morris felt not without a shudder i never dreamed i should come to actually covet such society he thought and then a brilliant idea struck him waterloo station a public place yet at certain hours of the day a solitary a place besides the very name of which must knock upon the heart of pitman and at once suggest a knowledge of the latest of his guilty secrets morris took a piece of paper and sketched his advertisement  william bent pitman if this should meet the eye of he will hear of something to his advantage on the far end of the main line departure platform waterloo station 2 to 4 pm sunday next  morris reperused this literary trifle with approbation terse he reflected something to his advantage is not strictly true but its taking and original and a man is not on oath in an advertisement all that i require now is the ready cash for my own meals and for the advertisement andno i cant lavish money upon john but ill give him some more papers how to raise the wind  he approached his cabinet of signets and the collector suddenly revolted in his blood i will not he cried nothing shall induce me to massacre my collectionrather theft and dashing upstairs to the drawingroom he helped himself to a few of his uncles curiosities a pair of turkish babooshes a smyrna fan a watercooler a musket guaranteed to have been seized from an ephesian bandit and a pocketful of curious but incomplete seashells     chapter xiv  william bent pitman hears of something to his advantage   on the morning of sunday william dent pitman rose at his usual hour although with something more than the usual reluctance the day before it should be explained an addition had been made to his family in the person of a lodger michael finsbury had acted sponsor in the business and guaranteed the weekly bill on the other hand no doubt with a spice of his prevailing jocularity he had drawn a depressing portrait of the lodgers character mr pitman had been led to understand his guest was not good company he had approached the gentleman with fear and had rejoiced to find himself the entertainer of an angel at tea he had been vastly pleased till hard on one in the morning he had sat entranced by eloquence and progressively fortified with information in the studio and now as he reviewed over his toilet the harmless pleasures of the evening the future smiled upon him with revived attractions mr finsbury is indeed an acquisition he remarked to himself and as he entered the little parlour where the table was already laid for breakfast the cordiality of his greeting would have befitted an acquaintanceship already old  i am delighted to see you sirthese were his expressionsand i trust you have slept well  accustomed as i have been for so long to a life of almost perpetual change replied the guest the disturbance so often complained of by the more sedentary as attending their first night in what is called a new bed is a complaint from which i am entirely free  i am delighted to hear it said the drawingmaster warmly but i see i have interrupted you over the paper  the sunday paper is one of the features of the age said mr finsbury in america i am told it supersedes all other literature the bone and sinew of the nation finding their requirements catered for hundreds of columns will be occupied with interesting details of the worlds doings such as waterspouts elopements conflagrations and public entertainments there is a corner for politics ladies work chess religion and even literature and a few spicy editorials serve to direct the course of public thought it is difficult to estimate the part played by such enormous and miscellaneous repositories in the education of the people but this though interesting in itself partakes of the nature of a digression and what i was about to ask you was this are you yourself a student of the daily press  there is not much in the papers to interest an artist returned pitman  in that case resumed joseph an advertisement which has appeared the last two days in various journals and reappears this morning may possibly have failed to catch your eye the name with a trifling variation bears a strong resemblance to your own ah here it is if you please i will read it to you  william bent pitman if this should meet the eye of he will hear of something to his advantage at the far end of the main line departure platform waterloo station 2 to 4 pm today  is that in print cried pitman let me see it bent it must be dent something to my advantage mr finsbury excuse me offering a word of caution i am aware how strangely this must sound in your ears but there are domestic reasons why this little circumstance might perhaps be better kept between ourselves mrs pitmanmy dear sir i assure you there is nothing dishonourable in my secrecy the reasons are domestic merely domestic and i may set your conscience at rest when i assure you all the circumstances are known to our common friend your excellent nephew mr michael who has not withdrawn from me his esteem  a word is enough mr pitman said joseph with one of his oriental reverences  half an hour later the drawingmaster found michael in bed and reading a book the picture of goodhumour and repose  hillo pitman he said laying down his book what brings you here at this inclement hour ought to be in church my boy  i have little thought of church today mr finsbury said the drawingmaster i am on the brink of something new sir and he presented the advertisement  why what is this cried michael sitting suddenly up he studied it for half a minute with a frown pitman i dont care about this document a particle said he  it will have to be attended to however said pitman  i thought youd had enough of waterloo returned the lawyer have you started a morbid craving youve never been yourself anyway since you lost that beard i believe now it was where you kept your senses  mr finsbury said the drawingmaster i have tried to reason this matter but and with your permission i should like to lay before you the results  fire away said michael but please pitman remember its sunday and lets have no bad language  there are three views open to us began pitman first this may be connected with the barrel second it may be connected with mr semitopoliss statue and third it may be from my wifes brother who went to australia in the first case which is of course possible i confess the matter would be best allowed to drop  the court is with you there brother pitman said michael  in the second continued the other it is plainly my duty to leave no stone unturned for the recovery of the lost antique  my dear fellow semitopolis has come down like a trump he has pocketed the loss and left you the profit what more would you have inquired the lawyer  i conceive sir under correction that mr semitopoliss generosity binds me to even greater exertion said the drawingmaster the whole business was unfortunate it wasi need not disguise it from youit was illegal from the first the more reason that i should try to behave like a gentleman concluded pitman flushing  i have nothing to say to that returned the lawyer i have sometimes thought i should like to try to behave like a gentleman myself only its such a onesided business with the world and the legal profession as they are  then in the third resumed the drawingmaster if its uncle tim of course our fortunes made  its not uncle tim though said the lawyer  have you observed that very remarkable expression something to his advantage inquired pitman shrewdly  you innocent mutton said michael its the seediest commonplace in the english language and only proves the advertiser is an ass let me demolish your house of cards for you at once would uncle tim make that blunder in your namein itself the blunder is delicious a huge improvement on the gross reality and i mean to adopt it in the future but is it like uncle tim  no its not like him pitman admitted but his mind may have become unhinged at ballarat  if you come to that pitman said michael the advertiser may be queen victoria fired with the desire to make a duke of you i put it to yourself if thats probable and yet its not against the laws of nature but we sit here to consider probabilities and with your genteel permission i eliminate her majesty and uncle tim on the threshold to proceed we have your second idea that this has some connection with the statue possible but in that case who is the advertiser not ricardi for he knows your address not the person who got the box for he doesnt know your name the vanman i hear you suggest in a lucid interval he might have got your name and got it incorrectly at the station and he might have failed to get your address i grant the vanman but a question do you really wish to meet the vanman  why should i not asked pitman  if he wants to meet you replied michael observe this it is because he has found his addressbook has been to the house that got the statue andmark my wordsis moving at the instigation of the murderer  i should be very sorry to think so said pitman but i still consider it my duty to mr semitopolis  pitman interrupted michael this will not do dont seek to impose on your legal adviser dont try to pass yourself off for the duke of wellington for that is not your line come i wager a dinner i can read your thoughts you still believe its uncle tim  mr finsbury said the drawingmaster colouring you are not a man in narrow circumstances and you have no family guendolen is growing up a very promising girlshe was confirmed this year and i think you will be able to enter into my feelings as a parent when i tell you she is quite ignorant of dancing the boys are at the board school which is all very well in its way at least i am the last man in the world to criticise the institutions of my native land but i had fondly hoped that harold might become a professional musician and little otho shows a quite remarkable vocation for the church i am not exactly an ambitious man  well well interrupted michael be explicit you think its uncle tim  it might be uncle tim insisted pitman and if it were and i neglected the occasion how could i ever look my children in the face i do not refer to mrs pitman  no you never do said michael   but in the case of her own brother returning from ballarat  continued pitman   with his mind unhinged put in the lawyer   returning from ballarat with a large fortune her impatience may be more easily imagined than described concluded pitman  all right said michael be it so and what do you propose to do  i am going to waterloo said pitman in disguise  all by your little self inquired the lawyer well i hope you think it safe mind and send me word from the police cells  o mr finsbury i had ventured to hopeperhaps you might be induced toto make one of us faltered pitman  disguise myself on sunday cried michael how little you understand my principles  mr finsbury i have no means of showing you my gratitude but let me ask you one question said pitman if i were a very rich client would you not take the risk  diamond diamond you know not what you do cried michael why man do you suppose i make a practice of cutting about london with my clients in disguise do you suppose money would induce me to touch this business with a stick i give you my word of honour it would not but i own i have a real curiosity to see how you conduct this interviewthat tempts me it tempts me pitman more than goldit should be exquisitely rich and suddenly michael laughed well pitman said he have all the truck ready in the studio ill go  about twenty minutes after two on this eventful day the vast and gloomy shed of waterloo lay like the temple of a dead religion silent and deserted here and there at one of the platforms a train lay becalmed here and there a wandering footfall echoed the cabhorses outside stamped with startling reverberations on the stones or from the neighbouring wilderness of railway an engine snorted forth a whistle the mainline departure platform slumbered like the rest the bookinghutches closed the backs of mr haggards novels with which upon a weekday the bookstall shines emblazoned discreetly hidden behind dingy shutters the rare officials undisguisedly somnambulant and the customary loiterers even to the middleaged woman with the ulster and the handbag fled to more congenial scenes as in the inmost dells of some small tropic island the throbbing of the ocean lingers so here a faint pervading hum and trepidation told in every corner of surrounding london  at the hour already named persons acquainted with john dickson of ballarat and ezra thomas of the united states of america would have been cheered to behold them enter through the bookingoffice  what names are we to take inquired the latter anxiously adjusting the windowglass spectacles which he had been suffered on this occasion to assume  theres no choice for you my boy returned michael bent pitman or nothing as for me i think i look as if i might be called appleby something agreeably oldworld about applebybreathes of devonshire cider talking of which suppose you wet your whistle the interview is likely to be trying  i think ill wait till afterwards returned pitman on the whole i think ill wait till the things over i dont know if it strikes you as it does me but the place seems deserted and silent mr finsbury and filled with very singular echoes  kind of jackinthebox feeling inquired michael as if all these empty trains might be filled with policemen waiting for a signal and sir charles warren perched among the girders with a silver whistle to his lips its guilt pitman  in this uneasy frame of mind they walked nearly the whole length of the departure platform and at the western extremity became aware of a slender figure standing back against a pillar the figure was plainly sunk into a deep abstraction he was not aware of their approach but gazed far abroad over the sunlit station michael stopped  holloa said he can that be your advertiser if so im done with it and then on second thoughts not so either he resumed more cheerfully here turn your back a moment so give me the specs  but you agreed i was to have them protested pitman  ah but that man knows me said michael  does he whats his name cried pitman  o he took me into his confidence returned the lawyer but i may say one thing if hes your advertiser and he may be for he seems to have been seized with criminal lunacy you can go ahead with a clear conscience for i hold him in the hollow of my hand  the change effected and pitman comforted with this good news the pair drew near to morris  are you looking for mr william bent pitman inquired the drawingmaster i am he  morris raised his head he saw before him in the speaker a person of almost indescribable insignificance in white spats and a shirt cut indecently low a little behind a second and more burly figure offered little to criticism except ulster whiskers spectacles and deerstalker hat since he had decided to call up devils from the underworld of london morris had pondered deeply on the probabilities of their appearance his first emotion like that of charoba when she beheld the sea was one of disappointment his second did more justice to the case never before had he seen a couple dressed like these he had struck a new stratum  i must speak with you alone said he  you need not mind mr appleby returned pitman he knows all  all do you know what i am here to speak of inquired morris the barrel  pitman turned pale but it was with manly indignation you are the man he cried you very wicked person  am i to speak before him asked morris disregarding these severe expressions  he has been present throughout said pitman he opened the barrel your guilty secret is already known to him as well as to your maker and myself  well then said morris what have you done with the money  i know nothing about any money said pitman  you neednt try that on said morris i have tracked you down you came to the station sacrilegiously disguised as a clergyman procured my barrel opened it rifled the body and cashed the bill i have been to the bank i tell you i have followed you step by step and your denials are childish and absurd  come come morris keep your temper said mr appleby  michael cried morris michael here too  here too echoed the lawyer here and everywhere my good fellow every step you take is counted trained detectives follow you like your shadow they report to me every threequarters of an hour no expense is spared  morriss face took on a hue of dirty grey well i dont care i have the less reserve to keep he cried that man cashed my bill its a theft and i want the money back  do you think i would lie to you morris asked michael  i dont know said his cousin i want my money  it was i alone who touched the body began michael  you michael cried morris starting back then why havent you declared the death  what the devil do you mean asked michael  am i mad or are you cried morris  i think it must be pitman said michael  the three men stared at each other wildeyed  this is dreadful said morris dreadful i do not understand one word that is addressed to me  i give you my word of honour no more do i said michael  and in gods name why whiskers cried morris pointing in a ghastly manner at his cousin does my brain reel how whiskers  o thats a matter of detail said michael  there was another silence during which morris appeared to himself to be shot in a trapeze as high as st pauls and as low as baker street station  let us recapitulate said michael unless its really a dream in which case i wish teena would call me for breakfast my friend pitman here received a barrel which it now appears was meant for you the barrel contained the body of a man how or why you killed him  i never laid a hand on him protested morris this is what i have dreaded all along but think michael im not that kind of man with all my faults i wouldnt touch a hair of anybodys head and it was all dead loss to me he got killed in that vile accident  suddenly michael was seized by mirth so prolonged and excessive that his companions supposed beyond a doubt his reason had deserted him again and again he struggled to compose himself and again and again laughter overwhelmed him like a tide in all this maddening interview there had been no more spectral feature than this of michaels merriment and pitman and morris drawn together by the common fear exchanged glances of anxiety  morris gasped the lawyer when he was at last able to articulate hold on i see it all now i can make it clear in one word heres the key i never guessed it was uncle joseph till this moment  this remark produced an instant lightening of the tension for morris for pitman it quenched the last ray of hope and daylight uncle joseph whom he had left an hour ago in norfolk street pasting newspaper cuttingsitthe dead bodythen who was he pitman and was this waterloo station or colney hatch  to be sure cried morris it was badly smashed i know how stupid not to think of that why then alls clear and my dear michael ill tell you whatwere saved both saved you get the tontinei dont grudge it you the leastand i get the leather business which is really beginning to look up declare the death at once dont mind me in the smallest dont consider me declare the death and were all right  ah but i cant declare it said michael  why not cried morris  i cant produce the corpus morris ive lost it said the lawyer  stop a bit ejaculated the leather merchant how is this its not possible i lost it  well ive lost it too my son said michael with extreme serenity not recognising it you see and suspecting something irregular in its origin i got rid ofwhat shall we saygot rid of the proceeds at once  you got rid of the body what made you do that wailed morris but you can get it again you know where it is  i wish i did morris and you may believe me there for it would be a small sum in my pocket but the fact is i dont said michael  good lord said morris addressing heaven and earth good lord ive lost the leather business  michael was once more shaken with laughter  why do you laugh you fool cried his cousin you lose more than i youve bungled it worse than even i did if you had a spark of feeling you would be shaking in your boots with vexation but ill tell you one thingill have that eight hundred poundill have that and go to swan riverthats mine anyway and your friend must have forged to cash it give me the eight hundred here upon this platform or i go straight to scotland yard and turn the whole disreputable story inside out  morris said michael laying his hand upon his shoulder hear reason it wasnt us it was the other man we never even searched the body  the other man repeated morris  yes the other man we palmed uncle joseph off upon another man said michael  you what you palmed him off thats surely a singular expression said morris  yes palmed him off for a piano said michael with perfect simplicity remarkably full rich tone he added  morris carried his hand to his brow and looked at it it was wet with sweat fever said he  no it was a broadwood grand said michael pitman here will tell you if it was genuine or not  eh o o yes i believe it was a genuine broadwood i have played upon it several times myself said pitman the threeletter e was broken  dont say anything more about pianos said morris with a strong shudder im not the man i used to be thisthis other manlets come to him if i can only manage to follow who is he where can i get hold of him  ah thats the rub said michael hes been in possession of the desired article let me seesince wednesday about four oclock and is now i should imagine on his way to the isles of javan and gadire  michael said morris pleadingly i am in a very weak state and i beg your consideration for a kinsman say it slowly again and be sure you are correct when did he get it  michael repeated his statement  yes thats the worst thing yet said morris drawing in his breath  what is asked the lawyer  even the dates are sheer nonsense said the leather merchant the bill was cashed on tuesday theres not a gleam of reason in the whole transaction  a young gentleman who had passed the trio and suddenly started and turned back at this moment laid a heavy hand on michaels shoulder  aha so this is mr dickson said he  the trump of judgment could scarce have rung with a more dreadful note in the ears of pitman and the lawyer to morris this erroneous name seemed a legitimate enough continuation of the nightmare in which he had so long been wandering and when michael with his brandnew bushy whiskers broke from the grasp of the stranger and turned to run and the weird little shaven creature in the lownecked shirt followed his example with a birdlike screech and the stranger finding the rest of his prey escape him pounced with a rude grasp on morris himself that gentlemans frame of mind might be very nearly expressed in the colloquial phrase i told you so  i have one of the gang said gideon forsyth  i do not understand said morris dully  o i will make you understand returned gideon grimly  you will be a good friend to me if you can make me understand anything cried morris with a sudden energy of conviction  i dont know you personally do i continued gideon examining his unresisting prisoner never mind i know your friends they are your friends are they not  i do not understand you said morris  you had possibly something to do with a piano suggested gideon  a piano cried morris convulsively clasping gideon by the arm then youre the other man where is it where is the body and did you cash the draft  where is the body this is very strange mused gideon do you want the body  want it cried morris my whole fortune depends upon it i lost it where is it take me to it  o you want it do you and the other man dicksondoes he want it inquired gideon  who do you mean by dickson o michael finsbury why of course he does he lost it too if he had it hed have won the tontine tomorrow  michael finsbury not the solicitor cried gideon  yes the solicitor said morris but where is the body  then that is why he sent the brief what is mr finsburys private address asked gideon  233 kings road what brief where are you going where is the body cried morris clinging to gideons arm  i have lost it myself returned gideon and ran out of the station     chapter xv  the return of the great vance   morris returned from waterloo in a frame of mind that baffles description he was a modest man he had never conceived an overweening notion of his own powers he knew himself unfit to write a book turn a table napkinring entertain a christmas party with legerdemaingrapple in short any of those conspicuous accomplishments that are usually classed under the head of genius he knewhe admittedhis parts to be pedestrian but he had considered them until quite lately fully equal to the demands of life and today he owned himself defeated life had the upper hand if there had been any means of flight or place to flee to if the world had been so ordered that a man could leave it like a place of entertainment morris would have instantly resigned all further claim on its rewards and pleasures and with inexpressible contentment ceased to be as it was one aim shone before him he could get home even as the sick dog crawls under the sofa morris could shut the door of john street and be alone  the dusk was falling when he drew near this place of refuge and the first thing that met his eyes was the figure of a man upon the step alternately plucking at the bellhandle and pounding on the panels the man had no hat his clothes were hideous with filth he had the air of a hoppicker yet morris knew him it was john  the first impulse of flight was succeeded in the elder brothers bosom by the empty quiescence of despair what does it matter now he thought and drawing forth his latchkey ascended the steps  john turned about his face was ghastly with weariness and dirt and fury and as he recognised the head of his family he drew in a long rasping breath and his eyes glittered  open that door he said standing back  i am going to said morris and added mentally he looks like murder  the brothers passed into the hall the door closed behind them and suddenly john seized morris by the shoulders and shook him as a terrier shakes a rat you mangy little cad he said id serve you right to smash your skull and shook him again so that his teeth rattled and his head smote upon the wall  dont be violent johnny said morris it cant do any good now  shut your mouth said john your times come to listen  he strode into the diningroom fell into the easychair and taking off one of his burst walkingshoes nursed for a while his foot like one in agony im lame for life he said what is there for dinner  nothing johnny said morris  nothing what do you mean by that inquired the great vance dont set up your chat to me  i mean simply nothing said his brother i have nothing to eat and nothing to buy it with ive only had a cup of tea and a sandwich all this day myself  only a sandwich sneered vance i suppose youre going to complain next but you had better take care ive had all i mean to take and i can tell you what it is i mean to dine and to dine well take your signets and sell them  i cant today objected morris its sunday  i tell you im going to dine cried the younger brother  but if its not possible johnny pleaded the other  you nincompoop cried vance aint we householders dont they know us at that hotel where uncle parker used to come be off with you and if you aint back in half an hour and if the dinner aint good first ill lick you till you dont want to breathe and then ill go straight to the police and blow the gaff do you understand that morris finsbury because if you do you had better jump  the idea smiled even upon the wretched morris who was sick with famine he sped upon his errand and returned to find john still nursing his foot in the armchair  what would you like to drink johnny he inquired soothingly  fizz said john some of the poppy stuff from the end bin a bottle of the old port that michael liked to follow and see and dont shake the port and look here light the fireand the gas and draw down the blinds its cold and its getting dark and then you can lay the cloth and i sayhere you bring me down some clothes  the room looked comparatively habitable by the time the dinner came and the dinner itself was good strong gravy soup fillets of sole mutton chops and tomato sauce roast beef done rare with roast potatoes cabinet pudding a piece of chester cheese and some early celery a meal uncompromisingly british but supporting  thank god said john his nostrils sniffing wide surprised by joy into the unwonted formality of grace now im going to take this chair with my back to the firetheres been a strong frost these two last nights and i cant get it out of my bones the celery will be just the ticketim going to sit here and you are going to stand there morris finsbury and play butler  but johnny im so hungry myself pleaded morris  you can have what i leave said vance youre just beginning to pay your score my daisy i owe you onepoundten dont you rouse the british lion there was something indescribably menacing in the face and voice of the great vance as he uttered these words at which the soul of morris withered there resumed the feaster give us a glass of the fizz to start with gravy soup and i thought i didnt like gravy soup do you know how i got here he asked with another explosion of wrath  no johnny how could i said the obsequious morris  i walked on my ten toes cried john tramped the whole way from browndean and begged i would like to see you beg its not so easy as you might suppose i played it on being a shipwrecked mariner from blyth i dont know where blyth is do you but i thought it sounded natural i begged from a little beast of a schoolboy and he forked out a bit of twine and asked me to make a clove hitch i did too i know i did but he said it wasnt he said it was a grannys knot and i was a whatdyecallem and he would give me in charge then i begged from a naval officerhe never bothered me with knots but he only gave me a tract theres a nice account of the british navyand then from a widow woman that sold lollipops and i got a hunch of bread from her another party i fell in with said you could generally always get bread and the thing to do was to break a plateglass window and get into gaol seemed rather a brilliant schemepass the beef  why didnt you stay at browndean morris ventured to inquire  skittles said john on what the pink un and a measly religious paper i had to leave browndean i had to i tell you i got tick at a public and set up to be the great vance so would you if you were leading such a beastly existence and a card stood me a lot of ale and stuff and we got swipey talking about musichalls and the piles of tin i got for singing and then they got me on to sing around her splendid form i weaved the magic circle and then he said i couldnt be vance and i stuck to it like grim death i was it was rot of me to sing of course but i thought i could brazen it out with a set of yokels it settled my hash at the public said john with a sigh and then the last thing was the carpenter  our landlord inquired morris  thats the party said john he came nosing about the place and then wanted to know where the waterbutt was and the bedclothes i told him to go to the devil so would you too when there was no possible thing to say and then he said i had pawned them and did i know it was felony then i made a pretty neat stroke i remembered he was deaf and talked a whole lot of rot very politely just so low he couldnt hear a word i dont hear you says he i know you dont my buck and i dont mean you to says i smiling away like a haberdasher im hard of hearing he roars id be in a pretty hot corner if you werent says i making signs as if i was explaining everything it was tiptop as long as it lasted well he said im deaf worse luck but i bet the constable can hear you and off he started one way and i the other they got a spiritlamp and the pink un and that old religious paper and another periodical you sent me i think you must have been drunkit had a name like one of those spots that uncle joseph used to hold forth at and it was all full of the most awful swipes about poetry and the use of the globes it was the kind of thing that nobody could read out of a lunatic asylum the athæneum that was the name golly what a paper  athenæum you mean said morris  i dont care what you call it said john so as i dont require to take it in there i feel better now im going to sit by the fire in the easychair pass me the cheese and the celery and the bottle of portno a champagne glass it holds more and now you can pitch in theres some of the fish left and a chop and some fizz ah sighed the refreshed pedestrian michael was right about that port theres old and vatted for you michaels a man i like hes clever and reads books and the athæneum and all that but hes not dreary to meet he dont talk athæneum like the other parties why the most of them would throw a blight over a skittle alley talking of michael i aint bored myself to put the question because of course i knew it from the first youve made a hash of it eh  michael made a hash of it said morris flushing dark  what have we got to do with that inquired john  he has lost the body thats what we have to do with it cried morris he has lost the body and the death cant be established  hold on said john i thought you didnt want to  o were far past that said his brother its not the tontine now its the leather business johnny its the clothes upon our back  stow the slow music said john and tell your story from beginning to end  morris did as he was bid  well now what did i tell you cried the great vance when the other had done but i know one thing im not going to be humbugged out of my property  i should like to know what you mean to do said morris  ill tell you that responded john with extreme decision im going to put my interests in the hands of the smartest lawyer in london and whether you go to quod or not is a matter of indifference to me  why johnny were in the same boat expostulated morris  are we cried his brother i bet were not have i committed forgery have i lied about uncle joseph have i put idiotic advertisements in the comic papers have i smashed other peoples statues i like your cheek morris finsbury no ive let you run my affairs too long now they shall go to michael i like michael anyway and its time i understood my situation  at this moment the brethren were interrupted by a ring at the bell and morris going timorously to the door received from the hands of a commissionaire a letter addressed in the hand of michael its contents ran as follows     morris finsbury if this should meet the eye of he will hear of    something to his advantage at my office in chancery lane at 10 am    tomorrow       michael finsbury  so utter was morriss subjection that he did not wait to be asked but handed the note to john as soon as he had glanced at it himself  thats the way to write a letter cried john nobody but michael could have written that  and morris did not even claim the credit of priority     chapter xvi  final adjustment of the leather business   finsbury brothers were ushered at ten the next morning into a large apartment in michaels office the great vance somewhat restored from yesterdays exhaustion but with one foot in a slipper morris not positively damaged but a man ten years older than he who had left bournemouth eight days before his face ploughed full of anxious wrinkles his dark hair liberally grizzled at the temples  three persons were seated at a table to receive them michael in the midst gideon forsyth on his right hand on his left an ancient gentleman with spectacles and silver hair  by jingo its uncle joe cried john  but morris approached his uncle with a pale countenance and glittering eyes  ill tell you what you did he cried you absconded  goodmorning morris finsbury returned joseph with no less asperity you are looking seriously ill  no use making trouble now remarked michael look the facts in the face your uncle as you see was not so much as shaken in the accident a man of your humane disposition ought to be delighted  then if thats so morris broke forth how about the body you dont mean to insinuate that thing i schemed and sweated for and colported with my own hands was the body of a total stranger  o no we cant go as far as that said michael soothingly you may have met him at the club  morris fell into a chair i would have found it out if it had come to the house he complained and why didnt it why did it go to pitman what right had pitman to open it  if you come to that morris what have you done with the colossal hercules asked michael  he went through it with the meataxe said john its all in spillikins in the back garden  well theres one thing snapped morris theres my uncle again my fraudulent trustee hes mine anyway and the tontine too i claim the tontine i claim it now i believe uncle mastermans dead  i must put a stop to this nonsense said michael and that for ever you say too near the truth in one sense your uncle is dead and has been so long but not in the sense of the tontine which it is even on the cards he may yet live to win uncle joseph saw him this morning he will tell you he still lives but his mind is in abeyance  he did not know me said joseph to do him justice not without emotion  so youre out again there morris said john my eye what a fool youve made of yourself  and that was why you wouldnt compromise said morris  as for the absurd position in which you and uncle joseph have been making yourselves an exhibition resumed michael it is more than time it came to an end i have prepared a proper discharge in full which you shall sign as a preliminary  what cried morris and lose my seven thousand eight hundred pounds and the leather business and the contingent interest and get nothing thank you  its like you to feel gratitude morris began michael  o i know its no good appealing to you you sneering devil cried morris but theres a stranger present i cant think why and i appeal to him i was robbed of that money when i was an orphan a mere child at a commercial academy since then ive never had a wish but to get back my own you may hear a lot of stuff about me and theres no doubt at times i have been ill advised but its the pathos of my situation thats what i want to show you  morris interrupted michael i do wish you would let me add one point for i think it will affect your judgment its pathetic toosince thats your taste in literature  well what is it said morris  its only the name of one of the persons whos to witness your signature morris replied michael his names moss my dear  there was a long silence i might have been sure it was you cried morris  youll sign wont you said michael  do you know what youre doing cried morris youre compounding a felony  very well then we wont compound it morris returned michael see how little i understood the sterling integrity of your character i thought you would prefer it so  look here michael said john this is all very fine and large but how about me morris is gone up i see that but im not and i was robbed too mind you and just as much an orphan and at the blessed same academy as himself  johnny said michael dont you think youd better leave it to me  im your man said john you wouldnt deceive a poor orphan ill take my oath morris you sign that document or ill start in and astonish your weak mind  with a sudden alacrity morris proffered his willingness clerks were brought in the discharge was executed and there was joseph a free man once more  and now said michael hear what i propose to do here john and morris is the leather business made over to the pair of you in partnership i have valued it at the lowest possible figure pogram and jarriss and here is a cheque for the balance of your fortune now you see morris you start fresh from the commercial academy and as you said yourself the leather business was looking up i suppose youll probably marry before long heres your marriage presentfrom a mr moss  morris bounded on his cheque with a crimsoned countenance  i dont understand the performance remarked john it seems too good to be true  its simply a readjustment michael explained i take up uncle josephs liabilities and if he gets the tontine its to be mine if my father gets it its mine anyway you see so that im rather advantageously placed  morris my unconverted friend youve got left was johns comment  and now mr forsyth resumed michael turning to his silent guest here are all the criminals before you except pitman i really didnt like to interrupt his scholastic career but you can have him arrested at the seminaryi know his hours here we are then were not pretty to look at what do you propose to do with us  nothing in the world mr finsbury returned gideon i seem to understand that this gentlemanindicating morrisis the fons et origo of the trouble and from what i gather he has already paid through the nose and really to be quite frank i do not see who is to gain by any scandal not me at least and besides i have to thank you for that brief  michael blushed it was the least i could do to let you have some business he said but theres one thing more i dont want you to misjudge poor pitman who is the most harmless being upon earth i wish you would dine with me tonight and see the creature on his native heathsay at verreys  i have no engagement mr finsbury replied gideon i shall be delighted but subject to your judgment can we do nothing for the man in the cart i have qualms of conscience  nothing but sympathise said michael       end of vol vii     printed by    cassell
