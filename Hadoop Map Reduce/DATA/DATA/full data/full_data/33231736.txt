last racegoodbye to the rival oarsmen   261       the young oarsmen of lakeview  chapter i  jerry harry and blumpo   ill race you  done are you ready  i am  then off we go  quicker than it can be related four oars fell into the water and four sturdy arms bent to the task of sending two beautiful singleshell craft skimming over the smooth surface of the lake  it was a spirited scene and attracted not a little attention for both of the contestants were well known  go it jerry you can beat him if you try  dont let him get ahead harry keep closer to the shore  how far is the race to be  up to the big pine tree and back  thats a full mile and more ill bet on jerry upton  and ill bet on harry parker he has more skill than jerry  but jerry has the muscle  there they go side by side  and thus the talking and shouting went on along the lake front most of the boys present were members of the lakeview boat club but there were others of the town there too as enthusiastic as the rest  it was a clear warm day in june the summer holidays at the various institutes of learning in the vicinity had just begun so many of the lads had nothing to do but to enjoy themselves  there were not a few craft out besides the two shells to which we have drawn attention but they drew out of the way to give the racers a free field  on and on went jerry and harry until the big pine was reached then came the turn and they started on the home stretch side by side neither one foot ahead of the other  its going to be a tie race  pull harry let yourself out  show him what you can do jerry  encouraged by the shouts of their friends both boys increase their speed but the increase on both sides was equal and still the boats kept bow and bow as they neared the boathouse  its going to be a tie sure enough  spurt a bit jerry  go it for all youre worth harry  again the two contestants put forth additional muscle each to outdistant his opponent and again the two rowboats leaped forward still side by side  as old jack broxton the keeper of the boathouse said afterward it would have taken twelve judges sitting twelve days to have told which had the advantage  the finishing point was now less than five hundred feet distant and in a few seconds more the race would be over the crowd began to stop shouting almost breathless with pentup interest it was surely the prettiest race that had ever been rowed on otasco lake  splash  the splash was followed by a splutter and then a frantic cry for help a portion of the high float in front of the boathouse had unexpectedly given way and a short stocky reddishblack youth had gone floundering over board  blumpo brown has gone under  it serves him right for standing away out on the edge of the float  help help cried the youth in the water hold on harry jerry dont run into me  alarmed by the cries the two racers turned around easing up on their oars as they did so a single glance showed them that the unfortunate one was directly in their path  we must stop cried jerry upton to his friend  all right call it off responded harry parker it was a tie  as he finished both shells drew up one on either side of blumpo brown each of the rowers offered the struggling youth a helping hand  blumpo was soon clinging to jerrys shell he was dripping from head to foot and not being at all a handsomelyformed or goodlooking youth he presented a most comical appearance  its too bad i spoiled the race mumbled blumpo but thats just mealways putting my foot into it  i guess you put more than your foot into it this time was harrys goodnatured comment as he ran close up alongside  where shall i land you blumpo questioned jerry upton  anywhere but near the boathouse returned blumpo with a shiver that was not brought on entirely by his involuntary bath if you land me there the fellows wont give me a chance to get out of sight  ill take you up the lake shore if you wish said jerry i intended to go up anyway in a rowboat  all right jerry do that and ill be much obliged to you returned blumpo brown  you are going along arent you harry continued jerry turning to his late rival  yes i want to stop at mrs flemings cottage replied harry parker  in a moment more harry had turned his shell over to old jack broxton and had leaped into a rowboat  aint you fellows going to try it over again asked several on the shore anxiously  not now returned jerry then he went on to harry in a lower tone i didnt expect to make a public exhibition of our little trial at speed did you  no not at all it was a tie and let it remain so  jerry soon left his shell and then four oars soon took the rowboat far away from the vicinity of the shore and while the three boys are on their way up the lake let us learn a little more concerning them especially as they are to form the allimportant characters of this tale of midsummer adventures  jerry upton was the only son of a welltodo farmer whose farm of one hundred acres lay just beyond the outskirts of lakeview and close to the lake shore jerry was a scholar at the lakeview academy and did but little on the farm although among the pupils he was often designated as cornfield  harry parker was the oldest boy in the parker family which numbered two boys and four girls harrys father was a shoe manufacturer whose large factory was situated in lakeview and at which nearly a fourth of the working population of the town found employment  it had been a singular incident which had brought the two boys together and made them firm friends both had been out skating on the lake the winter before when harry had lost his skate and gone down headlong directly in the track of a large iceboat which was coming on with the speed of a breeze that was almost a hurricane  to the onlookers it seemed certain that harry must be struck and killed by the sharp prow of the somewhat clumsy craft but in that time of extreme peril jerry had whipped up like a flash on his skates caught harry by the collar and literally flung himself and the boy who was then almost a stranger to him out of harms way  this gallant deed of courage had been warmly applauded by those who saw it it also came to mr parkers ears and from that time on the rich shoe manufacturer took an interest in the farmer boy he persuaded mr upton to allow jerry to attend the academy and promised that the boy should have a good position in the office of the factory should he wish it when his school days were over  harry was already a pupil at the academy and it was here that the two boys became warm friends it was nothing to harry that jerry was a farmers boy and that he was sometimes called cornfield he knew and appreciated jerry for his true worth  and now what of blumpo brown you ask there is little to tell at this point of our story concerning that semicolored individual he was alone in the world and had lived in lakeview some ten years previous to that time his history was a mystery where he had come from no one knew and if the truth was to be made known no one but blumpo himself cared he was a very peculiar youth often given to making the most ridiculous remarks and many persons around lakeview fancied he had considerable indian blood in him he lived in half a dozen places according to the condition of his finances and picked up his precarious existence by working for any one who would employ him he might have had a steady situation more than once but it was not in blumpos composition to stick at one thing for any great length of time we will learn much more concerning him as our story proceeds     chapter ii  mrs flemings runaway horse   well now that the midsummer holidays have really commenced what do you intend to do with yourself jerry asked harry as they took it easy for a bit after leaving the vicinity of the town  i expect ill have to help on the farmat least i think i ought to help was the reply you know this is the busy season  harrys face fell a little at this reply evidently something was on his mind and this answer did not harmonize with it  ill tell you what i would like mighty well put in blumpo i would like to leave town and take to the woods  why blumpo you must have been reading my thoughts cried harry i was thinking exactly the same thing  take to the woods repeated jerry what do you mean clear out from home entirely  no no laughed harry i mean to go off for a whilesay two or three weeks or a month sail up the lake and camp out you know oh jerrys face took on a pleased look i would like that myself especially if we could go fishing and swimming whenever we wanted to  ive had it in my mind for several days harry continued slowly i was going to speak of it yesterday but i didnt get the chance  you mean you want me to go with you asked jerry  yes dont you think your folks would let you  they might who else would go along do you think  i havent thought of any one else we might ask and harry hesitated in thought  whats the matter with asking me put in blumpo with a serenity that took away the lack of politeness in his remark im just as tired of lakeview as anybody  harry burst out laughing the idea of asking blumpo had never once entered his mind  it aint nothing to laugh at went on blumpo half angrily  excuse me blumpo said harry stopping short ithat isi wasnt thinking of you when i made the remark  im not rich nor eddicated as you call it and all that but i can hunt and fish and so on as good as the next feller cant i  you certainly can put in jerry who had for a long time had a strange liking for the homeless youth  and i am as willing as the next one to do my full share of camp workwashing dishes and the like went on blumpo you aint cut out for that he added turning to the son of the rich shoe manufacturer  maybe not but i reckon i can do my full share of work laughed harry i was not brought up with kid gloves on you know  one thing is certain mused jerry i wouldnt want to leave until i had rowed that race with si peters from rockpoint  the race to which jerry referred was one to take place on the following saturday silas peters was considered the best singleshell oarsman on the lower side of the lake and he had challenged jerry as a representative from the lakeview academy  youll win that race suah put in blumpo ill bet my hat on it  as blumpos hat was of straw and full of holes this made both jerry and his friend burst into a fit of laughter  i dont mean this hat i mean my sundaygotomeetin one said the homeless youth hastily  blumpo on your honor did you ever own two hats at once asked harry gravely  well since you buckle me down no was the low reply whats the use cant wear but one at a time thats as true as you live returned jerry  the three boys talked over the subject of an outing for some time all thought it a glorious idea and jerry said he would go if he possibly could  all this time jerry and harry were rowing up the lake at a moderate rate of speed jerry loved the water and spent nearly all of his spare time in the vicinity of the lake  presently harry grew tired and blumpo took his place at the oars  here comes the cutwater cried harry a few minutes later  the cutwater was a large sloop owned by one of the gentlemen living in lakeview as she came past those in the rowboat noticed several young ladies on board who were sailing the boat under directions of a young man named clarence conant  clarence had but little idea how a boat should be managed and as the sloop went by harrys face grew troubled  jerry what do you think of that  jerry stopped rowing for a moment to look at the sloop  a good lot of sail up especially if it should blow up stronger he said  just what i think  that clarence conant dont know nuffin about sailing snorted blumpo brown the ladies better beware how they go out with him  i agree with you blumpo said jerry gravely  the sloop now disappeared from sight around a turn in the lake at which several islands were situated  a few minutes later the rowboat drew up to a small dock at the end of a wellkept garden  this was mrs flemings place where harry intended to stop on an errand for his mother and father  he sprang on the dock and hurried toward the house saying he would not be gone more than five minutes  the two boys waited for him to return and during the interval jerry caught sight of the cutwater up the lake and watched her progress with interest the wind was getting stronger and the sloop carried more sail than was good for her soon she again disappeared and jerry turned toward the house wondering what kept harry so long  must have been invited to lunch was blumpos comment pity he didnt ask us in too  no he wouldnt stay and leave us here replied jerry most likelyhullo  jerry sprang up in the rowboat in amazement down the garden path leading from the front of the house to the dock came a beautiful black horse on a gallop on the animals back sat a little girl not more than eight years of age the horse was running away with her and she was clingling tightly to his mane  oh john stop him she screamed  whoa banker whoa shouted a man who came running after the animal  but the horse a nervous creature was frightened over something and would not stop  he clattered on the dock and the next instant went over into the lake with a loud splash carrying the little girl with him     chapter iii  jerrys bravery   blumpo was so scared by the accident that he uttered a short yell  fo the lan sake he moaned in a shaking voice  the horse disappeared from sight for a brief space of time and then came up and began to churn the water madly in an endeavor to save himself from drowning  the little girl was nowhere to be seen  shell be drowned thought jerry with rising horror  at that moment a lady rushed from the house followed by harry it was mrs fleming  my child my child she shrieked save my cora  jerry waited to hear no more at that moment the head of the little girl appeared directly by the horses side and he made a clever dive from the rowboat and came up close to the child  the girl was so bewildered that she simply beat the water in a helpless fashion and this frightened the horse still more swimming up behind the little one jerry caught her under the arms it was a perilous thing to do for jerry was in great danger of having his brains dashed out by one of the horses hoofs  good for you jerry shouted harry  look out for the hoss shouted the man hell kick you if he can  as rapidly as he could jerry swam out of the mad animals reach it was difficult with the struggling girl in his arms but at last he accomplished it and willing hands helped him to the dock  my cora my cora is she dead cried mrs fleming  no she is more frightened than hurt returned jerry let us take her to the house  but before he could go a step mrs fleming clasped her girl in her arms and led the way  anxious to be of assistance jerry followed the lady while harry blumpo and the hired man tried to rescue the horse who was very valuable despite his nervousness  a noose was made at the end of a rope and this was thrown over the animals neck then the horse got one foot through the noose and in this fashion they towed him to a spot where it was easy for him to wade out without assistance  the hired man was very much put out for it was his fault that the horse had run away he led the animal around to the barn and gave him a good rubbing down  harry started for the house and met jerry coming out  how is cora  shes all right come on and jerry brushed on toward the rowboat  why whats your hurry jerry  the young oarsman blushed  oh i hate to stand around and receive thanks he said mrs fleming wants to make a firstclass hero of me and i  and thats just what you are cried harry  indeed he is added blumpo  nonsense jerry brushed them to one side come on and he made a run for the rowboat and the others were compelled to follow  but your clothing is all wet insisted harry when they were seated in the craft  so is blumpos returned jerry  ise most dry the sun is that warm remarked the homeless youth  i dont mind the wetting a bit said jerry rowing will keep me warm and the sun will dry me off quick enough  youre a regular water dog anyway laughed harry he could not help but admire jerrys modesty in running away from mrs fleming as soon as it was ascertained that little cora was all right on and on up the lake the boys went inside of half an hour they came to a sheltered nook on one of the numerous islands  i move we take a swim said harry  second de emotion said blumpo and before jerry could say a word the homeless youth was running about as if in the savage wilds  it did not take jerry and harry long to disrobe the plunge into the water was very pleasant and they remained in bathing until jerrys clothing spread out on the top of a number of bushes was thoroughly dry  in the meanwhile jerry and harry raced to another island and back jerry came out first with harry four yards behind  the swim over they dressed and after picking several handfuls of berries which grew on the island in profusion they once more embarked in the rowboat  time to get back boys said jerry i promised to be home before dark  so did i said harry and we have several miles to go  it dont make no difference to me when i git back remarked blumpo dolefully  dont worry blumpo think of the good time we are going to have when we go camping said jerry  and i must ask father for a regular situation for you when we come back from our outing added harry  will you and the homeless boys face brightened  the wind had been increasing steadily and now it blew so strongly that the whitecaps were to be seen in every direction  were going to have no easy time getting back said jerry with an anxious look on his manly face maybe we may be caught in a hurricane  its hot enough returned harry such oppressive heat generally means something  a mile was covered and then the wind began to send the flying spray in every direction and filled the rowboats bottom with water  wet again laughed jerry grimly never mind  blumpo you had better bail out the boat said harry he was as wet as the rest but did not grumble  while the homeless youth bailed out the water with a dipper they had brought along jerry and harry pulled at the oars with all their remaining strength another mile was passed but now it was blowing a regular hurricane and no mistake  well go to the bottom suah groaned blumpo dismally  not much shouted jerry keep on bailing look look yelled harry at that moment and pointed over to the centre of the lake  there beating up in the teeth of the wind in the most haphazard manner was the cutwater evidently clarence conant was nearly paralyzed with fear for he had almost lost control of the craft  those ladies on board are worse off than we went on harry  thats so replied jerry  but the words were hardly out of his mouth when there came an extra puff of wind it sent the cutwater almost over on her side and threw a monstrous wave into the rowboat  the smaller craft could not stand the wind and waves and with a lurch she sank down and went over dumping all three of the youths into the angry lake     chapter iv  saving the sloop   it was no pleasant position to be in the three lads had been cast so suddenly into the angry waters that for the moment they could not comprehend the situation  then blumpo let out a yell of terror  save me de boat has gone down  he was wrong however for a second later the rowboat bobbed up less than four yards off  this way shouted harry to his companions but the wind fairly drowned his voice he swam toward the upturned craft and blumpo and jerry were not slow in following it  hardly had they reached it when a new peril confronted them the cutwater was bearing directly down upon them with every sail set she was in the very act of cutting them to pieces  look look yelled harry we are doomed  my gracious moaned blumpo  on and on came the sloop with gigantic bounds over the whitecaps clarence conant seemed utterly powerless to stay her course or steer her to the right or left  the young ladies on board with him huddled in a heap near the tiny cabin their faces white with terror  it was truly a thrilling moment  of the entire crowd jerry was the only one to keep perfectly cool  he was astride the rowboat directly in the centre of the bottom and it seemed as if the prow of the cutwater must strike him in a second more  every one dive under he called out and went overboard like a flash  for a wonder harry and blumpo promptly followed suit  crash  the rowboat was struck and stove in completely  the cutwater was quite a good sized craft and though the force of the collision did not damage her to any extent it checked her progress considerably  jerry went down and down he made a long dive and when he came up it was within a yard of the sloops rudder  before another boy would have had time to think the boy who so loved the water made up his mind what to do he made a mighty leap and caught hold of the rudder end ere the cutwater could get beyond his reach it was hard work to hang on as the sloop bobbed up and down with every wave and the rudder being beyond control swayed from side to side  but jerry was both plucky and full of grit he clung fast and watching his chance climbed up to the stern and leaped on the deck  a brief glance showed him the cause of the present trouble clarence conant was actually too much frightened to lower the sails he had started to act and got a rope twisted and then overcome with fear had allowed the matter to go while he clung to the bow in despair  you confounded coward cried the young oarsman you ought to have known better than to go out on anything bigger than a duck pond  he sprang to the halyards and soon the mainsail came down with a bang the jib followed there was no time to attend to the sails more than this  jerry looked around anxiously for harry and blumpo but for a long while could see nothing of them  look here demanded clarence conant recovering his composure now the greatest of the danger was over whatahdo you mean by talking to me in this fashion  i mean just what i say retorted jerry you had no right to take these young ladies out and expose them to such peril theahhurricane took me by surprise was the dudes lame excuse  i am very thankful to you jerry upton cried dora vincent the oldest and prettiest of the girls on board  and so am i  and i  thank you replied the boy blushing but now is no time to talk which of you will take the tiller if i tell you exactly what to do  i canahtake the tiller interposed conant haughtily  you wont touch it cried the young oarsman sternly  why boy what do you mean do youah  sit down if you dare to stir ill pitch you overboard  overcome with a new terror the dude collapsed he was hatless the curl was out of his mustache and hair and altogether he looked very much washed out  he sank down near the bow and it was well that he did so for just then came an extra heavy blast of the gale  hold hard every one yelled jerry perhaps you ladies had better go into the cabin he added  i am to take the tiller you know said dora vincent well then let the others go we can work along better with a clear deck  so while dora went aft the others crawled into the cabin or cuddy under pretense of seeing after their comfort conant crawled after them  now i will tell you just how to move the tiller said jerry to dora vincent  all right i am ready responded the brave girl  now that she had jerry with her and knowing he was well acquainted with boats she felt that she was safe no matter how bad the storm might prove itself  after giving the girl some instructions jerry hoisted the mainsail a few feet only the sloop then swung around and moved in a beating way against the storm  jerry wished to learn what had become of his companions he was fearful that they had been drowned  it took quite some time to reach the vicinity where the accident had occurred and even then but little was to be seen through the driving rain  hullo harry blumpo he called out  no answer came back and he repeated the cry a dozen times then he fancied he heard a response directly ahead the sloop was moved cautiously in the direction and presently they saw blumpo clinging to part of the shattered rowboat sabe me sabe me yelled the youth dont let me drown jerry  catch the rope blumpo cried jerry in return and threw forward the end of a coil  blumpo clutched the rope eagerly and then it was comparatively easy to haul him on board  praise de lawd he muttered fervently as he came on deck i tought i was a goner suah  where is harry  i cant tell you jerry  you havent seen him since we jumped from the rowboat  no  the young oarsmans face grew sober what if their chum had really gone to the bottom of lake otasco it would be awful to tell harrys parents that their son was no more  we must find him dead or alive blumpo take the tiller from miss vincent and well cruise around with our eyes and ears wide open said jerry with determination     chapter v  harry is rescued   i can stay on deck cant i asked dora as she turned the tiller over to the homeless youth  if you wish but be very careful when the sloop swings around replied jerry you did very well he added  dora smiled at this then she went forward and settled down in spite of the rain to help look for harry parker whose folks she knew fairly well  the cutwater was put on a different track and they began to move across the lake it being jerrys idea to cross and recross at a distance of every six or seven hundred feet  twice did they come close to each shore without seeing anything of harry  gone down suahs youre born said blumpo and the tears started out of his big honest eyes  i am afraid so returned jerry and yethark  he put up his hand and all were instantly on the alert the wind had gone down somewhat and from a distance came a low cry its harrys said jerry hullo harry he yelled with all the power of his lungs  he waited and an answering cry came back from toward the center of the lake it was very weak showing that harry was almost exhausted  the course of the sloop was instantly changed and they strove to reach the spot before the boy should go down  jerry was the first to see the form floating about amid the whitecaps  keep up harry he called encouragingly we will soon have you on board  i cant keep up any longer gasped his chum i am played out and throwing up his arms harry disappeared  tying the end of a long rope about his waist jerry leaped overboard he struck the spot where harry had gone down and felt in every direction for his chum  his hand touched an arm and then he held harry fast and brought him to the surface the poor boy was too weak to make the first movement  haul in on the rope blumpo called jerry  turning the tiller over to dora vincent the homeless youth did as directed  jerry with his burden was soon brought alongside  it was no easy matter to hoist harry on deck in the storm but at last it was accomplished and jerry followed his charge  harry was unconscious and he was taken to the cabin where dora and the other girls did all in their power for him and then the cutwater was headed for lakeview two miles distant  the hurricane or whatever it might be called had by this time spent itself the rain ceased and before the lake town came into view the sun shone once more as brightly as ever  clarence conant came on deck looking very much annoyed he felt that he had played the part of a coward and knew he would have no easy time of it to right himself in the eyes of the young ladies  theahtruth is i was very sick he explained to jerry i got aahspasm of theahheart  sure it wasnt a spasm in your great toe said jerry with a grin  but clarence never smiled it would not have been good form you know  as soon as the dock was reached jerry left blumpo to tie up and went to harry he found his chum able to sit up he was very weak but that was all  it was a close call for me jerry said harry with a shudder i owe you my life  it was a close call all around replied our hero we can be thankful that we are here safe and sound harry felt too weak to walk so a carriage was called to take him home jerry went with him while blumpo went over to the grocery store to tell of all that had happened  clarence conant was utterly left he tried to excuse himself to dora vincent and the other young ladies but they would have nothing to do with him  the next time i go out it will be with somebody who can manage a boat and who is brave enough to do it even in a storm said dora and walked away with her lady friends  beastly bad job beastly muttered clarence to himself and my best sailor suit utterly ruined too oh why did that storm have to come up on us  but this was not the end of the matter for the dude  the rowboat that had been smashed was a valuable one belonging to the lakeview boat club they did not care to lose the cost of it and so called on conant to pay for the same  at first he refused but when they threatened arrest he weakened it took nearly three weeks of his salary to square accounts and then the young man was utterly crushed he never went sailing again  it did not take harry long to recover from the effects of his outing on the lake inside of a week he was as well as ever blumpo took good care to tell every one of all that had happened and on every side jerry was praised for his daring work in saving the cutwater and his chum  we have spoken of the match to take place between jerry and si peters of rockport this was postponed for two weeks on sis account  si peters was a tall overgrown youth of eighteen and was generally considered to be the best oarsman on the lake  consequently when a match was arranged by the clubs to which they belonged between the pair it was thought even by many lakeview people that si peters would win  si had one great advantage over jerry his father was rich while jerrys father was poor consequently while jerry had to help on the farm during idle hours si peters could go out and practice and thus get himself in perfect condition  it was this fact that made si think he was going to have an easy time defeating jerry  but unknown to him jerry got more time than he thought harry was anxious to have his chum win and spoke to his father about it  now mr parker and si peters father were not on good terms and the former readily agreed to a plan harry proposed  mr upton he said one evening when he met jerrys father down in the town i would like to hire jerry to work for me every afternoon for a couple of weeks  all right mr parker said jerrys father promptly when do you want him to come  tomorrow if he can ill pay you five dollars a week  very well you can pay jerry  so it was settled and every afternoon the young oarsman went over to the parker place which bordered on the lake  here jerry would practice in secret in a little cove seldom visited by any boats  as the time grew close for the race between jerry and si peters the boat clubs began to bet on their favorites  so sure were the rockpointers that they would win that they gave the lakeview people heavy odds  together the two clubs put up as a trophy a silver cup which later on would be engraved with the name of the winner  of course jerrys father soon found out what his son was doing  but he would not break his bargain with mr parker and so let jerry practice every afternoon feeling sure that jerry would not take the money the rich manufacturer had offered  you will win said harry confidently i shall try my best returned jerry  si peters and his friends smiled broadly whenever they came over to lakeview  jerry upton wont be in it after the first quarter said they  the race was to be a mile half a mile each way the turning point being a wellknown rocky island scarcely fifty feet in diameter  jerry kept at his practice steadily until the great day for the race arrived     chapter vi  the single shell race   the race had been spoken of so much that lakeview presented a holiday appearance  all those who could crossed over from rockpoint and many came from other places  the lake was crowded with craft of all sorts and even standing room along the shore was at a premium  even farmer upton grew interested  you must win that race son he said not only for your own sake but for the sake of the whole lakeview district  and this made jerry more determined to win than ever  the race was not to come off until three oclock in the afternoon in the meanwhile there were half a dozen other contests in which however the masses took but small interest  while one of these contests was going on and jerry was in the dressing room of the boathouse putting on his rowing rig harry came in excitedly jerry you want to be on your guard he said in a low tone so that those standing about might not hear  on guard how  against si peters  i dont understand  from what i have overheard i imagine there is a plot on foot to make you lose the race  what sort of a plot  i cant say  the young oarsman gazed at his chum in perplexity  what have you heard i dont know what to make of this  you know wash crosby  yes he is si peters toady  well i heard him tell browling that it was a dead sure thing si would win  that might have been mere blowing  no browling thought so too but then crosby whispered in his ear at once browlings face took on a look of cunning  can you do it he asked and crosby said he could  then browling said he would put out his money on si if he could find anyone to bet you know the whole crowd is rich  yes and i know another thing exclaimed jerry suddenly i fancy i can see through their plan what  crosby owns a steam launch you know  i do  what is to prevent him from running the launch so that i shall get all the swash it would make me lose a quarter minute or more and perhaps upset me  jiminey crickets i believe you are right whispered harry  did they mention the steam launch  they did browling said he would go and take a look at her  then that is what the plot is you may be sure of it you ought to be able to stop them harry you are going to be on your uncles naptha launch  i will if they get too close to you ill boathook them and pull them off cried harry  good for you  but beware jerry the plot may not be that after all  ill keep my eyes open replied the young oarsman  a minute after this harry went off  then jerry having donned his rowing outfit was surrounded by the other members of the club his shell was inspected and found in perfect condition it had been guarded carefully and now the club members did not dare to let their eyes off of it  bring me my blades please said jerry and they were at once brought from the locker  he began to examine them from end to end suddenly he uttered a cry  boys look here  whats up jerry  this one has been strained and cracked an extra hard pull on it and it would give out  a murmur arose  who did this  some enemy wants jerry to lose sure  how the blade had got into that condition was a mystery  but now was no time to speculate on the affair a new set of blades must be procured at once  luckily there was a pair belonging to a private party to be had they were just the same size and weight  i would rather have my own but ill make these do and beat them in spite of all said jerry  at a given signal six of the boat club boys marched down the float carrying jerrys shell which had been polished and oiled until it shone like a mirror  with a faint splash the shell dropped into the water then jerry ran down and stepped in his feet were locked and the oars were handed over  illustration the single shell race  hurrah for jerry upton  hes the boy to win  hurrah for si peters  jerry wont be in it with si  he will  never  and so the talking and the shouting ran on  meanwhile si peters had emerged from the landing at a private boathouse some distance up the lake shore  he received a hearty shout as he moved slowly over to the starting point  si peters won the choice of positions and of course took the inside  the race should have been a mile straightway but the original challenge which led to the race had been for a half mile going and the same coming  soon the two boys were in position  ready  there was a dead silence  bang  they were off both boys caught the water at the same instant each pulled a long but quick stroke ten yards were covered and they remained side by side  pull si  go it jerry  like two clocks so far as regularity went the two contestants bent their backs and pulled with might and main  one thing was certain unless something happened it would be a close race  but now the lakeview boys were getting wild  see jerry he is gaining  jerry is five feet and more in the lead  it was true slowly but surely our hero was forging ahead should he be able to keep this up he would cross si peters course at the turning point  but now wash crosby showed his hand without so much as a toot of the whistle his steam launch kept drawing closer and closer to jerrys side  then it gradually went ahead until jerry was caught in the swash of the tiny waves it produced  under ordinary circumstances these waves would not have been noticed but in a shell and especially during a race even such apparent trifles count heavily  keep off shouted the young oarsman  mind your business shouted wash crosby in return but so lowly that no one but jerry could hear him this is si peters race     chapter vii  who won the shell race   jerry saw at once that he had been right in imagining that this was the plot against him wash crosby intended to keep just close enough to cause him trouble without actually fouling him  already the swash from the steam launch was telling on jerrys lead si peters kept up at his best and soon was once more abreast of our hero  hurrah came from the shore  si peters leads  i said he would win  that steam launch is too close to jerry upton  nonsense dont croak because you are going to lose the race shouted browling  the lakeview boys began to look glum  but now something happened that wash crosby had not calculated upon  straight from across the lake came the naptha launch belonging to harry parkers uncle in the bow stood harry boathook in hand  when the launch was within three yards of the crosby craft she came to a halt wash crosby was so interested in watching the race that he did not notice what was going on  harry threw the boathook and it caught fast in the steam launchs stern then the naptha launch was moved back and away she went carrying the steam launch with her  she could do this because crosby did not have on a full head of steam  astonished at the turn of affairs wash crosby looked around to see what was the matter  hi what are you doing he bellowed to harry  hauling you off returned jerrys chum i know your plot wash crosby but it is not going to work  let go there  not much youll keep your distance from jerry uptons shell  i would like to know who made you my master stormed crosby in a perfect rage  if you dont come away ill report you and get the town to lynch you retorted harry valiantly dont you dare to touch that boathook  however wash crosby did dare but as long as the line attached was taut he could not loosen it then he tried new tactics he put on a full head of steam  it was a tug of war between the steam and the naptha launches and for the moment it was hard to tell which would come off victorious  but harrys craft was more powerful than crosbys and soon the steam launch was carried far away from the racing shells  wash crosby was furious and would have eaten harry up could he have gotten at the lad  ill fix you for this he cried and threw a heavy chunk of coal at harrys head which the boy dodged  dont try that again wash crosby or ill retaliate in a way you least expect  you had no right to haul me off  you had no right to interfere with jerry upton  wash crosby grumbled but could do nothing harry calmly proceeded to hold him back until the race was almost over  in the meanwhile how was jerry faring  with long quick strokes he swept on side by side with si peters  it was going to be a close contest and the spectators along the lake front went wild with enthusiasm  dont let up si  show the rockpointers what you can do jerry  a dollar that si wins by a length  a dollar that jerry wins by two lengths at last the two reached rocky island which formed the turning point  they were still side by side but si had the inner turn all to himself while jerry had to move about in a much larger area  this brought jerry a good length behind si peters when the return was begun  si peters saw this and grinned to himself  you aint in it a little bit jerry upton he called out but jerry did not reply he was not foolish enough to waste breath just then in talking  over the smooth water swept the two long shells each boy working with quick and long strokes  now the finishing stake was in view si peters still kept his lead  its sis race no doubt of it  didnt i say jerry upton wouldnt be in it  what does cornfield know about rowing anyhow  but scarcely had the last remark been made when jerry began to increase his stroke  slowly but surely his shell began to overlap that of si peters now he was halfway up now threequarters now they were even  see him gaining  look look jerry is ahead  he cant keep that stroke its enough to kill him  cant he look he is actually walking away from si  jerry was now letting himself out  like a flash he swept past si peters and reached the finish two and a half lengths ahead  a rousing cheer from the lakeview boys greeted him while the rockpointers were as mum as oysters  si peters looked decidedly crestfallen for several minutes he had nothing to say then some of his friends whispered into his ear  you must do it si said one of the number  all right i will replied peters doggedly and hurried to the judges boat  i claim a foul he cried out loudly  every one was astonished and none more so than jerry  where were you fouled asked one of the judges  up at the turning point  that is a falsehood cried jerry indignantly i never came anywhere near you  im telling the truth said si peters if he hadnt fouled me i would have beaten with ease     chapter viii  a prisoner of the enemy   at once a loud murmur arose some sided with jerry while others took si peters part  from hot words the boys of the rival towns almost came to blows  in the midst of the quarrel a rowboat came down the lake carrying two elderly and wellknown gentlemen both residents of rockpoint curious to know the cause of the trouble the gentlemen came up to the judges craft now moored along shore  peters claims a foul up at the turning point said some one of the gentlemen  you mean up at the island  yes  there was no foul there was there greenley  none at all replied the second gentleman  these assertions attracted attention on inquiry it was learned that the two gentlemen had been up at the island fishing they had watched the race in the meanwhile and they were willing to make affidavit that jerry had not interfered in the slightest degree with si peters  he took the outside and he really gave peters more room than was necessary  the two gentlemen were too well known to be doubted in what they said and at once the judges refused to accept si peters plea  the race goes to jerry upton who won it fairly  then how jerrys friends did yell with delight the lad was pounced upon and raised up on his friends shoulders and away went the boat club boys around the town blumpo in advance of them blowing a big fishhorn  you is de boy said the homeless youth you is de best oarsman on de lake  harry was in the crowd and when he told how he had outwitted wash crosby every one roared  the race however made lots of illfeeling the rockpoint boys could not stand defeat and that evening half a dozen rows started in as many different places  sticks and stones were freely used and many boys went home with their arms and heads tied up  jerry became involved in one of the worst of the fights in rather a peculiar manner he was on his way home rather late thinking all was over and that the rockpointers had departed when he heard a hoarse cry for help from down a side street  he recognized the voice as that of blumpo brown and at once hurried to the spot there to find the youth at the mercy of four of the rockpoint boys including wash crosby si peters and two others named banner and graves the quartet had poor blumpo down on his back and were kicking him as hard as they could  you cowards shouted jerry as he rushed up to kick a fellow when hes down  this is none of your affair shouted si peters he insulted us and we wont take an insult from anybody much less an indian coon  da jess pitched inter me howled blumpo sabe me  let up i say went on jerry and clutching si peters by the shoulder he flung the big rockpointer flat on his back several feet away then jerry pitched into the others of the crowd  this gave blumpo a chance to rise he scrambled up and let out a long and loud yell for help luckily some other boys were not far away they heard the cry and arrived on a run  we must skip now cried wash crosby to si peters well have the whole town on us in another minute  hang the luck howled peters but just wait jerry upton ill get square with you yet  he turned away with his friends and the quartet scooted for the lake with jerry blumpo and half a dozen others at their heels  wash crosbys launch was tied up at a dock and into this they tumbled the line was cut and off they steamed amid a perfect shower of stones lumps of dirt old bottles and anything that came handy to the lakeview boys reach  there i fancy thats the end of them said jerry i thought they had gone long ago  da laid for me groaned blumpo wish i dun had a hoss pistol i would shoot em all full of holes  soon the steam launch faded away in the darkness and a little later found jerry again on his way home of course his folks were proud to think he had won the race  my boy jerry was all mrs upton said but the way she said it meant a good deal  it was a week later that the boat club gave a reception at which jerry was the lion he was presented with the silver trophy and made a neat little speech there were refreshments and music and altogether the affair was the most brilliant lakeview had seen for some time  matters moved along slowly for a week after the racing and the reception were over jerry worked on the farm and never was there a more industrious youth  in the meanwhile harry parker made several arrangements for the outing up the lake in which jerry and blumpo were to accompany him  one day mr upton received a letter from rockpoint it was from a friend and asked if the farmer could send him over at once a load of hay  i cant go very well said mr upton supposing you take it over to mr dike jerry  i will sir replied jerry promptly  the young oarsman had not been over to rockpoint since the races but he thought he could go over and come back without encountering trouble  the hay was soon loaded on the rick and then jerry started off for the other shore he was compelled to drive nearly to the lower end of the lake to cross on the bridge consequently it was well on toward the middle of the afternoon when rockpoint was reached  he and mr dike put the load in the barn and after being paid and partaking of a glass of cold milk and a piece of homemade pie jerry at just six oclock started on the return  it had been a gloomy day and consequently it was already growing dark although it was midsummer  but jerry knew the way well so he did not mind the darkness he let the team go their own gait and took it easy in the rick on a couple of horse blankets  he was in a sort of day dream when suddenly his team was stopped by a couple of boys who sprang from behind a clump of trees  the boys wore masks over their faces and when they spoke they did their best to disguise their voices  jerry sprang up in alarm at the same time four more boys also masked surrounded the hayrick  whats the meaning of this demanded jerry let go of those horses  instead of replying the two boys continued to hold the team the other four leaped into the hayrick and fell on jerry taken so suddenly he was at a disadvantage hardly could he make a move before one of the boys struck him on the head with a club dazing him  then a rope was brought forth and jerrys hands were tied behind him and he was thrown on the ground  the boys sent the team on their way trusting to luck that the horses would find their way home  what are you going to do with me asked jerry when he found himself bound and helpless  youll soon see jerry upton came from the leader in such a muffled voice that our hero tried in vain to recognize the speaker  make him march said another  all right march  into the woods the masked gang hurried jerry when he attempted to turn back they hit him with their sticks and tripped him up  finally when he would go no further four of the boys picked him up and carried him  nearly a quarter of an hour was spent in this manner and the party reached a little clearing on three sides were tall trees and on the fourth a wall of rocks  this is the spot cried the leader now tie him to a tree and get the stuff out of the cave  at once the young oarsman was bound to a tree on the edge of the clearing  then two of the boys entered a cave between the rocks  soon they came forth with a pot filled with a thick black liquid and two big pillows  at once jerry realized what his captors meant to do they were going to tar and feather him     chapter ix  tar and feathers   the prospect was far from pleasant to our hero in spite of his bravery he shivered as he saw the gang of masked boys start up a fire over which to heat the tar  so you intend to tar and feather me he said to the leader  youve struck it jerry upton  all right si peters do it and you shall go to prison mark my words  jerry had only guessed at the identity of the leader but he had hit upon the truth  who told you i wasbegan peters and broke off short youre mistaken he went on in his assumed voice  i am not mistaken si peters i know you and you had best remember what i say  oh youre too fresh upton and were going to teach you a lesson put in another of the crowd  a good coat of tar and feathers is just what your system needs  well paint you up so artistically that even your own mother wont know you  not if i can help it muttered jerry under his breath  a great mass of wood had been collected and this gave a roaring fire and also afforded a good light for the workers  on each side of the fire a notched stick was driven into the ground a third stick was laid across the top just beyond the flames from this upper stick the pot of tar was suspended by an iron chain  the heat soon began to tell on the tar as it softened it could be smelled a long distance off  how do you like that smell asked peters of jerry  oh its a good enough smell replied our hero as coolly as he could  never had a dose of tar before did you  i havent had this dose yet  thats so but you soon will have  maybe not  oh you cant escape us  not much he cant put in another and now jerry felt sure that the speaker was wash crosby  well talk about that later crosby  the masked boy started back and denied his identity but it was plain to see he was much put out  i know you peters crosby banner and graves went on jerry and ill discover who you other two fellows are before i leave here too  fiddlesticks shouted one of the boys by the fire who was stirring the tar  is it getting soft asked crosby  yes  where is the brush  ive got it spoke up another and he held up the stump of an old whitewash brush  thats all right  at a signal from peters the crowd of masked boys withdrew to the side of the fire  here a long talk followed it was so low that jerry could not hear a word  peters was making the crowd solemnly promise that they would not inform upon each other no matter what happened  if we stick together upton can prove nothing he said he has no witnesses  right you are si  we want to get square and this is the chance of our lives to do it  we can give him the tar and feathers and then leave him tied up in such a fashion that he can get free but not before we have had a chance to make good our escape and get home and to bed  thats the way to fix it  it will teach lakeporters a good lesson put in one of the unknowns my but aint i down on every one of em  and so am i  and i  and i  in the meanwhile the young oarsman was trying his best to work himself free of his bonds he felt that unless he escaped he would surely be tarred and feathered  he tugged at the ropes around his body and after a hard struggle he managed to free his left arm  his right arm followed although this cost him a bad cut on the wrist from which the blood flowed freely  but he gave the wound no thought and in haste began to work at the rope at his waist  now that was loosened only the one around his knees remained  he looked anxiously toward the fire the masked boys were still in deep discussion and not a single eye was directed toward the prisoner  oh for three minutes more time  he worked with feverish haste  and now he was practically free  si peters turned and beheld him as he took a step behind the tree out of the glare of the fire  he has got away fellows he shouted after him quick  a yell went up and the crowd rushed forward  he mustnt escape us  we worked too hard to capture him  see he is limping the rope is still fastened to one of his legs  like a pack of wolves after a rabbit they came after jerry  our hero did his best to outdistance them and he would have succeeded had it not been for the rope around one knee which caught in a tree root and threw him down flat on his face in another moment the crowd was on top of him  they showed him no mercy si peters was particularly brutal and kicked jerry heavily in the side half a dozen times  ill teach you to crawl away you sneak he cried you cant fool us in this fashion  the kicks stunned jerry and deprived him of his wind he fought as best he could but he was no match for six strong boys  again he was overpowered then the gang dragged him to the side of the roaring camp fire and threw off their masks  now well strip him said wash crosby the tar is all ready and so are the feathers  jerrys struggles availed him nothing his coat and vest were literally ripped from his body and his shirt followed  give me the brush i want to give him the first dose sang out si peters  the old whitewash brush was handed to the leader si dipped it deeply into the pot of hot tar and approached the young oarsman  now jerry upton well tar and feather you in spite of your threats he said     chapter x  what towser did   well by creation what does this mean  the speaker was mr upton jerrys father he was gazing at the hayrick which was coming down the road to the barn at a lively gait  as the boys who had captured jerry had thought the horses had found their way home alone  anxiously mr upton looked around for jerry and then he stopped the team and put them up in the barn  running into the house he told his wife of the state of affairs instantly mrs upton grew alarmed  perhaps they ran away and threw jerry out she cried  it aint likely they could get away with jerry replied mr upton but i allow it is curious  a half hour went by and the farmer determined to start on a hunt for his son he went off on horseback and took with him towser the farm dog  towser was an old and faithful animal a prime favorite with jerry and he trotted along beside the horse as if he knew something was wrong  we want to find jerry towser said mr upton jerry towser jerry  and the dog wagged his tail as if to say that he understood perfectly  it was now quite dark the farmer had brought along a lantern and this he lit and swung around first on one side of the road and then on the other as he journeyed along he remembered jerrys troubles with the rockpoint boys  maybe he has had another fight he thought it was foolish to let him go over there  inside of an hour the other side of the lake was reached and they struck the lonely road leading into rockpoint  as the farmer went on he became more and more sober in mind he seemed to feel in his mind that something was wrong  towser let out a mournful howl  jerry towser jerry  again the dog howled then he came to an unexpected halt and although farmer upton went on the dog refused to budge  what is it towser  for reply the dog started into the bushes and this at first made the old farmer angry for he did not understand the dog  come towser he cried we are not after game just now  but the dog would not come he wanted to enter the brush  at last mr upton went to catch him by the collar but just as he did so the dog gave a short bark and picked up something from among the bushes  hullo  no wonder the old farmer was surprised the article towser had discovered was a slingshot jerry often carried with him  must have come in here mused farmer upton  then of a sudden he began to examine the ground it was soft in spots and plainly showed the footmarks of jerry and the si peters crowd  hes in trouble said the old farmer to himself maybe some tramps have carried him off and robbed him  urging on the faithful dog mr upton hurried along the path through the woods leaving the horse tied to a tree  it was an uneven way and he stumbled many times but he did not mindhis one thought was to reach his son and find out the boys condition  towser ran ahead howling dismally at every few yards but the faithful dog did not lose the scent  presently through the bushes farmer upton caught sight of a distant campfire  hist he called to towser go slow now down  and the dog obeyed and howled no longer  a hundred yards more were passed when a loud cry rent the air  help help  it was jerrys voice si peters was in the act of applying the first brushful of tar to his back utterly helpless there was nothing left for jerry to do but to use his lungs  shut up cried si peters yell again and ill hit you in the mouth with the tar  you are an overgrown coward retorted jerry give me a fair show and ill knock you out in short order  and again he called for help  in a rage si peters started to plaster jerrys mouth with the hot tar but ere the brush could descend mr upton and towser burst upon the scene  stop you young scamps roared the old farmer at em towser chew em up  startled at the unexpected interruption the rowdies fell back then towser leaped forward and caught si peters by his trowsers  save me yelled si in terror the dog is going to chew me up  good towser returned jerry hold him fast  and towser did as bidden  in the meantime mr upton ran after the boys who had been holding jerry he caught two of them and before they knew it knocked their heads together so forcibly that they saw stars  jerry delighted at the unexpected turn of affairs turned upon wash crosby si peters had dropped the tar brush and this jerry secured  bang whack crosby received a blow over the head and one in the ear which left a big black streak of tar  oh dont please dont he screamed let up jerry it was only a joke we werent really going to tar and feather you  then the fellow ran for his very life  during this time si peters was trying his best to get away from towser who held on with a deathlike grip  around and around the campfire the two circled until jerry came up  the youth called off the dog and went at si in about the same manner as he had treated wash crosby  si wanted to run for it and in his hurry rushed through the fire knocking over the kettle of tar  the sticky mess emptied itself over his clothing then the young oarsman tripped him up and over he rolled among the loose feathers  now you can see how you like it cried jerry  and growling and panting for breath si peters ran away after the others  the rockpoint rowdies were thoroughly demoralized     chapter xi  off for hermit island   it took jerry and his father some little time to get back their breath sufficiently to leave the woods and make their way to the road  you came in the nick of time father said the lad in another five minutes i would have been tarred and feathered  tell me about the whole affair son said the old farmer and jerry did so  the goodfornothing rascals cried the old farmer if they touch you again ill have em all up before the squire  that wont help us father replied jerry they are rich you know they would get off somehow  then ill take it out of their hides  mr upton told how towser had led the way into the woods jerry had always loved the farm dog but now he thought more of him than ever  good boy he said you shall go with us when we take our outingthat is if father will let you go  yes jerry take him along he may help you out of some more trouble replied mr upton  it was rather late when they arrived home mrs upton was shocked to learn of what had occurred but glad to learn that jerry had escaped his enemies  the next day the young oarsman told harry parker and the other boys of his adventure harry was very indignant  those rockpoint boys ought to be driven out of the state  i dun racken ill carry my hoss pistol after dis said blumpo da dont cotch dis chile for to tar and feather him  a week later jerry harry and blumpo started up the lake on a ten days outing  they were in harrys largest rowboat the one that had a sail and carried with them a tent and a good stock of ammunition jerry and harry were armed with guns and blumpo carried his hoss pistol and a rusty spear  they were bound for hermit island a wild but beautiful patch of land situated almost at the end of otasco lake the island was so called because it was said by some that the place was inhabited by an old hermit who lived in a cave and never showed himself to visitors  some did not believe this story for try as hard as they could they had never been able to locate the strange creature who was said to have a white beard to his waist and white hair equally long  the day that the trio started away was a fine one and the boys were in excellent spirits  i trust we have no more squalls remarked harry as they glided along the sail set and the oars out  no storm today returned jerry we are going to have at least three or four days of fine weather  say i wondah if i could shoot a bar wid dis yere gun put in blumpo as he held up his pistol  you might if you threw the pistol at the bear when you pulled the trigger laughed jerry sure as you are born blumpo that pistol will go to pieces if you try to fire it  den ill fire it dis way replied the homeless youth and swung the weapon as if to heave it away  an hour passed during which the boys laid their plans for a camp and talked over what they would do  i hope we have good hunting and fishing said jerry  so do i returned harry and i likewise hope we find the hermit if there really is such a creature  maybe he wont want us on his island put in blumpo he may be an ugly feller  well risk it blumpo  i aint in fer stirrin up no hornets nest went on the homeless youth i jess like ter lay around an take it easy under de treesalistening to  the tumble bugs tumbling around as the song says laughed jerry blumpo you must get more ambition in you come row up lively its a good long distance to the island and we must make it before sundown  all three braced up and the big boat went forward at an increased rate of speed  hullo cried harry presently jerry doesnt that look like si peters yacht  and harry pointed over to the west shore of the lake where a craft had just emerged from behind a small headland  it is the peters yacht sure enough replied jerry after studying the craft  if she cums dis way well hab lively times remarked blumpo  thats true blumpo come maybe we can get away from her  the boys kept steadily on their course and for a long time those on the yacht seemed to pay no attention to them  but after awhile the big boat put on another tack and fifteen minutes later it was within hailing distance then they saw that si peters and crosby were in posession they had with them five other rockpoint lads including banner and graves  hi you fellows stop rowing yelled peters at the top of his voice  mind your own business si peters retorted harry  you wont stop  no leave us alone  we want you to give up jerry upton  give him up  exactly come up alongside and let him jump on board of the yacht  thats as cool as a cake of ice cried jerry you want everything dont you  we are going to get square with you jerry upton put in wash crosby  let us pull away as fast as we can whispered harry those chaps mean trouble  dats de talk said blumpo who was the worst scared of the three  they bent to their oars and soon moved off a hundred feet or more  then si peters ran out to the jib of the yacht  stop he commanded pull another yard and youll be sorry for it  well risk it replied jerry  well run you down  you wont dare yelled harry in alarm  wont we just see if we wont  at once si peters gave some directions to wash crosby who was at the wheel the course of the yacht was slightly changed and now the craft was headed directly for the boat containing our friends  anudder smashup shuah as youre born groaned blumpo and he prepared to leap into the lake  stay where you are ordered jerry ill check their little game  reaching into a locker the young oarsman brought out his gun leaping on one of the seats he pointed the weapon at si peters head  sheer off he cried sheer off or ill fire on you     chapter xii  an attack in the dark   si peters was nearly dumfounded at the unexpected turn affairs had taken the bully at once gave the necessary directions and the yacht passed to windward of the other boat  a good idea jerry exclaimed harry that will make them steer clear of us for good i reckon  if they havent got guns of their own harry  the boys on the yacht were evidently much crestfallen they had hoped to get jerry in their power but that plan was defeated they dropped behind several hiding places and again headed for the big rowboat  but once more jerry outwitted them calling to blumpo to steady the temporary mast he climbed to the top his gun slung over his shoulder  from this elevated point he was able to sweep the yachts deck from stem to stern  now turn about or ill fire on you as sure as fate he ordered  you think you are smart dont you sneered wash crosby  im too smart for your crowd retorted jerry  we can fire as well as you put in graves  if you had a gun which you havent retorted jerry  the boys on the yacht growled among themselves but could do nothing wash crosby tried to throw a piece of iron on the rowboat but it fell short then harry retaliated by shooting through the yachts mainsail  seeing the boys on the big rowboat meant business si peters and his crowd withdrew from the encounter  as soon as they were gone jerry came down from his perch and off they started once more for the island  the yacht sailed so far off they thought they were no longer observed  but in this they were mistaken for si peters had a field glass with him  this glass was now brought into play and peters crowd kept track of jerry and the others until the vicinity of hermit island was reached  going to camp there said wash crosby  it ought to give us a fine chance to get square replied si peters and the crowd began to plot against our hero and his friends  but in the meantime the big rowboat disappeared behind the bushes which fringed a narrow inlet and try their best those on the yacht could not locate it again  never mind well come up some other day said si peters its getting too late to do anything now  and the yacht returned to rockpoint  it was harry who selected a landing place on hermits island he found a smooth sandy beach and here the rowboat was drawn up well out of the water  back of the beach was a little clearing on one side were tall rocks and on the other the woods  as good a place as any to pitch the tent said jerry come blumpo stir yourself  the tent was brought out and put up and a camp fire was lit while blumpo gathered brush to put into the tent to sleep on jerry and harry tried their hands at fishing  soon harry had a bite and brought in a perch weighing a little over a half a pound  good for you harry you take first prize cried jerry  hardly had he spoken when he felt a jerk there was a lively struggle for fully a minute and then jerry landed his catcha rock bass all of a pound in weight  second but best laughed harry i guess that is all we want for tonight  the pan was over the fire getting hot blumpo cleaned the fish and put them on in the meantime jerry made a pot of coffee  never had a meal tasted better to the boys they lingered over the scraps for a long while talking over the events of the day blumpo also gave them a song it was a happy time  somebody ought to stand guard all night i suppose said jerry when it came time to turn in  oh nonsense cried harry who is going to hurt us in this out of the way spot  we dont know what may be around  ise too tired to watch put in blumpo  never knew the time you werent tired laughed jerry but let it go if you wish  quarter of an hour later all of the boys had turned in blumpo picked out a corner of the tent nearest the rear harry slept in the middle while jerry took up a place not far from the front flaps  as it was rather warm they left one of the flaps open to admit the air jerry lay in such a position that he could look out on the smoldering campfire  jerry was as tired as the rest and it did not take him long to drop off into a sound sleep  how long he slept he did not know a low noise outside aroused him he opened his eyes with a start wondering what it was  then came another growl or grunt he could not tell which he sat up and looked outside  a sight met his gaze that nearly caused his heart to stop beating the camp fire was almost out but beyond its fitful glare he beheld a pair of large eyes bent directly upon the tent opening  the eyes belonged to some savage beast which was about to attack the camp     chapter xiii  jerrys shot   jerry realized that he and his friends were in great peril what the savage beast outside was he could not tell but it looked large and powerful in the gloom beyond the camp fire  there was no time to lose if anything was to be done  luckily before lying down the young oarsman had loaded his gun and hung it up on the front pole of the tent within easy reach  sitting up he now took the weapon and pulled back the trigger  the click reached the ears of the animal outside and once again it let out that peculiar sound neither grunt nor growl  then jerry put the gun to his shoulder and taking aim at one of the shining eyes fired  bang  the report of the firearm caused harry and blumpo to spring up in wild alarm  whats the matter  heaben sabe us moaned blumpo  a wild animal outside cried jerry get your gun quick  harry leaped for his weapon  what is it  i cant make out  reloading as rapidly as he could our hero dashed into the open a howl of pain told he had hit his mark the beast had turned and was crashing through the brush close to the rocks  let us find out what it was cried harry  doan go moaned blumpo you will git chewed up  and then he dove back into the tent for his hoss pistol and his rusty spear  catching up a blazing brand jerry threw it into the brush by the light they saw the creature crouching on a rock  bang bang  the two guns spoke simultaneously harry hit the beast in the shoulder jerrys shot was more effective for it struck in the neck and with a snarl the creature leaped into the air and felldead  youve settled him cried harry come on and inspect him  wait and load your gun first cautioned our hero he may have some fight in him still  the weapons were put in order and then with firebrands to light the way they moved forward to inspect their victim  it was a large and heavy boar  a wild hog shouted jerry my what a big fellow he is  i thought it was a bear said harry he was somewhat disappointed  he was savage enough at all events replied jerry these wild hogs put up a terrible fight father says  oh i know that wasnt dick harbens uncle killed by one well hes dead enough and we have meat to last a month  pretty strong eating smiled jerry  they called blumpo the homeless youth was delighted over the dead animal  hams de best ob meat he sang ill soon fix him up see if i dont  the boys were glad that it was getting toward morning for the excitement had taken all the sleep out of them they replenished the fire and sat around waiting for daybreak  as soon as the sun rose blumpo prepared breakfast while jerry and harry took a plunge into the lake it was great sport and they remained in the water until blumpo called them  that day the boys tramped nearly two miles around the island they took their guns with them and came back with their game bags full of birds returning they were thoroughly tired out but nevertheless resolved to set a watch  four hours each said harry and this was agreed to  but nothing happened to disturb them and on the following night the watch was abandoned  the boys put in nearly a week in hunting fishing swimming and lying around and they enjoyed every minute of the time  nothing had been seen or heard of the hermit who was supposed to inhabit the island and they began to think that no such person existed  neither had they heard anything more of si peters and his crowd and they fancied they were safe from molestation  sunday passed quietly and on monday morning jerry proposed they take along a game bag full of provisions and climb to the top of the rocky hill in the centre of the island  we must go to the very top before we leave he said  the game bag was filled with eatables and cups plates etc and then they tied up the tent flaps and drew the boat still higher up out of the water  the first quarter of a mile of the journey was easy enough but after that they struck the rocks and climbing became more and more difficult with every step  phew but dis am work puffed blumpo dis boys most tucked out  well take a good long rest at noon blumpo said harry  up and up they went until jerry who was in advance came to a sudden halt a deep split in the rocks barred his further progress  will we have to go back asked harry anxiously  it looks like it  cant we leap over  we might try i can if you are willing to follow  i kin jump dat easy enough put in blumpo  jerry stepped back and running a few feet made the leap in safety harry followed and then both boys waited for blumpo brown to join them  the homeless youth measured the distance with his eye and came on like a steam engine  but just before he reached the edge of the split he slipped and went headlong unable to stop himself he crashed down into the opening head first  in going over the rocks he twisted himself partly around  with one hand he caught hold of a frail bush growing among the rocks  his left foot caught in a crevice and there he hung unable to help himself and with death staring him in the face     chapter xiv  the hermit of the island   hell be killed yelled harry  his face was deadly white  help me came faintly from blumpo  before the others could realize it jerry had leaped back to the other side of the opening catching hold of a jutting rock with one hand he grasped blumpos wrist with the other  now let go below and ill haul you up blumpo he said  the frightened youth did as requested and slowly but surely jerry dragged him up to a safe spot  good for you jerry shouted harry  by golly but dat was a close call shuddered the homeless youth  then with tears in his big honest eyes he wrung our heros hand  you dun sabed my life jerry he declared solemnly i wont forgit dat neber  the nervous boy was averse to attempting a second jump and so the party walked along the opening until a much narrower spot was reached  once over the upward climb was again begun by noon they reckoned that they were within half a mile of the top but all were exhausted and glad enough to rest and take a bite to eat  a fine spring was found and here they washed up and quenched their thirst before resuming the journey  they found a large quantity of huckleberries growing on the hillside and these made very acceptable eating  a fellow could put in a month here remarked jerry but heigho the vacation will soon be ended and then for school again  the rest over they went up and up again  beat you to the summit cried jerry and started up the last stretch on a rush harry followed and blumpo was not far behind  what a splendid panorama was spread before them they could see clear to either end of the lake and off to the hills east and west  i see the church steeple cried jerry  look look exclaimed harry suddenly  he pointed down the lake to where a yacht was bowling along before the breeze  si peters boat  i wonder if peters knows we are still on the island mused jerry  i reckon he does  its a wonder he and his crowd never came up to make more trouble for us  perhaps he dun got scared at dis hoss pistol ob mine put in blumpo  to him that hoss pistol was a mighty weapon greatly to be feared  a little back of the summit of rocks was a grassy plateau and here the boys decided to camp for the night  what a beautiful place for a picnic said harry  rather hard to get to though returned jerry i wonder if there is a spring handy  a spring away up heah exclaimed blumpo yo expect watah to run up hill ha ha  yes blumpo strange as it may seem the finest springs are found at the very tops of mountains come on and look for one  the homeless youth showed his surprise but he readily joined in the hunt and so did harry there was a patch of brush behind the plateau and this they skirted ere long jerry found a tiny rivulet flowing in a wellworn hollow  the head of this rill of water will bring us to the spring he said  they began to follow the watercourse it led around half a dozen big rocks  halt  all three of the boys sprang back in amazement from whence had that unexpected command proceeded  halt i say  they stopped short  who are you asked jerry quickly  i am the lonely man leave me  the lonely man repeated jerry  yes depart my boys at once  are you the man they call the hermit of the island asked harry  i presume so now leave me i have not spoken to other men for years  we would like to get a little water first if you please said jerry surely so good an old man as you will not refuse us that  this way of talking evidently struck the hermits fancy for there was a rustle of bushes and the hermit of the island stepped into view  all of the boys stared at him in blank amazement he was a reddishblack individual with snow white hair and long flowing beard  blumpo grew so frightened that he immediately fell on his knees  de voodoo doctor suah he muttered  like many other ignorant people he was very superstitious and believed in charms and voodooism  we are sorry to have disturbed you in your lonely retreat began harry but we  say no more my boy get the water you need and depart  we will  harry and jerry turned toward the spring and quietly filled up the big tin can they had brought along  the old hermit watched them curiously  you look like good boys he said i want to ask a favor of you  what asked both boys in a breath  i wish to end my days here undisturbed will you promise not to reveal my dwelling place to your friends  i am willing to say nothing said jerry promptly  so am i returned harry  the old man looked much relieved  and how is it with you he went on turning and walking to where blumpo had his head bent low on the ground  please sah dont charm me sah dont cast no spell ober me howled blumpo i aint dun nuffin deed i aint ise de best boy in lakeview aint i harry aint dat de truf jerry  i will not harm you so do not be afraid said the hermit with a faint smile on his reddishblack face  i wont tell a ting not a word sah hope ter die if i do went on blumpo still keeping his face down  he was afraid that if he looked at the hermit he would be bewitched  blumpo get up said harry sharply dont make a fool of yourself this gentleman is not going to hurt you stand up and be a man  thus spoken to the homeless boy arose slowly to his feet his knees were still trembling and he needed but little incentive to take to his heels  i have not seen a colored or an indian boy in years went on the old hermit if you are an honest boy let me take your hand  he advanced and with his knees knocking together blumpo put out his hand and looked the old man in the face  the next instant the hermit gave a leap back in profound astonishment  abraham as sure as the sun shines and i thought he was dead     chapter xv  the hermits secret   all three of the boys were much mystified by the old hermits words  he must be a little off in his head thought harry  who is abraham asked jerry  this is abraham cried the hermit are you not abraham he went on to blumpo  i reckon not sah ise jess plain blumpo brown  blumpo brown ha how well i remember that name you are indeed abraham and i am your father  and the hermit caught blumpo in his arms it is needless to say the youth was frightened and bewildered  come to my cave and i will tell you all went on the hermit and he dragged blumpo along  jerry and harry willingly followed they found that the old man had quite a comfortable place among the rocks it was elaborately furnished showing that the hermit was welltodo  they all took seats on some skins thrown over rude couches the hermit made blumpo sit close to him  my name is daniel brown he began and you blumpo are my only son your full name is blumpoulahauthe indian for boyofthelaughingfacefor you know you have much indian blood in your veins  dats what folks said i had said blumpo  i thought you were deadthat you had been drowned it was this drove me to make a hermit of myself  then the old hermit went into many particulars to which all listened with great interest  blumpo could scarcely believe his ears his face began to expand and a smile broke out on it the like of which had never before been seen he was a homeless waif no longer he had found a father  jerry and harry talked to the old hermit for an hour and more they found him peculiar in his ideas but with a warm heart  before they retired for the night daniel brown came to the conclusion to give up his dwelling on the top of the mountain  he said he would build a cabin down by the lakeside and there he and blumpo could live like ordinary people  i have several thousand dollars saved up he said so we will not want for anything i will buy a boat and blumpo can make a living by letting her out to pleasure parties  dat will suit me exactly cried blumpo  but you must also go to school in the winter went on daniel brown and you must drop that dialect and not say dat for that  golly but wont i be eddicate murmured blumpo say pop maybe i kin habi mean havea new suit eh  two of them abraham said the hermit and then all hands laughed  it was well for the boys that they were housed in the hermits dwelling for that night a terrible thunder storm came up the wind howled and shrieked around the mountain top and continued until dawn  if we had been on the plateau we would have been blown off into the lake said harry at breakfast  by nine oclock it cleared off and at twelve the mountain was as dry as ever they packed up and accompanied by the hermit set off for the old camp  daniel brown knew every inch of the mountain and under his guidance they reached the bottom much quicker than they would otherwise have done  as they were trailing through the woods toward the camp harry suddenly put up his hand  listen dont you hear some persons talking he asked  where can it be asked jerry  down by the camp said blumpo  si peters crowd ill bet a new hat cried jerry come on all of you  the young oarsman broke into a run and harry and blumpo came after with the hermit lagging on behind a turn in the brush brought them in sight of the camp  there were si peters wash crosby and four others in the act of shoving harrys craft into the water  they intended to run off with our boat yelled jerry stop there you thieves  stop or well fire on you added harry  the peters crowd were surprised and alarmed they hesitated for a moment  go ahead dont mind them howled si peters quick fellows shove out to the yacht  before jerry and the others could reach the spot the big rowboat was afloat the peters crowd leaped on board and quickly shipped the oars  stop or well fire on you sang out harry again  fire and be blowed howled wash crosby  bang went harrys gun and the shot rattled all around the rowboat  but now a turn of a headland took the craft out of range  follow me said jerry as he leaped across the camp to where they could again catch sight of the craft  over the rock and through the brush they stumbled a distance of two hundred feet then the shore of the lake was again reached  but alas before they could do anything the peters crowd was entirely out of range they saw the big rowboat taken over to where the yacht lay at anchor harrys craft was tied fast to the stern and the rockpointers clambered aboard their own vessel  goodbye and good luck to you cried si peters mockingly hope you fellows enjoy playing robinson crusoe well come back for you some time next year  and then the yacht sailed away leaving those on the island to their fate     chapter xvi  an exciting chase   for the moment the boys did not know what to do si peters and his crowd had run off with their rowboat and how to get to the mainland was a serious question  to swim the distance would be a dangerous undertaking and there was no telling how long it would be before another craft should come along to take them off  but the hermit solved the problem  if you want to follow those boys you can take my boat he said  have you a boat asked jerry quickly  certainly although i use it but sparingly and then only at night  the hermit led the way to the lower end of the island here in a watercave rested a long roundbottomed row boat containing two pairs of oars  just the thing cried jerry come on harry  he and his chum leaped in blumpo looked at his newly found father  i will go along if you wish said the hermit  in five seconds more all four were in the boat which was then shoved out into the lake  with jerry and harry at the oars they made good progress in the direction of si peters yacht  all were armed and blumpo occupied the time in seeing that every weapon was ready for use  the wind is dying out said harry that is in our favor  they have not more than half a mile start rejoined jerry we ought to catch up in half an hour  it was evident that those on the yacht did not anticipate pursuit for it was not until the distance between the two craft had been considerably lessened that they showed signs of alarm  they see us cried blumpo shall i give em a shot  no wait replied jerry  the wind had now gone down almost entirely and the yachts sails were flapping idly  si peters and wash crosby were evidently alarmed at the turn affairs had taken and they called their chums around them for consultation  we cant do anything while the wind is down said crosby  lets get out and row suggested graves who was one of the number  can we tow the yacht  we can try  this was decided on and all of the crowd leaped into harrys boat they brought the craft around to the yachts bow and then every one took an oar  see they are hauling off the yacht cried harry they mean to get away somehow  well race them replied jerry  they bent to their oars and made the old hermits boat fairly fly through the water slowly they crept nearer and nearer it was an exciting chase  take my place blumpo cried jerry at last and the boy willingly obeyed  jerry leaped into the bow and taking up his gun pointed it at si peters head  si peters he calledout do you see this gun unless you stop rowing ill fire at you no matter what the consequences are  si peters turned deadly white for he was in reality a big coward  do you hear me went on jerry onetwoth  stop dont shoot yelled the rockpoint bully and he held up his oar  now wash crosby you stop rowing too went on jerry  think you are boss eh sneered crosby  i am up with the oar  crosby hesitated and then his oar went up beside sis the others became badly frightened and also stopped rowing in a moment more the hermits craft was beside the big rowboat  the rockpointers gazed at the whitehaired man in astonishment they wanted to know who he was but just then had other matters to attend to  you think you own the earth when you have a gun howled si peters to jerry  were on top that is certain responded our hero say harry supposing we get on the yacht and make them row us back to the island  not much growled wash crosby  just the thing cried harry  still keeping the peters crowd under guard jerry and his friends boarded the yacht  then much against their will they made the others turn about and drag them back to where they had started from towing the hermits craft behind  peters and crosby were in a perfect rage but could do nothing as jerry pretended to be very savage and itching to shoot them  the island reached jerry made the peters crowd beach the boat and clean her  now take your yacht and begone he commanded and the crowd hurried off in doublequick order as the yacht drifted away the hermit laughed heartily  cleverly done he said jerry upton you are a smart lad  the boys spent one more day on the island and then left for home the hermit went along and created some surprise when he appeared on the streets of lakeview with blumpo his son  all the boys were glad that the homeless youth had found a father who would endeavor to make something out of the goodnatured and honest lad  there was also a surprise for our hero and harry  si peters and his gang had been arrested for burning down a barn belonging to harrys father  the rockpoint lads tried to beg off but the authorities took the matter in hand and every one of them was sent to the reformatory  this ended the rivalry for the time being between lakeview and rockpoint and as a consequence the autumn and winter which followed were comparatively quiet but stirring events were on the way as the chapters which follow will testify     chapter xvii  harrys new yacht   luff up a bit harry  all right jerry do you think we will make that point  if the wind holds out we are behind the rocks now and that cuts most of the breeze off  blumpo coil up some of that rope will you  to be suah returned the youth addressed  the scene was the deck of a handsome yacht named the whistler she was as clean cut as a craft could be and carried a spread of snowy white sails which would have gladdened the heart of any seadog to behold  three boys and an old man were sailing this craft the three boys were jerry harry and blumpo the man was jack broxton the boathouse keeper  the yacht was a new one recently purchased by harry parkers father for the use of his son and jerry  do you remember what a row we had up around this island last summer with si peters wash crosby and the rest of the rockpoint crowd mused jerry as the yacht swung around the north point of hermit island that spot where blumpo had so strangely found his father  dont i though cried harry i wonder if they are out of the reformatory yet for setting fire to the barn  i heard da was put in blumpo who now attended school regularly si peters got out las month an wash crosby got out six weeks ago  well i hope they turn out better boys now said harry seriously i dont see why they want to get into such trouble a fellow can have lots of sport without doing wrong  by the way harry the great yacht race comes off in long lake in a few weeks said jerry why cant we take our yacht down through the river and be on deck to see it  by golly dat would be most splendiferous yelled blumpo de best ting ive dun heard of dis summah  ive thought of it returned harry he turned to the old tar jack could we take the whistler down through poplar river to long lake  i reckon we could was the slow answer as jack broxton rolled his quid from one cheek to the other the water is running putty high now  it would be a fine trip in itself went on jerry ive never sailed down the poplar beyond carlville  nor i returned harry but never mind that just now here we are at the landing  an heah am my fathers house said blumpo  the former hermit now however a hermit no longer came out to greet his son in the meantime all hands lowered sail and tied up  it was a beautiful day and the young oarsman and harry had come over to the island to see what they could shoot they left jack in charge of the yacht and blumpo with his father and started off with guns and game bags for the interior  there cant be much game at this season of the year said harry but we may have a little sport and tramping in the woods does a fellow lots of good  indeed i know that was the quick response hullo heres a nasty bit of bog to cross  well go around by yonder big tree  the two boys went on in a semicircle when the big tree mentioned was reached jerry stepped on what he supposed was one of the twisted roots  a second later he let out a yell which was heard down to the landing  he sprang back so suddenly that he bumped into harry who was close behind and both rolled over in the wet grass  ere they could rise they heard an angry hiss and a snake darted from the tree and settled directly upon jerrys body  for a moment jerry was too paralyzed with fear to move or speak then as he recovered he threw off the snake and rolled away over harry and close to the boggy spot harry also turned away but came up against a heavy mass of brush  the snake hissed angrily the pressure of jerrys foot on its head had just been sufficient to arouse its anger it meant to strike if it could  hit it with your gun shouted harry  you hit it cried our hero oh  the snake was again coming on its long green body quivering in the spots of sunlight which shot under the trees there was no doubt but what it intended to fight the intruders more than likely it had a nest of young near  bang  the shot was a square one and when the smoke from the gun cleared away it was found that the reptiles head was completely severed from the body which latter continued to twist about until it fell into the water of the bog hole jerry kicked the head in after it out of sight  let us get out of here he said with a shudder who knows but what we have dropped into a regular nest of snakes  that he was right in his surmise was soon evident for low hissings could be heard on several sides without delay they sprang across the bog swamp and took to the higher ground where they could see every foot of the way before them  ive had snakes enough to last me the rest of the summer soliloquized jerry i hate them worse than anything else in the world look  he pointed on ahead to where there was a tree almost loaded with game birds at a sign from jerry both raised their guns and fired  there was a flutter and a whirr and then came a number of shrill cries from the birds which were wounded these the boys at once proceeded to put out of their misery  four birds said harry as he counted the lot that wasnt bad eh  youre right harry we wont get another such shot if we tramp all day  i move we get back to the yacht we have come a good distance and it will be more than dinner time before we can make it  i am with you we can go out hunting again this afternoon or try our hand at fishing  with the birds in their bags jerry and harry set out on the return to the landing  on the way they talked over the great yacht races soon to come off and also of the proposed trip through the poplar river to the large lake beyond  it will be a dandy trip said jerry and then he added with much spirit how i would like to sail on one of the yachts and help win  so would i rejoined harry it would be great sport not to say anything of the honor  when the chums arrived at the boatlanding they found blumpo and the others waiting for them a camp fire was burning a short distance away from the log house and over this the birds were done to a turn by the youth while the others prepared some potatoes and coffee brought from the yacht  blumpos father considered it a great holiday to have his son with him for the time being he asked blumpo how he was getting along with his studies and was pleased to learn that the youth was making fairly good progress  after dinner it was decided to sail around to the lower end of the island and try bass fishing for which the lake was famous  and then well come back here and stay all night said jerry to the old man  the lines were soon cast off and the mainsail and jib set and as soon as they caught the breeze they swung around and down the lake at a speed of several knots an hour  somebody else out besides ourselves observed jack broxton as he pointed to half a dozen sailboats cruising around this year everybody has the yachting craze  its great sport returned harry by the way he went on pointing to a large yacht coming up the lake on a long tack what boat is that  she is called the arrow i dont know who owns her was the old boatkeepers reply  she is coming over this way let us stand out a little and see who is on board  just as you say sir  yes im curious about that yacht too put in jerry  the course of the whistler was altered several points and they left the vicinity of the island shore as they drew closer to the big yacht jerry uttered a cry of astonishment  by jinks it cant be possible  whats up asked harry coming to his side  there are si peters and wash crosby on the deck of that yacht i can see them as plain as day  our old enemies murmured harry  da didnt lose no time in gittin togedder after da got out of de formatory did da laughed blumpo da say de bad ones allers do stick like glue  oh maybe theyll be firstclass chaps now said jerry who was willing to let the past be forgotten  dont you be too sure on that pint lads put in jack broxton its mighty hard to make anything out of a bad egg and si peters and wash crosby are bad eggs if ever there were any  dats so fo suah murmured blumpo  well we wont have any words with them said jerry well let bygones be bygones  i would like to know where they got that yacht said harry it cant be possible mr peters bought it for si when si went to the reformatory he told father he intended to send his son to a military school and cut off his allowance  maybe si has promised to reform hullo they are coming this way  jerry sprang up in alarm for the big yacht had suddenly veered around several points and was now coming head on toward them  well be run down shrieked blumpo in terror  the young fools muttered jack broxton dont they know anything about steering  the big yacht is evidently one too many for them see there is no one aboard but si and wash two hands are not enough for such a craft  nearer and nearer the two yachts came to each other  jack broxton did his best to steer clear of the arrow but he was at a disadvantage soon the big yacht took away all the wind of the whistler and she lay helpless  keep off yelled jerry but the cry was unheeded  bang crash the arrow struck the whistler on the bow the long bowsprit ripping a hole in the mainsail  then came a smashing of woodwork and the whistler began to sink     chapter xviii  the robbery of the rockpoint hotel   we are lost  heaben sabe us  cling fast for your lives  a dozen other cries rang out for the force of the collision was terrible  but all clung fast and no one was thrown into the water to be struck and perhaps instantly killed  what do you mean si peters yelled jerry you ran into us on purpose  there was no time to reply nor to say more after the crash the two yachts drifted apart and with a somewhat damaged bowsprit the arrow went on her way  as she slid by harry caught a glimpse of wash crosby holding fast to a big red valise which had come near bounding overboard he thought no more of it at the time but had good reason to remember it later  what shall we do asked jack broxton  weve got a neat little hole in the side  can we beach her on the island asked harry i dont want the whistler to go to the bottom of the lake  i reckon i can manage it just hold that bit of canvas over the hole  harry and our hero jumped to do as bidden while jack broxton and blumpo undertook to steer the yacht toward shore the craft was becoming so waterlogged that she acted clumsily and they had their hands full  we is gwine down suah groaned blumpo but as he spoke the keel grated on the sand and a moment later she swung around hard and fast and the danger of sinking was past  while jack and blumpo lowered the sails harry and jerry carried several lines ashore and tied them to the trees in such a fashion that the yacht could not pound herself even if the wind came up  after the sails were lowered old jack inspected the damage done  i can patch the mainsail in an hour he said but that hole at the bow will take three and i ought to have more tools than ive got aboard  cant we patch things up sufficiently to take her back into lakeview asked harry  maybe we can but it would be better on account of the wind to steer for rockpoint she couldnt stand the chop sea on the other course  all right well steer for rockpoint and take her over to dan masons boatyard  blumpo ran down the shore of the island to tell his father of what had happened while he was gone the others patched up the break at the bow with some thin wood and a square of canvas tacked on and gave all a coating of pitch  half an hour later found the whistler bound for rockpoint they had to sail along with great care for fear of breaking open the patched place had this occurred they would all have gone to the bottom  it was growing dusk when the harbor at rockpoint was reached at the dock they saw that something unusual had happened a crowd of men were gathered about talking earnestly and pointing up the lake  whoever they were they took a boat im sure of that said one man  thats so said another  but who were they and where did they go asked a third  ah thats for the police to find out  wondering what was up jack broxton and the three boys brought the whistler around to the boatyard and turned her over to dan mason the old fellow who was a firstclass man at repairing boats of all kinds promised to have the craft in good trim by noon of the next day  did you hear the news he asked after their business talk was at an end  what news asked jerry  about the hotel being robbed  robbed  exactly a couple of thieves got into the safe and took a box of jewelry and four hundred dollars in cash  by george dat am a loss ejaculated blumpo  the jewelry is said to be worth nearly one thousand dollars  have they any idea who the thieves were  no they wore handkerchiefs over their faces with holes cut in em for to see some thinks as how they got away in one o the boats lying up shore  how did they do the job questioned jerry with much interest  i didnt hear any of the particklers boys  come on up to the hotel and find out said harry we havent got to hurry home this evening  side by side harry and the young oarsman walked to the rockpoint hotel a large place now filled to overflowing with summer boarders  they found every one around the resort talking over the case presently harry heard somebody say that the stolen money and box of jewels had been placed by the robbers into a large red valise belonging to the proprietor of the hotel at once he called jerry aside  i know who committed this robbery he said  who  si peters and wash crosby     chapter xix  the red valise   of course jerry was astonished at his chums declaration  how do you know this  they had that red valise i saw it  let us make a few more inquiries before we say anything replied jerry slowly its pretty bad to accuse anybody of such a crime as this  they asked a number of people about the robbery but could gain no information which would directly implicate si peters and his crony  we had better keep mum for the present harry  what and let the robbers escape  oh i dont want that to happen  the two talked it over for awhile and when they returned home they were much troubled but that night word came from new york city which mystified them greatly  a detective telegraphed he had captured two tramps who confessed to a hotel robbery on lake otasco  that settles it said harry we were all wrong and i am glad we said nothing  on the following day they rowed over to rockpoint for the whistler they heard no more about the hotel robbery and the matter almost slipped their minds but they were destined ere long to remember the occurrence full well  jerry and harry talked matters over with their parents and made plans to sail down the poplar river to long lake and go to the yacht races at once  jack broxton was to accompany them unfortunately for blumpo his father was taken sick and the youth had to remain behind to attend him  bright and early the next day the trip was commenced  it lasted two days and three nights and then they found themselves out on long lake a large and beautiful sheet of water  harry and jerry had studied up all the newspaper reports concerning the race between the defender a splendid yacht from the poplar river and the spray a craft from up the lake and they knew exactly where to go in order to see the race to the best advantage  i know the captain of the defender well said harry he and father are old friends  maybe hell let you on his yacht then said jerry my but wouldnt that be jolly  i wont go without you said harry  i would like to be on that yacht myself said old jack broxton as they presently came in sight of the defender anchored a short distance from the starting point of the race  well run up and ill hail the captain said harry  this suited everybody and it was done the captain of the defender was on deck seeing to it that everything was in order for the race he greeted harry with a pleasant wave of his hand  can we come on board and take a look around asked harry  yes but you wont have time to waste was the captains reply weve got to get down to the starting point soon  the whistler was run up alongside and harry and jerry leaped on board of the defender they shook hands with the captain and also with frank lee the captains nephew a bright boy of their own age  they were much interested in the magnificent yacht and all of her appointments and laughed greatly when frank lee snatched off their caps and placed caps on them with the name of the defender above the peaks  now you fellows belong to the crew cried frank lee  all right well help you beat the spray returned jerry quickly  the captain overheard the remark and turned to harry  would you really like to remain on board during the race  indeed we would said harry and well do duty too same as the rest of the crew if youll only keep us you know both of us understand all about a regular yacht  well you can stay i am short one man and two boys ought to more than make up for him  perhaps jerry and harry were not delighted they sent word to jack broxton and then made themselves familiar with the great yacht the pride of all on board  soon it was time to up anchor and make for the starting point jerry and harry worked manfully at the ropes and so did frank lee no one is allowed to remain idle on a racing yacht the least one can do is to rush to this side or that and thus make ballast  all ready came the word and the signal was given to start and the defender and the spray were off  presently jerry came over to the captain who was at the wheel  can we pass the spray he asked anxiously  we can try upton was the reply can you take the wheel for a minute i must have a drink of water  aye aye sir said jerry  how proudly he took hold of the wheel he was for the time being in absolute command of the defender  an extra breeze sprang up they were sailing almost side by side with the spray suddenly the defender shot ahead our hero stuck to the wheel while harry and frank lee did their full share of work with the rest of the crew  the defender was ahead but the race was not yet over     chapter xx  the mishap to the yacht   the young oarsman was not allowed to remain at the wheel long soon the captain of the defender came up again and took charge  i see we have passed the spray he said thats a good one for you upton now we must keep ahead  after turning the wheel over to the captain jerry moved forward to where harry and frank lee were standing  in the meanwhile the gallant yacht was cutting the water like a razor the breeze was stiff and they were running free before it soon the spray was almost out of sight behind them  this defender is a great boat said harry  with the wind on the starboard quarter the defender and the spray reached along for over a mile at a six knots an hour gait  then the wind fell off to almost a calm  this is no good observed jerry  fortunes of racing laughed harry  i would like to see another stiff breeze  we may catch more than enough before we have finished put in frank lee  the further on the two yachts went the lighter became the wind and each in turn ran into soft spots when balloon topsails hung up and down idly  but no matter how the wind came the defender got along leaving the spray steadily behind  it was a triangular course of three miles to each side and soon the first side was sailed  the yachts wore around the first mark flat leaving it on the port hand  baby jib topsails had been sent down before the rounding and spinnaker poles were now ready for the balloon sail  with booms well off to port the defender led the way to the second stretch  sharp work was done in handling the spinnaker for just one minute after rounding this big balloon was set and pulling  this was clever work but the spray sailors did fully as as well for they had their spinnaker on just as fast  great caesar ejaculated our hero suddenly look  ashore the sky grew black and ominous foreboding a coming squall  the weather certainly looked bad and it turned out worse than it looked  instead of wind rain came on and soon all on board the yachts were soaked  what do you think of that jerry asked harry  were going to catch it and no mistake replied the young oarsman  all hands on board saw the coming squall and looked at the captain for orders but none came  the yachts favored by a strengthening breeze were pushed on to meet that which was sure to come and halfway over on the third stretch it came on hard and struck the defender  bang slash went the sails and the gallant yacht swept well over on her side  again all looked to the captain but he shook his head  reckon he wants to see what she can stand whispered jerry  he was right the captain at the wheel held the yacht up to it and held her true  on and on they went the sky growing blacker and blacker as they proceeded  suddenly jerry heard a crack like a pistol shot and looking forward saw that the standing part of the bridle to the jib had parted the seizing pulled out and away went the sheets  the sail snapped and cracked loudly and in a second more it carried away the club on the clew of the jib  there she goes yelled somebody  hardly had he uttered these words when the big sail split in half and hung flapping in the wind  it was now utterly useless to the racing yacht  a new sail must be set at once but in that high wind who would bring the old sail in  ill volunteer cried jerry as he sprang forward and harry and frank lee came close on his heels  the crew hung back for a moment and in that time jerry reached the flying sail  he caught one end just as an extra heavy puff of wind came on and in a twinkle he was dragged half overboard  but now harry and frank lee sprang to the rescue and then the regular crew came forward all worked like beavers and soon the torn sail was taken off  six minutes later a new sail was in place and on went the gallant defender as speedily as before  she carried herself well and nothing was lost in that blow but the jib  in the meanwhile the spray could not stand the strain and ran on behind with all sails reefed  a great yacht said those on the other boats and the defender stock went away up  the captain praised jerry for the quickness with which he had taken hold of the torn sail and steadied it  a loose sail on board a racing craft is a dangerous thing he said for there is no telling how much damage it will do  the squall was of short duration not lasting over seven minutes if as long it gathered strength as it worked off shore and some of the pleasure boats received the full benefit of it  as the defender got within two miles of the finishing line the breeze fell off  still the gallant craft held her own  the finish is in sight cried jerry presently  he was right a mile more and the race would be over  those on board of the spray did their best to haul up to the defender  the effort did not avail them for the defender gained steadily  at last the line was crossed  the defender had won the race by a lead of over half a mile and she received a rousing reception  steam whistles blew their mightiest flags waved and the crowd on the other boats shouted themselves hoarse  it was a great day and one never to be forgotten  that settles it said harry the defender is the champion yacht of the club  it was not long after this that the whistler ran up and took jerry and harry on board old jack broxton had seen the race and was greatly pleased  the boys resolved to anchor the whistler off the upper shore of long lake that night  well leave jack in charge and take a trip down to harmony beach suggested harry  this suited jerry and by half past six the two boys were on board the open cars on their way to the great summer resort they enjoyed the ride very much especially jerry who had never been to the beach before they visited the hotels and had supper and then listened to a band concert  it was after eleven oclock before they were ready to return to the whistler  as they were making their way back to the cars jerry caught harry by the arm  look look  harry looked and in a crowd of people saw wash crosby not far away stood si peters  both were swaggering around as if they had plenty of money and wanted everybody to know it  what shall we do asked harry  i hardly know replied jerry i feel certain in my mind that they robbed the rockpoint hotel in spite of what the detectives think  so do i but we cant prove it  the two boys resolved to watch peters and crosby and try to overhear any private talk they might have  peters and crosby entered a large music hall and sat down at one of the tables  motioning to harry our hero led the way to the side of the building  a board was off and by standing near the opening they could hear everything si peters and wash crosby said     chapter xxi  words and blows   the very first words spoken by si peters confirmed the young oarsmans suspicious  what did you do with the valise wash he asked  left it on the yacht at the cove replied wash crosby  thats where you made a big mistake  how so growled the toady  they might take it into their heads to search the yacht  oh i guess not  we dont want to run any chances of being found out  were all right dont worry  perhaps we are and perhaps we are not  oh keep still and let us enjoy the music growled crosby for an orchestra was now playing  a waiter came up and si peters gave an order jerry was quite sure he had ordered something stronger than what he was in the habit of drinking at home it was evident that the bully of rockpoint had turned out even worse than before  what shall we do whispered harry  we ought to inform the police  just my idea of it  i dont know if there are any officers around here  oh there must be  they looked around but in the darkness no policeman could be seen  you stay here and ill go hunt up somebody said jerry  scarcely had he spoken however when their attention was attracted to a row that was taking place in the concert hall two men were fighting and presently a chair flew through the air  at once those sitting around tried to retire  peters and crosby rushed out in the crowd and not to lose sight of the pair jerry and harry went after them  fifty feet from the concert hall the four came face to face si peters started back and wash crosby wanted to run for it  whowhat stammered peters  we have caught you said jerry boldly you may as well give in  what do you mean  we know that that you robbed the rockpoint hotel said harry  its not so cried crosby  shut up hissed si peters  without warning he hit jerry a sharp blow in the face then he rushed at harry and tripped him up  come on he yelled to crosby we must get away  like a deer he ran off behind a large roller coaster where all was dark  jerry stopped peters but only for a moment heavy blows were exchanged and then peters followed his chum  they are gone sure enough cried harry in dismay  and gone they were swallowed up in the crowd which surged on all sides of them  jerry and harry searched in vain for the two evildoers and then hunted up the police and told their story  a watch was set but si peters and wash crosby managed to escape from the beach resort without being detected  jerry and harry returned to lakeview with the whistler and the report spread that si peters and wash crosby had robbed the hotel  at first mr peters refused to believe it he came over to jerrys home and threatened mr upton with a lawsuit  but the farmer quickly silenced him  dont say a word to me mr peters he said a boy that will try to tar and feather another boy and then set fire to a barn and burn up cattle isnt none too good to rob a hotel  my son is as good as yours growled mr peters and went off in a perfect rage but he bothered the uptons no more nor did he go near the parkers  the lake was searched and the yacht found up at the cove si peters had mentioned on board was found the valise taken from the hotel  after this detectives were sent out to find the two young rascals but si peters and wash crosby kept out of sight  yet the day of reckoning was not far off as we shall soon see  about a week after this harry invited jerry to a drive along the west shore of lake otasco  as they bowled along they talked over all sorts of matters and presently harry mentioned si peters and wash crosby  i wonder if they are still hanging around harmony beach he said  oh i dont think they would dare replied jerry they must know by the newspapers that the detectives are on their track  i wish we could bring them to justice it would be a feather in our cap  so it would harry but i would rather have the law do the work i never want to have anymore to do with either of them  it did not take the two boys long to drive to the lower end of the lake here the team was put up at a livery stable and the chums hired bathing suits and houses and spread themselves for a fine dip in the lake  the water was just right and they enjoyed every second of the half hour they allowed themselves  it was eight oclock in the evening before they went to get their team again  the moon was just coming up over the rim of the lake and this promised them a splendid drive back to lakeview  as harry and our hero entered the turnout two figures stole up from the back of the barn  the pair were si peters and wash crosby  they ran on ahead and as the boys waited to settle with the livery stable keeper they soon disappeared  harry drove and the young oarsman leaned back and took it easy  a mile was covered and they were just passing a clump of bushes when whizz a stone came flying into the carriage it struck jerry on the arm causing him to cry with pain  who threw that he exclaimed  whizz came another stone it struck harry in the cheek drawing blood  whoa yelled jerry and while the horses were still in motion he leaped to the road  he had noted the direction from which the missiles came and bound off but behind the bushes all was dark  look out for yourself cried harry  he was busy with the horses who were shying first to one side and then to the other  at first jerry could see nothing but soon he discovered two forms in the semidarkness  he rushed over and found himself face to face with si peters and wash crosby  peters he ejaculated  scarcely had he spoken when a club was raised jerry tried to avoid the descending blow but was only partly successful  the club landed over his shoulder and neck and he was more than half stunned  come he heard peters whisper to crosby and then all became a confused whirl and he pitched forward in the grass  the two rascals ran out into the road  that for you harry parker yelled si peters and struck harry in the knee with the club  in the meantime wash crosby sprang half into the carriage  he made a grab at harrys gold watch chain  the chain broke from the buttonhole and along with it came harrys beautiful timepiece  ill keep this to remember you by cried wash crosby in derision and away he sped across the highway and down a side road with si peters at his heels     chapter xxii  another boat race   the horses now demanded all of harrys attention one of them was bound to run away and the youth had all he could do to hold the animal in check but the lad knew what he was doing and presently held them under complete control  then our hero staggered out of the bushes with his hand on his neck where a big lump was rising  where are they  gone did they rob you jerry  no  then you are in luck  what do you mean harry  crosby took my gold watch and chain  never  he did jerry those two chaps have turned nothing but common thieves went on harry bitterly  it certainly looks so harry what shall we do now  jump in and well go after them  jerry was soon beside harry and they turned up the side road taken by the fugitives the moon was out full making the way as light as day yet nothing was to be seen of the rascally pair  this was not to be wondered at for after running along the road but a few hundred feet si peters and wash crosby had taken to an open field crossing this they came out upon a railroad track a freight train was coming along slowly around the bend of the lake and they had had small trouble in boarding this inside of an hour they were many miles away from the vicinity  jerry and harry searched for the pair until midnight and then gave up the hunt and returned to lakeview once again the authorities were notified and the detectives started on a fresh hunt for the evildoers yet it was destined to be a long time before si peters and wash crosby were heard of again  about this time the lakeview boat club was organizing another series of rowing races and both harry and jerry were easily persuaded to enter a contest which was to take place between a number of local oarsmen  a prize of a fine bicycle had been put up also several other articles of more or less value and jerry and harry immediately went into training with a firm determination to win  there were seven entries all by young fellows of jerrys age and as the youth looked at his opponents he felt that the race would be no easy one  saturday afternoon the time appointed for the contest came bright and clear and it found the lake front crowded to its utmost capacity many came over from rockpoint but it was noticed that those who had belonged to si peters crowd were absent  the race was to be two miles long up the lake and back again the boats were all drawn up in a line and everything was made ready for a start jerry was at one end of the line with harry at the other and the remaining five contestants between them  bang went the gun on the judges boat and away shot the seven rowers like one man and the race was begun  for over half a mile the seven contestants kept almost side by side then three of them were seen to drop behind  gravling is ahead  harry parker is second  phil raymond is a close third  jerry upton is crawling up  so the shouting went on as the four leaders swept past when the turning point was reached harry led raymond came second gravling third and jerry fourth the remaining three felt they were out of the race and rowed back to the boathouse  good for you harry  whats the matter jerry youre not doing as good as the day you beat si peters  hurry up gravling  pull for all you know how raymond  on and on came the four their long blades flashing brightly in the sunshine they were making fast time and no matter who won the lake record was likely to be broken  half way down the homestretch harry still led with gravling but half a length behind him a length further back came raymond and jerry side by side  but the terrific speed was now beginning to tell upon raymond and slowly but surely he fell behind despite the urgings of his friends then jerry set to work to overtake gravling  see jerry upton crawling up  oh but isnt that a beautiful stroke  gravling cant shake him off  they are a tie  the last cry was true when still a dozen lengths from the finish jerry had overtaken gravling but they did not remain tie long half a dozen strokes and jerry shot ahead and the bow of his craft overlapped harrys stern jerry upton is second  hes going to shake up harry parker for first place  on came the two friends but now it was noticed that jerry although he still rowed his best seemed to be losing his interest in the race  it will be no fun to beat harry was the thought which ran through his head and then with a yell from three thousand throats harry crossed the line a winner with our hero not quite half a boat length behind  hurrah for harry parker  hurrah for jerry upton  cheer after cheer rent the air and both lads were immediately surrounded by their friends jerry was one of the first to shake his chums hand  you won it fairly harry he said what kind of time did we make  he was greatly pleased to learn that the lake record for two miles had been lowered by fortythree seconds and that he had helped lower it by fortytwo seconds  that evening the club held a meeting and harry was presented with the bicycle something he had been wishing for for some time jerrys prize was a silver watch and chain  this just suits me he said now when im away from home ill be able to tell what time it is  the celebration was at its height when a message came for jerry from his home stating that his father had been kicked by one of the horses and was badly injured  this news shocked the youth a good deal and bidding his friends a hasty goodnight the young oarsman set off for the farm on a run  he found his father lying on a couch in the diningroom a doctor had just arrived and he was doing all that he could for the sufferer  where did the horse kick him mother he questioned hurriedly  in the side right under the heart replied mrs upton oh i do trust it is not serious  so do i what can i do  i dont know we must see what the doctor says  the medical man after a long examination declared that several ribs had been fractured and that mr upton was suffering from shock some medicine was administered and the patient was carefully carried upstairs and placed upon a bed  no one in the farmhouse slept that night mrs upton sat by her husbands side and jerry came and went ready to do anything that might be asked of him  two days later the doctor pronounced the wounded man out of danger but his injuries were severe and it would be a long while before mr upton would be able to go around as before  his enforced idleness made the farmer fret a good deal it was true that the harvest work on the farm was over but he had wished to do much more  and i reckon that trip to new york is now out of the question jerry heard him say to mrs upton  why father were you going to new york asked the boy in much curiosity  i had an idea that way son returned mr upton slowly i was going on business he added after a pause  at this jerry was more curious than ever new york was over two hundred miles from lakeview and he had never heard of his parent having business in the metropolis  you see its this way jerry said mr upton noticing his look when your uncle charley died he left all his property to me some time ago i was cleaning out one of his old trunks and i ran across some deeds to property in california from what i can make out the land must be nigh to the city of sacramento  and the property belongs to you cried jerry  no i cant say that exactly as near as i can figure it your uncle charley owned an interest in it the property was in the hands of a land boomer named alexander slocum and there was a letter in the trunk from this alexander slocum which was dated from new york i think this boomer holds other papers relating to the land and i was thinking of making a trip to new york and hunting him up if he is still there  why not let me go to new york in your place suggested jerry quickly it had always been the ambition of his life to pay a visit to the great metropolis  well i was kind of thinking of that son returned the sick man slowly ill see about it in a day or two     chapter xxiii  jerry starts on a journey   now that the matter had once been talked over the young oarsman was very anxious to know all about the property in california and his mother brought forth the deeds and other papers found in the old trunk  the boy studied the documents with care he knew but little of the law yet he felt that if the land mentioned in the papers was valuable his fathers share as heir to his uncle must be considerable  i would like to ask mr parker about this he said to his folks but mr upton shook his head he was a very retired man and never brought his affairs to the ears of any outsider  the whole thing might prove worthless he said and then we would be laughed at by our neighbors  id risk it said jerry but his father only shook his head again  nevertheless mr upton appeared to be favorably impressed with the idea of jerrys going to new york to hunt up alexander slocum  it wont do any harm he said to his wife i have money for the fare in the house and it will give jerry a chance to see a bit of the world  mrs upton was doubtful but when jerry begged to go she finally consented long talks about the western land and alexander slocum followed and the youth prevailed upon his folks to let him take the deeds and papers with him promising that he would take the best of care of them  and while im in new york im going to look around for a situation and earn a little money said jerry who knows but what i may strike even a better opening than that mr parker has promised me at his shoe factory  its not likely a lad off the farm can strike much smiled his mother yet she was pleased at jerrys earnestness  three days later jerry was off valise in hand he had bid goodbye to harry and blumpo telling them he was going to new york on some private business for his father his mother saw him to the train and kissed him affectionately  take good care of yourself jerry she said and remember new york is an entirely different place from lakeview or rockpoint and you must have your eyes and ears open to avoid trouble  ill take care of myself dont worry mother and two minutes later the train came along and he was off  yet it must be confessed that our hero felt just a bit strange as he settled back in the cushioned seat with his valise beside him he was going over two hundred miles from home and among total strangers  i suppose it will be different from knocking around lakeview rockpoint or even long lake he mused ill have to brace up and watch myself or theyll take me for a regular greeny  as the train moved on jerry revolved the situation in his mind he knew he would arrive in the metropolis late in the afternoon and determined to seek a boardinghouse first of all knowing it would be useless to hunt for any trace of alexander slocum after office hours  at last the run through green fields and small towns and cities came to an end and the train ran into the grand central depot at fortysecond street and jerry alighted in a crowd and made his way to the street  cab coupe this way for the central hotel evening paper sun or world  a hundred cries seemed to start up all in an instant making jerrys ears ring the rattle of the carts and trucks on the pavement was also new and for the moment the lakeview boy did not know which way to turn  carry yer baggage queried a barefoot boy and almost caught his valise from his hand but the young oarsman pulled it back and shook his head and got out of the crowd as quickly as he could starting eastward for he had heard that the cheaper boarding houses lay in that direction  it was not long before the boy came to several places which displayed the sign boarding but the first two were too elegant and jerry passed them without stopping then came a third and ascending the steps jerry rang the bell  an elderly lady answered the summons a sharpfaced woman with powdered hair  you take boarders here queried jerry  we do young man she answered in a voice that made our hero far from comfortable  i expect to stay in new york a week or two and i  we dont take transients she snapped only regular boarders with firstclass references and she shut the door in jerrys face  he was glad enough to escape to the pavement feeling satisfied that he would not have cared to have boarded there even had she been willing to take him in  a block further on was another place a modest brick residence set back behind a small plot of green thinking this looked inviting and not reasoning that the spot of green was as valuable as a brownstone building would have been jerry entered the garden and made known his wants to the servant who was dusting the piazza chairs  she called the lady of the house who on hearing what jerry had to say smiled in a motherly way  i hardly think i can take you in my boy she said do you know how much i charge a week  no maam  twelve to fifteen dollars for a single room and not less than ten otherwise  jerry almost gasped for breath  that is twice what i can afford to pay he returned gracious i had no idea rates were so high  that is not high here in new york but perhaps i can direct you to a place that will suit i have a friend three blocks over here is her card and she handed it over  thanking her the young oarsman got out without delay he was glad she had directed him for now he was certain he would at least strike a place that would fit his pocketbook  jerry went on until he came to an avenue down which the elevated cars were running they were a great novelty and he paused on the corner to watch several of the trains rattle along overhead  as jerry was about to move on he heard a wild cry of alarm from the second story window of a house opposite looking in the direction he saw a girl pointing up the street to where a babycarriage had rolled from the pavement to the gutter overturning itself and spilling a little child into the street  the youth ran in the direction with the idea of picking the child up as he did this an icewagon came along at a furious speed the driver on the seat trying in vain to stop his horse  the icewagon was heading directly for the child and unless something was done the little one would be run over and most likely killed with his heart in his throat our hero threw down his valise and leaped to the rescue in another instant the runaway horse was fairly on top of the lad     chapter xxiv  the work of a real hero   jerrys heart was in his throat when he sprang to the rescue of the little child in the street he saw that the horse attached to the icewagon could not be stopped and realized only too well what it meant should he be struck down  yet the sight of that innocent face nerved him on and in less time than it takes to write it he had the child in his arms clinging to the little one he flung himself backward and like a flash the horse sprang past dragging the icewagon so close that the wheels scraped his leg  a shout went up from the crowd but jerry did not hear what was said staggering up he ran back to the sidewalk leaving the babycarriage a wreck behind him  in another moment the girl who had given the first cry of alarm was at jerrys side  is he hurt is little tommy hurt she cried as she snatched the youngster from jerrys arms  me fell in the dirt lisped the little one me aint hurt but me awful dirty  never mind the dirt dear cried the girl i am thankful you escaped mary why didnt you take better care of him  the last words were addressed to an irish girl who had just sauntered up  i went to get a hokypoky at the corner replied the girl i dont care to mind yer brother any more anyway she added and darted out of sight into the crowd  seeing the little boy was uninjured the crowd moved on and presently the young oarsman found himself alone with the girl who appeared to be several years older than himself  you are a brave boy she said warmly i would like to reward you but i am poor  i dont want any reward replied jerry stoutly it was a close shave though  you look like a stranger around here  i ami just arrived in new york and i am looking for a boardinghouse can you tell me where this one is and jerry showed her the card the lady had given him  oh yes it is one block over to your lefta real nice house too may i ask your name  jerry upton  mine is nellie ardell and this is my brother tommy we are alone here  havent you any folks  no mother was with us up to last winter but she had consumption and died  the tears stood in nellie ardells eyes as she spoke jerry saw at once that she had had a hard struggle of it  what do you do for a living he ventured to ask  i do sewing and mending for my neighborsprincipally mending for the girls who work in the stores  and can you make much that way  not a great deal but i try to make enough to pay the rent and store bills may i ask what you are going to do in new york  i came to find a real estate dealer named alexander slocum i want to see him about some property left by my uncle to my father have you ever heard of him  heard of him she cried in surprise he is my landlord  jerry was dumfounded by this unexpected bit of information  you are certain  why of course i am he was around to see me only day before yesterday about the rent i am a bit behind and i had to put him off  and what kind of a man is he  i think he is very hardhearted but then that may be because i am behind in my payment he threatened to put me out of my rooms if i didnt pay when he called again  how many rooms have you  only two and i pay six dollars a month for them  and how far behind are you  i only owe for the month  and he wont trust you even that long he certainly must be mean jerry rejoined warmly  you said something about property belonging to your father said nellie ardell has mr slocum an interest in it  he has and he hasnt the boy replied and he told his story in a few words as they walked along to the entrance of the house in which she lived  well i trust you get your right jerry upton said the girl come and see me some time  i will and after jerry had procured alexander slocums office address from her the pair separated  jerry was very thoughtful as he proceeded on his way by a turn of fortune he had gotten on slocums track much quicker than expected the question was how should he best approach the man  ill settle that after i have procured a boarding place he thought and hurried to the address given him  mrs price the landlady was a very nice old person she had a top room in the back she said she would let with board for five dollars a week and jerry closed with her without delay paying for one week in advance  this finished our hero found he was hungry and after a washingup ate supper with a relish he could not help but notice that the vegetables and milk served were not as fresh as those at home but remembered he was now in the city and not on a farm and did not complain  mrs price had taken in another new boarder that day a tall slim man possibly thirty years of age he was introduced as mr wakefield smith and he did all he could to make himself popular jerry felt that a good bit of his pleasantry was forced but as there was no use in finding fault he became quite friendly with the man  supposing we take a walk out together this evening wakefield smith suggested no doubt you would like to see the sights  ill go out for an hour or so answered the young oarsman and they started while it was yet light  mr wakefield smith knew the metropolis from end to end and as the pair covered block after block he pointed out various buildings he smoked constantly and several times invited jerry to have a cigar but the youth declined  supposing we have a drink then he urged  again jerry declined which made the man frown he insisted jerry should at least have some soda water with him and at last the boy accepted and they entered rather a modest looking drug store on a side street  hullo whats that crowd on the street exclaimed mr wakefield smith as the glasses were set out and as jerry looked out of the doorway he fancied the man shoved up close to where his glass was standing and made a movement as if to throw something into it  jerry saw nothing unusual in the street and the mans manner made him suspicious so that he hesitated about drinking the soda he swallowed a small portion of it and threw the remainder in a corner  whats the matter dont you like it demanded wakefield smith almost roughly  no its bitter  humph he growled something under his breath ill not treat you again he went on as they came out on the street  what jerry had taken of the soda had made his head ache and this caused the young oarsman to grow more suspicious than ever he had read in a daily paper about folks being drugged by friendly strangers and resolved to be on guard  the pair passed on the distance of a block and then jerry announced his intention of returning home to the boardinghouse  oh dont go yet urged mr wakefield smith come on across the way there are some beautiful pictures in an art store window i want to show you one of the pictures is worth ten thousand dollars  he caught our hero by the arm and hurried him over the way and into the crowd jerry was jostled to the right and left and it was fully a minute before he squeezed himself out to a clear spot then he looked around for mr wakefield smith but the man was gone  like a flash jerry felt something had gone wrong he put his hand in his pocket his money was missing     chapter xxv  a fruitless search   less than half a day in new york and robbed oh what a greeny i have been  thus jerry groaned to himself as he searched first one pocket and then another it was all to no purpose the money was gone and he was left absolutely penniless  the young oarsman was certain that mr wakefield smith had robbed him he had been wary of the man from the start and now blamed himself greatly for having given the rascal the chance to take the pocketbook  without loss of time jerry darted into the crowd again looking in every direction for the thief he was so eager he ran plump into an old gentleman knocking his silk hat to the pavement  hi hi stop you young rascal puffed the man as jerry stooped and restored the tile to him what do you mean by running into me in this fashion  excuse me but i have been robbed i want to catch the thief  robbed  yes sir  the gentleman nervously felt to see if his money and watch were safe several others heard the words and they gathered around jerry  who robbed you  how much did you have  why didnt you hold the thief  before jerry could answer any of the questions a policeman came forward and touched him on the shoulder  are you the boy said he was robbed  yes sir  what were you robbed of  a pocketbook containing nearly thirty dollars  did you see the thief  i believe it was a man i was walking with he called himself wakefield smith  the policeman questioned jerry closely and then took a good look around for the individual later on boy and officer walked to mrs prices boardinghouse  here it was learned that mr wakefield smith had not paid any board money giving as an excuse that he had nothing less than a onehundreddollar bill and that he would pay in the morning it also came to light that he had walked out with mrs prices silverhandled umbrella worth eight dollars  the villain she cried i hope the police catch him  you dont wish it more than i do returned the young oarsman dolefully he took my last dollar  acting on the policemans advice jerry walked around to the nearest precinct station and made a complaint giving the best description of mr wakefield smith he could  we will do our best to capture him said the captain in charge and with this promise the youth had to be content  my readers can imagine our hero did not spend a restful night he lay awake for several hours speculating on the turn affairs had taken his board was paid for a week but that was all he did not even have money to pay car fare back to lakeview  i wonder what mother and father would say if they knew he thought i wont let them know until theres nothing else to do  jerry arose early the next day and got breakfast before any of the other boarders  i must find something to do without delay he explained to mrs price a fellow without a dollar in his pocket cant afford to remain idle  you have a weeks board coming to you she said with a faint smile  yes but i havent even the price of a car fare in my pocket  well mr upton i like your looks and if youll accept it ill loan you a couple of dollars i suppose it was partly my fault that smith robbed you but dont blame me ive suffered too  i will accept the loan gladly mrs price i dont like to go around without a cent i will pay you back as soon as i can  i know you will i may have been deceived in that smith but i am certain i am not in you added the landlady  with the two dollars tucked away in a safe place jerry left the house he knew it would be useless to go to alexander slocums office at such an early hour and determined to look around in the hope of striking something whereby he might earn at least enough money to last him while stopping in new york  i wont write home unless i have to he muttered to himself my time is my own and ill make the most of it while im here  getting one of the dollar bills changed jerry bought a morning paper and looked over the help wantedmalescolumn and noted several addresses  ill try them and lose no time he thought and hurried to the nearest store where a boy was wanted  he was surprised to find a dozen applicants ahead of him worse than that a boy had already been hired so all of the others were forced to leave  jerry next tried a florists establishment but here a boy was wanted who understood the city thoroughly and he was quickly told he would not do  jerry walked from one place to another for three hours without success somewhat disheartened he strolled into a park close to broadway and sat down  the situation was certainly a serious one and the young oarsman was decidedly sober in mind as he sat there staring vacantly at the hurrying throng  well young man how did you make out last night  the question came from a bench just behind jerry looking around he saw sitting there the gentleman he had run into while trying to find wakefield smith  i didnt make out at all sir  couldnt find him eh  no sir  those pickpockets are slick chaps and no mistake went on the gentleman  did you lose much  all i hadnearly thirty dollars  phew that is too bad well i wouldnt sit down to mope about it you might as well get to work and earn the amount over again  the trouble is i cant find any work answered the boy earnestly i would work fast enough if i could only find it to do  you are out of a situation  yes sir  since when  since i came to new york answered jerry  you are about as bad off as i was some forty years ago said the man with a broad smile at that time i found myself in this city with just twentyfive cents in my pocket but i struck employment and rose from one place to another until now i am my own master with a bookbindingshop where i employ nearly fifty hands  as he spoke he gazed at jerry curiously  you were going to ask me for a job werent you he went on and jerry nodded what can you do  im not used to any such work sir but youll find me willing and strongand honest i would like to earn a little before i went back to my home  well those three qualities you mention are sure to win my boy perhaps i can find an opening for you here comes a friend i have been waiting for i am going out of town with him call at my shop tomorrow morning if you dont strike anything in the meantime  and handing out his card mr islen walked rapidly away  fifteen minutes later found jerry on the way to alexander slocums office in an inner pocket he carried the papers his father had unearthed from the trunk in the garret at home     chapter xxvi  alexander slocum is astonished   jerry felt that his mission to the real estate man was a delicate one what would he have to say when he learned who the youth was and what he had come for  the boy resolved to be on guard he might be from the country and green but no one should catch him napping as had mr wakefield smith  the distance to the address furnished by nellie ardell was nearly a dozen blocks but jerry was used to walking and made the journey on foot  the young oarsman found alexander slocums set of offices located on the top floor of an oldfashioned fourstory office building there was an elevator however and this jerry used and soon found himself in front of a groundglass door which bore the sign                              alexander slocum                      real estate and fire insurance                             loans negotiated  there was a hum of voices from within but the hum ceased as jerry knocked  come in was the short invitation and the boy entered to find a large apartment comfortably furnished with desks stuffed chairs and other things which went to show that the man he had come to interview was doing well  near an open window sat two gentlemen dressed in black one was much older than the other and jerry rightfully guessed that he was an office assistant  the other man was well preserved with a waxed mustache and piercing black eyes he held a silk hat in his hand as if he had been on the point of leaving  well young man what can i do for you questioned the office assistant as he regarded jerry indifferently  i came to see mr alexander slocum replied our hero  i am mr slocum put in the other man what is it you want  i came to see you on a bit of private business sir  yes well mr casey here knows all about my affairs so you need have no hesitation in speaking in front of him laughed the real estate man somewhat harshly  i am jerry upton and i came from lakeview my uncle charles upton who is now dead was once interested in a colonization land scheme that you started  jerry watch mr slocum narrowly as he spoke and saw that the man was greatly astonished he started back and for an instant the assuring look his face wore faded  jerry upton from lakeview he murmured slowly then he cleared his throat ii did not expect to see you  i suppose not sir  what is it you want  i want to find out how matters stand in regard to the land in california my father heard you had gone to europe  i did go to europe but not to escape inquiry added slocum hastily you see that scheme failed utterly he went on slowly why i lost nearly every dollar i possessed in it what your uncle lost was nothing in comparison  it was to him mr slocum to whom does the land belong  why iterit reverted to its original owners some mine speculators of denver  where is the land located  not far from the city of sacramento  cant you give me the precise location  at this alexander slocum glared at our hero savagely  it would do you no good to spend money on hunting the matter up he answered that affair was settled long ago the money was lost and that is all there is to it  not if i know it mr slocum i intend to sift the matter to the bottom i am convinced that all was not carried out as it should have been  you appear to be a very foolish boy  that may be your opinion but it wont alter my intention i have my uncles papers with me and unless you will give me some particulars of how the scheme fell through i shall place the matter in the hands of a lawyer  alexander slocum winced at this and jerry fancied he was hard struck he made a movement as if to clutch the youth by the arm then drew back  you have your uncles papers he asked cautiously  yes my father is his sole heir  i should like to see them perhaps i spoke hastily but really you are mistaken in thinking it can be of any use to bring that old deal up again the money was lost and there is no chance of getting it back again  but either you are responsible for the amount or else my uncles interest in the land still holds good said jerry  let me see the papers  mr slocum made a movement as if to take them but jerry drew back and shook his head  i prefer not to let them go out of my possession  do you mean to say you wont trust me  you can put it that way if you wish mr slocum  the real estate man bit his lip then he made a movement to his assistant who at once slid behind jerry towards the door  what are you going to do the young oarsman asked in alarm  without replying the assistant locked the door and slipped the key into his pocket  dont grow excited said alexander slocum coldly i want to see those papers thats all show them to me at once  like a flash jerry realized he was trapped by the enemy     chapter xxvii  jerrys clever escape   jerry saw at once that things were growing warm from the look on his face it was plain to see that alexander slocum was in deadly earnest when he said he wanted to see those papers  his manner made our hero feel that the papers would not be safe in his hands if he gave them up he might never see them again and without the documents the claim on the land in california would fall flat  did you hear what i said upton i want you to let me see those papers slocum went on after a second of intense silence  what do you mean by locking that door jerry demanded of the elderly assistant without paying any attention to the real estate dealers words  casey made no response instead he took his stand by his employers side as if awaiting further orders  you act as if you were afraid of me sneered slocum i wont hurt you  you wontnot if i can help it answered jerry but i want you to unlock that door i am not to be treated as a prisoner  i only wanted to secure us against interruption so many agents come up here and they are a regular nuisance  slocum advanced and held out his hand as if expecting jerry would drop the precious papers into it instead the boy retreated and took up a position behind a flattop desk in the centre of the office  at this the real estate dealer grew furious behind his wellwaxed mustache he had expected to intimidate our hero easily and now he was nonplused  are you going to let me see those papers he fumed  no at least not now  why not  i prefer not to answer that question  you think you have a case against methat you can place me in a tight hole  well if all is straight you have nothing to fear  dont preach to me boy all is straight i lost my money as well as the others did  this doesnt look as if you had lost much ventured jerry as he glanced about the elegant apartment  oh i have made money since in a lucky real estate deal in brooklyn i wont keep your papers  i want that door unlocked  slocum muttered something under his breath and his face grew suddenly red like a flash he placed his hands on the flat desk and leaped over it  ill bring you to terms you young country fool he cried and made a clutch for jerrys collar  had our hero not turned like a flash he would have had the lad but jerry was on guard and fled to the office door raising his foot he gave the barrier a kick that caused it to crack heavily  stop that  i wont let me out or ill kick the door down  casey catch the young rascal cried slocum im going to teach him a thing or two  anxious to obey the command of the man who held him completely under his thumb casey ran forward seeing him coming jerry fled behind a large screen here rested a heavy cane and he picked it up and brandished it over his head  keep back advance at your peril  im afraid to go near the young fool said casey  ill fix him stand aside i never yet saw the boy that could get the best of me muttered alexander slocum  he may kill you mr slocum  ill risk it  running around the desk the real estate dealer came for the young oarsman as he approached the boy pushed the screen against him and he went down with the heavy object on top of him  youyou villain he spluttered  to this jerry made no answer taking advantage of the time afforded him he looked around for some means of escaping his enemies to remain a moment longer in the office he felt would be perilous in the extreme  near the corner to which jerry had retreated was an open window glancing out of it he saw that the roof of the next building was but six or eight feet below the window sill  without stopping to think twice our hero leaped out of the window and on to the roof below  stop stop  both slocum and his assistant called after jerry but he paid no attention leaving the vicinity of the window he ran along the roof to the rear here there was an addition to a tinshop underneath and he dropped down and found himself within twelve feet of a narrow alleyway  are you coming back bawled alexander slocum and then as jerry let himself down over the edge of the roof he suddenly disappeared from the window  guessing he was coming down to head him off the youth lost no time in dropping to the ground  once down it was an easy matter to gain the street as he came out on the pavement slocum came running up all out of breath  youre a fine boy he cried come back to the office and let us talk matters over  not today answered jerry ive had enough of a dose for the present  you are making a mistake  i dont intend to put my head into the lions mouth  while the two were speaking casey came up and as the two appeared as if they wanted to drag jerry back into the building just left the youth retreated  alexander slocum followed for a block and then gave up the chase seeing this jerry walked on more leisurely  our heros visit to the real estate dealer had set him to thinking deeply the mans anxiety concerning the papers made the boy feel sure there was more at the bottom of the land speculation than either his parents or he had suspected  perhaps the land was still held by this man and was of great value if this was so how was he to go to work to establish his fathers claim  pondering over the affair the young oarsman thought of mr randolph islen and of his kindness he resolved to tell that gentleman his story and see what he would have to say  this conclusion reached jerry felt in his inner pocket to see if the precious papers were still safe to his horror they were gone     chapter xxviii  something about a tramp   gone  the cry burst involuntarily from jerrys lips and for the moment his heart seemed to stop beating the precious papers were missing  what had become of them with great haste he hunted all of his pockets not once but a dozen times then he felt in the linings and in fact in all places where the packet might have become concealed  it was useless they were gone that was all there was to it  had he dropped them in slocums office or during his hasty flight to the alleyway  our hero retraced his steps with eyes bent to the ground in hopes that they would be found lying on the walk in doing this he ran into half a dozen folks many of whom did not take kindly to the collision  look where you are going boy  hunting for a pin or gold dollars  jerry paid no attention to the remarks reaching the alleyway he turned into it and continued the search but without success  say wot yer doin in here  the question was asked by a youth in the tinshop he was redheaded and had a freckled face but not an unpleasant one  i was looking for something i lost said the young oarsman have you seen anything in here of a flat white package with a black shoestring tied around it  why yes i did he answered  and where is it  a tramp had it i saw him walk out of der alley wid it not five minutes ago  a tramp what kind of a looking man  tall and thin with a grizzly beard oh he was a regular bum  where did he go  up the street i think was the bundle valuable  indeed it was to me replied jerry and hurried off  he could see nothing of any tramp and after dodging around among the trucks for several minutes returned to the youth  please describe that tramp to me will you asked jerry and the tinners boy did so as well as he was able  i think da call him crazy jim he concluded he dont come down here very often he belongs uptown somewhere  well if you ever see him again please let me know my name is jerry upton and here is my address and our hero handed it over  all right i will my name is jerry martin wot was in de package  some papers belonging to my father  the boy wanted to question jerry for further particulars but the young oarsman did not care to say too much and hurried off to seek the tramp again  that evening found our hero at mrs prices footsore and downhearted he had seen nothing of crazy jim and it looked as if the precious packet was gone for good  jerry could not help but wonder what alexander slocums next move would be would the man endeavor to hunt him out or would he write to his father  the next morning on his way to mr randolph islens place of business jerry met nellie ardell  did you find mr slocums she asked  i did and had a very disagreeable visit returned our hero  i knew you would have she went on i wish he was not my landlord  jerry asked her how tommy was and then they parted and five minutes more brought our hero to the bookbindery  mr islen was not yet in but he soon arrived and smiled as jerry presented himself  on hand i see my young friend well how did you make out did you obtain a position  no sir  its rather hard mr grice he called out  the foreman of the bookbindery came in and jerry was introduced to him quite a chat followed at the end of which jerry was hired to work in the stock department at a salary of six dollars a week  the salary was not large but it would pay his expenses and that was all he wished for at present  i wont have to write home for money he thought  mr grice wanted jerry to come to work immediately but our hero begged to speak to mr islen in private for a moment and when they were left alone told his story from beginning to end  the rich bookbinder listened with interest and tapped meditatively upon his desk when jerry had finished  this is rather a strange story upton he said what would you like me to do  i would like you to give me some advice sir what had i best do  you can do a number of things what would be the best i cannot say you might hire a lawyer to look into the case and again you might have this slocum arrested for locking you in the office the loss of the packet complicates matters did it have your name on  yes sir  then you had better wait and in the meantime advertise for the packet offering a reward that tramp may be watching for such an advertisement  this was sound advice but jerry had no money and said so  i will pay for the advertisement and take it out of your pay said mr islen and the notice was written out without delay and sent off by the office boy  the young oarsman now felt a trifle lighter in heart he reasoned that the packet would be of no value to the tramp and that he would be glad to surrender it in hope of a reward he did not remember at the time that he had written alexander slocums name and address on the outside wrapper yet such was a fact  when jerry entered the bindery he found several pairs of curious eyes bent upon him from boys of about his own age without delay mr grice set our hero to work  what is your name asked one of the boys as soon as he had a chance  jerry upton what is yours  dick lenning say do you know you have got the job grice was going to give my brother  no i dont  its so jack was coming to work tomorrow it aint fair to take the bread out of a fellows mouth like that growled dick lenning  i fancy mr islen gave me my position jerry ventured  oh so it was the boss put you in well it aint fair anyway where do you come frombrooklyn  no lakeview  never heard of it must be some country village you look like a hayseed  as dick lenning spoke he gazed around to see if mr grice had gone then he added in a whisper  you have to set up the drinks for the crowd before you can work here see  drinks repeated our hero  sure all the new hands do that  ii rather think i wont  you are too mean  its not that i dont drink  you are a country jay and no mistake  dick lenning leaned forward and shoved jerry with his elbow at the same time putting one foot behind the youth he wanted to trip our hero up but jerry was on guard and resisting him the young oarsman caused him to slip down against a bench upon which rested a pot of bookbinders glue  the glue tipped over and part of it went down lennings leg causing him to yell like a wild indian     chapter xxix  mr wakefield smith again   ill hammer you for that  what did he do dick  knocked the glue over me you country jay you howled dick lenning and leaping up he bore down on jerry  lenning was a good deal of a bully he was tall and strong and evidently he thought he could make our hero submit to his will easily  take that he fairly hissed and aimed a blow at jerrys ear the youth dodged it and caught his arm  hold on jerry ejaculated i dont want to fight you will only make trouble  let go  not until you promise to keep quiet  ill promise nothing stormed lenning and began to struggle more excitedly than ever  but he soon wore himself out when jerry got behind him and clasped hands over his breast the bully was about to call on his friends to assist him when a cry went up  cheese it grice is coming this way  as if by magic the boys who had gathered around ran off to their work leaving the bully and jerry alone our hero released his opponent and turning around lenning glared at him vindictively  ill get even with you for this see if i dont he muttered in a hoarse whisper  then he followed his friends and mr grice came up and took jerry to another part of the shop  i have changed my mind about letting you work here he said i want you to get used to the place before i put you among those other boys  evening found our hero a good deal worn out not so much by the work as by the close confinement of the bindery how different life in the great metropolis was to life in the green fields of the country  after supper jerry determined to take a walk uptown to get the outdoor exercise and also in hope of seeing something of the tramp who had taken the packet he knew that looking for the tramp in the metropolis was a good deal like looking for a pin in a haystack but imagined that even that pin could be found if one looked long and sharp enough for it  the young oarsman sauntered forth toward broadway and thence past the fortysecond street depot and up to central park it was a long walk but he did not mind it in fact it seemed to do him good for it rested his mind  the window displays interested jerry not a little and he took in everything that came along so the time flew quickly until coming to a jewelers window he saw it was after ten oclock  ill have to be getting back he said to himself and was on the point of returning when he saw that which surprised him greatly a cab whirled past the corner upon which he was standing and on the back seat he recognized mr wakefield smith  the pickpocket was alone and ere jerry could stop him the cab rolled down the side street out of hearing  our hero did not stop long to consider what was best to do but took to his heels and followed the cab as best he could  the cab gained a distance of nearly two blocks and jerry was almost on the point of giving up when it came to a halt in front of what looked like a private clubhouse wakefield smith alighted and paid the cabman who went about his business without delay  stop there cried jerry to the pickpocket as the man mounted the steps of the house but whether the man heard our hero or not he paid no attention when jerry reached the spot he was standing on a low porch  did you hear me went on jerry and to prevent smith from entering the place our hero caught him by the button of his coat  to jerry surprise the rascal offered no resistance instead he came down the steps backward and fell on his back on the sidewalk his hat rolling toward the gutter  shay waz you do that fer he hiccoughed  jerry gazed at the pickpocket in wonder then the truth flashed over our hero the man who had robbed him was beastly intoxicated     chapter xxx  an unlooked for adventure   it would be hard to express jerrys feelings when he found mr wakefield smith was suffering heavily from intoxication for the moment he could do nothing but stare at the man as he lay helpless on the pavement  waz you mean boy went on smith and he tried in vain to get up waz you knock me down for i demand to know  do you recognize me said our hero sharply as he looked the pickpocket squarely in the face  nodont know you from adam pon my word  i am jerry upton the boy you robbed the other night  at the words smith straightened up for a moment and a look of alarm crossed his face  jerry upton he repeated slowly  yes what have you done with my money  aint got a dollar of your money  if you havent youve drank it up jerry ejaculated you ought to be ashamed of yourself  zats all right mboy all right i assure you come on and have a good time with me  with great difficulty wakefield smith arose to his feet and staggered towards the house he had been on the point of entering jerry pulled him back and held him as our hero did this he saw smith drop a tendollar bill jerry picked it up  you are not going in thereyou are going with me  where to  to the nearest station house  the pickpocket gave a hiccough and a cry of alarm that was very much like a whine  to the station house  yes come on  never  smith struggled feebly to get away but the boy held him with ease overcome the man finally sat down on the curbstone and refused to budge  shay let us compromise he mumbled it was all a mistake  it was no mistake  if i give you ten dollars will you call it off  no  then you dont git a cent see  and with great deliberation the pickpocket closed one bleared eye and glared at jerry  well see about that later cried our hero hotly and catching the rascal by the collar the youth yanked him to a standing position now come on and no nonsense  seeing that the youth was not to be fooled with wakefield smith tried to dicker again getting himself badly twisted in his plea that he would make everything all right jerry would not trust him and forced him to walk along until the nearest corner was reached here he suddenly made a clutch at an electriclight pole and held fast  help help help he cried out at the top of his lungs police  the young oarsman did not know what to make of this appeal for assistance for it seemed to him that the authorities were the very people mr wakefield smith wished to avoid he was destined however to soon learn a trick that was brand new to him  the pickpocket had hardly uttered his cry when a bluecoat put into appearance and came running to the spot  whats the trouble here he demanded  shay officer make that young fellow go away hiccoughed mr wakefield smith  what is he up to  trying to rob me officer reglar slick aleck  at this cool assertion jerry was dumbfounded  so youre trying to rob this gent eh said the bluecoat turning to our hero and catching his arm i reckon i came just in time  its a falsehood he is the pickpocket rejoined jerry as soon as he could speak  he looks like it said the officer sarcastically  he didnt rob me now he robbed several nights ago i just ran across him  hes a slick aleck went on mr wakefield smith dont let him take my watch officer  no fear of that come along with me young man  if i have to go i want him to go too  at these words mr wakefield smiths face changed color  i cant go officer have an important engagement at theerclub  he is a pickpocket and ill prove it at the station house said jerry warningly it is your duty to make him go along ill help you carry him if its necessary  and youll skip out too if you get the chance remarked the policeman grimly  if you think that handcuff me to this fellow  do you mean that  i do sir  hang me if i dont think you are honest after all  hes a big thief bawled mr wakefield smith  keep quiet and come along they can straighten matters out at the precinct  the officer took mr wakefield smith by the arm and started to walk the prisoner away with a dexterous twist the intoxicated man cleared himself and plunged down the street  the bluecoat and jerry made after him as quickly as they could but a drawing school in the neighborhood had just let out and they were detained by the crowd mr wakefield smith stumbled across the street and down a side thoroughfare that was very dark the officer and our hero went after him but at the end of the second block he was no longer to be seen  now youve let him escape said jerry to the policeman i have a good mind to report you  go on with you howled the officer in return i reckon it was a put up job all around clear about your business or ill run you in for disorderly conduct  and he made such a savage dash at the young oarsman with his long club that our hero was glad to retreat  he continued the hunt for the pickpocket alone but without avail and much disheartened finally returned to his boardinghouse he was afraid he had seen the last of mr wakefield smith and was glad he had gotten at least ten dollars from the pickpocket     chapter xxxi  nellie ardells troubles   on the following morning jerry went to work at the bindery as if nothing had happened when he went in dick lanning glared at our hero and stopped as if to speak but changed his mind and walked off without saying a word  during the day the young oarsman became much better acquainted with his work and began to like it  that night on leaving the bindery by the side entrance which opened on a narrow lane our hero saw dick lanning and several of his friends waiting for him  he attempted to pass but lenning put out his foot and had jerry not stopped he would have been tripped up  let me pass said he sharply but instead of complying lenning took a stand in front of him and hit the youth on the shoulder  i said id git square he hissed savagely if yer aint afraid stand up and fight  im not afraid replied jerry and pushed him up against the wall  without delay a roughandtumble fight ensued  give it to him dick  do the hayseed up  knock him into the middle of next week  these and a dozen other cries arose on the air and the crowd kept increasing until fully a hundred spectators surrounded the pair  dick lanning had caught jerry unfairly but the youth soon managed to shake him off and hauling back gave him a clean blow on the end of his unusually long nose which caused the blood to spurt from that organ in a stream  hes tapped dicks nose  my wasnt that a blow though  the country lad is game  wild with rage dick lanning endeavored to close in again jerry stopped the movement this time by a blow on the chest which sent him staggering back several feet into the crowd  whats the matter dick  dont let him use you like that  ill fix him howled the bully and rushed at our hero a third time  again he hit jerry this time in the chin but our heros blood was now up and calculating well he struck a square blow in the left eye that knocked the bully flat  dick is knocked out  that country jay is a corker  git up dick yer eye is turnin all black  better let him go hes too much for you  dick lanning was slow in coming to the front the eye was not only black but it was closing rapidly  hes got a stone in his fisthe dont fight fair he growled to his friends  i have nothing in my fist retorted jerry if he wants anymore i fancy i can accommodate him although i dont care to fight  dick lanning was uneasy he glanced toward his friends and passed a signal to one of his cronies  police skip cried the crony come on dick you dont want to git caught  and he dragged dick lanning away while the crowd scattered like magic no policeman was in sight nor did any appear it was only a ruse to retire without acknowledging defeat  but that fight taught dick lanning a severe lesson he still remained down upon the young oarsman but in the future he fought shy of our hero knowing that jerry would not stand his bullying manner  on saturday the shop closed down early and having nothing else to do jerry walked down to the newspaper office in hope of receiving some answer to the advertisement for the missing papers  but no answer was forthcoming and disappointed he retraced his steps and sauntered in the direction in which nellie ardell and her little brother tommy lived  ill call on them and see how she made out about her rent he said to himself and mounted the stairs to her apartment  there was a murmur of voices in the kitchen the door was partly open and jerry saw the girl and her little brother standing there confronted by a burly man  that rent has got to be paid thats all there is to it the man was saying  i cannot pay today replied nellie ardell i will try to pay monday  it wont do ive given you notice and if you cant pay you have got to leave  at this the girl burst into tears  would you put me on the street she wailed  ill have toits orders replied the burly man doggedly  whose order  mr slocum  mr slocum is a very hardhearted man cried the girl indignantly  thats so jerry put in as he entered  oh jerry upton nellie ardell cried when she saw our hero this man wants to put me out of my rooms  its a shame  who are you demanded the burly man do you live here  no i am this young ladys friend however did mr slocum say to put her out  yes  what shall i do if they put me on the street wailed nellie ardell  im sure i dont know but slocum shant put you on the street if i can help it went on jerry suddenly  what will you do  how much do you owe him  twelve dollars i have four but he wont take it he wants the entire amount  i will let you have ten dollars said our hero and brought out the bill wakefield smith had dropped  oh wont that be robbing you cried nellie ardell but her eyes glistened with pleasure  never mind take it and pay this man off  nellie ardell accepted the amount without further words  now she said as she paid the man i am going to move  move what for  i can get better rooms for less money just across the way  the burly mans face fell he was alexander slocums agent and he knew that to get tenants for the rooms nellie ardell occupied would be difficult  it aint right to move nowin the middle of the summer  you intended to put me outif i couldnt pay the rent  that is different  i have paid up promptly for many months mr slocum could have been a bit easier for once  he is more than mean put in jerry i would advise you to move by all means  you seem to know a great deal about him sneered the agent  i doand ill know more some day  the agent began to growl but seeing he could do nothing he went off to inform alexander slocum that nellie ardell intended to move     chapter xxxii  a crazy mans doings   you are more than kind to me jerry upton exclaimed nellie ardell when they and her little brother were left alone  i didnt want to see you thrown out of your home said jerry soberly  i shall pay you back that money as soon as i possibly can she went on i expect to get about twenty dollars for sewing next week one of the ladies i work for is out of town but is coming back on wednesday  all righttake your time when will you move maybe i can help carry some things for you  ive a good mind to move this afternoon those other rooms are all ready  then do it and ill pitch right in and in fun the young oarsman picked up several chairs  i will will you be kind enough to stay with tommy a few minutes  certainly  nellie ardell went off at once and was back in ten minutes when she returned she had rented three small rooms for less money than she now paid  she had not many articles of furniture and it did not seem the least bit like working to our hero to assist her in transferring them across the way the two worked together and as they labored they talked jerry telling her a good deal about his mission to new york and the girl relating her own experiences in keeping the wolf from the door  we were not always poor said nellie ardell when father was alive we lived in our own home in brooklyn but he grew interested in a western land scheme and it took all of his money  that was our trouble i came to new york to see what i could do toward making alexander slocum give an accounting of the money he put in a california land scheme for my uncle  why my father was in slocums land scheme she ejaculated  perhaps it was the same this land scheme i speak of was called the judge martinwhy i dont know  it is the same it was so called because the land once belonged to a judge martin of colorado  of course jerry was deeply interested and the moving finished he and she sat down to talk the matter over  from what our hero learned of nellie ardell he came to the conclusion that alexander slocum was every inch the villain he had taken him to be  the real estate dealer had hoodwinked the girl completely and she had surrendered to him all the documents her parent had left behind at the time of his death  its too bad said jerry we must work together against him but nothing can be done until my missing papers are recovered  before he left another matter was discussed and settled in her new quarters nellie ardell had a small room she did not really need and she offered to board jerry at three dollars and a half a week as this would be an acceptable saving just at present our hero accepted the offer and agreed to make the change on the following monday  sunday passed quietly jerry spent part of the day in writing a long letter home telling the folks just how matters stood and urging them not to worry as he felt certain all would come out right in the end and that he was quite content to remain in new york and support himself until he had settled matters with alexander slocum the letter was finished late in the afternoon and after taking supper he went out to post it  the novelty of life in the city had not yet passed and the letter put into a corner box the young oarsman sauntered on and on taking in the many strange sights  he had gone a distance of half a dozen blocks when he came to a church the doors were wide open and as the congregation were singing he stopped to listen to the music  when the music stopped our hero passed on down the street which seemed to grow poorer as he advanced the new houses gave place to those that were very old and on all sides jerry could see the effects of grinding poverty  its a great city he thought and it is true that one half doesnt know how the other half lives  please mister will you give me five cents  jerry stopped in his walk and looked down to see who had addressed him it was a little girl and she was crying bitterly  five cents he repeated  yes mister please dont say no ive asked so many for the money already and they wont give me a cent  what are you going to do with five cents  ive got to bring it home to daddy  to daddyyou mean your father  hes a sort of a father but hes not my real papa sobbed the little girl he took me when papa died  what does youryour daddy want with the five cents  at this question the little girls face flushed  ii darent tell youdaddy would whip me she whimpered  does he drink  i darent tell you  does he send you out very often to beg  he sends me out when heswhen hesbut i darent tell you he would whip me most to death  where do you live  over there  and the little girl pointed to a long row of rear tenements the very worstlooking in the neighborhood  and what is daddys name  his real name is james machenry but the folks around here all call him crazy jim she answered  jerry started back in surprise crazy jim was the tramp who had been seen walking off with his packet of documents  so you live with crazy jim said our hero to the little girl slowly  yes sir  how long have you lived with him  oh a long while sir  take me to him  at this request she drew back in horror  oh i cant do that indeed i cant she faltered  why not  i took a man to him oncea charity officerand daddywhipwhipped me for it  then show me where he lives went on jerry after a pause you neednt let him see you i must have a talk with him perhaps ill give him some money  the little girl still hesitated but finally led the way up the street into a horriblelooking alley and pointed to a dingy tenementhouse  daddy is up there on the top floor in the back  and is that where you live asked jerry with a shudder he could not repress  yes of course  its not a nice place  oh no and something like a tear glistened in the girls eye  here is ten cents for you added jerry you had better keep it for yourself are you hungry  a little i only had some bread today for dinner and supper  then go down to the restaurant on the corner and get something to eat for the money you need it  the little girl ran off to do as bidden and our hero entered the dilapidated tenement four dirty men and women sat on the stoop smoking and drinking from a tin pail  who are ye lookin fer asked one of the men roughly  crazy jim answered jerry briefly and brushed past him  the hallway was dark and it was with difficulty that the young oarsman found the rickety stairs every step of which creaked as he trod upon it  arriving at the top floor the youth noticed a shaft of light streaming from beneath a door in the rear he knocked loudly  there was a movement within the door was flung back and jerry found himself confronted by a tall roundshouldered individual with long unkempt hair and a wild look in his small black eyes     chapter xxxiii  the little nobody   well demanded the man laconically  is this james machenry  thats me boy  i would like to see you on business jerry went on as he brushed past and entered one of the barest living apartments he had ever seen  on business  yes a few days ago you picked up a packet downtown belonging to mea packet containing some documents and letters  who said they belonged to you  i say so my name is jerry upton and i dropped the packet in the alleyway where you found it  the man stared at our hero  say is this a game he demanded harshly  what do you mean  are you trying to get me into trouble  no i am trying to keep you out of trouble replied the young oarsman warmly  you say that packet belonged to you  yes  it didnt have your name on it  no it our hero stopped short it had alexander slocums name on it he burst out  exactly  you dont mean to say you delivered that packet to him gasped the youth  i didnot an hour ago  jerry fell back into a chair and breathed heavily the packet was goneinto the hands of the enemy  the man said it was his package said crazy jim he gave me a reward of five dollars for returning it to him  it was mine he wanted to steal itand now hes done it cried jerry you let him have it but an hour ago  yes  where did he go  i dont know  did you open the packet  yes but i couldnt make nothing out of itcos i aint eddicated i read his name on it and got another fellow to write a postal card yesterday afternoon he came here examined the papers and seemed much pleased  no doubt he was pleased groaned the young oarsman  was the thing worth much  it was worth a good deal i would have given five dollars to get it back  what does he want with it  wants to do my father out of some property answered our hero by the way who is that little girl who lives with you  at this question crazy jims face darkened  that aint none of your business he growled  you shouldnt send her out on the street to beg  wot has she been blabbin again ill break every bone in her body and off the man started out of the room and down the narrow stairs  jerry had noticed that his breath smelt strongly of liquor he was not only a drinking man but also one who was not quite right in his head  dont hurt her you brute called out the boy and followed him out of the alleyway into the street at the nearest corner stood the little girl and crazy jim rushed up to her fiercely  you goodfernothin he bawled ill teach ye a lesson didnt i tell ye ter keep yer clapper still about me take that and that  he raised his heavy hand and struck her a cruel blow on the side of the head she staggered back and he was about to repeat his unjust action when jerry thought it about time to interfere catching him by the arm our hero hurled him backward with such force that he fell flat in the gutter  at once a shout went up from those who saw jerrys action  what are yer doin  who is that boy  with a fearful exclamation crazy jim arose to his feet  ill fix ye fer that he hissed and sprang forward you aint got no right ter interfere between me an the gal  you are a brute burst out our hero this little girl has done nothing to deserve such punishment  who set you over me howled the infuriated man ill fix ye  he tried his best to hit jerry with his fist but the young oarsman dodged him and took a stand in front of the little girl  you had better run away jerry whispered to her he is in a terrible mood just now  where shall i go whimpered the girl  anywhere up two blocks i will join you soon  without delay the little girl ran off crazy jim tried to follow her but jerry headed him off  seeing he could do nothing with his hands the savage man looked around for some weapon a heavy stone was lying handy and he picked it up the next moment it was launched at our heros head  luckily jerry was quick at dodging or he might have been seriously wounded the missile went sailing over the lads head and flew with a crash through the front window of a neighboring store  the smashing of the pane of glass was followed by a shout of alarm from the storekeeper who sat in a chair on the pavement  here vots dot he yelled vot you means py preaking mine vinder hey you crazy gim i vos got you locked up aint it bolice bolice  the german storekeeper continued to yell so loudly that it was not long before an officer appeared seeing this jerry backed out of the crowd and hurried off he saw the policeman catch crazy jim by the arm and a wordy war followed a minute later the fellow was being marched off to the stationhouse no doubt the policeman would have liked it had he found jerry but our hero kept at a safe distance  it was now quite dark and it was with some difficulty that jerry again found the little girl she stood by a hitching post sobbing bitterly  where is he she asked choking back her sobs  the policeman took him off dont cry any more jerry added soothingly  but where shall i go she asked i cant go back  have you no friends  no crazy jim and i came to new york alone when papa died  where did you come from  the little girl shook her head at this she had been too young to remember  what is your name  dottie  dottie what  nothing only dottie  jerry was in a quandary to a certain degree he felt responsible for her present forlorn condition suddenly an idea struck him  if you will come with me ill see to it that you have a good bed tonight and breakfast in the morning he said and after that ill see what i can do for you dottie  who are you  my name is jerry upton  you look like a nice boy and ill go with you and she placed her hand confidently in that of the young oarsman  jerry took the little one to nellie ardells apartments of course she was much surprised and sitting down our hero had to explain everything as far as he was able nellie ardell agreed instantly to take the little girl in  you can stay here until we can do something for you she said i know how it would feel to have little tommy on the streets homeless  and soon after that dottie was put to bed very well content her hard life with crazy jim had made her used to ups and downs that no ordinary little girl could have endured  the reader can well imagine that jerry did not sleep much that night he could not forget that alexander slocum had the precious packet of papers bitterly he regretted not having taken better care of the documents  i will call on slocum and come to some sort of an understanding jerry said to himself perhaps when i tell him that both nellie ardell and myself are ready to proceed against him he will be willing to come to terms  the next day was a busy one at the bookbindery and our hero got no chance to call on slocum during that time he learned that crazy jim had been locked up for resisting the officer and had been sentenced to thirty days on blackwells island  the young oarsman did not know what to do about little dottie but nellie ardell solved this question  i have received a whole lot of new work she said so for the present we can keep her to mind tommy while i am dressmaking  so the little girl stayed on jerry never dreamed of how much she had to do with his future life  on thursday mr islins brother died and the bindery was closed for several days jerry took the opportunity to walk down to alexander slocums offices  the real estate man was alone and greeted our hero with a sinister smile  so you have seen fit to call again young man were his first words  mr slocum let us come to business jerry replied firmly what are you going to do about my fathers claim  alexander slocum laughed harshly  your fathers claim he repeated i dont recognize the fact that your father has any claim against me     chapter xxxiv  alexander slocum shows his hand   alexander slocums statement was no more than jerry had expected so he was not taken back by the words he looked the man steadily in the eyes  so that is the position you are going to take nowsince you received my packet from james machenry said jerry deliberately  slocum started and winced and the young oarsman saw that crazy jim had spoken the truth  i havent anything belonging to you upton  it is useless for you to deny it mr slocum he found the packet and delivered it to you for a reward of five dollars  the packet he delivered to me was my own it contained some legal documents belonging to this office  you may make others believe that mr slocum but  but what boy remember i want none of your insolence here i will listen to you but you mustnt grow impertinent  im only speaking the truth you virtually robbed me just as you robbed my father and mr bryant ardell  ha slocum leaped to his feet whowhere did you hear of bryant ardell he asked excitedly  i have met nellie ardell several timesin fact i am boarding with her  did she set you to hounding me  no we met by accident after i had come to new york almost on purpose to see you  she is an impudent young woman  she told me that you had her land papers just as you now have mine  its a falsehood  if both of us go to court with our story we may prove that it is not a falsehood  ha are you going to combine to ruin my reputation cried the real estate dealer growing pale  we are going to try to obtain our rights  youll gain nothing illill have you locked up on a charge of blackmail alexander slocum began to pace his office nervously see here upton how much do you want to go off and leave me alone he questioned suddenly  i want what is due my father  youll not get it he whispered hoarsely throwing his mask aside do you think i have plotted and worked all these years for nothing not much all that property is mine do you hear nobody else shall ever own a foot of it now ill tell you what i am willing to do ill give you a hundred dollars in cash and well call it square mind you i dont admit your claim i only want to avoid trouble  jerry looked at the man and drew a long breath he could see through slocums words as clearly as he could see through the window his fathers claim was worth a fortune  come what do you say demanded slocum as jerry did not answer him  i say this mr slocum rejoined our hero i wont accept your proposition and before i am done with you ill have our rights and youll be in states prison  with a snarl very much like that made by a fretful tiger the man leaped toward the boy as if to grab him by the throat  you fool ill make you come to terms  his hand touched jerrys collar but the young oarsman evaded him and placed the flattop desk between them when the man ran around the desk jerry picked up a heavy brassbound ruler  stop or ill crack you with this cried our hero and seeing the weapon slocum halted  dont be a fool boy  i dont intend to be  you can do nothing against me  that remains to be seen  who will take your word against mine nobody you are a mere country lad while i am a wellknown new york citizen  mr ardell was also well known in his day  again alexander slocums face grew pale  nellie ardell has no doubt urged you to attack me he growled i must see her why didnt she come with you  she is busy  i will explain matters to her in detail really the claim is not worth anything but i wish to avoid trouble and  you might as well stop mr slocum for its too late to say that now i am positive our claims are of great value since you wont do the right thing i shall advise my father to bring action in court to compel you to come to terms  while speaking jerry had walked to the door and now placed his hand on the knob  stop stop  no i have had enough for the present  you villain  slocum ran toward jerry who opened the door to step out but found the way blockaded by casey his bookkeeper  here whats up cried the man in wonder  dont let him get away casey cried alexander slocum he is going to make trouble sure  let me go burst out our hero as the bookkeeper caught hold of him let go or ill  jerry never finished that sentence alexander slocum had picked up the ruler the youth had dropped and leaped to the front down came the weapon on the young oarsmans head he felt a sharp stinging painand then he knew no more  when jerry came to his senses all was dark around him he was lying on a damp cement floor evidently that of a cellar  his head ached greatly and for several minutes he could not remember what had happened  then came back that scene in slocums office he staggered to his feet  where was he and how long had he been there  the first question was readily answered stepping forward jerry stumbled over some loose coal he was in a coalcellar around and above were brick walls the door was of sheetiron and it was tightly closed and barred how had he come to that place probably his enemies had carried him hither although how they could do it without being seen was a question  as soon as our hero felt strong enough he looked about for some means of escaping from his prison with great care he examined the walls and tried the door  finding no outlet on any side he turned his attention to the pavements above from one spot there came a faint glimmer of light in a circle and he rightfully guessed that the coalhole was located there  how to reach the hole was a problem it was several feet above our heros head and there was nothing in the coalvault to stand upon  jerry considered the situation for a minute and then standing directly under the cover of the hole leaped upward sending his hand over his head as he did so  the cover was loose and the force of the blow caused it to fly upward another blow and it fell away entirely and in a second more the young oarsman was clambering out of the opening  it was drawing towards evening and the street was full of people some of which eyed the boy curiously restoring the cover to its place he left the spot  the question now was should he return to slocums office or seek outside assistance he decided upon the latter course to attempt to bring the rascally real estate agent to terms alone would be foolhardy  jerrys head ached so much he could think only with difficulty and he decided to return to nellie ardells apartments it was a hard walk and he was glad when the place was reached and he could sit down  whats the matterare you hurt cried the young woman  i was knocked out replied the youth with a sorry little laugh ive got a pretty big lump on the top of my head  sitting down he told his story to which nellie ardell listened with breathless attention  the wicked man he should be locked up she burst out when jerry had finished its a wonder he didnt kill you  thats true as it was the blow was awfully hard  what will you do now  i really dont know  wont that mr islen whom you work for help you  perhaps he will returned the youth struck with the idea the trouble is his brother is dead and that has upset him  one thing is certain jerry the property is valuable  yes and another thing is certain added our hero we want our shares of it  it would be a great help to me to get some money out of it said nellie ardell with a sigh this sewing constantly day in and day out is wearing on me  the two talked for over an hour and then jerry felt compelled to lie down it was nearly morning before his head stopped aching and he got some rest     chapter xxxv  a strange disappearance   on the next day the bindery was opened as usual but mr islen did not appear having gone to philadelphia jerry worked throughout the day wondering what alexander slocum had thought and done after he had discovered the escape little did the young oarsman dream of what the real estate dealer was then doing  our hero was proving himself to be skillful at the work assigned to him and the foreman often praised him  youll be worth a raise in wages he said i never saw a boy take hold as you do  jerry never delayed after the days work was over he washed up put on his coat and hurried forth to his boarding place  when jerry reached the house he found little dottie on the stoop with tommy in her arms tommy was crying for something to eat and the little girl was having her hands full with him  where is miss nellie asked our hero in surprise  i dont know returned the girl she sent me out with tommy after dinner and when i tried to get in after a while the door was locked and she was gone  and you have been sitting here ever since  yes  come up ill open the door  jerry led the way and with a night key opened the door to the kitchen  a cry of surprise burst from his lips everywhere were the signs of a desperate struggle two of the chairs were overturned the tablecloth hung half off the table and nellie ardells sewing was strewn in all directions  this is slocums work  those were the words which arose to the youths lips as he surveyed the situation in the kitchen  alexander slocum had tried to get him out of the way and now he had tried the same plan upon nellie ardell  there had been a fierce struggle of that there was not the slightest doubt  but the girl had been overpowered in the end and taken off  to where  that was the all important question  while our hero was gazing around the room little tommy was crying at the top of his lungs  to quiet him jerry gave him his bowl of bread and milk and also gave dottie her supper  then jerry began a minute examination of the rooms  there was mud on the oilcloththe tracks of four boots  slocum and casey his bookkeeper he said to himself  going below he interviewed mrs flannigan a goodnatured irish woman who lived on the nest floor  did you see miss ardell this afternoon  sure an oi did not oi was out she replied  he next tried the janitress who lived in the basement she was a peppery old woman who seldom had a pleasant word for anybody  did i see her yes she went out with two men about two hours ago she said  what sort of looking men  i cant sayim not taking notice of everybody who comes and goes  but this is important mrs foley i am afraid something has happened to miss ardell  they were tall men and i guess both had big black mustaches and beards  where did she go with them  into a carriage all of em seemed to be in a big hurry  which way did the carriage go  down towards the brooklyn ferry  in a thoughtful mood the young oarsman walked back upstairs he met mrs flannigan outside of the door  whats wrong mr upton  that is what i am trying to find out miss ardell is missing if i go out will you look after the children  sure oi will bless the dears she said her heart was as large as her ruddy fullblown face  without waiting longer jerry ran down into the street and endeavored to trace the carriage down to the ferry in this he was successful and learned that the turnout containing two men and a young lady who appeared to be ill had crossed to brooklyn  by this time night had set in and all efforts to follow the carriage proved unsuccessful yet unwilling to give up jerry spent over two hours in brooklyn hunting in every direction for a clew  our hero had never been across the east river before and in hunting around it was but natural that he should get lost at the end of the search he found himself a good distance from the river in a neighborhood that looked anything but respectable  its time i got back thought the youth and started to make inquiries  youre a dozen blocks out of your way said a man go down that way three blocks and turn to your left  as jerry walked along a somewhat gloomy street he noticed three men walking ahead of him one was a tall finely built man wearing a large round hat of the western type  the other men were short fellows each with a red mustache they carried heavy canes and walked on either side of the tall individual  arent we almost there jerry heard the tall man ask as he drew closer to the trio  yes it aint but a step further was the reply from one of the short men  you are certain this crazy jim is the man i am after  oh yes  the mentioning of crazy jims name interested jerry crazy jim was still up on blackwells island it was possible however that they referred to some other individual  to hear what further they might have to say the young oarsman kept close to the party  its been a long hunt for me gentlemen said the tall man and by his speech jerry felt sure he was a westerner but if i am on the right trail things will soon come out right  what do you want to find crazy jim for asked one of the short men  im not saying any thing about that just now was the cool response  oh excuse me of course not the short fellow looked around but failed to catch sight of our hero jack how about a smoke he said to the other short fellow  strike a light was the answer  the words were evidently a secret signal for hardly were they spoken when one of the short men caught the westerner from behind and held his arms  here whats the meaning of this cried the man in alarm  keep still old man and we wont hurt you raise a row and youll get knocked out quick pete with his diamond pin and that roll of bills in his left pocket  at this command the man in front rushed in and caught hold of the mans pin out it came in his hand a beautiful affair worth at least a hundred dollars  stop stop yelled the westerner police police  shut up hissed the man who held him pete crack him over the head we cant afford to take any chances here  thus ordered the man who held the diamond pin slipped it into his pocket then he raised his heavy cane and started to do as bidden when jerry rushed at him  stop dont hit that man  the rascal was surprised  who are you oh its only a boy clear out of here  i wont you let that man alone  dont leave me pleaded the victim they want to rob me he has my diamond pin  shut up howled the man in the rear crack him pete and crack the boy too  once more the heavy cane was raised our hero caught it in the center and by a dexterous twist wrenched it from the rascals hand  with a howl of baffled rage the rascal turned and caught jerry by the throat  give me that stick boy or ill choke the life out of you he hissed into the youths ear     chapter xxxvi  jerry hears an astonishing statement   when the footpad for the fellow was nothing less attacked jerry our hero felt that he had a tough struggle before him  the rascals grasp on the young oarsmans throat was light however and jerry quickly shook it off  in the meantime the westerner began to struggle and shout at the top of his voice  help police police  in vain the fellow who held him tried to stop his cries they grew louder and soon footsteps were heard approaching  jerry received a savage blow on the chest and struck out in return hitting the footpad in the chin then the two clinched and both rolled to the pavement  jerrys assailant was a strong man and he was slowly but surely getting the best of the youth when three men put in an appearance they were heavyset individuals and were followed by a policeman  whats up here  dont kill that boy  he is a thief cried jerry he has that mans diamond pin  thats right put in the westerner who had managed to turn and catch hold of his assailant this fellow is his mate they just tackled me when the boy came to my help  it is a falsehood roared the footpad who had attacked our hero  saying this he arose and tried to sneak away but jerry tripped him up sending him headlong and before he could rise the policeman had him handcuffed  while this was going on the westerner and two of the new arrivals managed to make a prisoner of the other footpad he used some terrible language but this did not avail him  i know them said the policeman after the capture was effected they are hungry pete and jack the slick they are wanted for a burglary at sheepshead bay how did you happen to fall in with them  i met them up at rumfords hotel they said they knew a man i was looking for  will you come along and make a charge against them  certainly he has my diamond pin  the pin was brought to light and handed over to its owner and then our hero was asked to go along  anxious to know what the westerner might want of crazy jim jerry agreed and a minute later found the whole crowd bound for the nearest stationhouse  here the westerner gave his name as colonel albert dartwell he said he was from denver and had come east on private business  i have been sick for two months he said i am still weak that is the reason i did not put up a better fight when those two men tackled me  jerry told his story and the upshot of the matter was that the two footpads were held for another hearing before the judge in the morning  my boy i owe you something for your services to me said the westerner as he and our hero came out on the street you did well for a boy  i did the best i could replied the young oarsman but i want to ask you a question i heard you mention crazy jim what do you want to see him for  a look of pain crossed colonel dartwells face at my words  its a long story upton i am from the west and came many miles to see him do you know the man  i know one fellow called crazy jim sir  his right name is james machenry  thats the man  ah and where can he be found  most likely on blackwells island  he is in prison  yes  what for  for breaking the glass in a store window and creating a row  colonel dartwell drew a long breath  those footpads told me he was in a hotel in the neighborhood you are sure you are right  yes sir to be truthful i was mixed up in the scrape that took crazy jim to prison  indeed would you mind telling me about it you dont look like a boy that would do wrong  it wasnt my fault crazy jim had a packet belonging to mea packet containing some valuable documents i called for them and found he had given them up to an enemy of mine  and that led to the row  not exactly he is a bad man and there was a little girl living with him and he  as jerry spoke colonel dartwell grasped him by the arm  stop what did you say about a little girl he demanded eagerly  i said there was a little girl living with him he used to send her out to beg he got it into his head that she had set me against him and he started to beat her i told her to run away and then he attacked me and got arrested  and what became of the little girl tell me quickly and colonel dartwells voice was husky as he spoke  i met her afterward and took her to where i was boarding and she is still stopping there  describe her to me  seeing there was something behind the inquiry jerry gave him the best description he could the colonel listened with fixed attention  it must be her he murmured my poor lost dottie  dottie thats her name cried our hero and she is  she is my daughter was his answer  your daughter ejaculated jerry in amazement  yes my daughter take me to her at once  i will sir but this is the strangest thing i ever heard  i have no doubt of it  was she stolen from you  yes its a long story i will tell it to you while we are on the way she is well  yes sir but she has been misused so you mustnt expect to see her looking real good she is very thin  i have not seen her for four years not since she was a mite of a toddler  the pair started for the ferry without delay and as they proceeded the colonel related his story  he was a mineowner and had lived in the west for fifteen years his wife had died when dottie was born and the child had been turned over to the care of a colored nurse  at that time james machenry had been a prospector in the region and he had opened a mine close to that located by the colonel  all went well until the machenry mine petered out as it is called and then the mans mind became deranged he accused the colonel of having cheated him out of a slice of the richest land and a bitter quarrel resulted  two weeks later machenry disappeared and shortly after that baby dottie was missing a long search was made for the child but without avail  curiously enough the colonel did not connect the disappearance of his child with that of crazy jim he started to hunt for the little one among the indians and the outlaws in the mountains  two years passed and then one night a goodfornothing miner named duffy was shot in a quarrel over a game of cards on his dying bed duffy confessed that he had once been intimate with crazy jim and that the latter had acknowledged stealing dottie  a hunt was at once made for the abductor it was said he had gone to san francisco and later on he was traced to chicago but there the trail was lost until long after when a tramp turned up who spoke of having seen crazy jim around new york  without delay colonel dartwell had come east and scoured the metropolis while here he had fallen in with footpads who had sought to rob him     chapter xxxvii  a joyous meeting   by the time colonel dartwells story was told he and jerry had landed in the metropolis and a hurried walk of a few minutes brought them to nellie ardells apartment mrs flannigan was waiting for our hero having put both of the children to bed  an did ye find miss ardell she asked quickly  no mrs flannigan but i have found somebody elsethe father of little dottie  indade now an aint that noice she exclaimed glancing at colonel dartwells welldressed figure well the poor dear needs somebody not but what she got good care here she added hastily  tears stood in the colonels eyes as he stepped up beside the bed upon which dottie lay he took the whiterobed figure up in his arms and kissed her face  it is she he said in a choking voice the living picture of her dead mother  dottie awoke with a start and was inclined to cry out but jerry and the colonel quickly soothed her  i am your papa dottie dont you remember papa and big ruth that used to be with you  the little girl looked puzzled then she gave a cry  papa papa i know you i knew you would come to me oh papa dont go away again crazy jim said you were dead oh papa  and she clung to him convulsively it was such an affecting scene jerry had to turn away while mrs flannigan standing in the partly open doorway shed copious tears  an hour later the children had again retired and the colonel and the young oarsman sat in the little kitchen talking  and you say you think miss ardell was abducted he said  i felt sure of it sir this alexander slocum wants to get her out of the way on account of some property he is holding back from her i am interested in the same property  and jerry told him the particulars of affairs so far as they concerned slocum  if the land in question is near sacramento it ought to be of great value said the colonel property in that section is booming  i want to find nellie ardell sir i am afraid he will do her bodily harm he might even kill her to get her out of the way  i will help you all i can upton you have done me a great service and i certainly owe the young lady much for taking my child in and caring for her  our hero and the colonel went over the matter carefully for fully an hour and decided to start on a hunt as soon as it grew light the colonel offered to employ a detective and this offer jerry readily accepted  jerry passed several hours trying to sleep and at the first sign of dawn was up and dressed the colonel had rested in an armchair not caring to separate himself from his child by going to a hotel  mrs flannigan was again called upon and readily agreed to take charge of tommy and dottie once more she took them to her own rooms and was cautioned about letting strangers in  dont fear theyll not take em from me she said and in such a determined way that jerry was compelled to laugh  the call at a detectives office was soon over and it was not as satisfactory as our hero had anticipated  you mustnt expect too much laughed the colonel in spite of the thrilling detective stories published detectives are only ordinary men and cannot do the impossible mr gray will no doubt go to work in his own way and do the best he can  their next movement was to cross to brooklyn here the pair started on the hunt for the carriage that had carried nellie ardell off  an hour was spent in a fruitless search they were about to give it up when they saw a carriage coming down to the ferry that was covered with dust and mud  that looks as if it had been out in the country a good distance observed colonel dartwell ill stop the driver and see what he has to say it can do no harm  walking up in front of the team he motioned for the driver to halt  want a carriage boss  no i want to know where you have been demanded the westerner  at this question the driver seemed plainly disconcerted he looked around and seeing a clear space to his left whipped up his animals and sped off  hes our man cried the colonel come on he must not escape us  he set off with all speed and jerry followed the driver drove as far as the first corner and then had to halt because of a blockade in the street  come down here commanded colonel dartwell  i aint done nothin growled the fellow you let me alone  i asked you where you had been  up to the park  who did you have for a fare  an old man  thats not trueyou had two men and a girl  the carriage driver muttered something under his breath  iiwho said i had the men and a girl he asked surlily  i say so where did you take the young lady  at first the driver beat about the bush but the colonel threatened him with arrest and this brought him around  dont arrest me boss i wasnt in the game the men hired me to take em outthat was all they said the girl was lightheaded and the place was a private asylum  probably rejoined colonel dartwell sarcastically take us to that place without delay but stopdrive to police headquarters first  very unwillingly the fellow complied at the headquarters help was procured in the shape of two ward detectives all four of the party entered the carriage and were driven off to effect nellie ardells rescue  it was with deep interest that jerry accompanied colonel dartwell and the officers of the law in the search for the missing young lady  on through the crowded streets of brooklyn drove the carriage the driver now apparently as willing to help the law as he had before wished to evade it  the carriage was turning into one of the fine thoroughfares when jerry caught sight of a figure which instantly arrested his attention the figure was that of mr wakefield smith  stop cried the young oarsman to the driver of the carriage  whats up demanded the colonel  do you see that man over there by the paper stand  yes  that is wakefield smith the pickpocket  indeed he ought to be arrested  you know him to be a pickpocket questioned one of the detectives  i do he robbed me of over twenty dollars i got back ten dollars hes a very smooth and slick worker  i think i know that chap returned the detective dont he look like charley the dude he asked of his companion  by jove thats our man ejaculated the second detective i would know him anywhere by that peculiar walk he has grown a heavy mustache since i saw him last  will you stop and arrest him asked jerry he ought to be locked up we can get the policeman on the beat to attend to him there is an officer on the next corner just call him harrity  the carriage was brought up to the curb and our hero and the officers alighted the colonel remaining behind to keep an eye on the driver  mr wakefield smith was strolling down the street in a lordly way when jerry tapped him on the shoulder  so ive met you again he said  the pickpocket turned and his face fell but only for a moment then he gazed at the youth brazenly  i dont know you me boy he drawled in an assumed voice  but i know you mr smith rejoined jerry i want the balance of my money i got ten dollars the night you were intoxicated but that is not enough  boy you are talking riddles i never saw you before  i can easily prove it i fancy  its no use charley broke in the detective who had followed me we know you well enough  and who are you asked the pickpocket much disconcerted  i am a detective you are the rogue known as charley the dude you may consider yourself under arrest  this is an outrage  hardly  by this time the second detective had arrived with a policeman at sight of the bluecoat the pickpocket became nervous turning he suddenly started to run  but the others ran for him and soon he was handcuffed explanations to the policeman followed and the officer took him off and jerry and the detectives continued on their way  it may be well to state here that the pickpocket whose real name was charles heulig was later on convicted of several crimes and sent to state prison for a term of years jerry never received a cent of the balance of the money due but other events that followed made this loss seem a trivial one     chapter xxxviii  alexander slocum is brought to book   in half an hour after the arrest of the pickpocket the young oarsman and his companions found themselves on the outskirts of brooklyn and bowling along a smooth country road which the detectives said they knew well  on and on they went until colonel dartwell asked the driver how much further they had to go  about half a mile sir was the answer  his words proved correct turning into a side road the carriage came to the entrance to a large grounds surrounded by a high board fence  over the gateway was the sign                      dr halcones private sanitarium  a private lunatic asylum murmured colonel dartwell  yes sir said the driver you know i told you they said the young lady was a bit off  what shall we do was the question put by the westerner to the detectives shall we go in boldly and order them to produce the girl  will they do it asked jerry they may be in slocums pay and hide her away  the young man is right said one of the detectives well drive on a way and then sneak back and size the place up  this was done and five minutes later found the colonel and our hero walking along a hedge which separated the grounds on one side from a woods  look there jerry cried suddenly and pointed to an upper window of the brick building beyond  he had seen nellie ardells face as the young lady walked about the apartment as the others gazed upward alexander slocum appeared he held a sheet of paper and a pen in his hands  he wants her to sign something cried our hero in a low voice see see he is going to force her  leave me be mr slocum those below heard nellie ardell exclaim i will not sign off my interest in that property leave me be oh that somebody was at hand to help me  come onthere is no time to waste cried colonel dartwell and pushed through the hedge  jerry followed and both ran for a side door of the building which stood open  here they found themselves confronted by a burly man of advanced age evidently the proprietor of the sanitarium  here what do you want here he demanded roughly  we want that young lady upstairs cried jerry  you cant have her  well see about that put in colonel dartwell you have no authority to detain her here  she is insane and  help help came from upstairs and rushing past the burly doctor jerry skipped up the stairs three steps at a time  the colonel came behind the doctor was about to remonstrate when he found himself confronted by the two detectives  our hero and the colonel soon found the proper door it was locked but putting his shoulder to it the young oarsman soon burst it open  alexander slocum stood at the table in the center of the room he had nellie ardell by the wrist and was endeavoring to force her to sign the paper before them  leave her alone you villain cried jerry and dragged him backward  jerry upton exclaimed the young woman and her tone was full of joy oh how thankful i am that you have come  whatwhat is the meaning of this asked slocum turning deadly pale  it means that you have been found out alexander slocum replied our hero we have learned  darnley the boomer burst out colonel dartwell at this point so this is where you drifted to after the swindle at silver run  do you know him queried jerry  only too well he was in colorado for several years under the name of chester darnley he is a boomer and allaround swindler  its aa falsehood burst from alexander slocums lips but his voice trembled as he spoke  i can prove all i say said the colonel there are witnesses enough against you at silver run  slocum was all but overcome he sank in a chair and a moment later one of the detectives came up and slipped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists  the proprietor of the socalled sanitarium was also arrested and both prisoners were driven down to the brooklyn police station a hearing was had and the prisoners were held for trial  from brooklyn the colonel nellie and jerry returned to new york nellie left the party to go home and jerry and the colonel continued on to slocums office with an officer  the bookkeeper casey was found and arrested and the office was placed in care of the authorities the next day jerry recovered his fathers papers and also those belonging to nellie ardell  the young oarsman lost no time in sending word home how matters had turned stating that the claim was probably worth a good deal of money he added that if his father was not well enough to come to the metropolis colonel dartwell stood ready to take entire charge of the case and see that they got their rights  an answer soon came back written by mrs upton mr upton was well enough to sit up but that was all and he would be glad enough to do as his son had suggested so the necessary papers were made out and a suit instituted against alexander slocum  in the meantime mr islen sold out his bindery and by this turn of affairs our hero found himself out of employment but he had had enough of the great metropolis for the present and was glad enough to go back to lakeview while awaiting the time when slocum should be brought to trial  the news of what he had accomplished had leaked out and when he arrived he found harry and blumpo awaiting him at the depot  youre a clever one jerry cried harry shaking his hand warmly to run off on the quiet and come back with a fortune for your family  we havent got the fortune yet laughed the young oarsman but we hope to have it before long  i always said jerry was de greatest boy dat eber was born ejaculated blumpo with his face on a broad grin  how is your father blumpo asked jerry to change the subject  hes very well again  you must tell us your whole story went on harry i am dying to hear it  i willbut i must get home first answered the young oarsman  he was soon on his way to the farm where his parents received him with open arms a splendid dinner was awaiting himsuch a repast as he had not had since leavingbut none of the food was touched until his tale was told from end to end with all of its details as they have been presented to my readers  you did well son was mr uptons comment i dont believe anybody could have done better  mrs upton smiled fondly and put her arms about the boy  hes our jerry father was all she said but the simple words meant a good deal  his own story told and the dinner finished jerry wanted to know the news around lakeview but his parents had little to tell  i have not been out since your father was taken down said mrs upton youll have to asked harry parker and your other friends  have si peters and wash crosby been caught yet  no and i doubt if they ever do catch them responded mrs upton     chapter xxxix  harry to the rescue   early on the following morning harry came over to take jerry for a sail on the lake in the whistler  we can sail and talk at the same time he explained i know you must be longing for a whiff of the water  you are right there harry returned the young oarsman lake otasco is better than the hot pavements of new york city a hundred times over  the two boys soon set off harry had expected blumpo to accompany them but that youth was out in his own boat with a party that had hired the craft for several days  blumpo is making money said harry and i am glad of it  so am i replied our hero he is an odd sort of chap but his heart is of gold  the whistler was soon on her way up the lake with old jack broxton at the tiller and as the breeze was steady the boys had little to do but talk once again our hero related his story and harry proved a most attentive listener  that alexander slocum ought to go to prison for life he said at the conclusion the idea of daring to make out that nellie ardell was insane  it was a bold scheme harry  it seems to me the world is full of bad people jerry look at such men as that slocum and his tools and then at such boys as si peters and wash crosby  where do you suppose crosby and peters are  the authorities dont know but blumpo told me a few days ago he was almost certain he had seen them on the north shore of the lake he said they took to their heels in the bushes just about the time he spotted them  they are bound to be brought to justice sooner or later  i dont know but i do know one thing i would like to get back my gold watch  thus the talk ran on until hermit island was reached here they run in for a few minutes to pass a word with blumpos father who greeted them cordially after this they continued up along the south side of the lake  as they skirted the beautiful shore they gradually crept up to a large excursion boat hullo whats that boat doing here cried jerry  its a sundayschool excursion from cedar falls replied his chum  the steamboat was not a large one and she seemed to have more than her regular allowance of passengers aboard every deck was full of grown folks and children dressed in their best  a band was playing a merry air and some of the children were singing  lets give them a cheer suggested the young oarsman as they drew closer  all right replied harry pulling out his handkerchief one two three hurrah hur  harry stopped short as a cry of horror arose on board of the excursion boat  a young girl had been standing close to the rail on a camp stool at the bow of the boat  as the steamboat swung around the girl lost her balance  she tried to save herself and failing pitched headlong into the water  harry saw her go under the greenish waves  shell be struck by the paddle wheel he yelled and then splash he was overboard himself  bravely he struck out to save the maiden  the order was given to back the steamboat  the wheels churned up the water into a white foam but still the momentum carried the large craft on in the meantime harry came up and struck out valiantly for the girl who was now going down for a second time  save her save her shrieked the mother of the girl in an agony of fear  half a dozen life preservers were thrown overboard but none came to where the girl could reach them  the mother of the girl wanted to join her daughter in the water but strong hands held her back  the young fellow will save her madam  hes a true hero  life lines were thrown over but even these did no good  the steamboat swung around but the run of the water washed the girl closer and closer to the paddle wheel  she now came up a second time should she sink again all would be over  harry was swimming with all the strength and skill at his command  at last he was within a yard of the struggling girl  the maiden threw up her hands and went under  as quick as a flash harry dove down  a second passed then up came the youth with the girl clinging to his shoulder  but now the current was apparently too strong for both of them  they were hurled up against the paddle wheel of the steamboat and then disappeared entirely from view  jack broxton gave a groan  harry is lost  jerry shuddered  it looks like it he replied  the captain of the steamboat did not dare to move his craft for fear he would do more harm than good  the mother of the girl continued to struggle to free herself  but now a cry was heard it came from the stern of the steamboat  there they are  the girl is safe and so is that brave young man  jerry and jack broxton heard the cry and immediately put about in their yacht  harry was swimming along on his side the girl was too weak to support herself and he was holding her up well out of the water  it took the whistler but a moment to run up alongside of the pair jerry reached over and caught hold of the girl and placed her on deck  in the meantime harry secured a rope thrown by jack broxton and pulled himself up  a cheer arose from those on the excursion boat  she is safe now sure  the girl was too exhausted to move and both boys rubbed her hands and did what they could for her  jack broxton ran up alongside of the steamboat and a little later the girl was placed on board  the mother clasped her child to her breast  go ahead jack said harry in a low voice i dont want the crowd to stare at me  but the mother wants to thank you began jerry  but harry would not listen he was too modest and made jack broxton actually run away from the excursion boat  but five hundred people cheered harry and waved their handkerchiefs  how did you escape the steamboat asked jerry when the excitement was over  we went under part of her was the reply i swam for all i knew how but it was a close call  after this harry retired to the cabin and changed his clothing he drank several cups of hot coffee and half an hour later declared that he felt as well as ever  the remainder of the run down the lake was uneventful they dropped anchor near the mouth of the poplar river and started in to fish  they had all the necessary tackle on board and procured bait at a boathouse near by  the yacht was anchored at a wellknown spot and then the sport began  ive a bite cried harry  and sure enough he had something he began to reel in with great rapidity  first fish said jerry  scarcely had harry landed his haul than click click click went jerrys reel the line went off like a flash  jerry began to reel in that something big was on his hook was certain  the fish darted in every direction and jerry had his hands full playing him  youll lose him cried harry excitedly  ill do my best with him responded jerry quietly  after playing the fish for nearly five minutes he reeled him in rapidly  get the landing net jack he said and the old tar stood ready the moment the fish came into view  a bass a threepounder cried harry by jinks but thats a haul worth making  it was indeed a beautiful catch and jerry was justly proud of it  after this nothing was caught for twenty minutes then harry landed a fine fat perch weighing a pound jack was not fishing but smoked and looked on contentedly  evening found them with a fine mess of bass and perch  not a bad haul said jerry as he surveyed the lot  i reckon its about time to be gitting back observed jack broxton we want ter make lakeview afore dark  so the anchor was hoisted and away they went before a nineknot breeze  the return was made along the north shore here there were numerous little islands separated from the mainland by a series of channels some shallow and others deep enough to admit of the passage of a goodsized yacht  the whistler was just passing one of these channels and jerry and harry were at the side cleaning their fish when suddenly old jack broxton uttered a cry  what is it jack asked the young oarsman quickly while harry also raised up  theres a boat over yonder back of that island and im certain i saw si peters and wash crosby on board was the old boatmans interesting answer     chapter xl  a struggle in the dark   you are sure demanded jerry and harry in a breath  yes the boat had the name redeye painted on the stern if i remember rightly she belongs to a tough crowd of fishermen from long lake  where is she now demanded harry  back there somewhere  we must follow that boat eh jerry  i am willing replied the young oarsman  you may have lively times with that crowd put in jack broxton with a grave shake of his head  well risk it answered harry he was thinking of his missing gold watch  the course of the whistler was changed and soon they rounded the shore of the island jack broxton had pointed out  sure enough there was the redeye with all sails set making up the lake  near the stern stood si peters wash crosby and several rascally looking men  they have discovered that we are after them cried jerry a few minutes later see they are crowding on all sail  the young oarsman was right leaving the vicinity of the islands the other craft stood out boldly into the lake and cut the water like a knife  shes a good one observed jack broxton  the whistler already had all sails out and thus the craft went on neither gaining nor losing for half an hour  then darkness settled over the lake and the wind fell flat  weve lost them now said harry dismally  its a good thing the wind has fallen replied jerry  how so  as soon as it is dark enough we can take the rowboat and follow in that  thats an idea  soon night had settled over lake otasco then our hero and harry lost no time in entering the tender of the whistler  make as little noise as possible cautioned jerry  he was in the bow peering ahead while harry was at the oars  so they went on a distance of a quarter of a mile  see anything whispered harry  not yet pull in a little closer to shore i have an idea peters and crosby may land somewhere around here  like as not that is their game  on they went the darkness growing more intense as they proceeded there was no moon and the stars shone but faintly in the blue vault overhead  suddenly jerry held up his hand as a sign to harry to stop rowing instantly his chum raised the oars  what do you see he whispered  something aheadi cant make out just what yet  several minutes of breathless silence followed then jerry bent back  the redeye is just ahead but i believe si peters and wash crosby have already left her  a second later a low but clear cry rang out  you left that bundle behind crosby  never mind i dont want the old suit was the reply coming from some distance in toward shore  that settles it whispered jerry crosby and peters are in a rowboat pulling for shore beyond a doubt  thats all right replied harry i would rather tackle them than all those on the redeye  so would i  the rowboat was headed for the west  how far off the shore was they did not know  they had located the voice of crosby and now steered in the direction  jerry at the bow continued to keep his ears on the alert  a little to the right now he said thats it if you dont make too much noise well surprise them completely  i think the best thing we can do is to follow them after they land until they reach some place where we can have them locked up jerry  that is certainly a good plan it will save us the trouble of dragging them off to jail if we are fortunate enough to capture them  harrys plan was accepted and on they went  look cried jerry presently and pointed down the shore  i dont see anything jerry  dont you see the lights coming toward us  harry strained his eyes  i see them now  its a steamer coming this way  my gracious well have to get out of the way or well be run down  she is close in shore went on jerry i believe shell pass between the other rowboat and ours  let us hold up a minute and see what she intends to do said harry  he rested on his oars soon the craft came closer it was the excursion boat on her return  she is not coming near us said jerry pull on  harry had just taken to the oars again when a wild cry rang out it came from the rowboat which held peters and crosby  stop dont run us down  the steamboat is onto them ejaculated jerry  scarcely had he spoken when there came another cry followed by a crash  theyve been struck yelled harry  pull ahead cried jerry like as not they have either been killed or are drowning  he sprang to harrys side and with an oar each they sped on to the assistance of the unfortunate ones  in the meanwhile the steamboat stopped  whats the trouble called a voice  no answer was vouchsafed and a moment later the steamboat went on  like as not si peters and wash crosby are dead observed harry as he bent to his oar  well soon know the truth replied the young oarsman  both boys pulled a swift stroke and were soon on the spot where the catastrophe had occurred  in the meanwhile the steamboat was fast disappearing in the distance soon the last light faded from sight  in the darkness of the night jerry and harry could see but little  there is an oar cried harry pointing it out  and there is part of the rowboats bottom said jerry it looks as if the rowboat was actually ground to pieces  then it isnt likely that si peters and wash crosby escaped  well well take a good look around  the two continued to row about but for a long while saw nothing but bits of wreckage  then our hero beheld a form floating just to their right  take both oars harry he said and be careful for that is wash crosbys body  harry took the oars and began to row slowly  as he moved on jerry stood in the bow  at that instant a strange thing happened si peters came up under the boat giving it such a shove that jerry was hurled overboard  then with a swiftness that was really surprising si peters clambered into the rowboat  in his hand he held part of a broken oar  jump out after jerry upton he growled as he advanced upon harry  without replying harry leaped up to defend himself as he did this he saw that jerry and wash crosby were fighting in the water  neither crosby nor peters had been hurt by the collision both having left their craft before the steamboat struck it  their one thought now was to get the good rowboat away from our two heroes  jerry thinking wash crosby seriously hurt was taken completely by surprise  crosby caught him by the shoulder and forced him far under the water and then did his best to hold him there  crosby was a powerful fellow and he well understood what defeat and capture meanta term in prison  but as we know jerrys muscles were like iron and his first surprise over he went for crosby tooth and nail  with a powerful twist he freed himself from the rascals grasp and swam some distance away  then coming up behind crosby the young oarsman let out with his right fist  the blow took the rockpoint bully behind the ear and crosby let out a wild yell of pain broken by a gasp for air as he went under the bosom of the ocean  as he went down our hero gave him an extra shove and then swam with all speed for the rowboat which had drifted several yards away  he saw harry and si peters standing up in the boat peters had just struck at his chum and harry had partly dodged the vicious blow  but the broken oar landed on harrys arm causing him to cry out from pain  drop that si peters  the command coming so unexpectedly startled peters he turned to find jerry at the gunwale directly behind him  oh jerry help cried harry  si peters gave a low yell of rage  again harry sprang away and now armed himself with an oar  you cant frighten me you fool shouted peters dont you dare to put your hand on the boat  and as jerry grasped the gunwale peters raised his heavy foot as if to crush our heros fingers  but jerry was too quick for him  he dropped off then whizz something dark flew through the air  it was part of the broken oar thrown by jerry and it took si peters in the neck  whack him one harry while you have the chance  harry needed no advice on the subject he sprang in and a second later a resounding crack laid si peters flat on his back  that was a good one cried jerry as he clambered over the side now bind him before he comes to  havent a blessed thing replied harry  here is some cord tie his hands together  while harry was doing this jerry began to look around for wash crosby  this way we are in trouble yelled crosby  pshaw exclaimed jerry hell have that yacht down on us in another minute  but for once the young oarsman was mistaken the men on the redeye had no desire after befriending si peters and wash crosby to fall into the hands of the law and instead of coming up they allowed their craft to float off in an opposite direction  there is crosby shouted jerry a moment later as he beheld the youth floundering around in the water and look here comes the whistler  he was right a slight breeze had sprung up and jack broxton had nursed the yacht along with all of the skill at his command  the coming of the old sailor ended the battle so far as the bad boys from rockpoint were concerned both si peters and wash crosby were hauled on board and here they were tightly bound to prevent their making further trouble  it was after midnight when lakeview was reached and the prisoners were handed over to the local police then harry and jerry separated to go home and tell of their fresh adventures  the following morning si peters and wash crosby were taken to rockpoint and an examination was held the bad boys confessed robbing the hotel and the larger part of the money taken was recovered as was also harrys gold watch which si peters had been bold enough to wear some time later the evildoers were tried and sent to jail and that was the last our heroes heard of them     chapter xli  a last racegoodbye to the rival oarsmen   hurrah here they come  its going to be a dandy race harry  indeed it is dick  there comes hosmer  here comes pinkney  whats the matter with villelet  hes all right  the conversation took place on the bank of the hudson river not far from poughkeepsie  it was the day of the great intercollegiate boat races  the singleshell race had just been ordered  among the number to compete in this race was jerry upton  our hero was rich nowthat is his folks were which amounted to the same thing  on trial it had been proven what a villain alexander slocum was all of his masquerading in the west under the name of darnley was exposed as well as his fraudulent land schemes in the east the realestate manipulator was sent to prison for a term of years and the property in california was divided up between jerrys father nellie ardell and several others who held an interest in it  the land was found to be within the city limits of sacramento and the upton share was computed to be worth fortyfive thousand dollars  mr upton was offered forty thousand dollars for it but by the advice of colonel dartwell who became his intimate friend he concluded to keep it  the investment is bringing in good interest he said and as it was jerry who did the work in getting it the lad shall have it just as it stands when i and my wife die  immediately after these matters were settled up jerry began to study for college and harry did also and both made the entrance examination with ease  jerry was a fine scholar and he was also one of the best oarsmen in his class harry likewise rowed a good deal although not near as much as formerly  it was a perfect day and the river was filled with pleasure boats loaded down to the rails with sightseers the banks of the stream were likewise lined with the crowds which had poured in to see the various college oarsmen compete for the supremacy in aquatic sports  in the crowd on short was our old friend blumpo brown blumpo was now in business at lakeview letting out pleasure boats of which he owned several and he was unusually prosperous just at present he was wearing the colors of jerrys college and whooping her up for our hero whenever the chance presented itself  at the given signal the single shells took their places at the starting point  the participants were the pick of the singleshell men and jerry realized that he would have a struggle to win  a puff of smoke the report of a gun and they were off  a fine start  hosmer leads  he will lead to the finish  pinkney is a close second  jerry upton is third  my but they are cutting the water  two to one that hosmer wins  three to one that the record is broken  foah to one dat jerry upton wins dis race cried blumpo brown waving a big college flag over his head dat boy dont know what it is to lose  hear that chap talk  pitch him overboard to cool him off  dats all right its jerry uptons muscle dats talkin not me growled blumpo  down the straight course came the singleshell oarsmen each back bending to a long and powerful stroke  the quarter stretch was past with hosmer still in the lead  behind him came pinkney and jerry side by side  then came the half stretch the leaders still held the same positions  told you hosmer would win  jerry upton is falling behind  it was true pinkney had increased his stroke and was crawling up slowly but surely to the leader  pull jerry pull yelled harry  you dun got to win dat race suah screamed blumpo  jerry heard them but paid no heed he was rowing the race of the yearthe race that would make his college chums shout with joy or look glum for the balance of the season  and now the threequarter mark was past a quarter of a mile more and the race would be over  see pinkney is drawing up to hosmer  pinkney leads hosmer has dropped away behind  pinkney first and jerry upton second  villelet is crawling up  he has passed pinkney  and so the shouting went on the end of the course was in sight how the oarsmen were pulling but now look at jerry  how like a flash his back bends how powerful is that broad stroke how quick his recovery  in vain pinkney tried to hold his lead jerry means to win and nothing can hold him back  he fairly flies past pinkney and comes in a winner by a length and a half his friends go wild  hurrah for jerry upton shouts harry  and the cheers echo and reecho along the water and back to the distant hills  blumpo dances a breakdown for joy  i told you he could do it he cries da cant beat our jerry nohow  thats right they cant adds harry hurrah hurrah hurrah  jerry leaves his shell and is hoisted up upon the shoulders of his friends and marched around the town  that night he is given a big reception by his fellow students it is the happiest moment of his life  and here we will leave him and harry and blumpo and all of the rest shouting as do our heros many friends  hurrah for the young oarsman of lakeview  the end    famous books for boys  these are new and superior editions of these famous
