amanuensis mrs strong at intervals between january 1893 and october 1894 see vailima letters pp 242–246 299 324 and 350  about six weeks before his death he laid the story aside to take up weir of hermiston  the thirty chapters of st ives which he had written the last few of them apparently unrevised brought the tale within sight of its conclusion and the intended course of the remainder was known in outline to mrs strong  for the benefit of those readers who do not like a story to be left unfinished the delicate task of supplying the missing chapters has been entrusted to mr quillercouch whose work begins at chap xxxi 0                                                                   s c     chapter i—a tale of a lion rampant   it was in the month of may 1813 that i was so unlucky as to fall at last into the hands of the enemy  my knowledge of the english language had marked me out for a certain employment  though i cannot conceive a soldier refusing to incur the risk yet to be hanged for a spy is a disgusting business and i was relieved to be held a prisoner of war into the castle of edinburgh standing in the midst of that city on the summit of an extraordinary rock i was cast with several hundred fellowsufferers all privates like myself and the more part of them by an accident very ignorant plain fellows  my english which had brought me into that scrape now helped me very materially to bear it  i had a thousand advantages  i was often called to play the part of an interpreter whether of orders or complaints and thus brought in relations sometimes of mirth sometimes almost of friendship with the officers in charge  a young lieutenant singled me out to be his adversary at chess a game in which i was extremely proficient and would reward me for my gambits with excellent cigars  the major of the battalion took lessons of french from me while at breakfast and was sometimes so obliging as to have me join him at the meal  chevenix was his name  he was stiff as a drummajor and selfish as an englishman but a fairly conscientious pupil and a fairly upright man  little did i suppose that his ramrod body and frozen face would in the end step in between me and all my dearest wishes that upon this precise regular icy soldierman my fortunes should so nearly shipwreck  i never liked but yet i trusted him and though it may seem but a trifle i found his snuffbox with the bean in it come very welcome  for it is strange how grown men and seasoned soldiers can go back in life so that after but a little while in prison which is after all the next thing to being in the nursery they grow absorbed in the most pitiful childish interests and a sugar biscuit or a pinch of snuff become things to follow after and scheme for  we made but a poor show of prisoners  the officers had been all offered their parole and had taken it  they lived mostly in suburbs of the city lodging with modest families and enjoyed their freedom and supported the almost continual evil tidings of the emperor as best they might  it chanced i was the only gentleman among the privates who remained  a great part were ignorant italians of a regiment that had suffered heavily in catalonia  the rest were mere diggers of the soil treaders of grapes or hewers of wood who had been suddenly and violently preferred to the glorious state of soldiers  we had but the one interest in common each of us who had any skill with his fingers passed the hours of his captivity in the making of little toys and articles of paris and the prison was daily visited at certain hours by a concourse of people of the country come to exult over our distress or—it is more tolerant to suppose—their own vicarious triumph  some moved among us with a decency of shame or sympathy  others were the most offensive personages in the world gaped at us as if we had been baboons sought to evangelise us to their rustic northern religion as though we had been savages or tortured us with intelligence of disasters to the arms of france  good bad and indifferent there was one alleviation to the annoyance of these visitors for it was the practice of almost all to purchase some specimen of our rude handiwork  this led amongst the prisoners to a strong spirit of competition  some were neat of hand and the genius of the french being always distinguished could place upon sale little miracles of dexterity and taste  some had a more engaging appearance fine features were found to do as well as fine merchandise and an air of youth in particular as it appealed to the sentiment of pity in our visitors to be a source of profit  others again enjoyed some acquaintance with the language and were able to recommend the more agreeably to purchasers such trifles as they had to sell  to the first of these advantages i could lay no claim for my fingers were all thumbs  some at least of the others i possessed and finding much entertainment in our commerce i did not suffer my advantages to rust  i have never despised the social arts in which it is a national boast that every frenchman should excel  for the approach of particular sorts of visitors i had a particular manner of address and even of appearance which i could readily assume and change on the occasion rising  i never lost an opportunity to flatter either the person of my visitor if it should be a lady or if it should be a man the greatness of his country in war  and in case my compliments should miss their aim i was always ready to cover my retreat with some agreeable pleasantry which would often earn me the name of an ‘oddity’ or a ‘droll fellow’  in this way although i was so lefthanded a toymaker i made out to be rather a successful merchant and found means to procure many little delicacies and alleviations such as children or prisoners desire  i am scarcely drawing the portrait of a very melancholy man  it is not indeed my character and i had in a comparison with my comrades many reasons for content  in the first place i had no family i was an orphan and a bachelor neither wife nor child awaited me in france  in the second i had never wholly forgot the emotions with which i first found myself a prisoner and although a military prison be not altogether a garden of delights it is still preferable to a gallows  in the third i am almost ashamed to say it but i found a certain pleasure in our place of residence being an obsolete and really mediaeval fortress high placed and commanding extraordinary prospects not only over sea mountain and champaign but actually over the thoroughfares of a capital city which we could see blackened by day with the moving crowd of the inhabitants and at night shining with lamps  and lastly although i was not insensible to the restraints of prison or the scantiness of our rations i remembered i had sometimes eaten quite as ill in spain and had to mount guard and march perhaps a dozen leagues into the bargain the first of my troubles indeed was the costume we were obliged to wear  there is a horrible practice in england to trick out in ridiculous uniforms and as it were to brand in mass not only convicts but military prisoners and even the children in charity schools  i think some malignant genius had found his masterpiece of irony in the dress which we were condemned to wear jacket waistcoat and trousers of a sulphur or mustard yellow and a shirt or blueandwhite striped cotton  it was conspicuous it was cheap it pointed us out to laughter—we who were old soldiers used to arms and some of us showing noble scars—like a set of lugubrious zanies at a fair  the old name of that rock on which our prison stood was i have heard since then the painted hill  well now it was all painted a bright yellow with our costumes and the dress of the soldiers who guarded us being of course the essential british red rag we made up together the elements of a lively picture of hell  i have again and again looked round upon my fellowprisoners and felt my anger rise and choked upon tears to behold them thus parodied  the more part as i have said were peasants somewhat bettered perhaps by the drillsergeant but for all that ungainly loutish fellows with no more than a mere barrackroom smartness of address indeed you could have seen our army nowhere more discreditably represented than in this castle of edinburgh  and i used to see myself in fancy and blush  it seemed that my more elegant carriage would but point the insult of the travesty  and i remembered the days when i wore the coarse but honourable coat of a soldier and remembered further back how many of the noble the fair and the gracious had taken a delight to tend my childhood     but i must not recall these tender and sorrowful memories twice their place is further on and i am now upon another business  the perfidy of the britannic government stood nowhere more openly confessed than in one particular of our discipline that we were shaved twice in the week  to a man who has loved all his life to be fresh shaven can a more irritating indignity be devised  monday and thursday were the days  take the thursday and conceive the picture i must present by sunday evening  and saturday which was almost as bad was the great day for visitors  those who came to our market were of all qualities men and women the lean and the stout the plain and the fairly pretty  sure if people at all understood the power of beauty there would be no prayers addressed except to venus and the mere privilege of beholding a comely woman is worth paying for  our visitors upon the whole were not much to boast of and yet sitting in a corner and very much ashamed of myself and my absurd appearance i have again and again tasted the finest the rarest and the most ethereal pleasures in a glance of an eye that i should never see again—and never wanted to  the flower of the hedgerow and the star in heaven satisfy and delight us how much more the look of that exquisite being who was created to bear and rear to madden and rejoice mankind  there was one young lady in particular about eighteen or nineteen tall of a gallant carriage and with a profusion of hair in which the sun found threads of gold  as soon as she came in the courtyard and she was a rather frequent visitor it seemed i was aware of it  she had an air of angelic candour yet of a high spirit she stepped like a diana every movement was noble and free  one day there was a strong east wind the banner was straining at the flagstaff below us the smoke of the city chimneys blew hither and thither in a thousand crazy variations and away out on the forth we could see the ships lying down to it and scudding  i was thinking what a vile day it was when she appeared  her hair blew in the wind with changes of colour her garments moulded her with the accuracy of sculpture the ends of her shawl fluttered about her ear and were caught in again with an inimitable deftness  you have seen a pool on a gusty day how it suddenly sparkles and flashes like a thing alive so this lady’s face had become animated and coloured and as i saw her standing somewhat inclined her lips parted a divine trouble in her eyes i could have clapped my hands in applause and was ready to acclaim her a genuine daughter of the winds  what put it in my head i know not perhaps because it was a thursday and i was new from the razor but i determined to engage her attention no later than that day  she was approaching that part of the court in which i sat with my merchandise when i observed her handkerchief to escape from her hands and fall to the ground the next moment the wind had taken it up and carried it within my reach  i was on foot at once i had forgot my mustardcoloured clothes i had forgot the private soldier and his salute  bowing deeply i offered her the slip of cambric  ‘madam’ said i ‘your handkerchief  the wind brought it me’  i met her eyes fully  ‘i thank you sir’ said she  ‘the wind brought it me’ i repeated  ‘may i not take it for an omen you have an english proverb “it’s an ill wind that blows nobody good”’  ‘well’ she said with a smile ‘“one good turn deserves another”  i will see what you have’  she followed me to where my wares were spread out under lee of a piece of cannon  ‘alas mademoiselle’ said i ‘i am no very perfect craftsman  this is supposed to be a house and you see the chimneys are awry  you may call this a box if you are very indulgent but see where my tool slipped yes i am afraid you may go from one to another and find a flaw in everything  failures for sale should be on my signboard  i do not keep a shop i keep a humorous museum’  i cast a smiling glance about my display and then at her and instantly became grave  ‘strange is it not’ i added ‘that a grown man and a soldier should be engaged upon such trash and a sad heart produce anything so funny to look at’  an unpleasant voice summoned her at this moment by the name of flora and she made a hasty purchase and rejoined her party  a few days after she came again  but i must first tell you how she came to be so frequent  her aunt was one of those terrible british old maids of which the world has heard much and having nothing whatever to do and a word or two of french she had taken what she called an interest in the french prisoners  a big bustling bold old lady she flounced about our marketplace with insufferable airs of patronage and condescension  she bought indeed with liberality but her manner of studying us through a quizzingglass and playing cicerone to her followers acquitted us of any gratitude  she had a tail behind her of heavy obsequious old gentlemen or dull giggling misses to whom she appeared to be an oracle  ‘this one can really carve prettily is he not a quiz with his big whiskers’ she would say  ‘and this one’ indicating myself with her gold eyeglass ‘is i assure you quite an oddity’  the oddity you may be certain ground his teeth  she had a way of standing in our midst nodding around and addressing us in what she imagined to be french ‘bienne hommes ça va bienne’  i took the freedom to reply in the same lingo bienne femme ça va coucicouci tout d’même la bourgeoise’  and at that when we had all laughed with a little more heartiness than was entirely civil ‘i told you he was quite an oddity’ says she in triumph  needless to say these passages were before i had remarked the niece  the aunt came on the day in question with a following rather more than usually large which she manoeuvred to and fro about the market and lectured to at rather more than usual length and with rather less than her accustomed tact  i kept my eyes down but they were ever fixed in the same direction quite in vain  the aunt came and went and pulled us out and showed us off like caged monkeys but the niece kept herself on the outskirts of the crowd and on the opposite side of the courtyard and departed at last as she had come without a sign  closely as i had watched her i could not say her eyes had ever rested on me for an instant and my heart was overwhelmed with bitterness and blackness  i tore out her detested image i felt i was done with her for ever i laughed at myself savagely because i had thought to please when i lay down at night sleep forsook me and i lay and rolled and gloated on her charms and cursed her insensibility for half the night  how trivial i thought her and how trivial her sex  a man might be an angel or an apollo and a mustardcoloured coat would wholly blind them to his merits  i was a prisoner a slave a contemned and despicable being the butt of her sniggering countrymen  i would take the lesson no proud daughter of my foes should have the chance to mock at me again none in the future should have the chance to think i had looked at her with admiration  you cannot imagine any one of a more resolute and independent spirit or whose bosom was more wholly mailed with patriotic arrogance than i  before i dropped asleep i had remembered all the infamies of britain and debited them in an overwhelming column to flora  the next day as i sat in my place i became conscious there was some one standing near and behold it was herself  i kept my seat at first in the confusion of my mind later on from policy and she stood and leaned a little over me as in pity  she was very still and timid her voice was low  did i suffer in my captivity she asked me  had i to complain of any hardship  ‘mademoiselle i have not learned to complain’ said i  ‘i am a soldier of napoleon’  she sighed  ‘at least you must regret la france’ said she and coloured a little as she pronounced the words which she did with a pretty strangeness of accent  ‘what am i to say’ i replied  ‘if you were carried from this country for which you seem so wholly suited where the very rains and winds seem to become you like ornaments would you regret do you think  we must surely all regret the son to his mother the man to his country these are native feelings’  ‘you have a mother’ she asked  ‘in heaven mademoiselle’ i answered  ‘she and my father also went by the same road to heaven as so many others of the fair and brave they followed their queen upon the scaffold  so you see i am not so much to be pitied in my prison’ i continued ‘there are none to wait for me i am alone in the world  ’tis a different case for instance with yon poor fellow in the cloth cap  his bed is next to mine and in the night i hear him sobbing to himself  he has a tender character full of tender and pretty sentiments and in the dark at night and sometimes by day when he can get me apart with him he laments a mother and a sweetheart do you know what made him take me for a confidant’  she parted her lips with a look but did not speak  the look burned all through me with a sudden vital heat  ‘because i had once seen in marching by the belfry of his village’ i continued  ‘the circumstance is quaint enough  it seems to bind up into one the whole bundle of those human instincts that make life beautiful and people and places dear—and from which it would seem i am cut off’  i rested my chin on my knee and looked before me on the ground  i had been talking until then to hold her but i was now not sorry she should go an impression is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow  presently she seemed to make an effort  ‘i will take this toy’ she said laid a fiveandsixpenny piece in my hand and was gone ere i could thank her  i retired to a place apart near the ramparts and behind a gun  the beauty the expression of her eyes the tear that had trembled there the compassion in her voice and a kind of wild elegance that consecrated the freedom of her movements all combined to enslave my imagination and inflame my heart  what had she said  nothing to signify but her eyes had met mine and the fire they had kindled burned inextinguishably in my veins  i loved her and i did not fear to hope  twice i had spoken with her and in both interviews i had been well inspired i had engaged her sympathies i had found words that she must remember that would ring in her ears at night upon her bed  what mattered if i were half shaved and my clothes a caricature  i was still a man and i had drawn my image on her memory  i was still a man and as i trembled to realise she was still a woman  many waters cannot quench love and love which is the law of the world was on my side  i closed my eyes and she sprang up on the background of the darkness more beautiful than in life  ‘ah’ thought i ‘and you too my dear you too must carry away with you a picture that you are still to behold again and still to embellish  in the darkness of night in the streets by day still you are to have my voice and face whispering making love for me encroaching on your shy heart  shy as your heart is it is lodged there—i am lodged there let the hours do their office—let time continue to draw me ever in more lively ever in more insidious colours’  and then i had a vision of myself and burst out laughing  a likely thing indeed that a beggarman a private soldier a prisoner in a yellow travesty was to awake the interest of this fair girl  i would not despair but i saw the game must be played fine and close  it must be my policy to hold myself before her always in a pathetic or pleasing attitude never to alarm or startle her to keep my own secret locked in my bosom like a story of disgrace and let hers if she could be induced to have one grow at its own rate to move just so fast and not by a hair’sbreadth any faster than the inclination of her heart  i was the man and yet i was passive tied by the foot in prison  i could not go to her i must cast a spell upon her at each visit so that she should return to me and this was a matter of nice management  i had done it the last time—it seemed impossible she should not come again after our interview and for the next i had speedily ripened a fresh plan  a prisoner if he has one great disability for a lover has yet one considerable advantage there is nothing to distract him and he can spend all his hours ripening his love and preparing its manifestations i had been then some days upon a piece of carving—no less than the emblem of scotland the lion rampant  this i proceeded to finish with what skill i was possessed of and when at last i could do no more to it and you may be sure was already regretting i had done so much added on the base the following dedication—                                 À la belle flora                          le prisonnier reconnaissant                              a d st  y d k  i put my heart into the carving of these letters  what was done with so much ardour it seemed scarce possible that any should behold with indifference and the initials would at least suggest to her my noble birth  i thought it better to suggest i felt that mystery was my stockintrade the contrast between my rank and manners between my speech and my clothing and the fact that she could only think of me by a combination of letters must all tend to increase her interest and engage her heart  this done there was nothing left for me but to wait and to hope  and there is nothing further from my character in love and in war i am all for the forward movement and these days of waiting made my purgatory it is a fact that i loved her a great deal better at the end of them for love comes like bread from a perpetual rehandling  and besides i was fallen into a panic of fear  how if she came no more how was i to continue to endure my empty days how was i to fall back and find my interest in the major’s lessons the lieutenant’s chess in a twopenny sale in the market or a halfpenny addition to the prison fare  days went by and weeks i had not the courage to calculate and today i have not the courage to remember but at last she was there  at last i saw her approach me in the company of a boy about her own age and whom i divined at once to be her brother  i rose and bowed in silence  ‘this is my brother mr ronald gilchrist’ said she  ‘i have told him of your sufferings  he is so sorry for you’  ‘it is more than i have the right to ask’ i replied ‘but among gentlefolk these generous sentiments are natural  if your brother and i were to meet in the field we should meet like tigers but when he sees me here disarmed and helpless he forgets his animosity’  at which as i had ventured to expect this beardless champion coloured to the ears for pleasure  ‘ah my dear young lady’ i continued ‘there are many of your countrymen languishing in my country even as i do here  i can but hope there is found some french lady to convey to each of them the priceless consolation of her sympathy  you have given me alms and more than alms—hope and while you were absent i was not forgetful  suffer me to be able to tell myself that i have at least tried to make a return and for the prisoner’s sake deign to accept this trifle’  so saying i offered her my lion which she took looked at in some embarrassment and then catching sight of the dedication broke out with a cry  ‘why how did you know my name’ she exclaimed  ‘when names are so appropriate they should be easily guessed’ said i bowing  ‘but indeed there was no magic in the matter  a lady called you by name on the day i found your handkerchief and i was quick to remark and cherish it’  ‘it is very very beautiful’ said she ‘and i shall be always proud of the inscription—come ronald we must be going’  she bowed to me as a lady bows to her equal and passed on i could have sworn with a heightened colour  i was overjoyed my innocent ruse had succeeded she had taken my gift without a hint of payment and she would scarce sleep in peace till she had made it up to me  no greenhorn in matters of the heart i was besides aware that i had now a resident ambassador at the court of my lady  the lion might be ill chiselled it was mine  my hands had made and held it my knife—or to speak more by the mark my rusty nail—had traced those letters and simple as the words were they would keep repeating to her that i was grateful and that i found her fair  the boy had looked like a gawky and blushed at a compliment i could see besides that he regarded me with considerable suspicion yet he made so manly a figure of a lad that i could not withhold from him my sympathy  and as for the impulse that had made her bring and introduce him i could not sufficiently admire it  it seemed to me finer than wit and more tender than a caress  it said plain as language ‘i do not and i cannot know you  here is my brother—you can know him this is the way to me—follow it’     chapter ii—a tale of a pair of scissors   i was still plunged in these thoughts when the bell was rung that discharged our visitors into the street  our little market was no sooner closed than we were summoned to the distribution and received our rations which we were then allowed to eat according to fancy in any part of our quarters  i have said the conduct of some of our visitors was unbearably offensive it was possibly more so than they dreamed—as the sightseers at a menagerie may offend in a thousand ways and quite without meaning it the noble and unfortunate animals behind the bars and there is no doubt but some of my compatriots were susceptible beyond reason  some of these old whiskerandos originally peasants trained since boyhood in victorious armies and accustomed to move among subject and trembling populations could ill brook their change of circumstance  there was one man of the name of goguelat a brute of the first water who had enjoyed no touch of civilisation beyond the military discipline and had risen by an extreme heroism of bravery to a grade for which he was otherwise unfitted—that of maréchal des logis in the 22nd of the line  in so far as a brute can be a good soldier he was a good soldier the cross was on his breast and gallantly earned but in all things outside his line of duty the man was no other than a brawling bruising ignorant pillar of low pothouses  as a gentleman by birth and a scholar by taste and education i was the type of all that he least understood and most detested and the mere view of our visitors would leave him daily in a transport of annoyance which he would make haste to wreak on the nearest victim and too often on myself  it was so now  our rations were scarce served out and i had just withdrawn into a corner of the yard when i perceived him drawing near he wore an air of hateful mirth a set of young fools among whom he passed for a wit followed him with looks of expectation and i saw i was about to be the object of some of his insufferable pleasantries  he took a place beside me spread out his rations drank to me derisively from his measure of prison beer and began  what he said it would be impossible to print but his admirers who believed their wit to have surpassed himself actually rolled among the gravel  for my part i thought at first i should have died  i had not dreamed the wretch was so observant but hate sharpens the ears and he had counted our interviews and actually knew flora by her name  gradually my coolness returned to me accompanied by a volume of living anger that surprised myself  ‘are you nearly done’ i asked  ‘because if you are i am about to say a word or two myself’  ‘oh fair play’ said he  ‘turn about  the marquis of carabas to the tribune’  ‘very well’ said i  ‘i have to inform you that i am a gentleman  you do not know what that means hey  well i will tell you  it is a comical sort of animal springs from another strange set of creatures they call ancestors and in common with toads and other vermin has a thing that he calls feelings  the lion is a gentleman he will not touch carrion  i am a gentleman and i cannot bear to soil my fingers with such a lump of dirt  sit still philippe goguelat sit still and do not say a word or i shall know you are a coward the eyes of our guards are upon us  here is your health’ said i and pledged him in the prison beer  ‘you have chosen to speak in a certain way of a young child’ i continued ‘who might be your daughter and who was giving alms to me and some others of us mendicants  if the emperor’—saluting—‘if my emperor could hear you he would pluck off the cross from your gross body  i cannot do that i cannot take away what his majesty has given but one thing i promise you—i promise you goguelat you shall be dead tonight’  i had borne so much from him in the past i believe he thought there was no end to my forbearance and he was at first amazed  but i have the pleasure to think that some of my expressions had pierced through his thick hide and besides the brute was truly a hero of valour and loved fighting for itself  whatever the cause at least he had soon pulled himself together and took the thing to do him justice handsomely  ‘and i promise you by the devil’s horns that you shall have the chance’ said he and pledged me again and again i did him scrupulous honour  the news of this defiance spread from prisoner to prisoner with the speed of wings every face was seen to be illuminated like those of the spectators at a horserace and indeed you must first have tasted the active life of a soldier and then mouldered for a while in the tedium of a jail in order to understand perhaps even to excuse the delight of our companions  goguelat and i slept in the same squad which greatly simplified the business and a committee of honour was accordingly formed of our shedmates  they chose for president a sergeantmajor in the 4th dragoons a greybeard of the army an excellent military subject and a good man  he took the most serious view of his functions visited us both and reported our replies to the committee  mine was of a decent firmness  i told him the young lady of whom goguelat had spoken had on several occasions given me alms  i reminded him that if we were now reduced to hold out our hands and sell pillboxes for charity it was something very new for soldiers of the empire  we had all seen bandits standing at a corner of a wood truckling for copper halfpence and after their benefactors were gone spitting out injuries and curses  ‘but’ said i ‘i trust that none of us will fall so low  as a frenchman and a soldier i owe that young child gratitude and am bound to protect her character and to support that of the army  you are my elder and my superior tell me if i am not right’  he was a quietmannered old fellow and patted me with three fingers on the back  ‘c’est bien mon enfant’ says he and returned to his committee  goguelat was no more accommodating than myself  ‘i do not like apologies nor those that make them’ was his only answer  and there remained nothing but to arrange the details of the meeting  so far as regards place and time we had no choice we must settle the dispute at night in the dark after a round had passed by and in the open middle of the shed under which we slept  the question of arms was more obscure  we had a good many tools indeed which we employed in the manufacture of our toys but they were none of them suited for a single combat between civilised men and being nondescript it was found extremely hard to equalise the chances of the combatants  at length a pair of scissors was unscrewed and a couple of tough wands being found in a corner of the courtyard one blade of the scissors was lashed solidly to each with resined twine—the twine coming i know not whence but the resin from the green pillars of the shed which still sweated from the axe  it was a strange thing to feel in one’s hand this weapon which was no heavier than a ridingrod and which it was difficult to suppose would prove more dangerous  a general oath was administered and taken that no one should interfere in the duel nor suppose it to result seriously betray the name of the survivor  and with that all being then ready we composed ourselves to await the moment  the evening fell cloudy not a star was to be seen when the first round of the night passed through our shed and wound off along the ramparts and as we took our places we could still hear over the murmurs of the surrounding city the sentries challenging its further passage  leclos the sergeantmajor set us in our stations engaged our wands and left us  to avoid bloodstained clothing my adversary and i had stripped to the shoes and the chill of the night enveloped our bodies like a wet sheet  the man was better at fencing than myself he was vastly taller than i being of a stature almost gigantic and proportionately strong in the inky blackness of the shed it was impossible to see his eyes and from the suppleness of the wands i did not like to trust to a parade  i made up my mind accordingly to profit if i might by my defect and as soon as the signal should be given to throw myself down and lunge at the same moment  it was to play my life upon one card should i not mortally wound him no defence would be left me what was yet more appalling i thus ran the risk of bringing my own face against his scissor with the double force of our assaults and my face and eyes are not that part of me that i would the most readily expose  ‘allez’ said the sergeantmajor  both lunged in the same moment with an equal fury and but for my manoeuvre both had certainly been spitted  as it was he did no more than strike my shoulder while my scissor plunged below the girdle into a mortal part and that great bulk of a man falling from his whole height knocked me immediately senseless  when i came to myself i was laid in my own sleepingplace and could make out in the darkness the outline of perhaps a dozen heads crowded around me  i sat up  ‘what is it’ i exclaimed  ‘hush’ said the sergeantmajor  ‘blessed be god all is well’  i felt him clasp my hand and there were tears in his voice  ‘’tis but a scratch my child here is papa who is taking good care of you  your shoulder is bound up we have dressed you in your clothes again and it will all be well’  at this i began to remember  ‘and goguelat’ i gasped  ‘he cannot bear to be moved he has his bellyful ’tis a bad business’ said the sergeantmajor  the idea of having killed a man with such an instrument as half a pair of scissors seemed to turn my stomach  i am sure i might have killed a dozen with a firelock a sabre a bayonet or any accepted weapon and been visited by no such sickness of remorse  and to this feeling every unusual circumstance of our rencounter the darkness in which we had fought our nakedness even the resin on the twine appeared to contribute  i ran to my fallen adversary kneeled by him and could only sob his name  he bade me compose myself  ‘you have given me the key of the fields comrade’ said he  ‘sans rancune’  at this my horror redoubled  here had we two expatriated frenchmen engaged in an illregulated combat like the battles of beasts  here was he who had been all his life so great a ruffian dying in a foreign land of this ignoble injury and meeting death with something of the spirit of a bayard  i insisted that the guards should be summoned and a doctor brought  ‘it may still be possible to save him’ i cried  the sergeantmajor reminded me of our engagement  ‘if you had been wounded’ said he ‘you must have lain there till the patrol came by and found you  it happens to be goguelat—and so must he  come child time to go to byby’  and as i still resisted ‘champdivers’ he said ‘this is weakness  you pain me’  ‘ay off to your beds with you’ said goguelat and named us in a company with one of his jovial gross epithets  accordingly the squad lay down in the dark and simulated what they certainly were far from experiencing sleep  it was not yet late  the city from far below and all around us sent up a sound of wheels and feet and lively voices  yet awhile and the curtain of the cloud was rent across and in the space of sky between the eaves of the shed and the irregular outline of the ramparts a multitude of stars appeared meantime in the midst of us lay goguelat and could not always withhold himself from groaning  we heard the round far off heard it draw slowly nearer  last of all it turned the corner and moved into our field of vision two file of men and a corporal with a lantern which he swung to and fro so as to cast its light in the recesses of the yards and sheds  ‘hullo’ cried the corporal pausing as he came by goguelat  he stooped with his lantern  all our hearts were flying  ‘what devil’s work is this’ he cried and with a startling voice summoned the guard  we were all afoot upon the instant more lanterns and soldiers crowded in front of the shed an officer elbowed his way in  in the midst was the big naked body soiled with blood  some one had covered him with his blanket but as he lay there in agony he had partly thrown it off  ‘this is murder’ cried the officer  ‘you wild beasts you will hear of this tomorrow’  as goguelat was raised and laid upon a stretcher he cried to us a cheerful and blasphemous farewell     chapter iii—major chevenix comes into the story and goguelat goes out   there was never any talk of a recovery and no time was lost in getting the man’s deposition  he gave but the one account of it that he had committed suicide because he was sick of seeing so many englishmen  the doctor vowed it was impossible the nature and direction of the wound forbidding it  goguelat replied that he was more ingenious than the other thought for and had propped up the weapon in the ground and fallen on the point—‘just like nebuchadnezzar’ he added winking to the assistants  the doctor who was a little spruce ruddy man of an impatient temper pished and pshawed and swore over his patient ‘nothing to be made of him’ he cried  ‘a perfect heathen  if we could only find the weapon’  but the weapon had ceased to exist  a little resined twine was perhaps blowing about in the castle gutters some bits of broken stick may have trailed in corners and behold in the pleasant air of the morning a dandy prisoner trimming his nails with a pair of scissors  finding the wounded man so firm you may be sure the authorities did not leave the rest of us in peace  no stone was left unturned  we were had in again and again to be examined now singly now in twos and threes we were threatened with all sorts of impossible severities and tempted with all manner of improbable rewards  i suppose i was five times interrogated and came off from each with flying colours  i am like old souvaroff i cannot understand a soldier being taken aback by any question he should answer as he marches on the fire with an instant briskness and gaiety  i may have been short of bread gold or grace i was never yet found wanting in an answer  my comrades if they were not all so ready were none of them less staunch and i may say here at once that the inquiry came to nothing at the time and the death of goguelat remained a mystery of the prison  such were the veterans of france  and yet i should be disingenuous if i did not own this was a case apart in ordinary circumstances some one might have stumbled or been intimidated into an admission and what bound us together with a closeness beyond that of mere comrades was a secret to which we were all committed and a design in which all were equally engaged  no need to inquire as to its nature there is only one desire and only one kind of design that blooms in prisons  and the fact that our tunnel was near done supported and inspired us  i came off in public as i have said with flying colours the sittings of the court of inquiry died away like a tune that no one listens to and yet i was unmasked—i whom my very adversary defended as good as confessed as good as told the nature of the quarrel and by so doing prepared for myself in the future a most anxious disagreeable adventure it was the third morning after the duel and goguelat was still in life when the time came round for me to give major chevenix a lesson  i was fond of this occupation not that he paid me much—no more indeed than eighteenpence a month the customary figure being a miser in the grain but because i liked his breakfasts and to some extent himself  at least he was a man of education and of the others with whom i had any opportunity of speech those that would not have held a book upsidedown would have torn the pages out for pipelights  for i must repeat again that our body of prisoners was exceptional there was in edinburgh castle none of that educational busyness that distinguished some of the other prisons so that men entered them unable to read and left them fit for high employments  chevenix was handsome and surprisingly young to be a major six feet in his stockings well set up with regular features and very clear grey eyes  it was impossible to pick a fault in him and yet the sumtotal was displeasing  perhaps he was too clean he seemed to bear about with him the smell of soap  cleanliness is good but i cannot bear a man’s nails to seem japanned  and certainly he was too selfpossessed and cold  there was none of the fire of youth none of the swiftness of the soldier in this young officer  his kindness was cold and cruel cold his deliberation exasperating  and perhaps it was from this character which is very much the opposite of my own that even in these days when he was of service to me i approached him with suspicion and reserve  i looked over his exercise in the usual form and marked six faults  ‘h’m  six’ says he looking at the paper  ‘very annoying  i can never get it right’  ‘oh but you make excellent progress’ i said  i would not discourage him you understand but he was congenitally unable to learn french some fire i think is needful and he had quenched his fire in soapsuds  he put the exercise down leaned his chin upon his hand and looked at me with clear severe eyes  ‘i think we must have a little talk’ said he  ‘i am entirely at your disposition’ i replied but i quaked for i knew what subject to expect  ‘you have been some time giving me these lessons’ he went on ‘and i am tempted to think rather well of you  i believe you are a gentleman’  ‘i have that honour sir’ said i  ‘you have seen me for the same period  i do not know how i strike you but perhaps you will be prepared to believe that i also am a man of honour’ said he  ‘i require no assurances the thing is manifest’ and i bowed  ‘very well then’ said he  ‘what about this goguelat’  ‘you heard me yesterday before the court’ i began  ‘i was awakened only—’  ‘oh yes i “heard you yesterday before the court” no doubt’ he interrupted ‘and i remember perfectly that you were “awakened only”  i could repeat the most of it by rote indeed  but do you suppose that i believed you for a moment’  ‘neither would you believe me if i were to repeat it here’ said i  ‘i may be wrong—we shall soon see’ says he ‘but my impression is that you will not “repeat it here”  my impression is that you have come into this room and that you will tell me something before you go out’  i shrugged my shoulders  ‘let me explain’ he continued  ‘your evidence of course is nonsense i put it by and the court put it by’  ‘my compliments and thanks’ said i  ‘you must know—that’s the short and the long’ he proceeded  ‘all of you in shed b are bound to know  and i want to ask you where is the commonsense of keeping up this farce and maintaining this cockandbull story between friends  come come my good fellow own yourself beaten and laugh at it yourself’  ‘well i hear you go ahead’ said i  ‘you put your heart in it’  he crossed his legs slowly  ‘i can very well understand’ he began ‘that precautions have had to be taken  i dare say an oath was administered  i can comprehend that perfectly’  he was watching me all the time with his cold bright eyes  ‘and i can comprehend that about an affair of honour you would be very particular to keep it’  ‘about an affair of honour’ i repeated like a man quite puzzled  ‘it was not an affair of honour then’ he asked  ‘what was not  i do not follow’ said i  he gave no sign of impatience simply sat awhile silent and began again in the same placid and goodnatured voice ‘the court and i were at one in setting aside your evidence  it could not deceive a child  but there was a difference between myself and the other officers because i knew my man and they did not  they saw in you a common soldier and i knew you for a gentleman  to them your evidence was a leash of lies which they yawned to hear you telling  now i was asking myself how far will a gentleman go  not surely so far as to help hush a murder up  so that—when i heard you tell how you knew nothing of the matter and were only awakened by the corporal and all the rest of it—i translated your statements into something else  now champdivers’ he cried springing up lively and coming towards me with animation ‘i am going to tell you what that was and you are going to help me to see justice done how i don’t know for of course you are under oath—but somehow  mark what i’m going to say’  at that moment he laid a heavy hard grip upon my shoulder and whether he said anything more or came to a full stop at once i am sure i could not tell you to this day  for as the devil would have it the shoulder he laid hold of was the one goguelat had pinked  the wound was but a scratch it was healing with the first intention but in the clutch of major chevenix it gave me agony  my head swam the sweat poured off my face i must have grown deadly pale  he removed his hand as suddenly as he had laid it there  ‘what is wrong with you’ said he  ‘it is nothing’ said i  ‘a qualm  it has gone by’  ‘are you sure’ said he  ‘you are as white as a sheet’  ‘oh no i assure you  nothing whatever  i am my own man again’ i said though i could scarce command my tongue  ‘well shall i go on again’ says he  ‘can you follow me’  ‘oh by all means’ said i and mopped my streaming face upon my sleeve for you may be sure in those days i had no handkerchief  ‘if you are sure you can follow me  that was a very sudden and sharp seizure’ he said doubtfully  ‘but if you are sure all right and here goes  an affair of honour among you fellows would naturally be a little difficult to carry out perhaps it would be impossible to have it wholly regular  and yet a duel might be very irregular in form and under the peculiar circumstances of the case loyal enough in effect  do you take me  now as a gentleman and a soldier’  his hand rose again at the words and hovered over me  i could bear no more and winced away from him  ‘no’ i cried  ‘not that  do not put your hand upon my shoulder  i cannot bear it  it is rheumatism’ i made haste to add  ‘my shoulder is inflamed and very painful’  he returned to his chair and deliberately lighted a cigar  ‘i am sorry about your shoulder’ he said at last  ‘let me send for the doctor’  ‘not in the least’ said i  ‘it is a trifle  i am quite used to it  it does not trouble me in the smallest  at any rate i don’t believe in doctors’  ‘all right’ said he and sat and smoked a good while in a silence which i would have given anything to break  ‘well’ he began presently ‘i believe there is nothing left for me to learn  i presume i may say that i know all’  ‘about what’ said i boldly  ‘about goguelat’ said he  ‘i beg your pardon  i cannot conceive’ said i  ‘oh’ says the major ‘the man fell in a duel and by your hand  i am not an infant’  ‘by no means’ said i  ‘but you seem to me to be a good deal of a theorist’  ‘shall we test it’ he asked  ‘the doctor is close by  if there is not an open wound on your shoulder i am wrong  if there is—’  he waved his hand  ‘but i advise you to think twice  there is a deuce of a nasty drawback to the experiment—that what might have remained private between us two becomes public property’  ‘oh well’ said i with a laugh ‘anything rather than a doctor  i cannot bear the breed’  his last words had a good deal relieved me but i was still far from comfortable  major chevenix smoked awhile looking now at his cigar ash now at me ‘i’m a soldier myself’ he says presently ‘and i’ve been out in my time and hit my man  i don’t want to run any one into a corner for an affair that was at all necessary or correct  at the same time i want to know that much and i’ll take your word of honour for it  otherwise i shall be very sorry but the doctor must be called in’  ‘i neither admit anything nor deny anything’ i returned  ‘but if this form of words will suffice you here is what i say i give you my parole as a gentleman and a soldier there has nothing taken place amongst us prisoners that was not honourable as the day’  ‘all right’ says he  ‘that was all i wanted  you can go now champdivers’  and as i was going out he added with a laugh ‘by the bye i ought to apologise i had no idea i was applying the torture’  the same afternoon the doctor came into the courtyard with a piece of paper in his hand  he seemed hot and angry and had certainly no mind to be polite  ‘here’ he cried  ‘which of you fellows knows any english  oh’—spying me—‘there you are what’s your name  you’ll do  tell these fellows that the other fellow’s dying  he’s booked no use talking i expect he’ll go by evening  and tell them i don’t envy the feelings of the fellow who spiked him  tell them that first’  i did so  ‘then you can tell ’em’ he resumed ‘that the fellow goggle—what’s his name—wants to see some of them before he gets his marching orders  if i got it right he wants to kiss or embrace you or some sickening stuff got that  then here’s a list he’s had written and you’d better read it out to them—i can’t make head or tail of your beastly names—and they can answer present and fall in against that wall’  it was with a singular movement of incongruous feelings that i read the first name on the list  i had no wish to look again on my own handiwork my flesh recoiled from the idea and how could i be sure what reception he designed to give me  the cure was in my own hand i could pass that first name over—the doctor would not know—and i might stay away  but to the subsequent great gladness of my heart i did not dwell for an instant on the thought walked over to the designated wall faced about read out the name ‘champdivers’ and answered myself with the word ‘present’  there were some half dozen on the list all told and as soon as we were mustered the doctor led the way to the hospital and we followed after like a fatigue party in single file  at the door he paused told us ‘the fellow’ would see each of us alone and as soon as i had explained that sent me by myself into the ward  it was a small room whitewashed a south window stood open on a vast depth of air and a spacious and distant prospect and from deep below in the grassmarket the voices of hawkers came up clear and far away  hard by on a little bed lay goguelat  the sunburn had not yet faded from his face and the stamp of death was already there  there was something wild and unmannish in his smile that took me by the throat only death and love know or have ever seen it  and when he spoke it seemed to shame his coarse talk  he held out his arms as if to embrace me  i drew near with incredible shrinkings and surrendered myself to his arms with overwhelming disgust but he only drew my ear down to his lips  ‘trust me’ he whispered  ‘je suis bon bougre moi  i’ll take it to hell with me and tell the devil’  why should i go on to reproduce his grossness and trivialities  all that he thought at that hour was even noble though he could not clothe it otherwise than in the language of a brutal farce  presently he bade me call the doctor and when that officer had come in raised a little up in his bed pointed first to himself and then to me who stood weeping by his side and several times repeated the expression ‘frinds—frinds—dam frinds’  to my great surprise the doctor appeared very much affected  he nodded his little bobwigged head at us and said repeatedly ‘all right johnny—me comprong’  then goguelat shook hands with me embraced me again and i went out of the room sobbing like an infant  how often have i not seen it that the most unpardonable fellows make the happiest exits  it is a fate we may well envy them  goguelat was detested in life in the last three days by his admirable staunchness and consideration he won every heart and when word went about the prison the same evening that he was no more the voice of conversation became hushed as in a house of mourning  for myself i was like a man distracted i cannot think what ailed me when i awoke the following day nothing remained of it but that night i was filled with a gloomy fury of the nerves  i had killed him he had done his utmost to protect me i had seen him with that awful smile  and so illogical and useless is this sentiment of remorse that i was ready at a word or a look to quarrel with somebody else  i presume the disposition of my mind was imprinted on my face and when a little after i overtook saluted and addressed the doctor he looked on me with commiseration and surprise  i had asked him if it was true  ‘yes’ he said ‘the fellow’s gone’  ‘did he suffer much’ i asked  ‘devil a bit passed away like a lamb’ said he  he looked on me a little and i saw his hand go to his fob  ‘here take that no sense in fretting’ he said and putting a silver twopennybit in my hand he left me  i should have had that twopenny framed to hang upon the wall for it was the man’s one act of charity in all my knowledge of him  instead of that i stood looking at it in my hand and laughed out bitterly as i realised his mistake then went to the ramparts and flung it far into the air like blood money  the night was falling through an embrasure and across the gardened valley i saw the lamplighters hasting along princes street with ladder and lamp and looked on moodily  as i was so standing a hand was laid upon my shoulder and i turned about  it was major chevenix dressed for the evening and his neckcloth really admirably folded  i never denied the man could dress  ‘ah’ said he ‘i thought it was you champdivers  so he’s gone’  i nodded  ‘come come’ said he ‘you must cheer up  of course it’s very distressing very painful and all that  but do you know it ain’t such a bad thing either for you or me  what with his death and your visit to him i am entirely reassured’  so i was to owe my life to goguelat at every point  ‘i had rather not discuss it’ said i  ‘well’ said he ‘one word more and i’ll agree to bury the subject what did you fight about’  ‘oh what do men ever fight about’ i cried  ‘a lady’ said he  i shrugged my shoulders  ‘deuce you did’ said he  ‘i should scarce have thought it of him’  and at this my illhumour broke fairly out in words  ‘he’ i cried  ‘he never dared to address her—only to look at her and vomit his vile insults  she may have given him sixpence if she did it may take him to heaven yet’  at this i became aware of his eyes set upon me with a considering look and brought up sharply  ‘well well’ said he  ‘good night to you champdivers  come to me at breakfasttime tomorrow and we’ll talk of other subjects’  i fully admit the man’s conduct was not bad in writing it down so long after the events i can even see that it was good     chapter iv—st ives gets a bundle of bank notes   i was surprised one morning shortly after to find myself the object of marked consideration by a civilian and a stranger  this was a man of the middle age he had a face of a mulberry colour round black eyes comical tufted eyebrows and a protuberant forehead and was dressed in clothes of a quakerish cut  in spite of his plainness he had that inscrutable air of a man welltodo in his affairs  i conceived he had been some while observing me from a distance for a sparrow sat betwixt us quite unalarmed on the breech of a piece of cannon  so soon as our eyes met he drew near and addressed me in the french language which he spoke with a good fluency but an abominable accent  ‘i have the pleasure of addressing monsieur le vicomte anne de kéroual de saintyves’ said he  ‘well’ said i ‘i do not call myself all that but i have a right to if i chose  in the meanwhile i call myself plain champdivers at your disposal  it was my mother’s name and good to go soldiering with’  ‘i think not quite’ said he ‘for if i remember rightly your mother also had the particle  her name was florimonde de champdivers’  ‘right again’ said i ‘and i am extremely pleased to meet a gentleman so well informed in my quarterings  is monsieur born himself’  this i said with a great air of assumption partly to conceal the degree of curiosity with which my visitor had inspired me and in part because it struck me as highly incongruous and comical in my prison garb and on the lips of a private soldier  he seemed to think so too for he laughed  ‘no sir’ he returned speaking this time in english ‘i am not “born” as you call it and must content myself with dying of which i am equally susceptible with the best of you  my name is mr romaine—daniel romaine—a solicitor of london city at your service and what will perhaps interest you more i am here at the request of your greatuncle the count’  ‘what’ i cried ‘does m de kéroual de styves remember the existence of such a person as myself and will he deign to count kinship with a soldier of napoleon’  ‘you speak english well’ observed my visitor  ‘it has been a second language to me from a child’ said i  ‘i had an english nurse my father spoke english with me and i was finished by a countryman of yours and a dear friend of mine a mr vicary’  a strong expression of interest came into the lawyer’s face  ‘what’ he cried ‘you knew poor vicary’  ‘for more than a year’ said i ‘and shared his hidingplace for many months’  ‘and i was his clerk and have succeeded him in business’ said he ‘excellent man  it was on the affairs of m de kéroual that he went to that accursed country from which he was never destined to return  do you chance to know his end sir’  ‘i am sorry’ said i ‘i do  he perished miserably at the hands of a gang of banditti such as we call chauffeurs  in a word he was tortured and died of it  see’ i added kicking off one shoe for i had no stockings ‘i was no more than a child and see how they had begun to treat myself’  he looked at the mark of my old burn with a certain shrinking  ‘beastly people’ i heard him mutter to himself  ‘the english may say so with a good grace’ i observed politely  such speeches were the coin in which i paid my way among this credulous race  ninety per cent of our visitors would have accepted the remark as natural in itself and creditable to my powers of judgment but it appeared my lawyer was more acute  ‘you are not entirely a fool i perceive’ said he  ‘no’ said i ‘not wholly’  ‘and yet it is well to beware of the ironical mood’ he continued  ‘it is a dangerous instrument  your greatuncle has i believe practised it very much until it is now become a problem what he means’  ‘and that brings me back to what you will admit is a most natural inquiry’ said i  ‘to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit how did you recognise me and how did you know i was here’  carefull separating his coat skirts the lawyer took a seat beside me on the edge of the flags  ‘it is rather an odd story’ says he ‘and with your leave i’ll answer the second question first  it was from a certain resemblance you bear to your cousin m le vicomte’  ‘i trust sir that i resemble him advantageously’ said i  ‘i hasten to reassure you’ was the reply ‘you do  to my eyes m alain de styves has scarce a pleasing exterior  and yet when i knew you were here and was actually looking for you—why the likeness helped  as for how i came to know your whereabouts by an odd enough chance it is again m alain we have to thank  i should tell you he has for some time made it his business to keep m de kéroual informed of your career with what purpose i leave you to judge  when he first brought the news of your—that you were serving buonaparte it seemed it might be the death of the old gentleman so hot was his resentment  but from one thing to another matters have a little changed  or i should rather say not a little  we learned you were under orders for the peninsula to fight the english then that you had been commissioned for a piece of bravery and were again reduced to the ranks  and from one thing to another as i say m de kéroual became used to the idea that you were his kinsman and yet served with buonaparte and filled instead with wonder that he should have another kinsman who was so remarkably well informed of events in france  and it now became a very disagreeable question whether the young gentleman was not a spy  in short sir in seeking to disserve you he had accumulated against himself a load of suspicions’  my visitor now paused took snuff and looked at me with an air of benevolence  ‘good god sir’ says i ‘this is a curious story’  ‘you will say so before i have done’ said he  ‘for there have two events followed  the first of these was an encounter of m de kéroual and m de mauseant’  ‘i know the man to my cost’ said i ‘it was through him i lost my commission’  ‘do you tell me so’ he cried  ‘why here is news’  ‘oh i cannot complain’ said i  ‘i was in the wrong  i did it with my eyes open  if a man gets a prisoner to guard and lets him go the least he can expect is to be degraded’  ‘you will be paid for it’ said he  ‘you did well for yourself and better for your king’  ‘if i had thought i was injuring my emperor’ said i ‘i would have let m de mauseant burn in hell ere i had helped him and be sure of that  i saw in him only a private person in a difficulty i let him go in private charity not even to profit myself will i suffer it to be misunderstood’  ‘well well’ said the lawyer ‘no matter now  this is a foolish warmth—a very misplaced enthusiasm believe me  the point of the story is that m de mauseant spoke of you with gratitude and drew your character in such a manner as greatly to affect your uncle’s views  hard upon the back of which in came your humble servant and laid before him the direct proof of what we had been so long suspecting  there was no dubiety permitted  m alain’s expensive way of life his clothes and mistresses his dicing and racehorses were all explained he was in the pay of buonaparte a hired spy and a man that held the strings of what i can only call a convolution of extremely fishy enterprises  to do m de kéroual justice he took it in the best way imaginable destroyed the evidences of the one greatnephew’s disgrace—and transferred his interest wholly to the other’  ‘what am i to understand by that’ said i  ‘i will tell you’ says he  ‘there is a remarkable inconsistency in human nature which gentlemen of my cloth have a great deal of occasion to observe  selfish persons can live without chick or child they can live without all mankind except perhaps the barber and the apothecary but when it comes to dying they seem physically unable to die without an heir  you can apply this principle for yourself  viscount alain though he scarce guesses it is no longer in the field  remains viscount anne’  ‘i see’ said i ‘you give a very unfavourable impression of my uncle the count’  ‘i had not meant it’ said he  ‘he has led a loose life—sadly loose—but he is a man it is impossible to know and not to admire his courtesy is exquisite’  ‘and so you think there is actually a chance for me’ i asked  ‘understand’ said he ‘in saying as much as i have done i travel quite beyond my brief  i have been clothed with no capacity to talk of wills or heritages or your cousin  i was sent here to make but the one communication that m de kéroual desires to meet his greatnephew’  ‘well’ said i looking about me on the battlements by which we sat surrounded ‘this is a case in which mahomet must certainly come to the mountain’  ‘pardon me’ said mr romaine ‘you know already your uncle is an aged man but i have not yet told you that he is quite broken up and his death shortly looked for  no no there is no doubt about it—it is the mountain that must come to mahomet’  ‘from an englishman the remark is certainly significant’ said i ‘but you are of course and by trade a keeper of men’s secrets and i see you keep that of cousin alain which is not the mark of a truculent patriotism to say the least’  ‘i am first of all the lawyer of your family’ says he  ‘that being so’ said i ‘i can perhaps stretch a point myself  this rock is very high and it is very steep a man might come by a devil of a fall from almost any part of it and yet i believe i have a pair of wings that might carry me just so far as to the bottom  once at the bottom i am helpless’  ‘and perhaps it is just then that i could step in’ returned the lawyer ‘suppose by some contingency at which i make no guess and on which i offer no opinion—’  but here i interrupted him  ‘one word ere you go further  i am under no parole’ said i  ‘i understood so much’ he replied ‘although some of you french gentry find their word sit lightly on them’  ‘sir i am not one of those’ said i  ‘to do you plain justice i do not think you one’ said he  ‘suppose yourself then set free and at the bottom of the rock’ he continued ‘although i may not be able to do much i believe i can do something to help you on your road  in the first place i would carry this whether in an inside pocket or my shoe’  and he passed me a bundle of bank notes  ‘no harm in that’ said i at once concealing them  ‘in the second place’ he resumed ‘it is a great way from here to where your uncle lives—amersham place not far from dunstable you have a great part of britain to get through and for the first stages i must leave you to your own luck and ingenuity  i have no acquaintance here in scotland or at least’ with a grimace ‘no dishonest ones  but further to the south about wakefield i am told there is a gentleman called burchell fenn who is not so particular as some others and might be willing to give you a cast forward  in fact sir i believe it’s the man’s trade a piece of knowledge that burns my mouth  but that is what you get by meddling with rogues and perhaps the biggest rogue now extant m de saintyves is your cousin m alain’  ‘if this be a man of my cousin’s’ i observed ‘i am perhaps better to keep clear of him’  ‘it was through some paper of your cousin’s that we came across his trail’ replied the lawyer  ‘but i am inclined to think so far as anything is safe in such a nasty business you might apply to the man fenn  you might even i think use the viscount’s name and the little trick of family resemblance might come in  how for instance if you were to call yourself his brother’  ‘it might be done’ said i  ‘but look here a moment  you propose to me a very difficult game i have apparently a devil of an opponent in my cousin and being a prisoner of war i can scarcely be said to hold good cards  for what stakes then am i playing’  ‘they are very large’ said he  ‘your greatuncle is immensely rich—immensely rich  he was wise in time he smelt the revolution long before sold all that he could and had all that was movable transported to england through my firm  there are considerable estates in england amersham place itself is very fine and he has much money wisely invested  he lives indeed like a prince  and of what use is it to him  he has lost all that was worth living for—his family his country he has seen his king and queen murdered he has seen all these miseries and infamies’ pursued the lawyer with a rising inflection and a heightening colour and then broke suddenly off—‘in short sir he has seen all the advantages of that government for which his nephew carries arms and he has the misfortune not to like them’  ‘you speak with a bitterness that i suppose i must excuse’ said i ‘yet which of us has the more reason to be bitter  this man my uncle m de kéroual fled  my parents who were less wise perhaps remained  in the beginning they were even republicans to the end they could not be persuaded to despair of the people  it was a glorious folly for which as a son i reverence them  first one and then the other perished  if i have any mark of a gentleman all who taught me died upon the scaffold and my last school of manners was the prison of the abbaye  do you think you can teach bitterness to a man with a history like mine’  ‘i have no wish to try’ said he  ‘and yet there is one point i cannot understand i cannot understand that one of your blood and experience should serve the corsican  i cannot understand it it seems as though everything generous in you must rise against that—domination’  ‘and perhaps’ i retorted ‘had your childhood passed among wolves you would have been overjoyed yourself to see the corsican shepherd’  ‘well well’ replied mr romaine ‘it may be  there are things that do not bear discussion’  and with a wave of his hand he disappeared abruptly down a flight of steps and under the shadow of a ponderous arch     chapter v—st ives is shown a house   the lawyer was scarce gone before i remembered many omissions and chief among these that i had neglected to get mr burchell fenn’s address here was an essential point neglected and i ran to the head of the stairs to find myself already too late  the lawyer was beyond my view in the archway that led downward to the castle gate only the red coat and the bright arms of a sentry glittered in the shadow and i could but return to my place upon the ramparts  i am not very sure that i was properly entitled to this corner  but i was a high favourite not an officer and scarce a private in the castle would have turned me back except upon a thing of moment and whenever i desired to be solitary i was suffered to sit here behind my piece of cannon unmolested  the cliff went down before me almost sheer but mantled with a thicket of climbing trees from farther down an outwork raised its turret and across the valley i had a view of that long terrace of princes street which serves as a promenade to the fashionable inhabitants of edinburgh  a singularity in a military prison that it should command a view on the chief thoroughfare  it is not necessary that i should trouble you with the train of my reflections which turned upon the interview i had just concluded and the hopes that were now opening before me  what is more essential my eye even while i thought kept following the movement of the passengers on princes street as they passed briskly to and fro—met greeted and bowed to each other—or entered and left the shops which are in that quarter and for a town of the britannic provinces particularly fine  my mind being busy upon other things the course of my eye was the more random and it chanced that i followed for some time the advance of a young gentleman with a red head and a white greatcoat for whom i cared nothing at the moment and of whom it is probable i shall be gathered to my fathers without learning more  he seemed to have a large acquaintance his hat was for ever in his hand and i daresay i had already observed him exchanging compliments with half a dozen when he drew up at last before a young man and a young lady whose tall persons and gallant carriage i thought i recognised  it was impossible at such a distance that i could be sure but the thought was sufficient and i craned out of the embrasure to follow them as long as possible  to think that such emotions that such a concussion of the blood may have been inspired by a chance resemblance and that i may have stood and thrilled there for a total stranger  this distant view at least whether of flora or of some one else changed in a moment the course of my reflections  it was all very well and it was highly needful i should see my uncle but an uncle a greatuncle at that and one whom i had never seen leaves the imagination cold and if i were to leave the castle i might never again have the opportunity of finding flora  the little impression i had made even supposing i had made any how soon it would die out how soon i should sink to be a phantom memory with which in after days she might amuse a husband and children  no the impression must be clenched the wax impressed with the seal ere i left edinburgh  and at this the two interests that were now contending in my bosom came together and became one  i wished to see flora again and i wanted some one to further me in my flight and to get me new clothes  the conclusion was apparent  except for persons in the garrison itself with whom it was a point of honour and military duty to retain me captive i knew in the whole country of scotland these two alone  if it were to be done at all they must be my helpers  to tell them of my designed escape while i was still in bonds would be to lay before them a most difficult choice  what they might do in such a case i could not in the least be sure of for the same case arising i was far from sure what i should do myself  it was plain i must escape first when the harm was done when i was no more than a poor wayside fugitive i might apply to them with less offence and more security  to this end it became necessary that i should find out where they lived and how to reach it and feeling a strong confidence that they would soon return to visit me i prepared a series of baits with which to angle for my information  it will be seen the first was good enough  perhaps two days after master ronald put in an appearance by himself  i had no hold upon the boy and pretermitted my design till i should have laid court to him and engaged his interest  he was prodigiously embarrassed not having previously addressed me otherwise than by a bow and blushes and he advanced to me with an air of one stubbornly performing a duty like a raw soldier under fire  i laid down my carving greeted him with a good deal of formality such as i thought he would enjoy and finding him to remain silent branched off into narratives of my campaigns such as goguelat himself might have scrupled to endorse  he visibly thawed and brightened drew more near to where i sat forgot his timidity so far as to put many questions and at last with another blush informed me he was himself expecting a commission  ‘well’ said i ‘they are fine troops your british troops in the peninsula  a young gentleman of spirit may well be proud to be engaged at the head of such soldiers’  ‘i know that’ he said ‘i think of nothing else  i think shame to be dangling here at home and going through with this foolery of education while others no older than myself are in the field’  ‘i cannot blame you’ said i  ‘i have felt the same myself’  ‘there are—there are no troops are there quite so good as ours’ he asked  ‘well’ said i ‘there is a point about them they have a defect—they are not to be trusted in a retreat  i have seen them behave very ill in a retreat’  ‘i believe that is our national character’ he said—god forgive him—with an air of pride  ‘i have seen your national character running away at least and had the honour to run after it’ rose to my lips but i was not so ill advised as to give it utterance  every one should be flattered but boys and women without stint and i put in the rest of the afternoon narrating to him tales of british heroism for which i should not like to engage that they were all true  ‘i am quite surprised’ he said at last  ‘people tell you the french are insincere  now i think your sincerity is beautiful  i think you have a noble character  i admire you very much  i am very grateful for your kindness to—to one so young’ and he offered me his hand  ‘i shall see you again soon’ said i  ‘oh now  yes very soon’ said he  ‘i—i wish to tell you  i would not let flora—miss gilchrist i mean—come today  i wished to see more of you myself  i trust you are not offended you know one should be careful about strangers’  i approved his caution and he took himself away leaving me in a mixture of contrarious feelings part ashamed to have played on one so gullible part raging that i should have burned so much incense before the vanity of england yet in the bottom of my soul delighted to think i had made a friend—or at least begun to make a friend—of flora’s brother  as i had half expected both made their appearance the next day  i struck so fine a shade betwixt the pride that is allowed to soldiers and the sorrowful humility that befits a captive that i declare as i went to meet them i might have afforded a subject for a painter  so much was high comedy i must confess but so soon as my eyes lighted full on her dark face and eloquent eyes the blood leaped into my cheeks—and that was nature  i thanked them but not the least with exultation it was my cue to be mournful and to take the pair of them as one  ‘i have been thinking’ i said ‘you have been so good to me both of you stranger and prisoner as i am that i have been thinking how i could testify to my gratitude  it may seem a strange subject for a confidence but there is actually no one here even of my comrades that knows me by my name and title  by these i am called plain champdivers a name to which i have a right but not the name which i should bear and which but a little while ago i must hide like a crime  miss flora suffer me to present to you the vicomte anne de kéroual de saintyves a private soldier’  ‘i knew it’ cried the boy ‘i knew he was a noble’  and i thought the eyes of miss flora said the same but more persuasively  all through this interview she kept them on the ground or only gave them to me for a moment at a time and with a serious sweetness  ‘you may conceive my friends that this is rather a painful confession’ i continued  ‘to stand here before you vanquished a prisoner in a fortress and take my own name upon my lips is painful to the proud and yet i wished that you should know me  long after this we may yet hear of one another—perhaps mr gilchrist and myself in the field and from opposing camps—and it would be a pity if we heard and did not recognise’  they were both moved and began at once to press upon me offers of service such as to lend me books get me tobacco if i used it and the like  this would have been all mighty welcome before the tunnel was ready  now it signified no more to me than to offer the transition i required  ‘my dear friends’ i said—‘for you must allow me to call you that who have no others within so many hundred leagues—perhaps you will think me fanciful and sentimental and perhaps indeed i am but there is one service that i would beg of you before all others  you see me set here on the top of this rock in the midst of your city  even with what liberty i have i have the opportunity to see a myriad roofs and i dare to say thirty leagues of sea and land  all this hostile  under all these roofs my enemies dwell wherever i see the smoke of a house rising i must tell myself that some one sits before the chimney and reads with joy of our reverses  pardon me dear friends i know that you must do the same and i do not grudge at it  with you it is all different show me your house then were it only the chimney or if that be not visible the quarter of the town in which it lies  so when i look all about me i shall be able to say “there is one house in which i am not quite unkindly thought of”’  flora stood a moment  ‘it is a pretty thought’ said she ‘and as far as regards ronald and myself a true one  come i believe i can show you the very smoke out of our chimney’  so saying she carried me round the battlements towards the opposite or southern side of the fortress and indeed to a bastion almost immediately overlooking the place of our projected flight  thence we had a view of some foreshortened suburbs at our feet and beyond of a green open and irregular country rising towards the pentland hills  the face of one of these summits say two leagues from where we stood is marked with a procession of white scars  and to this she directed my attention  ‘you see these marks’ she said  ‘we call them the seven sisters follow a little lower with your eye and you will see a fold of the hill the tops of some trees and a tail of smoke out of the midst of them that is swanston cottage where my brother and i are living with my aunt if it gives you pleasure to see it i am glad  we too can see the castle from a corner in the garden and we go there in the morning often—do we not ronald—and we think of you m de saintyves but i am afraid it does not altogether make us glad’  ‘mademoiselle’ said i and indeed my voice was scarce under command ‘if you knew how your generous words—how even the sight of you—relieved the horrors of this place i believe i hope i know you would be glad  i will come here daily and look at that dear chimney and these green hills and bless you from the heart and dedicate to you the prayers of this poor sinner  ah  i do not say they can avail’  ‘who can say that m de saintyves’ she said softly  ‘but i think it is time we should be going’  ‘high time’ said ronald whom to say the truth i had a little forgotten  on the way back as i was laying myself out to recover lost ground with the youth and to obliterate if possible the memory of my last and somewhat too fervent speech who should come past us but the major  i had to stand aside and salute as he went by but his eyes appeared entirely occupied with flora  ‘who is that man’ she asked  ‘he is a friend of mine’ said i  ‘i give him lessons in french and he has been very kind to me’  ‘he stared’ she said—‘i do not say rudely but why should he stare’  ‘if you do not wish to be stared at mademoiselle suffer me to recommend a veil’ said i  she looked at me with what seemed anger  ‘i tell you the man stared’ she said  and ronald added  ‘oh i don’t think he meant any harm  i suppose he was just surprised to see us walking about with a pr with m saintyves’  but the next morning when i went to chevenix’s rooms and after i had dutifully corrected his exercise—‘i compliment you on your taste’ said he to me  ‘i beg your pardon’ said i  ‘oh no i beg yours’ said he  ‘you understand me perfectly just as i do you’  i murmured something about enigmas  ‘well shall i give you the key to the enigma’ said he leaning back ‘that was the young lady whom goguelat insulted and whom you avenged  i do not blame you  she is a heavenly creature’  ‘with all my heart to the last of it’ said i  ‘and to the first also if it amuses you  you are become so very acute of late that i suppose you must have your own way’  ‘what is her name’ he asked  ‘now really’ said i  ‘do you think it likely she has told me’  ‘i think it certain’ said he  i could not restrain my laughter  ‘well then do you think it likely i would tell you’ i cried  ‘not a bit’ said he  ‘but come to our lesson’     chapter vi—the escape   the time for our escape drew near and the nearer it came the less we seemed to enjoy the prospect  there is but one side on which this castle can be left either with dignity or safety but as there is the main gate and guard and the chief street of the upper city it is not to be thought of by escaping prisoners  in all other directions an abominable precipice surrounds it down the face of which if anywhere at all we must regain our liberty  by our concurrent labours in many a dark night working with the most anxious precautions against noise we had made out to pierce below the curtain about the southwest corner in a place they call the devil’s elbow  i have never met that celebrity nor if the rest of him at all comes up to what they called his elbow have i the least desire of his acquaintance  from the heel of the masonry the rascally breakneck precipice descended sheer among waste lands scattered suburbs of the city and houses in the building  i had never the heart to look for any length of time—the thought that i must make the descent in person some dark night robbing me of breath and indeed on anybody not a seaman or a steeplejack the mere sight of the devil’s elbow wrought like an emetic  i don’t know where the rope was got and doubt if i much cared  it was not that which gravelled me but whether now that we had it it would serve our turn  its length indeed we made a shift to fathom out but who was to tell us how that length compared with the way we had to go day after day there would be always some of us stolen out to the devil’s elbow and making estimates of the descent whether by a bare guess or the dropping of stones  a private of pioneers remembered the formula for that—or else remembered part of it and obligingly invented the remainder  i had never any real confidence in that formula and even had we got it from a book there were difficulties in the way of the application that might have daunted archimedes  we durst not drop any considerable pebble lest the sentinels should hear and those that we dropped we could not hear ourselves  we had never a watch—or none that had a secondhand and though every one of us could guess a second to a nicety all somehow guessed it differently  in short if any two set forth upon this enterprise they invariably returned with two opinions and often with a black eye in the bargain  i looked on upon these proceedings although not without laughter yet with impatience and disgust  i am one that cannot bear to see things botched or gone upon with ignorance and the thought that some poor devil was to hazard his bones upon such premises revolted me  had i guessed the name of that unhappy first adventurer my sentiments might have been livelier still  the designation of this personage was indeed all that remained for us to do and even in that we had advanced so far that the lot had fallen on shed b  it had been determined to mingle the bitter and the sweet and whoever went down first the whole of his shedmates were to follow next in order  this caused a good deal of joy in shed b and would have caused more if it had not still remained to choose our pioneer  in view of the ambiguity in which we lay as to the length of the rope and the height of the precipice—and that this gentleman was to climb down from fifty to seventy fathoms on a pitchy night on a rope entirely free and with not so much as an infant child to steady it at the bottom a little backwardness was perhaps excusable  but it was in our case more than a little  the truth is we were all womanish fellows about a height and i have myself been put more than once hors de combat by a less affair than the rock of edinburgh castle  we discussed it in the dark and between the passage of the rounds and it was impossible for any body of men to show a less adventurous spirit  i am sure some of us and myself first among the number regretted goguelat  some were persuaded it was safe and could prove the same by argument but if they had good reasons why some one else should make the trial they had better still why it should not be themselves  others again condemned the whole idea as insane among these as illluck would have it a seaman of the fleet who was the most dispiriting of all  the height he reminded us was greater than the tallest ship’s mast the rope entirely free and he as good as defied the boldest and strongest to succeed  we were relieved from this deadlock by our sergeantmajor of dragoons  ‘comrades’ said he ‘i believe i rank you all and for that reason if you really wish it i will be the first myself  at the same time you are to consider what the chances are that i may prove to be the last as well  i am no longer young—i was sixty near a month ago  since i have been a prisoner i have made for myself a little bedaine  my arms are all gone to fat  and you must promise not to blame me if i fall and play the devil with the whole thing’  ‘we cannot hear of such a thing’ said i  ‘m laclas is the oldest man here and as such he should be the very last to offer  it is plain we must draw lots’  ‘no’ said m laclas ‘you put something else in my head  there is one here who owes a pretty candle to the others for they have kept his secret  besides the rest of us are only rabble and he is another affair altogether  let champdivers—let the noble go the first’  i confess there was a notable pause before the noble in question got his voice  but there was no room for choice  i had been so illadvised when i first joined the regiment as to take ground on my nobility  i had been often rallied on the matter in the ranks and had passed under the bynames of monseigneur and the marquis  it was now needful i should justify myself and take a fair revenge  any little hesitation i may have felt passed entirely unnoticed from the lucky incident of a round happening at that moment to go by  and during the interval of silence there occurred something that sent my blood to the boil  there was a private in our shed called clausel a man of a very ugly disposition  he had made one of the followers of goguelat but whereas goguelat had always a kind of monstrous gaiety about him clausel was no less morose than he was evilminded  he was sometimes called the general and sometimes by a name too illmannered for repetition  as we all sat listening this man’s hand was laid on my shoulder and his voice whispered in my ear ‘if you don’t go i’ll have you hanged marquis’  as soon as the round was past—‘certainly gentlemen’ said i  ‘i will give you a lead with all the pleasure in the world  but first of all there is a hound here to be punished  m clausel has just insulted me and dishonoured the french army and i demand that he run the gauntlet of this shed’  there was but one voice asking what he had done and as soon as i had told them but one voice agreeing to the punishment  the general was in consequence extremely roughly handled and the next day was congratulated by all who saw him on his new decorations  it was lucky for us that he was one of the prime movers and believers in our project of escape or he had certainly revenged himself by a denunciation  as for his feelings towards myself they appeared by his looks to surpass humanity and i made up my mind to give him a wide berth in the future  had i been to go down that instant i believe i could have carried it well  but it was already too late—the day was at hand  the rest had still to be summoned  nor was this the extent of my misfortune for the next night and the night after were adorned with a perfect galaxy of stars and showed every cat that stirred in a quarter of a mile  during this interval i have to direct your sympathies on the vicomte de saintyves  all addressed me softly like folk round a sickbed  our italian corporal who had got a dozen of oysters from a fishwife laid them at my feet as though i were a pagan idol and i have never since been wholly at my ease in the society of shellfish  he who was the best of our carvers brought me a snuffbox which he had just completed and which while it was yet in hand he had often declared he would not part with under fifteen dollars  i believe the piece was worth the money too and yet the voice stuck in my throat with which i must thank him  i found myself in a word to be fed up like a prisoner in a camp of anthropophagi and honoured like the sacrificial bull  and what with these annoyances and the risky venture immediately ahead i found my part a trying one to play  it was a good deal of a relief when the third evening closed about the castle with volumes of seafog  the lights of princes street sometimes disappeared sometimes blinked across at us no brighter than the eyes of cats and five steps from one of the lanterns on the ramparts it was already groping dark  we made haste to lie down  had our jailers been upon the watch they must have observed our conversation to die out unusually soon  yet i doubt if any of us slept  each lay in his place tortured at once with the hope of liberty and the fear of a hateful death  the guard call sounded the hum of the town declined by little and little  on all sides of us in their different quarters we could hear the watchman cry the hours along the street  often enough during my stay in england have i listened to these gruff or broken voices or perhaps gone to my window when i lay sleepless and watched the old gentleman hobble by upon the causeway with his cape and his cap his hanger and his rattle  it was ever a thought with me how differently that cry would reecho in the chamber of lovers beside the bed of death or in the condemned cell  i might be said to hear it that night myself in the condemned cell  at length a fellow with a voice like a bull’s began to roar out in the opposite thoroughfare  ‘past yin o’cloak and a dark haary moarnin’’  at which we were all silently afoot  as i stole about the battlements towards the—gallows i was about to write—the sergeantmajor perhaps doubtful of my resolution kept close by me and occasionally proffered the most indigestible reassurances in my ear  at last i could bear them no longer  ‘be so obliging as to let me be’ said i  ‘i am neither a coward nor a fool  what do you know of whether the rope be long enough  but i shall know it in ten minutes’  the good old fellow laughed in his moustache and patted me  it was all very well to show the disposition of my temper before a friend alone before my assembled comrades the thing had to go handsomely  it was then my time to come on the stage and i hope i took it handsomely  ‘now gentlemen’ said i ‘if the rope is ready here is the criminal’  the tunnel was cleared the stake driven the rope extended  as i moved forward to the place many of my comrades caught me by the hand and wrung it an attention i could well have done without  ‘keep an eye on clausel’ i whispered to laclas and with that got down on my elbows and knees took the rope in both hands and worked myself feet foremost through the tunnel  when the earth failed under my feet i thought my heart would have stopped and a moment after i was demeaning myself in midair like a drunken jumpingjack  i have never been a model of piety but at this juncture prayers and a cold sweat burst from me simultaneously  the line was knotted at intervals of eighteen inches and to the inexpert it may seem as if it should have been even easy to descend  the trouble was this devil of a piece of rope appeared to be inspired not with life alone but with a personal malignity against myself  it turned to the one side paused for a moment and then spun me like a toastingjack to the other slipped like an eel from the clasp of my feet kept me all the time in the most outrageous fury of exertion and dashed me at intervals against the face of the rock  i had no eyes to see with and i doubt if there was anything to see but darkness  i must occasionally have caught a gasp of breath but it was quite unconscious  and the whole forces of my mind were so consumed with losing hold and getting it again that i could scarce have told whether i was going up or coming down  of a sudden i knocked against the cliff with such a thump as almost bereft me of my sense and as reason twinkled back i was amazed to find that i was in a state of rest that the face of the precipice here inclined outwards at an angle which relieved me almost wholly of the burthen of my own weight and that one of my feet was safely planted on a ledge  i drew one of the sweetest breaths in my experience hugged myself against the rope and closed my eyes in a kind of ecstasy of relief  it occurred to me next to see how far i was advanced on my unlucky journey a point on which i had not a shadow of a guess  i looked up there was nothing above me but the blackness of the night and the fog  i craned timidly forward and looked down  there upon a floor of darkness i beheld a certain pattern of hazy lights some of them aligned as in thoroughfares others standing apart as in solitary houses and before i could well realise it or had in the least estimated my distance a wave of nausea and vertigo warned me to lie back and close my eyes  in this situation i had really but the one wish and that was something else to think of  strange to say i got it a veil was torn from my mind and i saw what a fool i was—what fools we had all been—and that i had no business to be thus dangling between earth and heaven by my arms  the only thing to have done was to have attached me to a rope and lowered me and i had never the wit to see it till that moment  i filled my lungs got a good hold on my rope and once more launched myself on the descent  as it chanced the worst of the danger was at an end and i was so fortunate as to be never again exposed to any violent concussion  soon after i must have passed within a little distance of a bush of wallflower for the scent of it came over me with that impression of reality which characterises scents in darkness  this made me a second landmark the ledge being my first  i began accordingly to compute intervals of time so much to the ledge so much again to the wallflower so much more below  if i were not at the bottom of the rock i calculated i must be near indeed to the end of the rope and there was no doubt that i was not far from the end of my own resources  i began to be lightheaded and to be tempted to let go—now arguing that i was certainly arrived within a few feet of the level and could safely risk a fall anon persuaded i was still close at the top and it was idle to continue longer on the rock  in the midst of which i came to a bearing on plain ground and had nearly wept aloud  my hands were as good as flayed my courage entirely exhausted and what with the long strain and the sudden relief my limbs shook under me with more than the violence of ague and i was glad to cling to the rope  but this was no time to give way  i had by god’s single mercy got myself alive out of that fortress and now i had to try to get the others my comrades  there was about a fathom of rope to spare i got it by the end and searched the whole ground thoroughly for anything to make it fast to  in vain the ground was broken and stony but there grew not there so much as a bush of furze  ‘now then’ thought i to myself ‘here begins a new lesson and i believe it will prove richer than the first  i am not strong enough to keep this rope extended  if i do not keep it extended the next man will be dashed against the precipice  there is no reason why he should have my extravagant good luck  i see no reason why he should not fall—nor any place for him to fall on but my head’  from where i was now standing there was occasionally visible as the fog lightened a lamp in one of the barrack windows which gave me a measure of the height he had to fall and the horrid force that he must strike me with  what was yet worse we had agreed to do without signals every so many minutes by laclas’ watch another man was to be started from the battlements  now i had seemed to myself to be about half an hour in my descent and it seemed near as long again that i waited straining on the rope for my next comrade to begin  i began to be afraid that our conspiracy was out that my friends were all secured and that i should pass the remainder of the night and be discovered in the morning vainly clinging to the rope’s end like a hooked fish upon an angle  i could not refrain at this ridiculous image from a chuckle of laughter  and the next moment i knew by the jerking of the rope that my friend had crawled out of the tunnel and was fairly launched on his descent  it appears it was the sailor who had insisted on succeeding me as soon as my continued silence had assured him the rope was long enough gautier for that was his name had forgot his former arguments and shown himself so extremely forward that laclas had given way  it was like the fellow who had no harm in him beyond an instinctive selfishness  but he was like to have paid pretty dearly for the privilege  do as i would i could not keep the rope as i could have wished it and he ended at last by falling on me from a height of several yards so that we both rolled together on the ground  as soon as he could breathe he cursed me beyond belief wept over his finger which he had broken and cursed me again i bade him be still and think shame of himself to be so great a crybaby did he not hear the round going by above i asked and who could tell but what the noise of his fall was already remarked and the sentinels at the very moment leaning upon the battlements to listen  the round however went by and nothing was discovered the third man came to the ground quite easily the fourth was of course child’s play and before there were ten of us collected it seemed to me that without the least injustice to my comrades i might proceed to take care of myself  i knew their plan they had a map and an almanack and designed for grangemouth where they were to steal a ship  suppose them to do so i had no idea they were qualified to manage it after it was stolen  their whole escape indeed was the most haphazard thing imaginable only the impatience of captives and the ignorance of private soldiers would have entertained so misbegotten a device and though i played the good comrade and worked with them upon the tunnel but for the lawyer’s message i should have let them go without me  well now they were beyond my help as they had always been beyond my counselling and without word said or leave taken i stole out of the little crowd  it is true i would rather have waited to shake hands with laclas but in the last man who had descended i thought i recognised clausel and since the scene in the shed my distrust of clausel was perfect  i believed the man to be capable of any infamy and events have since shown that i was right     chapter vii—swanston cottage   i had two views  the first was naturally to get clear of edinburgh castle and the town to say nothing of my fellowprisoners the second to work to the southward so long as it was night and be near swanston cottage by morning  what i should do there and then i had no guess and did not greatly care being a devotee of a couple of divinities called chance and circumstance  prepare if possible where it is impossible work straight forward and keep your eyes open and your tongue oiled wit and a good exterior—there is all life in a nutshell  i had at first a rather chequered journey got involved in gardens butted into houses and had even once the misfortune to awake a sleeping family the father of which as i suppose menaced me from the window with a blunderbuss  altogether though i had been some time gone from my companions i was still at no great distance when a miserable accident put a period to the escape  of a sudden the night was divided by a scream  this was followed by the sound of something falling and that again by the report of a musket from the castle battlements  it was strange to hear the alarm spread through the city  in the fortress drums were beat and a bell rung backward  on all hands the watchmen sprang their rattles  even in that limbo or noman’sland where i was wandering lights were made in the houses sashes were flung up i could hear neighbouring families converse from window to window and at length i was challenged myself  ‘wha’s that’ cried a big voice  i could see it proceeded from a big man in a big nightcap leaning from a onepair window and as i was not yet abreast of his house i judged it was more wise to answer  this was not the first time i had had to stake my fortunes on the goodness of my accent in a foreign tongue and i have always found the moment inspiriting as a gambler should  pulling around me a sort of greatcoat i had made of my blanket to cover my sulphurcoloured livery—‘a friend’ said i  ‘what like’s all this collieshangie’ said he  i had never heard of a collieshangie in my days but with the racket all about us in the city i could have no doubt as to the man’s meaning  ‘i do not know sir really’ said i ‘but i suppose some of the prisoners will have escaped’  ‘bedamned’ says he  ‘oh sir they will be soon taken’ i replied ‘it has been found in time  good morning sir’  ‘ye walk late sir’ he added  ‘oh surely not’ said i with a laugh  ‘earlyish if you like’ which brought me finally beyond him highly pleased with my success  i was now come forth on a good thoroughfare which led as well as i could judge in my direction  it brought me almost immediately through a piece of street whence i could hear close by the springing of a watchman’s rattle and where i suppose a sixth part of the windows would be open and the people in all sorts of night gear talking with a kind of tragic gusto from one to another  here again i must run the gauntlet of a halfdozen questions the rattle all the while sounding nearer but as i was not walking inordinately quick as i spoke like a gentleman and the lamps were too dim to show my dress i carried it off once more  one person indeed inquired where i was off to at that hour  i replied vaguely and cheerfully and as i escaped at one end of this dangerous pass i could see the watchman’s lantern entering by the other i was now safe on a dark country highway out of sight of lights and out of the fear of watchmen  and yet i had not gone above a hundred yards before a fellow made an ugly rush at me from the roadside  i avoided him with a leap and stood on guard cursing my empty hands wondering whether i had to do with an officer or a mere footpad and scarce knowing which to wish  my assailant stood a little in the thick darkness i could see him bob and sidle as though he were feinting at me for an advantageous onfall  then he spoke  ‘my goo’ frien’’ says he and at the first word i pricked my ears ‘my goo’ frien’ will you oblishe me with lil neshary infamation  whish roa’ t’ cramond’  i laughed out clear and loud stepped up to the convivialist took him by the shoulders and faced him about  ‘my good friend’ said i ‘i believe i know what is best for you much better than yourself and may god forgive you the fright you have given me  there get you gone to edinburgh’  and i gave a shove which he obeyed with the passive agility of a ball and disappeared incontinently in the darkness down the road by which i had myself come  once clear of this foolish fellow i went on again up a gradual hill descended on the other side through the houses of a country village and came at last to the bottom of the main ascent leading to the pentlands and my destination  i was some way up when the fog began to lighten a little farther and i stepped by degrees into a clear starry night and saw in front of me and quite distinct the summits of the pentlands and behind the valley of the forth and the city of my late captivity buried under a lake of vapour  i had but one encounter—that of a farmcart which i heard from a great way ahead of me creaking nearer in the night and which passed me about the point of dawn like a thing seen in a dream with two silent figures in the inside nodding to the horse’s steps  i presume they were asleep by the shawl about her head and shoulders one of them should be a woman  soon by concurrent steps the day began to break and the fog to subside and roll away  the east grew luminous and was barred with chilly colours and the castle on its rock and the spires and chimneys of the upper town took gradual shape and arose like islands out of the receding cloud  all about me was still and sylvan the road mounting and winding with nowhere a sign of any passenger the birds chirping i suppose for warmth the boughs of the trees knocking together and the red leaves falling in the wind  it was broad day but still bitter cold and the sun not up when i came in view of my destination  a single gable and chimney of the cottage peeped over the shoulder of the hill not far off and a trifle higher on the mountain a tall old whitewashed farmhouse stood among the trees beside a falling brook beyond were rough hills of pasture  i bethought me that shepherd folk were early risers and if i were once seen skulking in that neighbourhood it might prove the ruin of my prospects took advantage of a line of hedge and worked myself up in its shadow till i was come under the garden wall of my friends’ house  the cottage was a little quaint place of many roughcast gables and grey roofs  it had something the air of a rambling infinitesimal cathedral the body of it rising in the midst two storeys high with a steeppitched roof and sending out upon all hands as it were chapterhouses chapels and transepts onestoreyed and dwarfish projections  to add to this appearance it was grotesquely decorated with crockets and gargoyles ravished from some medieval church  the place seemed hidden away being not only concealed in the trees of the garden but on the side on which i approached it buried as high as the eaves by the rising of the ground about the walls of the garden there went a line of wellgrown elms and beeches the first entirely bare the last still pretty well covered with red leaves and the centre was occupied with a thicket of laurel and holly in which i could see arches cut and paths winding  i was now within hail of my friends and not much the better  the house appeared asleep yet if i attempted to wake any one i had no guarantee it might not prove either the aunt with the gold eyeglasses whom i could only remember with trembling or some ass of a servantmaid who should burst out screaming at sight of me  higher up i could hear and see a shepherd shouting to his dogs and striding on the rough sides of the mountain and it was clear i must get to cover without loss of time  no doubt the holly thickets would have proved a very suitable retreat but there was mounted on the wall a sort of signboard not uncommon in the country of great britain and very damping to the adventurous spring guns and mantraps was the legend that it bore  i have learned since that these advertisements three times out of four were in the nature of quaker guns on a disarmed battery but i had not learned it then and even so the odds would not have been good enough  for a choice i would a hundred times sooner be returned to edinburgh castle and my corner in the bastion than to leave my foot in a steel trap or have to digest the contents of an automatic blunderbuss  there was but one chance left—that ronald or flora might be the first to come abroad and in order to profit by this chance if it occurred i got me on the cope of the wall in a place where it was screened by the thick branches of a beech and sat there waiting  as the day wore on the sun came very pleasantly out  i had been awake all night i had undergone the most violent agitations of mind and body and it is not so much to be wondered at as it was exceedingly unwise and foolhardy that i should have dropped into a doze  from this i awakened to the characteristic sound of digging looked down and saw immediately below me the back view of a gardener in a stable waistcoat  now he would appear steadily immersed in his business anon to my more immediate terror he would straighten his back stretch his arms gaze about the otherwise deserted garden and relish a deep pinch of snuff  it was my first thought to drop from the wall upon the other side  a glance sufficed to show me that even the way by which i had come was now cut off and the field behind me already occupied by a couple of shepherds’ assistants and a score or two of sheep  i have named the talismans on which i habitually depend but here was a conjuncture in which both were wholly useless  the copestone of a wall arrayed with broken bottles is no favourable rostrum and i might be as eloquent as pitt and as fascinating as richelieu and neither the gardener nor the shepherd lads would care a halfpenny  in short there was no escape possible from my absurd position there i must continue to sit until one or other of my neighbours should raise his eyes and give the signal for my capture  the part of the wall on which for my sins i was posted could be scarce less than twelve feet high on the inside the leaves of the beech which made a fashion of sheltering me were already partly fallen and i was thus not only perilously exposed myself but enabled to command some part of the garden walks and under an evergreen arch the front lawn and windows of the cottage  for long nothing stirred except my friend with the spade then i heard the opening of a sash and presently after saw miss flora appear in a morning wrapper and come strolling hitherward between the borders pausing and visiting her flowers—herself as fair there was a friend here immediately beneath me an unknown quantity—the gardener how to communicate with the one and not attract the notice of the other  to make a noise was out of the question i dared scarce to breathe  i held myself ready to make a gesture as soon as she should look and she looked in every possible direction but the one  she was interested in the vilest tuft of chickweed she gazed at the summit of the mountain she came even immediately below me and conversed on the most fastidious topics with the gardener but to the top of that wall she would not dedicate a glance  at last she began to retrace her steps in the direction of the cottage whereupon becoming quite desperate i broke off a piece of plaster took a happy aim and hit her with it in the nape of the neck  she clapped her hand to the place turned about looked on all sides for an explanation and spying me as indeed i was parting the branches to make it the more easy half uttered and half swallowed down again a cry of surprise  the infernal gardener was erect upon the instant  ‘what’s your wull miss’ said he  her readiness amazed me  she had already turned and was gazing in the opposite direction  ‘there’s a child among the artichokes’ she said  ‘the plagues of egyp’  i’ll see to them’ cried the gardener truculently and with a hurried waddle disappeared among the evergreens  that moment she turned she came running towards me her arms stretched out her face incarnadined for the one moment with heavenly blushes the next pale as death  ‘monsieur de saintyves’ she said  ‘my dear young lady’ i said ‘this is the damnedest liberty—i know it but what else was i to do’  ‘you have escaped’ said she  ‘if you call this escape’ i replied  ‘but you cannot possibly stop there’ she cried  ‘i know it’ said i  ‘and where am i to go’  she struck her hands together  ‘i have it’ she exclaimed  ‘come down by the beech trunk—you must leave no footprint in the border—quickly before robie can get back  i am the henwife here i keep the key you must go into the henhouse—for the moment’  i was by her side at once  both cast a hasty glance at the blank windows of the cottage and so much as was visible of the garden alleys it seemed there was none to observe us  she caught me by the sleeve and ran  it was no time for compliments hurry breathed upon our necks and i ran along with her to the next corner of the garden where a wired court and a board hovel standing in a grove of trees advertised my place of refuge she thrust me in without a word the bulk of the fowls were at the same time emitted and i found myself the next moment locked in alone with half a dozen sitting hens  in the twilight of the place all fixed their eyes on me severely and seemed to upbraid me with some crying impropriety  doubtless the hen has always a puritanic appearance although in its own behaviour i could never observe it to be more particular than its neighbours  but conceive a british hen     chapter viii—the henhouse   i was half an hour at least in the society of these distressing bipeds and alone with my own reflections and necessities  i was in great pain of my flayed hands and had nothing to treat them with i was hungry and thirsty and had nothing to eat or to drink i was thoroughly tired and there was no place for me to sit  to be sure there was the floor but nothing could be imagined less inviting  at the sound of approaching footsteps my goodhumour was restored  the key rattled in the lock and master ronald entered closed the door behind him and leaned his back to it  ‘i say you know’ he said and shook a sullen young head  ‘i know it’s a liberty’ said i  ‘it’s infernally awkward my position is infernally embarrassing’ said he  ‘well’ said i ‘and what do you think of mine’  this seemed to pose him entirely and he remained gazing upon me with a convincing air of youth and innocence  i could have laughed but i was not so inhumane  ‘i am in your hands’ said i with a little gesture  ‘you must do with me what you think right’  ‘ah yes’ he cried ‘if i knew’  ‘you see’ said i ‘it would be different if you had received your commission  properly speaking you are not yet a combatant i have ceased to be one and i think it arguable that we are just in the position of one ordinary gentleman to another where friendship usually comes before the law  observe i only say arguable  for god’s sake don’t think i wish to dictate an opinion  these are the sort of nasty little businesses inseparable from war which every gentleman must decide for himself  if i were in your place—’  ‘ay what would you do then’ says he  ‘upon my word i do not know’ said i  ‘hesitate as you are doing i believe’  ‘i will tell you’ he said  ‘i have a kinsman and it is what he would think that i am thinking  it is general graham of lynedoch—sir thomas graham  i scarcely know him but i believe i admire him more than i do god’  ‘i admire him a good deal myself’ said i ‘and have good reason to  i have fought with him been beaten and run away  veni victus sum evasi’  ‘what’ he cried  ‘you were at barossa’  ‘there and back which many could not say’ said i  ‘it was a pretty affair and a hot one and the spaniards behaved abominably as they usually did in a pitched field the marshal duke of belluno made a fool of himself and not for the first time and your friend sir thomas had the best of it so far as there was any best  he is a brave and ready officer’  ‘now then you will understand’ said the boy  ‘i wish to please sir thomas what would he do’  ‘well i can tell you a story’ said i ‘a true one too and about this very combat of chiclana or barossa as you call it  i was in the eighth of the line we lost the eagle of the first battalion more betoken but it cost you dear  well we had repulsed more charges than i care to count when your 87th regiment came on at a foot’s pace very slow but very steady in front of them a mounted officer his hat in his hand whitehaired and talking very quietly to the battalions  our major vigoroussillon set spurs to his horse and galloped out to sabre him but seeing him an old man very handsome and as composed as if he were in a coffeehouse lost heart and galloped back again  only you see they had been very close together for the moment and looked each other in the eyes  soon after the major was wounded taken prisoner and carried into cadiz  one fine day they announced to him the visit of the general sir thomas graham  “well sir” said the general taking him by the hand “i think we were face to face upon the field”  it was the whitehaired officer’  ‘ah’ cried the boy—his eyes were burning  ‘well and here is the point’ i continued  ‘sir thomas fed the major from his own table from that day and served him with six covers’  ‘yes it is a beautiful—a beautiful story’ said ronald  ‘and yet somehow it is not the same—is it’  ‘i admit it freely’ said i  the boy stood awhile brooding  ‘well i take my risk of it’ he cried ‘i believe it’s treason to my sovereign—i believe there is an infamous punishment for such a crime—and yet i’m hanged if i can give you up’  i was as much moved as he  ‘i could almost beg you to do otherwise’ i said  ‘i was a brute to come to you a brute and a coward  you are a noble enemy you will make a noble soldier’  and with rather a happy idea of a compliment for this warlike youth i stood up straight and gave him the salute  he was for a moment confused his face flushed  ‘well well i must be getting you something to eat but it will not be for six’ he added with a smile ‘only what we can get smuggled out  there is my aunt in the road you see’ and he locked me in again with the indignant hens  i always smile when i recall that young fellow and yet if the reader were to smile also i should feel ashamed  if my son shall be only like him when he comes to that age it will be a brave day for me and not a bad one for his country  at the same time i cannot pretend that i was sorry when his sister succeeded in his place  she brought me a few crusts of bread and a jug of milk which she had handsomely laced with whisky after the scottish manner  ‘i am so sorry’ she said ‘i dared not bring on anything more  we are so small a family and my aunt keeps such an eye upon the servants  i have put some whisky in the milk—it is more wholesome so—and with eggs you will be able to make something of a meal  how many eggs will you be wanting to that milk for i must be taking the others to my aunt—that is my excuse for being here  i should think three or four  do you know how to beat them or shall i do it’  willing to detain her a while longer in the henhouse i displayed my bleeding palms at which she cried aloud  ‘my dear miss flora you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs’ said i ‘and it is no bagatelle to escape from edinburgh castle  one of us i think was even killed’  ‘and you are as white as a rag too’ she exclaimed ‘and can hardly stand  here is my shawl sit down upon it here in the corner and i will beat your eggs  see i have brought a fork too i should have been a good person to take care of jacobites or covenanters in old days  you shall have more to eat this evening ronald is to bring it you from town we have money enough although no food that we can call our own  ah if ronald and i kept house you should not be lying in this shed  he admires you so much’  ‘my dear friend’ said i ‘for god’s sake do not embarrass me with more alms  i loved to receive them from that hand so long as they were needed but they are so no more and whatever else i may lack—and i lack everything—it is not money’  i pulled out my sheaf of notes and detached the top one it was written for ten pounds and signed by that very famous individual abraham newlands  ‘oblige me as you would like me to oblige your brother if the parts were reversed and take this note for the expenses  i shall need not only food but clothes’  ‘lay it on the ground’ said she  ‘i must not stop my beating’  ‘you are not offended’ i exclaimed  she answered me by a look that was a reward in itself and seemed to imply the most heavenly offers for the future  there was in it a shadow of reproach and such warmth of communicative cordiality as left me speechless  i watched her instead till her hens’ milk was ready  ‘now’ said she ‘taste that’  i did so and swore it was nectar  she collected her eggs and crouched in front of me to watch me eat  there was about this tall young lady at the moment an air of motherliness delicious to behold  i am like the english general and to this day i still wonder at my moderation  ‘what sort of clothes will you be wanting’ said she  ‘the clothes of a gentleman’ said i  ‘right or wrong i think it is the part i am best qualified to play  mr st ives for that’s to be my name upon the journey i conceive as rather a theatrical figure and his makeup should be to match’  ‘and yet there is a difficulty’ said she  ‘if you got coarse clothes the fit would hardly matter  but the clothes of a fine gentleman—o it is absolutely necessary that these should fit  and above all with your’—she paused a moment—‘to our ideas somewhat noticeable manners’  ‘alas for my poor manners’ said i  ‘but my dear friend flora these little noticeabilities are just what mankind has to suffer under yourself you see you’re very noticeable even when you come in a crowd to visit poor prisoners in the castle’  i was afraid i should frighten my good angel visitant away and without the smallest breath of pause went on to add a few directions as to stuffs and colours  she opened big eyes upon me  ‘o mr st ives’ she cried—‘if that is to be your name—i do not say they would not be becoming but for a journey do you think they would be wise  i am afraid’—she gave a pretty break of laughter—‘i am afraid they would be daftlike’  ‘well and am i not daft’ i asked her  ‘i do begin to think you are’ said she  ‘there it is then’ said i  ‘i have been long enough a figure of fun can you not feel with me that perhaps the bitterest thing in this captivity has been the clothes  make me a captive—bind me with chains if you like—but let me be still myself  you do not know what it is to be a walking travesty—among foes’ i added bitterly  ‘o but you are too unjust’ she cried  ‘you speak as though any one ever dreamed of laughing at you  but no one did  we were all pained to the heart  even my aunt—though sometimes i do think she was not quite in good taste—you should have seen her and heard her at home  she took so much interest  every patch in your clothes made us sorry it should have been a sister’s work’  ‘that is what i never had—a sister’ said i  ‘but since you say that i did not make you laugh—’  ‘o mr st ives never’ she exclaimed  ‘not for one moment  it was all too sad  to see a gentleman—’  ‘in the clothes of a harlequin and begging’ i suggested  ‘to see a gentleman in distress and nobly supporting it’ she said  ‘and do you not understand my fair foe’ said i ‘that even if all were as you say—even if you had thought my travesty were becoming—i should be only the more anxious for my sake for my country’s sake and for the sake of your kindness that you should see him whom you have helped as god meant him to be seen that you should have something to remember him by at least more characteristic than a misfitting sulphuryellow suit and half a week’s beard’  ‘you think a great deal too much of clothes’ she said  ‘i am not that kind of girl’  ‘and i am afraid i am that kind of man’ said i  ‘but do not think of me too harshly for that  i talked just now of something to remember by  i have many of them myself of these beautiful reminders of these keepsakes that i cannot be parted from until i lose memory and life many of them are great things many of them are high virtues—charity mercy faith  but some of them are trivial enough  miss flora do you remember the day that i first saw you the day of the strong east wind miss flora shall i tell you what you wore’  we had both risen to our feet and she had her hand already on the door to go  perhaps this attitude emboldened me to profit by the last seconds of our interview and it certainly rendered her escape the more easy  ‘o you are too romantic’ she said laughing and with that my sun was blown out my enchantress had fled away and i was again left alone in the twilight with the lady hens     chapter ix—three is company and four none   the rest of the day i slept in the corner of the henhouse upon flora’s shawl  nor did i awake until a light shone suddenly in my eyes and starting up with a gasp for indeed at the moment i dreamed i was still swinging from the castle battlements i found ronald bending over me with a lantern  it appeared it was past midnight that i had slept about sixteen hours and that flora had returned her poultry to the shed and i had heard her not  i could not but wonder if she had stooped to look at me as i slept  the puritan hens now slept irremediably and being cheered with the promise of supper i wished them an ironical goodnight and was lighted across the garden and noiselessly admitted to a bedroom on the ground floor of the cottage  there i found soap water razors—offered me diffidently by my beardless host—and an outfit of new clothes  to be shaved again without depending on the barber of the gaol was a source of a delicious if a childish joy  my hair was sadly too long but i was none so unwise as to make an attempt on it myself  and indeed i thought it did not wholly misbecome me as it was being by nature curly  the clothes were about as good as i expected  the waistcoat was of toilenet a pretty piece the trousers of fine kerseymere and the coat sat extraordinarily well  altogether when i beheld this changeling in the glass i kissed my hand to him  ‘my dear fellow’ said i ‘have you no scent’  ‘good god no’ cried ronald  ‘what do you want with scent’  ‘capital thing on a campaign’ said i  ‘but i can do without’  i was now led with the same precautions against noise into the little bowwindowed diningroom of the cottage  the shutters were up the lamp guiltily turned low the beautiful flora greeted me in a whisper and when i was set down to table the pair proceeded to help me with precautions that might have seemed excessive in the ear of dionysius  ‘she sleeps up there’ observed the boy pointing to the ceiling and the knowledge that i was so imminently near to the restingplace of that gold eyeglass touched even myself with some uneasiness  our excellent youth had imported from the city a meat pie and i was glad to find it flanked with a decanter of really admirable wine of oporto while i ate ronald entertained me with the news of the city which had naturally rung all day with our escape troops and mounted messengers had followed each other forth at all hours and in all directions but according to the last intelligence no recapture had been made  opinion in town was very favourable to us our courage was applauded and many professed regret that our ultimate chance of escape should be so small the man who had fallen was one sombref a peasant he was one who slept in a different part of the castle and i was thus assured that the whole of my former companions had attained their liberty and shed a was untenanted  from this we wandered insensibly into other topics  it is impossible to exaggerate the pleasure i took to be thus sitting at the same table with flora in the clothes of a gentleman at liberty and in the full possession of my spirits and resources of all of which i had need because it was necessary that i should support at the same time two opposite characters and at once play the cavalier and lively soldier for the eyes of ronald and to the ears of flora maintain the same profound and sentimental note that i had already sounded  certainly there are days when all goes well with a man when his wit his digestion his mistress are in a conspiracy to spoil him and even the weather smiles upon his wishes  i will only say of myself upon that evening that i surpassed my expectations and was privileged to delight my hosts little by little they forgot their terrors and i my caution until at last we were brought back to earth by a catastrophe that might very easily have been foreseen but was not the less astonishing to us when it occurred  i had filled all the glasses  ‘i have a toast to propose’ i whispered ‘or rather three but all so inextricably interwoven that they will not bear dividing  i wish first to drink to the health of a brave and therefore a generous enemy  he found me disarmed a fugitive and helpless  like the lion he disdained so poor a triumph and when he might have vindicated an easy valour he preferred to make a friend  i wish that we should next drink to a fairer and a more tender foe  she found me in prison she cheered me with a priceless sympathy what she has done since i know she has done in mercy and i only pray—i dare scarce hope—her mercy may prove to have been merciful  and i wish to conjoin with these for the first and perhaps the last time the health—and i fear i may already say the memory—of one who has fought not always without success against the soldiers of your nation but who came here vanquished already only to be vanquished again by the loyal hand of the one by the unforgettable eyes of the other’  it is to be feared i may have lent at times a certain resonancy to my voice it is to be feared that ronald who was none the better for his own hospitality may have set down his glass with something of a clang whatever may have been the cause at least i had scarce finished my compliment before we were aware of a thump upon the ceiling overhead  it was to be thought some very solid body had descended to the floor from the level possibly of a bed  i have never seen consternation painted in more lively colours than on the faces of my hosts  it was proposed to smuggle me forth into the garden or to conceal my form under a horsehair sofa which stood against the wall  for the first expedient as was now plain by the approaching footsteps there was no longer time from the second i recoiled with indignation  ‘my dear creatures’ said i ‘let us die but do not let us be ridiculous’  the words were still upon my lips when the door opened and my friend of the gold eyeglass appeared a memorable figure on the threshold  in one hand she bore a bedroom candlestick in the other with the steadiness of a dragoon a horsepistol  she was wound about in shawls which did not wholly conceal the candid fabric of her nightdress and surmounted by a nightcap of portentous architecture  thus accoutred she made her entrance laid down the candle and pistol as no longer called for looked about the room with a silence more eloquent than oaths and then in a thrilling voice—‘to whom have i the pleasure’ she said addressing me with a ghost of a bow  ‘madam i am charmed i am sure’ said i  ‘the story is a little long and our meeting however welcome was for the moment entirely unexpected by myself  i am sure—’ but here i found i was quite sure of nothing and tried again  ‘i have the honour’ i began and found i had the honour to be only exceedingly confused  with that i threw myself outright upon her mercy  ‘madam i must be more frank with you’ i resumed  ‘you have already proved your charity and compassion for the french prisoners i am one of these and if my appearance be not too much changed you may even yet recognise in me that oddity who had the good fortune more than once to make you smile’  still gazing upon me through her glass she uttered an uncompromising grunt and then turning to her niece—‘flora’ said she ‘how comes he here’  the culprits poured out for a while an antiphony of explanations which died out at last in a miserable silence  ‘i think at least you might have told your aunt’ she snorted  ‘madam’ i interposed ‘they were about to do so  it is my fault if it be not done already  but i made it my prayer that your slumbers might be respected and this necessary formula of my presentation should be delayed until tomorrow in the morning’  the old lady regarded me with undissembled incredulity to which i was able to find no better repartee than a profound and i trust graceful reverence  ‘french prisoners are very well in their place’ she said ‘but i cannot see that their place is in my private diningroom’  ‘madam’ said i ‘i hope it may be said without offence but except the castle of edinburgh i cannot think upon the spot from which i would so readily be absent’  at this to my relief i thought i could perceive a vestige of a smile to steal upon that iron countenance and to be bitten immediately in  ‘and if it is a fair question what do they call ye’ she asked  ‘at your service the vicomte anne de styves’ said i  ‘mosha the viscount’ said she ‘i am afraid you do us plain people a great deal too much honour’  ‘my dear lady’ said i ‘let us be serious for a moment  what was i to do  where was i to go  and how can you be angry with these benevolent children who took pity on one so unfortunate as myself  your humble servant is no such terrific adventurer that you should come out against him with horsepistol and’—smiling—‘bedroom candlesticks  it is but a young gentleman in extreme distress hunted upon every side and asking no more than to escape from his pursuers  i know your character i read it in your face’—the heart trembled in my body as i said these daring words  ‘there are unhappy english prisoners in france at this day perhaps at this hour  perhaps at this hour they kneel as i do they take the hand of her who might conceal and assist them they press it to their lips as i do—’  ‘here here’ cried the old lady breaking from my solicitations ‘behave yourself before folk  saw ever anyone the match of that  and on earth my dears what are we to do with him’  ‘pack him off my dear lady’ said i ‘pack off the impudent fellow doublequick  and if it may be and if your good heart allows it help him a little on the way he has to go’  ‘what’s this pie’ she cried stridently  ‘where is this pie from flora’  no answer was vouchsafed by my unfortunate and i may say extinct accomplices  ‘is that my port’ she pursued  ‘hough  will somebody give me a glass of my port wine’  i made haste to serve her  she looked at me over the rim with an extraordinary expression  ‘i hope ye liked it’ said she  ‘it is even a magnificent wine’ said i  ‘aweel it was my father laid it down’ said she  ‘there were few knew more about port wine than my father god rest him’  she settled herself in a chair with an alarming air of resolution  ‘and so there is some particular direction that you wish to go in’ said she  ‘o’ said i following her example ‘i am by no means such a vagrant as you suppose  i have good friends if i could get to them for which all i want is to be once clear of scotland and i have money for the road’ and i produced my bundle  ‘english banknotes’ she said  ‘that’s not very handy for scotland it’s been some fool of an englishman that’s given you these i’m thinking  how much is it’  ‘i declare to heaven i never thought to count’ i exclaimed  ‘but that is soon remedied’  and i counted out ten notes of ten pound each all in the name of abraham newlands and five bills of country bankers for as many guineas  ‘one hundred and twenty six pound five’ cried the old lady  ‘and you carry such a sum about you and have not so much as counted it  if you are not a thief you must allow you are very thieflike’  ‘and yet madam the money is legitimately mine’ said i  she took one of the bills and held it up  ‘is there any probability now that this could be traced’ she asked  ‘none i should suppose and if it were it would be no matter’ said i ‘with your usual penetration you guessed right  an englishman brought it me  it reached me through the hands of his english solicitor from my greatuncle the comte de kéroual de saintyves i believe the richest émigré in london’  ‘i can do no more than take your word for it’ said she  ‘and i trust madam not less’ said i  ‘well’ said she ‘at this rate the matter may be feasible  i will cash one of these fiveguinea bills less the exchange and give you silver and scots notes to bear you as far as the border  beyond that mosha the viscount you will have to depend upon yourself’  i could not but express a civil hesitation as to whether the amount would suffice in my case for so long a journey  ‘ay’ said she ‘but you havenae heard me out  for if you are not too fine a gentleman to travel with a pair of drovers i believe i have found the very thing and the lord forgive me for a treasonable old wife there are a couple stopping up by with the shepherdman at the farm tomorrow they will take the road for england probably by skriegh of day—and in my opinion you had best be travelling with the stots’ said she  ‘for heaven’s sake do not suppose me to be so effeminate a character’ i cried  ‘an old soldier of napoleon is certainly beyond suspicion  but dear lady to what end and how is the society of these excellent gentlemen supposed to help me’  ‘my dear sir’ said she ‘you do not at all understand your own predicament and must just leave your matters in the hands of those who do  i dare say you have never even heard tell of the droveroads or the drovers and i am certainly not going to sit up all night to explain it to you  suffice it that it is me who is arranging this affair—the more shame to me—and that is the way ye have to go  ronald’ she continued ‘away upby to the shepherds rowst them out of their beds and make it perfectly distinct that sim is not to leave till he has seen me’  ronald was nothing loath to escape from his aunt’s neighbourhood and left the room and the cottage with a silent expedition that was more like flight than mere obedience  meanwhile the old lady turned to her niece  ‘and i would like to know what we are to do with him the night’ she cried  ‘ronald and i meant to put him in the henhouse’ said the encrimsoned flora  ‘and i can tell you he is to go to no such a place’ replied the aunt ‘henhouse indeed  if a guest he is to be he shall sleep in no mortal henhouse  your room is the most fit i think if he will consent to occupy it on so great a suddenty  and as for you flora you shall sleep with me’  i could not help admiring the prudence and tact of this old dowager and of course it was not for me to make objections  ere i well knew how i was alone with a flat candlestick which is not the most sympathetic of companions and stood studying the snuff in a frame of mind between triumph and chagrin  all had gone well with my flight the masterful lady who had arrogated to herself the arrangement of the details gave me every confidence and i saw myself already arriving at my uncle’s door but alas it was another story with my love affair  i had seen and spoken with her alone i had ventured boldly i had been not ill received i had seen her change colour had enjoyed the undissembled kindness of her eyes and now in a moment down comes upon the scene that apocalyptic figure with the nightcap and the horsepistol and with the very wind of her coming behold me separated from my love  gratitude and admiration contended in my breast with the extreme of natural rancour  my appearance in her house at past midnight had an air i could not disguise it from myself that was insolent and underhand and could not but minister to the worst suspicions  and the old lady had taken it well  her generosity was no more to be called in question than her courage and i was afraid that her intelligence would be found to match certainly miss flora had to support some shrewd looks and certainly she had been troubled  i could see but the one way before me to profit by an excellent bed to try to sleep soon to be stirring early and to hope for some renewed occasion in the morning  to have said so much and yet to say no more to go out into the world upon so halfhearted a parting was more than i could accept  it is my belief that the benevolent fiend sat up all night to baulk me she was at my bedside with a candle long ere day roused me laid out for me a damnable misfit of clothes and bade me pack my own which were wholly unsuited to the journey in a bundle  sore grudging i arrayed myself in a suit of some country fabric as delicate as sackcloth and about as becoming as a shroud and on coming forth found the dragon had prepared for me a hearty breakfast  she took the head of the table poured out the tea and entertained me as i ate with a great deal of good sense and a conspicuous lack of charm  how often did i not regret the change—how often compare her and condemn her in the comparison with her charming niece  but if my entertainer was not beautiful she had certainly been busy in my interest  already she was in communication with my destined fellowtravellers and the device on which she had struck appeared entirely suitable  i was a young englishman who had outrun the constable warrants were out against me in scotland and it had become needful i should pass the border without loss of time and privately  ‘i have given a very good account of you’ said she ‘which i hope you may justify  i told them there was nothing against you beyond the fact that you were put to the haw if that is the right word for debt’  ‘i pray god you have the expression incorrectly ma’am’ said i  ‘i do not give myself out for a person easily alarmed but you must admit there is something barbarous and mediaeval in the sound well qualified to startle a poor foreigner’  ‘it is the name of a process in scots law and need alarm no honest man’ said she  ‘but you are a very idleminded young gentleman you must still have your joke i see i only hope you will have no cause to regret it’  ‘i pray you not to suppose because i speak lightly that i do not feel deeply’ said i  ‘your kindness has quite conquered me i lay myself at your disposition i beg you to believe with real tenderness i pray you to consider me from henceforth as the most devoted of your friends’  ‘well well’ she said ‘here comes your devoted friend the drover  i’m thinking he will be eager for the road and i will not be easy myself till i see you well off the premises and the dishes washed before my servantwoman wakes  praise god we have gotten one that is a treasure at the sleeping’  the morning was already beginning to be blue in the trees of the garden and to put to shame the candle by which i had breakfasted  the lady rose from table and i had no choice but to follow her example  all the time i was beating my brains for any means by which i should be able to get a word apart with flora or find the time to write her a billet  the windows had been open while i breakfasted i suppose to ventilate the room from any traces of my passage there and master ronald appearing on the front lawn my ogre leaned forth to address him  ‘ronald’ she said ‘wasn’t that sim that went by the wall’  i snatched my advantage  right at her back there was pen ink and paper laid out  i wrote ‘i love you’ and before i had time to write more or so much as to blot what i had written i was again under the guns of the gold eyeglasses  ‘it’s time’ she began and then as she observed my occupation ‘umph’ she broke off  ‘ye have something to write’ she demanded  ‘some notes madam’ said i bowing with alacrity  ‘notes’ she said ‘or a note’  ‘there is doubtless some finesse of the english language that i do not comprehend’ said i  ‘i’ll contrive however to make my meaning very plain to ye mosha le viscount’ she continued  ‘i suppose you desire to be considered a gentleman’  ‘can you doubt it madam’ said i  ‘i doubt very much at least whether you go to the right way about it’ she said  ‘you have come here to me i cannot very well say how i think you will admit you owe me some thanks if it was only for the breakfast i made ye  but what are you to me  a waif young man not so far to seek for looks and manners with some english notes in your pocket and a price upon your head  i am a lady i have been your hostess with however little will and i desire that this random acquaintance of yours with my family will cease and determine’  i believe i must have coloured  ‘madam’ said i ‘the notes are of no importance and your least pleasure ought certainly to be my law  you have felt and you have been pleased to express a doubt of me  i tear them up’  which you may be sure i did thoroughly  ‘there’s a good lad’ said the dragon and immediately led the way to the front lawn  the brother and sister were both waiting us here and as well as i could make out in the imperfect light bore every appearance of having passed through a rather cruel experience  ronald seemed ashamed to so much as catch my eye in the presence of his aunt and was the picture of embarrassment  as for flora she had scarce the time to cast me one look before the dragon took her by the arm and began to march across the garden in the extreme first glimmer of the dawn without exchanging speech  ronald and i followed in equal silence  there was a door in that same high wall on the top of which i had sat perched no longer gone than yesterday morning  this the old lady set open with a key and on the other side we were aware of a roughlooking thickset man leaning with his arms through which was passed a formidable staff on a drystone dyke  him the old lady immediately addressed  ‘sim’ said she ‘this is the young gentleman’  sim replied with an inarticulate grumble of sound and a movement of one arm and his head which did duty for a salutation  ‘now mr st ives’ said the old lady ‘it’s high time for you to be taking the road  but first of all let me give the change of your fiveguinea bill  here are four pounds of it in british linen notes and the balance in small silver less sixpence  some charge a shilling i believe but i have given you the benefit of the doubt  see and guide it with all the sense that you possess’  ‘and here mr st ives’ said flora speaking for the first time ‘is a plaid which you will find quite necessary on so rough a journey  i hope you will take it from the hands of a scotch friend’ she added and her voice trembled  ‘genuine holly i cut it myself’ said ronald and gave me as good a cudgel as a man could wish for in a row  the formality of these gifts and the waiting figure of the driver told me loudly that i must be gone  i dropped on one knee and bade farewell to the aunt kissing her hand  i did the like—but with how different a passion—to her niece as for the boy i took him to my arms and embraced him with a cordiality that seemed to strike him speechless  ‘farewell’ and ‘farewell’ i said  ‘i shall never forget my friends  keep me sometimes in memory  farewell’ with that i turned my back and began to walk away and had scarce done so when i heard the door in the high wall close behind me  of course this was the aunt’s doing and of course if i know anything of human character she would not let me go without some tart expressions  i declare even if i had heard them i should not have minded in the least for i was quite persuaded that whatever admirers i might be leaving behind me in swanston cottage the aunt was not the least sincere     chapter x—the drovers   it took me a little effort to come abreast of my new companion for though he walked with an ugly roll and no great appearance of speed he could cover the around at a good rate when he wanted to  each looked at the other i with natural curiosity he with a great appearance of distaste  i have heard since that his heart was entirely set against me he had seen me kneel to the ladies and diagnosed me for a ‘gesterin’ eediot’  ‘so ye’re for england are ye’ said he  i told him yes  ‘weel there’s waur places i believe’ was his reply and he relapsed into a silence which was not broken during a quarter of an hour of steady walking  this interval brought us to the foot of a bare green valley which wound upwards and backwards among the hills  a little stream came down the midst and made a succession of clear pools near by the lowest of which i was aware of a drove of shaggy cattle and a man who seemed the very counterpart of mr sim making a breakfast upon bread and cheese  this second drover whose name proved to be candlish rose on our approach  ‘here’s a mannie that’s to gang through with us’ said sim  ‘it was the auld wife gilchrist wanted it’  ‘aweel aweel’ said the other and presently remembering his manners and looking on me with a solemn grin ‘a fine day’ says he  i agreed with him and asked him how he did  ‘brawly’ was the reply and without further civilities the pair proceeded to get the cattle under way  this as well as almost all the herding was the work of a pair of comely and intelligent dogs directed by sim or candlish in little more than monosyllables  presently we were ascending the side of the mountain by a rude green track whose presence i had not hitherto observed  a continual sound of munching and the crying of a great quantity of moor birds accompanied our progress which the deliberate pace and perennial appetite of the cattle rendered wearisomely slow  in the midst my two conductors marched in a contented silence that i could not but admire  the more i looked at them the more i was impressed by their absurd resemblance to each other  they were dressed in the same coarse homespun carried similar sticks were equally begrimed about the nose with snuff and each wound in an identical plaid of what is called the shepherd’s tartan  in a back view they might be described as indistinguishable and even from the front they were much alike  an incredible coincidence of humours augmented the impression thrice and four times i attempted to pave the way for some exchange of thought sentiment or—at the least of it—human words  an ay or an nhm was the sole return and the topic died on the hillside without echo  i can never deny that i was chagrined and when after a little more walking sim turned towards me and offered me a ram’s horn of snuff with the question ‘do ye use it’ i answered with some animation ‘faith sir i would use pepper to introduce a little cordiality’  but even this sally failed to reach or at least failed to soften my companions  at this rate we came to the summit of a ridge and saw the track descend in front of us abruptly into a desert vale about a league in length and closed at the farther end by no less barren hilltops  upon this point of vantage sim came to a halt took off his hat and mopped his brow  ‘weel’ he said ‘here we’re at the top o’ howden’  ‘the top o’ howden sure eneuch’ said candlish  ‘mr st ivey are ye dry’ said the first  ‘now really’ said i ‘is not this satan reproving sin’  ‘what ails ye man’ said he  ‘i’m offerin’ ye a dram’  ‘oh if it be anything to drink’ said i ‘i am as dry as my neighbours’  whereupon sim produced from the corner of his plaid a black bottle and we all drank and pledged each other  i found these gentlemen followed upon such occasions an invariable etiquette which you may be certain i made haste to imitate  each wiped his mouth with the back of his left hand held up the bottle in his right remarked with emphasis ‘here’s to ye’ and swallowed as much of the spirit as his fancy prompted  this little ceremony which was the nearest thing to manners i could perceive in either of my companions was repeated at becoming intervals generally after an ascent  occasionally we shared a mouthful of ewemilk cheese and an inglorious form of bread which i understood but am far from engaging my honour on the point to be called ‘shearer’s bannock’  and that may be said to have concluded our whole active intercourse for the first day  i had the more occasion to remark the extraordinarily desolate nature of that country through which the drove road continued hour after hour and even day after day to wind  a continual succession of insignificant shaggy hills divided by the course of ten thousand brooks through which we had to wade or by the side of which we encamped at night infinite perspectives of heather infinite quantities of moorfowl here and there by a stream side small and pretty clumps of willows or the silver birch here and there the ruins of ancient and inconsiderable fortresses—made the unchanging characters of the scene  occasionally but only in the distance we could perceive the smoke of a small town or of an isolated farmhouse or cottage on the moors more often a flock of sheep and its attendant shepherd or a rude field of agriculture perhaps not yet harvested  with these alleviations we might almost be said to pass through an unbroken desert—sure one of the most impoverished in europe and when i recalled to mind that we were yet but a few leagues from the chief city where the law courts sat every day with a press of business soldiers garrisoned the castle and men of admitted parts were carrying on the practice of letters and the investigations of science it gave me a singular view of that poor barren and yet illustrious country through which i travelled  still more perhaps did it commend the wisdom of miss gilchrist in sending me with these uncouth companions and by this unfrequented path  my itinerary is by no means clear to me the names and distances i never clearly knew and have now wholly forgotten and this is the more to be regretted as there is no doubt that in the course of those days i must have passed and camped among sites which have been rendered illustrious by the pen of walter scott  nay more i am of opinion that i was still more favoured by fortune and have actually met and spoken with that inimitable author  our encounter was of a tall stoutish elderly gentleman a little grizzled and of a rugged but cheerful and engaging countenance  he sat on a hill pony wrapped in a plaid over his green coat and was accompanied by a horsewoman his daughter a young lady of the most charming appearance  they overtook us on a stretch of heath reined up as they came alongside and accompanied us for perhaps a quarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the hillsides to our left  great was my amazement to find the unconquerable mr sim thaw immediately on the accost of this strange gentleman who hailed him with a ready familiarity proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of droving and the prices of cattle and did not disdain to take a pinch from the inevitable ram’s horn  presently i was aware that the stranger’s eye was directed on myself and there ensued a conversation some of which i could not help overhearing at the time and the rest have pieced together more or less plausibly from the report of sim  ‘surely that must be an amateur drover ye have gotten there’ the gentleman seems to have asked  sim replied i was a young gentleman that had a reason of his own to travel privately  ‘well well ye must tell me nothing of that  i am in the law you know and tace is the latin for a candle’ answered the gentleman  ‘but i hope it’s nothing bad’  sim told him it was no more than debt  ‘oh lord if that be all’ cried the gentleman and turning to myself ‘well sir’ he added ‘i understand you are taking a tramp through our forest here for the pleasure of the thing’  ‘why yes sir’ said i ‘and i must say i am very well entertained’  ‘i envy you’ said he  ‘i have jogged many miles of it myself when i was younger  my youth lies buried about here under every heatherbush like the soul of the licentiate lucius  but you should have a guide  the pleasure of this country is much in the legends which grow as plentiful as blackberries’  and directing my attention to a little fragment of a broken wall no greater than a tombstone he told me for an example a story of its earlier inhabitants  years after it chanced that i was one day diverting myself with a waverley novel when what should i come upon but the identical narrative of my greencoated gentleman upon the moors in a moment the scene the tones of his voice his northern accent and the very aspect of the earth and sky and temperature of the weather flashed back into my mind with the reality of dreams  the unknown in the greencoat had been the great unknown  i had met scott i had heard a story from his lips i should have been able to write to claim acquaintance to tell him that his legend still tingled in my ears  but the discovery came too late and the great man had already succumbed under the load of his honours and misfortunes  presently after giving us a cigar apiece scott bade us farewell and disappeared with his daughter over the hills  and when i applied to sim for information his answer of ‘the shirra man  a’body kens the shirra’ told me unfortunately nothing  a more considerable adventure falls to be related  we were now near the border  we had travelled for long upon the track beaten and browsed by a million herds our predecessors and had seen no vestige of that traffic which had created it  it was early in the morning when we at last perceived drawing near to the drove road but still at a distance of about half a league a second caravan similar to but larger than our own  the liveliest excitement was at once exhibited by both my comrades they climbed hillocks they studied the approaching drove from under their hand they consulted each other with an appearance of alarm that seemed to me extraordinary  i had learned by this time that their standoff manners implied at least no active enmity and i made bold to ask them what was wrong  ‘bad yins’ was sim’s emphatic answer  all day the dogs were kept unsparingly on the alert and the drove pushed forward at a very unusual and seemingly unwelcome speed  all day sim and candlish with a more than ordinary expenditure both of snuff and of words continued to debate the position  it seems that they had recognised two of our neighbours on the road—one faa and another by the name of gillies  whether there was an old feud between them still unsettled i could never learn but sim and candlish were prepared for every degree of fraud or violence at their hands  candlish repeatedly congratulated himself on having left ‘the watch at home with the mistress’ and sim perpetually brandished his cudgel and cursed his illfortune that it should be sprung  ‘i willna care a damn to gie the daashed scoon’rel a fair clout wi’ it’ he said  ‘the daashed thing micht come sindry in ma hand’  ‘well gentlemen’ said i ‘suppose they do come on i think we can give a very good account of them’  and i made my piece of holly ronald’s gift the value of which i now appreciated sing about my head  ‘ay man  are ye stench’ inquired sim with a gleam of approval in his wooden countenance  the same evening somewhat wearied with our daylong expedition we encamped on a little verdant mound from the midst of which there welled a spring of clear water scarce great enough to wash the hands in  we had made our meal and lain down but were not yet asleep when a growl from one of the collies set us on the alert  all three sat up and on a second impulse all lay down again but now with our cudgels ready  a man must be an alien and an outlaw an old soldier and a young man in the bargain to take adventure easily  with no idea as to the rights of the quarrel or the probable consequences of the encounter i was as ready to take part with my two drovers as ever to fall in line on the morning of a battle  presently there leaped three men out of the heather we had scarce time to get to our feet before we were assailed and in a moment each one of us was engaged with an adversary whom the deepening twilight scarce permitted him to see  how the battle sped in other quarters i am in no position to describe  the rogue that fell to my share was exceedingly agile and expert with his weapon had and held me at a disadvantage from the first assault forced me to give ground continually and at last in mere selfdefence to let him have the point  it struck him in the throat and he went down like a ninepin and moved no more  it seemed this was the signal for the engagement to be discontinued  the other combatants separated at once our foes were suffered without molestation to lift up and bear away their fallen comrade so that i perceived this sort of war to be not wholly without laws of chivalry and perhaps rather to partake of the character of a tournament than of a battle à outrance  there was no doubt at least that i was supposed to have pushed the affair too seriously  our friends the enemy removed their wounded companion with undisguised consternation and they were no sooner over the top of the brae than sim and candlish roused up their wearied drove and set forth on a night march  ‘i’m thinking faa’s unco bad’ said the one  ‘ay’ said the other ‘he lookit dooms gash’  ‘he did that’ said the first  and their weary silence fell upon them again  presently sim turned to me  ‘ye’re unco ready with the stick’ said he  ‘too ready i’m afraid’ said i  ‘i am afraid mr faa if that be his name has got his gruel’  ‘weel i wouldnae wonder’ replied sim  ‘and what is likely to happen’ i inquired  ‘aweel’ said sim snuffing profoundly ‘if i were to offer an opeenion it would not be conscientious  for the plain fac’ is mr st ivy that i div not ken  we have had crackit heids—and rowth of them—ere now and we have had a broken leg or maybe twa and the like of that we drover bodies make a kind of a practice like to keep among oursel’s  but a corp we have none of us ever had to deal with and i could set nae leemit to what gillies micht consider proper in the affair  forbye that he would be in raither a hobble himsel’ if he was to gang hame wantin’ faa  folk are awfu’ throng with their questions and parteecularly when they’re no wantit’  ‘that’s a fac’’ said candlish  i considered this prospect ruefully and then making the best of it ‘upon all which accounts’ said i ‘the best will be to get across the border and there separate  if you are troubled you can very truly put the blame upon your late companion and if i am pursued i must just try to keep out of the way’  ‘mr st ivy’ said sim with something resembling enthusiasm ‘no’ a word mair  i have met in wi’ mony kinds o’ gentry ere now i hae seen o’ them that was the tae thing and i hae seen o’ them that was the tither but the wale of a gentleman like you i have no sae very frequently seen the bate of’  our night march was accordingly pursued with unremitting diligence  the stars paled the east whitened and we were still both dogs and men toiling after the wearied cattle  again and again sim and candlish lamented the necessity it was ‘fair ruin on the bestial’ they declared but the thought of a judge and a scaffold hunted them ever forward  i myself was not so much to be pitied  all that night and during the whole of the little that remained before us of our conjunct journey i enjoyed a new pleasure the reward of my prowess in the now loosened tongue of mr sim  candlish was still obdurately taciturn it was the man’s nature but sim having finally appraised and approved me displayed without reticence a rather garrulous habit of mind and a pretty talent for narration  the pair were old and close companions coexisting in these endless moors in a brotherhood of silence such as i have heard attributed to the trappers of the west  it seems absurd to mention love in connection with so ugly and snuffy a couple at least their trust was absolute and they entertained a surprising admiration for each other’s qualities candlish exclaiming that sim was ‘grand company’ and sim frequently assuring me in an aside that for ‘a rale auld stench bitch there was nae the bate of candlish in braid scotland’  the two dogs appeared to be entirely included in this family compact and i remarked that their exploits and traits of character were constantly and minutely observed by the two masters  dog stories particularly abounded with them and not only the dogs of the present but those of the past contributed their quota  ‘but that was naething’ sim would begin ‘there was a herd in manar they ca’d him tweedie—ye’ll mind tweedie can’lish’  ‘fine that’ said candlish  ‘aweel tweedie had a dog—’  the story i have forgotten i dare say it was dull and i suspect it was not true but indeed my travels with the drove rendered me indulgent and perhaps even credulous in the matter of dog stories beautiful indefatigable beings as i saw them at the end of a long day’s journey frisking barking bounding striking attitudes slanting a bushy tail manifestly playing to the spectator’s eye manifestly rejoicing in their grace and beauty—and turned to observe sim and candlish unornamentally plodding in the rear with the plaids about their bowed shoulders and the drop at their snuffy nose—i thought i would rather claim kinship with the dogs than with the men  my sympathy was unreturned in their eyes i was a creature light as air and they would scarce spare me the time for a perfunctory caress or perhaps a hasty lap of the wet tongue ere they were back again in sedulous attendance on those dingy deities their masters—and their masters as like as not damning their stupidity  altogether the last hours of our tramp were infinitely the most agreeable to me and i believe to all of us and by the time we came to separate there had grown up a certain familiarity and mutual esteem that made the parting harder  it took place about four of the afternoon on a bare hillside from which i could see the ribbon of the great north road henceforth to be my conductor  i asked what was to pay  ‘naething’ replied sim  ‘what in the name of folly is this’ i exclaimed  ‘you have led me you have fed me you have filled me full of whisky and now you will take nothing’  ‘ye see we indentit for that’ replied sim   ‘indented’ i repeated ‘what does the man mean’  ‘mr st ivy’ said sim ‘this is a maitter entirely between candlish and me and the auld wife gilchrist  you had naething to say to it weel ye can have naething to do with it then’  ‘my good man’ said i ‘i can allow myself to be placed in no such ridiculous position  mrs gilchrist is nothing to me and i refuse to be her debtor’  ‘i dinna exac’ly see what way ye’re gaun to help it’ observed my drover  ‘by paying you here and now’ said i  ‘there’s aye twa to a bargain mr st ives’ said he  ‘you mean that you will not take it’ said i  ‘there or thereabout’ said he  ‘forbye that it would set ye a heap better to keep your siller for them you awe it to  ye’re young mr st ivy and thoughtless but it’s my belief that wi’ care and circumspection ye may yet do credit to yoursel’  but just you bear this in mind that him that awes siller should never gie siller’  well what was there to say  i accepted his rebuke and bidding the pair farewell set off alone upon my southward way  ‘mr st ivy’ was the last word of sim ‘i was never muckle ta’en up in englishry but i think that i really ought to say that ye seem to me to have the makings of quite a decent lad’     chapter xi—the great north road   it chanced that as i went down the hill these last words of my friend the drover echoed not unfruitfully in my head  i had never told these men the least particulars as to my race or fortune as it was a part and the best part of their civility to ask no questions yet they had dubbed me without hesitation english  some strangeness in the accent they had doubtless thus explained  and it occurred to me that if i could pass in scotland for an englishman i might be able to reverse the process and pass in england for a scot  i thought if i was pushed to it i could make a struggle to imitate the brogue after my experience with candlish and sim i had a rich provision of outlandish words at my command and i felt i could tell the tale of tweedie’s dog so as to deceive a native at the same time i was afraid my name of st ives was scarcely suitable till i remembered there was a town so called in the province of cornwall thought i might yet be glad to claim it for my place of origin and decided for a cornish family and a scots education  for a trade as i was equally ignorant of all and as the most innocent might at any moment be the means of my exposure it was best to pretend to none  and i dubbed myself a young gentleman of a sufficient fortune and an idle curious habit of mind rambling the country at my own charges in quest of health information and merry adventures  at newcastle which was the first town i reached i completed my preparations for the part before going to the inn by the purchase of a knapsack and a pair of leathern gaiters  my plaid i continued to wear from sentiment  it was warm useful to sleep in if i were again benighted and i had discovered it to be not unbecoming for a man of gallant carriage  thus equipped i supported my character of the lighthearted pedestrian not amiss  surprise was indeed expressed that i should have selected such a season of the year but i pleaded some delays of business and smilingly claimed to be an eccentric  the devil was in it i would say if any season of the year was not good enough for me i was not made of sugar i was no mollycoddle to be afraid of an illaired bed or a sprinkle of snow and i would knock upon the table with my fist and call for t’other bottle like the noisy and freehearted young gentleman i was  it was my policy if i may so express myself to talk much and say little  at the inn tables the country the state of the roads the business interest of those who sat down with me and the course of public events afforded me a considerable field in which i might discourse at large and still communicate no information about myself  there was no one with less air of reticence i plunged into my company up to the neck and i had a long cockandbull story of an aunt of mine which must have convinced the most suspicious of my innocence ‘what’ they would have said ‘that young ass to be concealing anything why he has deafened me with an aunt of his until my head aches  he only wants you should give him a line and he would tell you his whole descent from adam downward and his whole private fortune to the last shilling’ a responsible solid fellow was even so much moved by pity for my inexperience as to give me a word or two of good advice that i was but a young man after all—i had at this time a deceptive air of youth that made me easily pass for oneandtwenty and was in the circumstances worth a fortune—that the company at inns was very mingled that i should do well to be more careful and the like to all which i made answer that i meant no harm myself and expected none from others or the devil was in it ‘you are one of those dd prudent fellows that i could never abide with’ said i  ‘you are the kind of man that has a long head  that’s all the world my dear sir the longheads and the shorthorns  now i am a shorthorn’  ‘i doubt’ says he ‘that you will not go very far without getting sheared’  i offered to bet with him on that and he made off shaking his head  but my particular delight was to enlarge on politics and the war  none damned the french like me none was more bitter against the americans and when the northbound mail arrived crowned with holly and the coachman and guard hoarse with shouting victory i went even so far as to entertain the company to a bowl of punch which i compounded myself with no illiberal hand and doled out to such sentiments as the following—  ‘our glorious victory on the nivelle’  ‘lord wellington god bless him and may victory ever attend upon his arms’ and ‘soult poor devil and may he catch it again to the same tune’  never was oratory more applauded to the echo—never any one was more of the popular man than i  i promise you we made a night of it  some of the company supported each other with the assistance of boots to their respective bedchambers while the rest slept on the field of glory where we had left them and at the breakfast table the next morning there was an extraordinary assemblage of red eyes and shaking fists  i observed patriotism to burn much lower by daylight  let no one blame me for insensibility to the reverses of france  god knows how my heart raged how i longed to fall on that herd of swine and knock their heads together in the moment of their revelry  but you are to consider my own situation and its necessities also a certain lightheartedness eminently gallic which forms a leading trait in my character and leads me to throw myself into new circumstances with the spirit of a schoolboy  it is possible that i sometimes allowed this impish humour to carry me further than good taste approves and i was certainly punished for it once  this was in the episcopal city of durham  we sat down a considerable company to dinner most of us fine old vatted english tories of that class which is often so enthusiastic as to be inarticulate  i took and held the lead from the beginning and the talk having turned on the french in the peninsula i gave them authentic details on the authority of a cousin of mine an ensign of certain cannibal orgies in galicia in which no less a person than general caffarelli had taken a part  i always disliked that commander who once ordered me under arrest for insubordination and it is possible that a spice of vengeance added to the rigour of my picture  i have forgotten the details no doubt they were highcoloured  no doubt i rejoiced to fool these jolterheads and no doubt the sense of security that i drank from their dull gasping faces encouraged me to proceed extremely far  and for my sins there was one silent little man at table who took my story at the true value  it was from no sense of humour to which he was quite dead  it was from no particular intelligence for he had not any  the bond of sympathy of all things in the world had rendered him clairvoyant  dinner was no sooner done than i strolled forth into the streets with some design of viewing the cathedral and the little man was silently at my heels  a few doors from the inn in a dark place of the street i was aware of a touch on my arm turned suddenly and found him looking up at me with eyes pathetically bright  ‘i beg your pardon sir but that story of yours was particularly rich he—he  particularly racy’ said he  ‘i tell you sir i took you wholly  i smoked you  i believe you and i sir if we had a chance to talk would find we had a good many opinions in common  here is the “blue bell” a very comfortable place  they draw good ale sir  would you be so condescending as to share a pot with me’  there was something so ambiguous and secret in the little man’s perpetual signalling that i confess my curiosity was much aroused  blaming myself even as i did so for the indiscretion i embraced his proposal and we were soon face to face over a tankard of mulled ale  he lowered his voice to the least attenuation of a whisper  ‘here sir’ said he ‘is to the great man  i think you take me  no’ he leaned forward till our noses touched  ‘here is to the emperor’ said he  i was extremely embarrassed and in spite of the creature’s innocent appearance more than half alarmed  i thought him too ingenious and indeed too daring for a spy  yet if he were honest he must be a man of extraordinary indiscretion and therefore very unfit to be encouraged by an escaped prisoner  i took a half course accordingly—accepted his toast in silence and drank it without enthusiasm  he proceeded to abound in the praises of napoleon such as i had never heard in france or at least only on the lips of officials paid to offer them  ‘and this caffarelli now’ he pursued ‘he is a splendid fellow too is he not  i have not heard vastly much of him myself  no details sir—no details  we labour under huge difficulties here as to unbiassed information’  ‘i believe i have heard the same complaint in other countries’ i could not help remarking  ‘but as to caffarelli he is neither lame nor blind he has two legs and a nose in the middle of his face  and i care as much about him as you care for the dead body of mr perceval’  he studied me with glowing eyes  ‘you cannot deceive me’ he cried  ‘you have served under him  you are a frenchman  i hold by the hand at last one of that noble race the pioneers of the glorious principles of liberty and brotherhood  hush no it is all right  i thought there had been somebody at the door  in this wretched enslaved country we dare not even call our souls our own the spy and the hangman sir—the spy and the hangman  and yet there is a candle burning too  the good leaven is working sir—working underneath even in this town there are a few brave spirits who meet every wednesday  you must stay over a day or so and join us  we do not use this house  another and a quieter  they draw fine ale however—fair mild ale  you will find yourself among friends among brothers  you will hear some very daring sentiments expressed’ he cried expanding his small chest  ‘monarchy christianity—all the trappings of a bloated past—the free confraternity of durham and tyneside deride’  here was a devil of a prospect for a gentleman whose whole design was to avoid observation  the free confraternity had no charms for me daring sentiments were no part of my baggage and i tried instead a little cold water  ‘you seem to forget sir that my emperor has reestablished christianity’ i observed  ‘ah sir but that was policy’ he exclaimed  ‘you do not understand napoleon  i have followed his whole career  i can explain his policy from first to last  now for instance in the peninsula on which you were so very amusing if you will come to a friend’s house who has a map of spain i can make the whole course of the war quite clear to you i venture to say in half an hour’  this was intolerable  of the two extremes i found i preferred the british tory and making an appointment for the morrow i pleaded sudden headache escaped to the inn packed my knapsack and fled about nine at night from this accursed neighbourhood  it was cold starry and clear and the road dry with a touch of frost  for all that i had not the smallest intention to make a long stage of it and about ten o’clock spying on the righthand side of the way the lighted windows of an alehouse i determined to bait there for the night  it was against my principle which was to frequent only the dearest inns and the misadventure that befell me was sufficient to make me more particular in the future  a large company was assembled in the parlour which was heavy with clouds of tobacco smoke and brightly lighted up by a roaring fire of coal  hard by the chimney stood a vacant chair in what i thought an enviable situation whether for warmth or the pleasure of society and i was about to take it when the nearest of the company stopped me with his hand  ‘beg thy pardon sir’ said he ‘but that there chair belongs to a british soldier’  a chorus of voices enforced and explained  it was one of lord wellington’s heroes  he had been wounded under rowland hill  he was colbourne’s righthand man  in short this favoured individual appeared to have served with every separate corps and under every individual general in the peninsula  of course i apologised  i had not known  the devil was in it if a soldier had not a right to the best in england  and with that sentiment which was loudly applauded i found a corner of a bench and awaited with some hopes of entertainment the return of the hero  he proved of course to be a private soldier  i say of course because no officer could possibly enjoy such heights of popularity  he had been wounded before san sebastian and still wore his arm in a sling what was a great deal worse for him every member of the company had been plying him with drink  his honest yokel’s countenance blazed as if with fever his eyes were glazed and looked the two ways and his feet stumbled as amidst a murmur of applause he returned to the midst of his admirers  two minutes afterwards i was again posting in the dark along the highway to explain which sudden movement of retreat i must trouble the reader with a reminiscence of my services  i lay one night with the outpickets in castile  we were in close touch with the enemy the usual orders had been issued against smoking fires and talk and both armies lay as quiet as mice when i saw the english sentinel opposite making a signal by holding up his musket  i repeated it and we both crept together in the dry bed of a stream which made the demarcation of the armies  it was wine he wanted of which we had a good provision and the english had quite run out  he gave me the money and i as was the custom left him my firelock in pledge and set off for the canteen  when i returned with a skin of wine behold it had pleased some uneasy devil of an english officer to withdraw the outposts  here was a situation with a vengeance and i looked for nothing but ridicule in the present and punishment in the future  doubtless our officers winked pretty hard at this interchange of courtesies but doubtless it would be impossible to wink at so gross a fault or rather so pitiable a misadventure as mine and you are to conceive me wandering in the plains of castile benighted charged with a wineskin for which i had no use and with no knowledge whatever of the whereabouts of my musket beyond that it was somewhere in my lord wellington’s army  but my englishman was either a very honest fellow or else extremely thirsty and at last contrived to advertise me of his new position  now the english sentry in castile and the wounded hero in the durham publichouse were one and the same person and if he had been a little less drunk or myself less lively in getting away the travels of m st ives might have come to an untimely end  i suppose this woke me up it stirred in me besides a spirit of opposition and in spite of cold darkness the highwaymen and the footpads i determined to walk right on till breakfasttime a happy resolution which enabled me to observe one of those traits of manners which at once depict a country and condemn it  it was near midnight when i saw a great way ahead of me the light of many torches presently after the sound of wheels reached me and the slow tread of feet and soon i had joined myself to the rear of a sordid silent and lugubrious procession such as we see in dreams  close on a hundred persons marched by torchlight in unbroken silence in their midst a cart and in the cart on an inclined platform the dead body of a man—the centrepiece of this solemnity the hero whose obsequies we were come forth at this unusual hour to celebrate  it was but a plain dingy old fellow of fifty or sixty his throat cut his shirt turned over as though to show the wound  blue trousers and brown socks completed his attire if we can talk so of the dead  he had a horrid look of a waxwork  in the tossing of the lights he seemed to make faces and mouths at us to frown and to be at times upon the point of speech  the cart with this shabby and tragic freight and surrounded by its silent escort and bright torches continued for some distance to creak along the highroad and i to follow it in amazement which was soon exchanged for horror  at the corner of a lane the procession stopped and as the torches ranged themselves along the hedgerowside i became aware of a grave dug in the midst of the thoroughfare and a provision of quicklime piled in the ditch  the cart was backed to the margin the body slung off the platform and dumped into the grave with an irreverent roughness  a sharpened stake had hitherto served it for a pillow  it was now withdrawn held in its place by several volunteers and a fellow with a heavy mallet the sound of which still haunts me at night drove it home through the bosom of the corpse the hole was filled with quicklime and the bystanders as if relieved of some oppression broke at once into a sound of whispered speech  my shirt stuck to me my heart had almost ceased beating and i found my tongue with difficulty  ‘i beg your pardon’ i gasped to a neighbour ‘what is this what has he done is it allowed’  ‘why where do you come from’ replied the man  ‘i am a traveller sir’ said i ‘and a total stranger in this part of the country  i had lost my way when i saw your torches and came by chance on this—this incredible scene  who was the man’  ‘a suicide’ said he  ‘ay he was a bad one was johnnie green’  it appeared this was a wretch who had committed many barbarous murders and being at last upon the point of discovery fell of his own hand  and the nightmare at the crossroads was the regular punishment according to the laws of england for an act which the romans honoured as a virtue whenever an englishman begins to prate of civilisation as indeed it’s a defect they are rather prone to i hear the measured blows of a mallet see the bystanders crowd with torches about the grave smile a little to myself in conscious superiority—and take a thimbleful of brandy for the stomach’s sake  i believe it must have been at my next stage for i remember going to bed extremely early that i came to the model of a good oldfashioned english inn and was attended on by the picture of a pretty chambermaid  we had a good many pleasant passages as she waited table or warmed my bed for me with a devil of a brass warming pan fully larger than herself and as she was no less pert than she was pretty she may be said to have given rather better than she took  i cannot tell why unless it were for the sake of her saucy eyes but i made her my confidante told her i was attached to a young lady in scotland and received the encouragement of her sympathy mingled and connected with a fair amount of rustic wit while i slept the downmail stopped for supper it chanced that one of the passengers left behind a copy of the edinburgh courant and the next morning my pretty chambermaid set the paper before me at breakfast with the remark that there was some news from my ladylove  i took it eagerly hoping to find some further word of our escape in which i was disappointed and i was about to lay it down when my eye fell on a paragraph immediately concerning me  faa was in hospital grievously sick and warrants were out for the arrest of sim and candlish  these two men had shown themselves very loyal to me  this trouble emerging the least i could do was to be guided by a similar loyalty to them suppose my visit to my uncle crowned with some success and my finances reestablished i determined i should immediately return to edinburgh put their case in the hands of a good lawyer and await events  so my mind was very lightly made up to what proved a mighty serious matter candlish and sim were all very well in their way and i do sincerely trust i should have been at some pains to help them had there been nothing else  but in truth my heart and my eyes were set on quite another matter and i received the news of their tribulation almost with joy  that is never a bad wind that blows where we want to go and you may be sure there was nothing unwelcome in a circumstance that carried me back to edinburgh and flora  from that hour i began to indulge myself with the making of imaginary scenes and interviews in which i confounded the aunt flattered ronald and now in the witty now in the sentimental manner declared my love and received the assurance of its return  by means of this exercise my resolution daily grew stronger until at last i had piled together such a mass of obstinacy as it would have taken a cataclysm of nature to subvert  ‘yes’ said i to the chambermaid ‘here is news of my ladylove indeed and very good news too’  all that day in the teeth of a keen winter wind i hugged myself in my plaid and it was as though her arms were flung around me     chapter xii—i follow a covered cart nearly to my destination   at last i began to draw near by reasonable stages to the neighbourhood of wakefield and the name of mr burchell fenn came to the top in my memory  this was the gentleman the reader may remember who made a trade of forwarding the escape of french prisoners  how he did so whether he had a signboard escapes forwarded apply within what he charged for his services or whether they were gratuitous and charitable were all matters of which i was at once ignorant and extremely curious thanks to my proficiency in english and mr romaine’s banknotes i was getting on swimmingly without him but the trouble was that i could not be easy till i had come to the bottom of these mysteries and it was my difficulty that i knew nothing of him beyond the name  i knew not his trade beyond that of forwarder of escapes—whether he lived in town or country whether he were rich or poor nor by what kind of address i was to gain his confidence  it would have a very bad appearance to go along the highwayside asking after a man of whom i could give so scanty an account and i should look like a fool indeed if i were to present myself at his door and find the police in occupation  the interest of the conundrum however tempted me and i turned aside from my direct road to pass by wakefield kept my ears pricked as i went for any mention of his name and relied for the rest on my good fortune  if luck who must certainly be feminine favoured me as far as to throw me in the man’s way i should owe the lady a candle if not i could very readily console myself  in this experimental humour and with so little to help me it was a miracle that i should have brought my enterprise to a good end and there are several saints in the calendar who might be happy to exchange with st ives  i had slept that night in a good inn at wakefield made my breakfast by candlelight with the passengers of an upcoach and set off in a very ill temper with myself and my surroundings  it was still early the air raw and cold the sun low and soon to disappear under a vast canopy of rainclouds that had begun to assemble in the northwest and from that quarter invaded the whole width of the heaven  already the rain fell in crystal rods already the whole face of the country sounded with the discharge of drains and ditches and i looked forward to a day of downpour and the hell of wet clothes in which particular i am as dainty as a cat  at a corner of the road and by the last glint of the drowning sun i spied a covered cart of a kind that i thought i had never seen before preceding me at the foot’s pace of jaded horses  anything is interesting to a pedestrian that can help him to forget the miseries of a day of rain and i bettered my pace and gradually overtook the vehicle  the nearer i came the more it puzzled me  it was much such a cart as i am told the calico printers use mounted on two wheels and furnished with a seat in front for the driver  the interior closed with a door and was of a bigness to contain a good load of calico or at a pinch and if it were necessary four or five persons  but indeed if human beings were meant to travel there they had my pity  they must travel in the dark for there was no sign of a window and they would be shaken all the way like a phial of doctor’s stuff for the cart was not only ungainly to look at—it was besides very imperfectly balanced on the one pair of wheels and pitched unconscionably  altogether if i had any glancing idea that the cart was really a carriage i had soon dismissed it but i was still inquisitive as to what it should contain and where it had come from  wheels and horses were splashed with many different colours of mud as though they had come far and across a considerable diversity of country  the driver continually and vainly plied his whip  it seemed to follow they had made a long perhaps an allnight stage and that the driver at that early hour of a little after eight in the morning already felt himself belated  i looked for the name of the proprietor on the shaft and started outright  fortune had favoured the careless it was burchell fenn  ‘a wet morning my man’ said i  the driver a loutish fellow shockheaded and turnipfaced returned not a word to my salutation but savagely flogged his horses  the tired animals who could scarce put the one foot before the other paid no attention to his cruelty and i continued without effort to maintain my position alongside smiling to myself at the futility of his attempts and at the same time pricked with curiosity as to why he made them  i made no such formidable a figure as that a man should flee when i accosted him and my conscience not being entirely clear i was more accustomed to be uneasy myself than to see others timid  presently he desisted and put back his whip in the holster with the air of a man vanquished  ‘so you would run away from me’ said i  ‘come come that’s not english’  ‘beg pardon master no offence meant’ he said touching his hat  ‘and none taken’ cried i  ‘all i desire is a little gaiety by the way’  i understood him to say he didn’t ‘take with gaiety’  ‘then i will try you with something else’ said i  ‘oh i can be all things to all men like the apostle  i dare to say i have travelled with heavier fellows than you in my time and done famously well with them are you going home’  ‘yes i’m a goin’ home i am’ he said  ‘a very fortunate circumstance for me’ said i  ‘at this rate we shall see a good deal of each other going the same way and now i come to think of it why should you not give me a cast  there is room beside you on the bench’  with a sudden snatch he carried the cart two yards into the roadway the horses plunged and came to a stop  ‘no you don’t’ he said menacing me with the whip  ‘none o’ that with me’  ‘none of what’ said i  ‘i asked you for a lift but i have no idea of taking one by force’  ‘well i’ve got to take care of the cart and ’orses i have’ says he ‘i don’t take up with no runagate vagabones you see else’  ‘i ought to thank you for your touching confidence’ said i approaching carelessly nearer as i spoke  ‘but i admit the road is solitary hereabouts and no doubt an accident soon happens  little fear of anything of the kind with you  i like you for it like your prudence like that pastoral shyness of disposition  but why not put it out of my power to hurt  why not open the door and bestow me here in the box or whatever you please to call it’ and i laid my hand demonstratively on the body of the cart  he had been timorous before but at this he seemed to lose the power of speech a moment and stared at me in a perfect enthusiasm of fear  ‘why not’ i continued  ‘the idea is good  i should be safe in there if i were the monster williams himself  the great thing is to have me under lock and key  for it does lock it is locked now’ said i trying the door  ‘a propos what have you for a cargo  it must be precious’  he found not a word to answer  rattattat i went upon the door like a welldrilled footman  ‘any one at home’ i said and stooped to listen  there came out of the interior a stifled sneeze the first of an uncontrollable paroxysm another followed immediately on the heels of it and then the driver turned with an oath laid the lash upon the horses with so much energy that they found their heels again and the whole equipage fled down the road at a gallop  at the first sound of the sneeze i had started back like a man shot the next moment a great light broke on my mind and i understood  here was the secret of fenn’s trade this was how he forwarded the escape of prisoners hawking them by night about the country in his covered cart there had been frenchmen close to me he who had just sneezed was my countryman my comrade perhaps already my friend  i took to my heels in pursuit  ‘hold hard’ i shouted  ‘stop  it’s all right  stop’  but the driver only turned a white face on me for a moment and redoubled his efforts bending forward plying his whip and crying to his horses these lay themselves down to the gallop and beat the highway with flying hoofs and the cart bounded after them among the ruts and fled in a halo of rain and spattering mud  but a minute since and it had been trundling along like a lame cow and now it was off as though drawn by apollo’s coursers there is no telling what a man can do until you frighten him  it was as much as i could do myself though i ran valiantly to maintain my distance and that since i knew my countrymen so near was become a chief point with me  a hundred yards farther on the cart whipped out of the highroad into a lane embowered with leafless trees and became lost to view  when i saw it next the driver had increased his advantage considerably but all danger was at an end and the horses had again declined into a hobbling walk  persuaded that they could not escape me i took my time and recovered my breath as i followed them  presently the lane twisted at right angles and showed me a gate and the beginning of a gravel sweep and a little after as i continued to advance a red brick house about seventy years old in a fine style of architecture and presenting a front of many windows to a lawn and garden  behind i could see outhouses and the peaked roofs of stacks and i judged that a manorhouse had in some way declined to be the residence of a tenantfarmer careless alike of appearances and substantial comfort  the marks of neglect were visible on every side in flowerbushes straggling beyond the borders in the illkept turf and in the broken windows that were incongruously patched with paper or stuffed with rags  a thicket of trees mostly evergreen fenced the place round and secluded it from the eyes of prying neighbours  as i came in view of it on that melancholy winter’s morning in the deluge of the falling rain and with the wind that now rose in occasional gusts and hooted over the old chimneys the cart had already drawn up at the frontdoor steps and the driver was already in earnest discourse with mr burchell fenn he was standing with his hands behind his back—a man of a gross misbegotten face and body dewlapped like a bull and red as a harvest moon and in his jockey cap blue coat and top boots he had much the air of a good solid tenantfarmer  the pair continued to speak as i came up the approach but received me at last in a sort of goggling silence  i had my hat in my hand  ‘i have the pleasure of addressing mr burchell fenn’ said i  ‘the same sir’ replied mr fenn taking off his jockey cap in answer to my civility but with the distant look and the tardy movements of one who continues to think of something else  ‘and who may you be’ he asked  ‘i shall tell you afterwards’ said i  ‘suffice it in the meantime that i come on business’  he seemed to digest my answer laboriously his mouth gaping his little eyes never straying from my face  ‘suffer me to point out to you sir’ i resumed ‘that this is a devil of a wet morning and that the chimney corner and possibly a glass of something hot are clearly indicated’  indeed the rain was now grown to be a deluge the gutters of the house roared the air was filled with the continuous strident crash  the stolidity of his face on which the rain streamed was far from reassuring me  on the contrary i was aware of a distinct qualm of apprehension which was not at all lessened by a view of the driver craning from his perch to observe us with the expression of a fascinated bird  so we stood silent when the prisoner again began to sneeze from the body of the cart and at the sound prompt as a transformation the driver had whipped up his horses and was shambling off round the corner of the house and mr fenn recovering his wits with a gulp had turned to the door behind him  ‘come in come in sir’ he said  ‘i beg your pardon sir the lock goes a trifle hard’  indeed it took him a surprising time to open the door which was not only locked on the outside but the lock seemed rebellious from disuse and when at last he stood back and motioned me to enter before him i was greeted on the threshold by that peculiar and convincing sound of the rain echoing over empty chambers  the entrancehall in which i now found myself was of a good size and good proportions potted plants occupied the corners the paved floor was soiled with muddy footprints and encumbered with straw on a mahogany halltable which was the only furniture a candle had been stuck and suffered to burn down—plainly a long while ago for the gutterings were green with mould  my mind under these new impressions worked with unusual vivacity  i was here shut off with fenn and his hireling in a deserted house a neglected garden and a wood of evergreens the most eligible theatre for a deed of darkness there came to me a vision of two flagstones raised in the hallfloor and the driver putting in the rainy afternoon over my grave and the prospect displeased me extremely  i felt i had carried my pleasantry as far as was safe i must lose no time in declaring my true character and i was even choosing the words in which i was to begin when the halldoor was slammedto behind me with a bang and i turned dropping my stick as i did so in time—and not any more than time—to save my life  the surprise of the onslaught and the huge weight of my assailant gave him the advantage  he had a pistol in his right hand of a portentous size which it took me all my strength to keep deflected  with his left arm he strained me to his bosom so that i thought i must be crushed or stifled  his mouth was open his face crimson and he panted aloud with hard animal sounds  the affair was as brief as it was hot and sudden the potations which had swelled and bloated his carcase had already weakened the springs of energy  one more huge effort that came near to overpower me and in which the pistol happily exploded and i felt his grasp slacken and weakness come on his joints his legs succumbed under his weight and he grovelled on his knees on the stone floor  ‘spare me’ he gasped  i had not only been abominably frightened i was shocked besides my delicacy was in arms like a lady to whom violence should have been offered by a similar monster  i plucked myself from his horrid contact i snatched the pistol—even discharged it was a formidable weapon—and menaced him with the butt  ‘spare you’ i cried ‘you beast’  his voice died in his fat inwards but his lips still vehemently framed the same words of supplication  my anger began to pass off but not all my repugnance the picture he made revolted me and i was impatient to be spared the further view of it  ‘here’ said i ‘stop this performance it sickens me  i am not going to kill you do you hear  i have need of you’  a look of relief that i could almost have called beautiful dawned on his countenance  ‘anything—anything you wish’ said he  anything is a big word and his use of it brought me for a moment to a stand  ‘why what do you mean’ i asked  ‘do you mean that you will blow the gaff on the whole business’  he answered me yes with eager asseverations  ‘i know monsieur de saintyves is in it it was through his papers we traced you’ i said  ‘do you consent to make a clean breast of the others’  ‘i do—i will’ he cried  ‘the ’ole crew of ’em there’s good names among ’em  i’ll be king’s evidence’  ‘so that all shall hang except yourself  you damned villain’ i broke out  ‘understand at once that i am no spy or thieftaker  i am a kinsman of monsieur de st yves—here in his interest  upon my word you have put your foot in it prettily mr burchell fenn  come stand up don’t grovel there  stand up you lump of iniquity’  he scrambled to his feet  he was utterly unmanned or it might have gone hard with me yet and i considered him hesitating as indeed there was cause  the man was a doubledyed traitor he had tried to murder me and i had first baffled his endeavours and then exposed and insulted him was it wise to place myself any longer at his mercy  with his help i should doubtless travel more quickly doubtless also far less agreeably and there was everything to show that it would be at a greater risk  in short i should have washed my hands of him on the spot but for the temptation of the french officers whom i knew to be so near and for whose society i felt so great and natural an impatience  if i was to see anything of my countrymen it was clear i had first of all to make my peace with mr fenn and that was no easy matter  to make friends with any one implies concessions on both sides and what could i concede what could i say of him but that he had proved himself a villain and a fool and the worse man  ‘well’ said i ‘here has been rather a poor piece of business which i dare say you can have no pleasure in calling to mind and to say truth i would as readily forget it myself  suppose we try  take back your pistol which smells very ill put it in your pocket or wherever you had it concealed  there  now let us meet for the first time—give you good morning mr fenn  i hope you do very well  i come on the recommendation of my kinsman the vicomte de st yves’  ‘do you mean it’ he cried  ‘do you mean you will pass over our little scrimmage’  ‘why certainly’ said i  ‘it shows you are a bold fellow who may be trusted to forget the business when it comes to the point  there is nothing against you in the little scrimmage unless that your courage is greater than your strength  you are not so young as you once were that is all’  ‘and i beg of you sir don’t betray me to the viscount’ he pleaded ‘i’ll not deny but what my ’eart failed me a trifle but it was only a word sir what anybody might have said in the ’eat of the moment and over with it’  ‘certainly’ said i  ‘that is quite my own opinion’  ‘the way i came to be anxious about the viscount’ he continued ‘is that i believe he might be induced to form an ’asty judgment  and the business in a pecuniary point of view is all that i could ask only trying sir—very trying  it’s making an old man of me before my time you might have observed yourself sir that i ’aven’t got the knees i once ’ad  the knees and the breathing there’s where it takes me  but i’m very sure sir i address a gentleman as would be the last to make trouble between friends’  ‘i am sure you do me no more than justice’ said i ‘and i shall think it quite unnecessary to dwell on any of these passing circumstances in my report to the vicomte’  ‘which you do favour him if you’ll excuse me being so bold as to mention it exac’ly’ said he  ‘i should have known you anywheres  may i offer you a pot of ’omebrewed ale sir  by your leave  this way if you please  i am ’eartily grateful—’eartily pleased to be of any service to a gentleman like you sir which is related to the viscount and really a fambly of which you might well be proud  take care of the step sir you have good news of ’is ’ealth i trust as well as that of monseer the count’  god forgive me the horrible fellow was still puffing and panting with the fury of his assault and already he had fallen into an obsequious wheedling familiarity like that of an old servant—already he was flattering me on my family connections  i followed him through the house into the stableyard where i observed the driver washing the cart in a shed  he must have heard the explosion of the pistol  he could not choose but hear it the thing was shaped like a little blunderbuss charged to the mouth and made a report like a piece of field artillery  he had heard he had paid no attention and now as we came forth by the backdoor he raised for a moment a pale and telltale face that was as direct as a confession  the rascal had expected to see fenn come forth alone he was waiting to be called on for that part of sexton which i had already allotted to him in fancy  i need not detain the reader very long with any description of my visit to the backkitchen of how we mulled our ale there and mulled it very well nor of how we sat talking fenn like an old faithful affectionate dependant and i—well  i myself fallen into a mere admiration of so much impudence that transcended words and had very soon conquered animosity i took a fancy to the man he was so vast a humbug  i began to see a kind of beauty in him his aplomb was so majestic  i never knew a rogue to cut so fat his villainy was ample like his belly and i could scarce find it in my heart to hold him responsible for either  he was good enough to drop into the autobiographical telling me how the farm in spite of the war and the high prices had proved a disappointment how there was ‘a sight of cold wet land as you come along the ’ighroad’ how the winds and rains and the seasons had been misdirected it seemed ‘o’ purpose’ how mrs fenn had died—‘i lost her coming two year agone a remarkable fine woman my old girl sir if you’ll excuse me’ he added with a burst of humility  in short he gave me an opportunity of studying john bull as i may say stuffed naked—his greed his usuriousness his hypocrisy his perfidy of the backstairs all swelled to the superlative—such as was well worth the little disarray and fluster of our passage in the hall     chapter xiii—i meet two of my countrymen   as soon as i judged it safe and that was not before burchell fenn had talked himself back into his breath and a complete good humour i proposed he should introduce me to the french officers henceforth to become my fellowpassengers  there were two of them it appeared and my heart beat as i approached the door  the specimen of perfidious albion whom i had just been studying gave me the stronger zest for my fellowcountrymen  i could have embraced them i could have wept on their necks  and all the time i was going to a disappointment  it was in a spacious and low room with an outlook on the court that i found them bestowed  in the good days of that house the apartment had probably served as a library for there were traces of shelves along the wainscot  four or five mattresses lay on the floor in a corner with a frowsy heap of bedding near by was a basin and a cube of soap a rude kitchentable and some deal chairs stood together at the far end and the room was illuminated by no less than four windows and warmed by a little crazy sidelong grate propped up with bricks in the vent of a hospitable chimney in which a pile of coals smoked prodigiously and gave out a few starveling flames  an old frail whitehaired officer sat in one of the chairs which he had drawn close to this apology for a fire he was wrapped in a camlet cloak of which the collar was turned up his knees touched the bars his hands were spread in the very smoke and yet he shivered for cold  the second—a big florid fine animal of a man whose every gesture labelled him the cock of the walk and the admiration of the ladies—had apparently despaired of the fire and now strode up and down sneezing hard bitterly blowing his nose and proffering a continual stream of bluster complaint and barrackroom oaths  fenn showed me in with the brief form of introduction ‘gentlemen all this here’s another fare’ and was gone again at once  the old man gave me but the one glance out of lacklustre eyes and even as he looked a shiver took him as sharp as a hiccough  but the other who represented to admiration the picture of a beau in a catarrh stared at me arrogantly  ‘and who are you sir’ he asked  i made the military salute to my superiors  ‘champdivers private eighth of the line’ said i  ‘pretty business’ said he  ‘and you are going on with us  three in a cart and a great trolloping private at that  and who is to pay for you my fine fellow’ he inquired  ‘if monsieur comes to that’ i answered civilly ‘who paid for him’  ‘oh if you choose to play the wit’ said he—and began to rail at large upon his destiny the weather the cold the danger and the expense of the escape and above all the cooking of the accursed english  it seemed to annoy him particularly that i should have joined their party ‘if you knew what you were doing thirty thousand millions of pigs you would keep yourself to yourself  the horses can’t drag the cart the roads are all ruts and swamps  no longer ago than last night the colonel and i had to march half the way—thunder of god—half the way to the knees in mud—and i with this infernal cold—and the danger of detection happily we met no one a desert—a real desert—like the whole abominable country  nothing to eat—no sir there is nothing to eat but raw cow and greens boiled in water—nor to drink but worcestershire sauce  now i with my catarrh i have no appetite is it not so  well if i were in france i should have a good soup with a crust in it an omelette a fowl in rice a partridge in cabbages—things to tempt me thunder of god  but here—day of god—what a country  and cold too  they talk about russia—this is all the cold i want  and the people—look at them  what a race  never any handsome men never any fine officers’—and he looked down complacently for a moment at his waist—‘and the women—what faggots no that is one point clear i cannot stomach the english’  there was something in this man so antipathetic to me as sent the mustard into my nose  i can never bear your bucks and dandies even when they are decentlooking and well dressed and the major—for that was his rank—was the image of a flunkey in good luck  even to be in agreement with him or to seem to be so was more than i could make out to endure  ‘you could scarce be expected to stomach them’ said i civilly ‘after having just digested your parole’  he whipped round on his heel and turned on me a countenance which i dare say he imagined to be awful but another fit of sneezing cut him off ere he could come the length of speech  ‘i have not tried the dish myself’ i took the opportunity to add  ‘it is said to be unpalatable  did monsieur find it so’  with surprising vivacity the colonel woke from his lethargy  he was between us ere another word could pass  ‘shame gentlemen’ he said  ‘is this a time for frenchmen and fellowsoldiers to fall out  we are in the midst of our enemies a quarrel a loud word may suffice to plunge us back into irretrievable distress  monsieur le commandant you have been gravely offended  i make it my request i make it my prayer—if need be i give you my orders—that the matter shall stand by until we come safe to france then if you please i will serve you in any capacity  and for you young man you have shown all the cruelty and carelessness of youth this gentleman is your superior he is no longer young’—at which word you are to conceive the major’s face  ‘it is admitted he has broken his parole  i know not his reason and no more do you  it might be patriotism in this hour of our country’s adversity it might be humanity necessity you know not what in the least and you permit yourself to reflect on his honour  to break parole may be a subject for pity and not derision  i have broken mine—i a colonel of the empire  and why  i have been years negotiating my exchange and it cannot be managed those who have influence at the ministry of war continually rush in before me and i have to wait and my daughter at home is in a decline  i am going to see my daughter at last and it is my only concern lest i should have delayed too long  she is ill and very ill—at death’s door  nothing is left me but my daughter my emperor and my honour and i give my honour blame me for it who dare’  at this my heart smote me  ‘for god’s sake’ i cried ‘think no more of what i have said  a parole what is a parole against life and death and love  i ask your pardon this gentleman’s also  as long as i shall be with you you shall not have cause to complain of me again  i pray god you will find your daughter alive and restored’  ‘that is past praying for’ said the colonel and immediately the brief fire died out of him and returning to the hearth he relapsed into his former abstraction  but i was not so easy to compose  the knowledge of the poor gentleman’s trouble and the sight of his face had filled me with the bitterness of remorse and i insisted upon shaking hands with the major which he did with a very ill grace and abounded in palinodes and apologies  ‘after all’ said i ‘who am i to talk  i am in the luck to be a private soldier i have no parole to give or to keep once i am over the rampart i am as free as air  i beg you to believe that i regret from my soul the use of these ungenerous expressions  allow me    is there no way in this damned house to attract attention  where is this fellow fenn’  i ran to one of the windows and threw it open  fenn who was at the moment passing below in the court cast up his arms like one in despair called to me to keep back plunged into the house and appeared next moment in the doorway of the chamber  ‘oh sir’ says he ‘keep away from those there windows  a body might see you from the back lane’  ‘it is registered’ said i  ‘henceforward i will be a mouse for precaution and a ghost for invisibility  but in the meantime for god’s sake fetch us a bottle of brandy  your room is as damp as the bottom of a well and these gentlemen are perishing of cold’  so soon as i had paid him for everything i found must be paid in advance i turned my attention to the fire and whether because i threw greater energy into the business or because the coals were now warmed and the time ripe i soon started a blaze that made the chimney roar again  the shine of it in that dark rainy day seemed to reanimate the colonel like a blink of sun  with the outburst of the flames besides a draught was established which immediately delivered us from the plague of smoke and by the time fenn returned carrying a bottle under his arm and a single tumbler in his hand there was already an air of gaiety in the room that did the heart good  i poured out some of the brandy  ‘colonel’ said i ‘i am a young man and a private soldier  i have not been long in this room and already i have shown the petulance that belongs to the one character and the ill manners that you may look for in the other  have the humanity to pass these slips over and honour me so far as to accept this glass’  ‘my lad’ says he waking up and blinking at me with an air of suspicion ‘are you sure you can afford it’  i assured him i could  ‘i thank you then i am very cold’  he took the glass out and a little colour came in his face  ‘i thank you again’ said he  ‘it goes to the heart’  the major when i motioned him to help himself did so with a good deal of liberality continued to do so for the rest of the morning now with some sort of apology now with none at all and the bottle began to look foolish before dinner was served  it was such a meal as he had himself predicted beef greens potatoes mustard in a teacup and beer in a brown jug that was all over hounds horses and hunters with a fox at the fat end and a gigantic john bull—for all the world like fenn—sitting in the midst in a bobwig and smoking tobacco  the beer was a good brew but not good enough for the major he laced it with brandy—for his cold he said and in this curative design the remainder of the bottle ebbed away  he called my attention repeatedly to the circumstance helped me pointedly to the dregs threw the bottle in the air and played tricks with it and at last having exhausted his ingenuity and seeing me remain quite blind to every hint he ordered and paid for another himself  as for the colonel he ate nothing sat sunk in a muse and only awoke occasionally to a sense of where he was and what he was supposed to be doing  on each of these occasions he showed a gratitude and kind courtesy that endeared him to me beyond expression  ‘champdivers my lad your health’ he would say  ‘the major and i had a very arduous march last night and i positively thought i should have eaten nothing but your fortunate idea of the brandy has made quite a new man of me—quite a new man’  and he would fall to with a great air of heartiness cut himself a mouthful and before he had swallowed it would have forgotten his dinner his company the place where he then was and the escape he was engaged on and become absorbed in the vision of a sickroom and a dying girl in france  the pathos of this continual preoccupation in a man so old sick and overweary and whom i looked upon as a mere bundle of dying bones and deathpains put me wholly from my victuals it seemed there was an element of sin a kind of rude bravado of youth in the mere relishing of food at the same table with this tragic father and though i was well enough used to the coarse plain diet of the english i ate scarce more than himself  dinner was hardly over before he succumbed to a lethargic sleep lying on one of the mattresses with his limbs relaxed and his breath seemingly suspended—the very image of dissolution  this left the major and myself alone at the table  you must not suppose our têteàtête was long but it was a lively period while it lasted he drank like a fish or an englishman shouted beat the table roared out songs quarrelled made it up again and at last tried to throw the dinnerplates through the window a feat of which he was at that time quite incapable  for a party of fugitives condemned to the most rigorous discretion there was never seen so noisy a carnival and through it all the colonel continued to sleep like a child  seeing the major so well advanced and no retreat possible i made a fair wind of a foul one keeping his glass full pushing him with toasts and sooner than i could have dared to hope he became drowsy and incoherent  with the wrongheadedness of all such sots he would not be persuaded to lie down upon one of the mattresses until i had stretched myself upon another  but the comedy was soon over soon he slept the sleep of the just and snored like a military music and i might get up again and face as best i could the excessive tedium of the afternoon  i had passed the night before in a good bed i was denied the resource of slumber and there was nothing open for me but to pace the apartment maintain the fire and brood on my position  i compared yesterday and today—the safety comfort jollity openair exercise and pleasant roadside inns of the one with the tedium anxiety and discomfort of the other  i remembered that i was in the hands of fenn who could not be more false—though he might be more vindictive—than i fancied him  i looked forward to nights of pitching in the covered cart and days of monotony in i knew not what hidingplaces and my heart failed me and i was in two minds whether to slink off ere it was too late and return to my former solitary way of travel  but the colonel stood in the path  i had not seen much of him but already i judged him a man of a childlike nature—with that sort of innocence and courtesy that i think is only to be found in old soldiers or old priests—and broken with years and sorrow i could not turn my back on his distress could not leave him alone with the selfish trooper who snored on the next mattress  ‘champdivers my lad your health’ said a voice in my ear and stopped me—and there are few things i am more glad of in the retrospect than that it did  it must have been about four in the afternoon—at least the rain had taken off and the sun was setting with some wintry pomp—when the current of my reflections was effectually changed by the arrival of two visitors in a gig  they were farmers of the neighbourhood i suppose—big burly fellows in greatcoats and topboots mightily flushed with liquor when they arrived and before they left inimitably drunk  they stayed long in the kitchen with burchell drinking shouting singing and keeping it up and the sound of their merry minstrelsy kept me a kind of company the night fell and the shine of the fire brightened and blinked on the panelled wall  our illuminated windows must have been visible not only from the back lane of which fenn had spoken but from the court where the farmers’ gig awaited them  in the far end of the firelit room lay my companions the one silent the other clamorously noisy the images of death and drunkenness  little wonder if i were tempted to join in the choruses below and sometimes could hardly refrain from laughter and sometimes i believe from tears—so unmitigated was the tedium so cruel the suspense of this period  at last about six at night i should fancy the noisy minstrels appeared in the court headed by fenn with a lantern and knocking together as they came  the visitors clambered noisily into the gig one of them shook the reins and they were snatched out of sight and hearing with a suddenness that partook of the nature of prodigy  i am well aware there is a providence for drunken men that holds the reins for them and presides over their troubles doubtless he had his work cut out for him with this particular gigful  fenn rescued his toes with an ejaculation from under the departing wheels and turned at once with uncertain steps and devious lantern to the far end of the court  there through the open doors of a coachhouse the shockheaded lad was already to be seen drawing forth the covered cart  if i wished any private talk with our host it must be now or never  accordingly i groped my way downstairs and came to him as he looked on at and lighted the harnessing of the horses  ‘the hour approaches when we have to part’ said i ‘and i shall be obliged if you will tell your servant to drop me at the nearest point for dunstable  i am determined to go so far with our friends colonel x and major y but my business is peremptory and it takes me to the neighbourhood of dunstable’  orders were given to my satisfaction with an obsequiousness that seemed only inflamed by his potations     chapter xiv—travels of the covered cart   my companions were aroused with difficulty the colonel poor old gentleman to a sort of permanent dream in which you could say of him only that he was very deaf and anxiously polite the major still maudlin drunk  we had a dish of tea by the fireside and then issued like criminals into the scathing cold of the night  for the weather had in the meantime changed  upon the cessation of the rain a strict frost had succeeded  the moon being young was already near the zenith when we started glittered everywhere on sheets of ice and sparkled in ten thousand icicles  a more unpromising night for a journey it was hard to conceive  but in the course of the afternoon the horses had been well roughed and king for such was the name of the shockheaded lad was very positive that he could drive us without misadventure  he was as good as his word indeed despite a gawky air he was simply invaluable in his present employment showing marked sagacity in all that concerned the care of horses and guiding us by one short cut after another for days and without a fault  the interior of that engine of torture the covered cart was fitted with a bench on which we took our places the door was shut in a moment the night closed upon us solid and stifling and we felt that we were being driven carefully out of the courtyard  careful was the word all night and it was an alleviation of our miseries that we did not often enjoy in general as we were driven the better part of the night and day often at a pretty quick pace and always through a labyrinth of the most infamous country lanes and byroads we were so bruised upon the bench so dashed against the top and sides of the cart that we reached the end of a stage in truly pitiable case sometimes flung ourselves down without the formality of eating made but one sleep of it until the hour of departure returned and were only properly awakened by the first jolt of the renewed journey  there were interruptions at times that we hailed as alleviations  at times the cart was bogged once it was upset and we must alight and lend the driver the assistance of our arms at times too as on the occasion when i had first encountered it the horses gave out and we had to trail alongside in mud or frost until the first peep of daylight or the approach to a hamlet or a high road bade us disappear like ghosts into our prison  the main roads of england are incomparable for excellence of a beautiful smoothness very ingeniously laid down and so well kept that in most weathers you could take your dinner off any part of them without distaste  on them to the note of the bugle the mail did its sixty miles a day innumerable chaises whisked after the bobbing postboys or some young blood would flit by in a curricle and tandem to the vast delight and danger of the lieges  on them the slowpacing waggons made a music of bells and all day long the travellers on horseback and the travellers on foot like happy mr st ives so little a while before kept coming and going and baiting and gaping at each other as though a fair were due and they were gathering to it from all england  no nowhere in the world is travel so great a pleasure as in that country but unhappily our one need was to be secret and all this rapid and animated picture of the road swept quite apart from us as we lumbered up hill and down dale under hedge and over stone among circuitous byways only twice did i receive as it were a whiff of the highway  the first reached my ears alone  i might have been anywhere  i only knew i was walking in the dark night and among ruts when i heard very far off over the silent country that surrounded us the guard’s horn wailing its signal to the next posthouse for a change of horses  it was like the voice of the day heard in darkness a voice of the world heard in prison the note of a cock crowing in the midseas—in short i cannot tell you what it was like you will have to fancy for yourself—but i could have wept to hear it  once we were belated the cattle could hardly crawl the day was at hand it was a nipping rigorous morning king was lashing his horses i was giving an arm to the old colonel and the major was coughing in our rear  i must suppose that king was a thought careless being nearly in desperation about his team and in spite of the cold morning breathing hot with his exertions  we came at last a little before sunrise to the summit of a hill and saw the highroad passing at right angles through an open country of meadows and hedgerow pollards and not only the york mail speeding smoothly at the gallop of the four horses but a postchaise besides with the postboy titupping briskly and the traveller himself putting his head out of the window but whether to breathe the dawn or the better to observe the passage of the mail i do not know  so that we enjoyed for an instant a picture of free life on the road in its most luxurious forms of despatch and comfort  and thereafter with a poignant feeling of contrast in our hearts we must mount again into our wheeled dungeon  we came to our stages at all sorts of odd hours and they were in all kinds of odd places  i may say at once that my first experience was my best  nowhere again were we so well entertained as at burchell fenn’s and this i suppose was natural and indeed inevitable in so long and secret a journey  the first stop we lay six hours in a barn standing by itself in a poor marshy orchard and packed with hay to make it more attractive we were told it had been the scene of an abominable murder and was now haunted  but the day was beginning to break and our fatigue was too extreme for visionary terrors  the second or third we alighted on a barren heath about midnight built a fire to warm us under the shelter of some thorns supped like beggars on bread and a piece of cold bacon and slept like gipsies with our feet to the fire  in the meanwhile king was gone with the cart i know not where to get a change of horses and it was late in the dark morning when he returned and we were able to resume our journey  in the middle of another night we came to a stop by an ancient whitewashed cottage of two stories a privet hedge surrounded it the frosty moon shone blankly on the upper windows but through those of the kitchen the firelight was seen glinting on the roof and reflected from the dishes on the wall  here after much hammering on the door king managed to arouse an old crone from the chimneycorner chair where she had been dozing in the watch and we were had in and entertained with a dish of hot tea  this old lady was an aunt of burchell fenn’s—and an unwilling partner in his dangerous trade though the house stood solitary and the hour was an unlikely one for any passenger upon the road king and she conversed in whispers only  there was something dismal something of the sickroom in this perpetual guarded sibilation  the apprehensions of our hostess insensibly communicated themselves to every one present  we ate like mice in a cat’s ear if one of us jingled a teaspoon all would start and when the hour came to take the road again we drew a long breath of relief and climbed to our places in the covered cart with a positive sense of escape  the most of our meals however were taken boldly at hedgerow alehouses usually at untimely hours of the day when the clients were in the field or the farmyard at labour  i shall have to tell presently of our last experience of the sort and how unfortunately it miscarried but as that was the signal for my separation from my fellowtravellers i must first finish with them  i had never any occasion to waver in my first judgment of the colonel the old gentleman seemed to me and still seems in the retrospect the salt of the earth  i had occasion to see him in the extremes of hardship hunger and cold he was dying and he looked it and yet i cannot remember any hasty harsh or impatient word to have fallen from his lips  on the contrary he ever showed himself careful to please and even if he rambled in his talk rambled always gently—like a humane halfwitted old hero true to his colours to the last  i would not dare to say how often he awoke suddenly from a lethargy and told us again as though we had never heard it the story of how he had earned the cross how it had been given him by the hand of the emperor and of the innocent—and indeed foolish—sayings of his daughter when he returned with it on his bosom  he had another anecdote which he was very apt to give by way of a rebuke when the major wearied us beyond endurance with dispraises of the english  this was an account of the braves gens with whom he had been boarding  true enough he was a man so simple and grateful by nature that the most common civilities were able to touch him to the heart and would remain written in his memory but from a thousand inconsiderable but conclusive indications i gathered that this family had really loved him and loaded him with kindness  they made a fire in his bedroom which the sons and daughters tended with their own hands letters from france were looked for with scarce more eagerness by himself than by these alien sympathisers when they came he would read them aloud in the parlour to the assembled family translating as he went  the colonel’s english was elementary his daughter not in the least likely to be an amusing correspondent and as i conceived these scenes in the parlour i felt sure the interest centred in the colonel himself and i thought i could feel in my own heart that mixture of the ridiculous and the pathetic the contest of tears and laughter which must have shaken the bosoms of the family  their kindness had continued till the end  it appears they were privy to his flight the camlet cloak had been lined expressly for him and he was the bearer of a letter from the daughter of the house to his own daughter in paris  the last evening when the time came to say goodnight it was tacitly known to all that they were to look upon his face no more  he rose pleading fatigue and turned to the daughter who had been his chief ally ‘you will permit me my dear—to an old and very unhappy soldier—and may god bless you for your goodness’  the girl threw her arms about his neck and sobbed upon his bosom the lady of the house burst into tears ‘et je vous le jure le père se mouchait’ quoth the colonel twisting his moustaches with a cavalry air and at the same time blinking the water from his eyes at the mere recollection  it was a good thought to me that he had found these friends in captivity that he had started on this fatal journey from so cordial a farewell  he had broken his parole for his daughter that he should ever live to reach her sickbed that he could continue to endure to an end the hardships the crushing fatigue the savage cold of our pilgrimage i had early ceased to hope  i did for him what i was able—nursed him kept him covered watched over his slumbers sometimes held him in my arms at the rough places of the road  ‘champdivers’ he once said ‘you are like a son to me—like a son’  it is good to remember though at the time it put me on the rack  all was to no purpose  fast as we were travelling towards france he was travelling faster still to another destination daily he grew weaker and more indifferent  an old rustic accent of lower normandy reappeared in his speech from which it had long been banished and grew stronger old words of the patois too ouistreham matrassé and others the sense of which we were sometimes unable to guess  on the very last day he began again his eternal story of the cross and the emperor  the major who was particularly ill or at least particularly cross uttered some angry words of protest ‘pardonnezmoi monsieur le commandant mais c’est pour monsieur’ said the colonel ‘monsieur has not yet heard the circumstance and is good enough to feel an interest’  presently after however he began to lose the thread of his narrative and at last ‘qué que j’ai  je m’embrouille’ says he ‘suffit s’m’a la donné et berthe en était bien contente’  it struck me as the falling of the curtain or the closing of the sepulchre doors  sure enough in but a little while after he fell into a sleep as gentle as an infant’s which insensibly changed into the sleep of death  i had my arm about his body at the time and remarked nothing unless it were that he once stretched himself a little so kindly the end came to that disastrous life  it was only at our evening halt that the major and i discovered we were travelling alone with the poor clay  that night we stole a spade from a field—i think near market bosworth—and a little farther on in a wood of young oak trees and by the light of king’s lantern we buried the old soldier of the empire with both prayers and tears  we had needs invent heaven if it had not been revealed to us there are some things that fall so bitterly ill on this side time  as for the major i have long since forgiven him  he broke the news to the poor colonel’s daughter i am told he did it kindly and sure nobody could have done it without tears  his share of purgatory will be brief and in this world as i could not very well praise him i have suppressed his name  the colonel’s also for the sake of his parole  requiescat     chapter xv—the adventure of the attorney’s clerk   i have mentioned our usual course which was to eat in inconsiderable wayside hostelries known to king  it was a dangerous business we went daily under fire to satisfy our appetite and put our head in the loin’s mouth for a piece of bread  sometimes to minimise the risk we would all dismount before we came in view of the house straggle in severally and give what orders we pleased like disconnected strangers  in like manner we departed to find the cart at an appointed place some half a mile beyond  the colonel and the major had each a word or two of english—god help their pronunciation  but they did well enough to order a rasher and a pot or call a reckoning and to say truth these country folks did not give themselves the pains and had scarce the knowledge to be critical  about nine or ten at night the pains of hunger and cold drove us to an alehouse in the flats of bedfordshire not far from bedford itself  in the inn kitchen was a long lean characteristiclooking fellow of perhaps forty dressed in black  he sat on a settle by the fireside smoking a long pipe such as they call a yard of clay  his hat and wig were hanged upon the knob behind him his head as bald as a bladder of lard and his expression very shrewd cantankerous and inquisitive  he seemed to value himself above his company to give himself the airs of a man of the world among that rustic herd which was often no more than his due being as i afterwards discovered an attorney’s clerk  i took upon myself the more ungrateful part of arriving last and by the time i entered on the scene the major was already served at a side table  some general conversation must have passed and i smelled danger in the air the major looked flustered the attorney’s clerk triumphant and three or four peasants in smockfrocks who sat about the fire to play chorus had let their pipes go out  ‘give you good evening sir’ said the attorney’s clerk to me  ‘the same to you sir’ said i  ‘i think this one will do’ quoth the clerk to the yokels with a wink and then as soon as i had given my order ‘pray sir whither are you bound’ he added  ‘sir’ said i ‘i am not one of those who speak either of their business or their destination in houses of public entertainment’  ‘a good answer’ said he ‘and an excellent principle  sir do you speak french’  ‘why no sir’ said i  ‘a little spanish at your service’  ‘but you know the french accent perhaps’ said the clerk  ‘well do i do that’ said i  ‘the french accent  why i believe i can tell a frenchman in ten words’  ‘here is a puzzle for you then’ he said  ‘i have no material doubt myself but some of these gentlemen are more backward  the lack of education you know  i make bold to say that a man cannot walk cannot hear and cannot see without the blessings of education’  he turned to the major whose food plainly stuck in his throat  ‘now sir’ pursued the clerk ‘let me have the pleasure to hear your voice again  where are you going did you say’  ‘sare i am going to london’ said the major  i could have flung my plate at him to be such an ass and to have so little a gift of languages where that was the essential  ‘what think ye of that’ said the clerk  ‘is that french enough’  ‘good god’ cried i leaping up like one who should suddenly perceive an acquaintance ‘is this you mr dubois  why who would have dreamed of encountering you so far from home’  as i spoke i shook hands with the major heartily and turning to our tormentor ‘oh sir you may be perfectly reassured  this is a very honest fellow a late neighbour of mine in the city of carlisle’  i thought the attorney looked put out i little knew the man  ‘but he is french’ said he ‘for all that’  ‘ay to be sure’ said i  ‘a frenchman of the emigration  none of your buonaparte lot  i will warrant his views of politics to be as sound as your own’  ‘what is a little strange’ said the clerk quietly ‘is that mr dubois should deny it’  i got it fair in the face and took it smiling but the shock was rude and in the course of the next words i contrived to do what i have rarely done and make a slip in my english  i kept my liberty and life by my proficiency all these months and for once that i failed it is not to be supposed that i would make a public exhibition of the details  enough that it was a very little error and one that might have passed ninetynine times in a hundred  but my limb of the law was as swift to pick it up as though he had been by trade a master of languages  ‘aha’ cries he ‘and you are french too  your tongue bewrays you  two frenchmen coming into an alehouse severally and accidentally not knowing each other at ten of the clock at night in the middle of bedfordshire  no sir that shall not pass  you are all prisoners escaping if you are nothing worse  consider yourselves under arrest  i have to trouble you for your papers’  ‘where is your warrant if you come to that’ said i  ‘my papers  a likely thing that i would show my papers on the ipse dixit of an unknown fellow in a hedge alehouse’  ‘would you resist the law’ says he  ‘not the law sir’ said i  ‘i hope i am too good a subject for that but for a nameless fellow with a bald head and a pair of gingham smallclothes why certainly  ’tis my birthright as an englishman where’s magna charta else’  ‘we will see about that’ says he and then addressing the assistants ‘where does the constable live’  ‘lord love you sir’ cried the landlord ‘what are you thinking of  the constable at past ten at night  why he’s abed and asleep and good and drunk two hours agone’  ‘ah that a’ be’ came in chorus from the yokels  the attorney’s clerk was put to a stand  he could not think of force there was little sign of martial ardour about the landlord and the peasants were indifferent—they only listened and gaped and now scratched a head and now would get a light to their pipes from the embers on the hearth  on the other hand the major and i put a bold front on the business and defied him not without some ground of law  in this state of matters he proposed i should go along with him to one squire merton a great man of the neighbourhood who was in the commission of the peace the end of his avenue but three lanes away  i told him i would not stir a foot for him if it were to save his soul next he proposed i should stay all night where i was and the constable could see to my affair in the morning when he was sober  i replied i should go when and where i pleased that we were lawful travellers in the fear of god and the king and i for one would suffer myself to be stayed by nobody  at the same time i was thinking the matter had lasted altogether too long and i determined to bring it to an end at once  ‘see here’ said i getting up for till now i had remained carelessly seated ‘there’s only one way to decide a thing like this—only one way that’s right english—and that’s man to man  take off your coat sir and these gentlemen shall see fair play’  at this there came a look in his eye that i could not mistake  his education had been neglected in one essential and eminently british particular he could not box  no more could i you may say but then i had the more impudence—and i had made the proposal  ‘he says i’m no englishman but the proof of the pudding is the eating of it’ i continued  and here i stripped my coat and fell into the proper attitude which was just about all i knew of this barbarian art  ‘why sir you seem to me to hang back a little’ said i  ‘come i’ll meet you i’ll give you an appetiser—though hang me if i can understand the man that wants any enticement to hold up his hands’  i drew a banknote out of my fob and tossed it to the landlord  ‘there are the stakes’ said i  ‘i’ll fight you for first blood since you seem to make so much work about it  if you tap my claret first there are five guineas for you and i’ll go with you to any squire you choose to mention  if i tap yours you’ll perhaps let on that i’m the better man and allow me to go about my lawful business at my own time and convenience by god is that fair my lads’ says i appealing to the company  ‘ay ay’ said the chorus of chawbacons ‘he can’t say no fairer nor that he can’t  take off thy coat master’  the limb of the law was now on the wrong side of public opinion and what heartened me to go on the position was rapidly changing in our favour  already the major was paying his shot to the very indifferent landlord and i could see the white face of king at the backdoor making signals of haste  ‘oho’ quoth my enemy ‘you are as full of doubles as a fox are you not but i see through you i see through and through you  you would change the venue would you’  ‘i may be transparent sir’ says i ‘but if you’ll do me the favour to stand up you’ll find i can hit dam hard’  ‘which is a point if you will observe that i had never called in question’ said he  ‘why you ignorant clowns’ he proceeded addressing the company ‘can’t you see the fellow’s gulling you before your eyes can’t you see that he has changed the point upon me  i say he’s a french prisoner and he answers that he can box  what has that to do with it i would not wonder but what he can dance too—they’re all dancing masters over there  i say and i stick to it that he’s a frenchy  he says he isn’t  well then let him out with his papers if he has them  if he had would he not show them  if he had would he not jump at the idea of going to squire merton a man you all know  now you are all plain straightforward bedfordshire men and i wouldn’t ask a better lot to appeal to  you’re not the kind to be talked over with any french gammon and he’s plenty of that  but let me tell him he can take his pigs to another market they’ll never do here they’ll never go down in bedfordshire  why look at the man  look at his feet  has anybody got a foot in the room like that  see how he stands do any of you fellows stand like that  does the landlord there  why he has frenchman wrote all over him as big as a signpost’  this was all very well and in a different scene i might even have been gratified by his remarks but i saw clearly if i were to allow him to talk he might turn the tables on me altogether  he might not be much of a hand at boxing but i was much mistaken or he had studied forensic eloquence in a good school  in this predicament i could think of nothing more ingenious than to burst out of the house under the pretext of an ungovernable rage  it was certainly not very ingenious—it was elementary but i had no choice  ‘you whitelivered dog’ i broke out  ‘do you dare to tell me you’re an englishman and won’t fight  but i’ll stand no more of this  i leave this place where i’ve been insulted  here what’s to pay  pay yourself’ i went on offering the landlord a handful of silver ‘and give me back my banknote’  the landlord following his usual policy of obliging everybody offered no opposition to my design  the position of my adversary was now thoroughly bad  he had lost my two companions  he was on the point of losing me also  there was plainly no hope of arousing the company to help and watching him with a corner of my eye i saw him hesitate for a moment  the next he had taken down his hat and his wig which was of black horsehair and i saw him draw from behind the settle a vast hooded greatcoat and a small valise  ‘the devil’ thought i ‘is the rascal going to follow me’  i was scarce clear of the inn before the limb of the law was at my heels i saw his face plain in the moonlight and the most resolute purpose showed in it along with an unmoved composure  a chill went over me ‘this is no common adventure’ thinks i to myself  ‘you have got hold of a man of character st ives  a bitehard a bulldog a weasel is on your trail and how are you to throw him off’  who was he  by some of his expressions i judged he was a hangeron of courts  but in what character had he followed the assizes  as a simple spectator as a lawyer’s clerk as a criminal himself or—last and worst supposition—as a bowstreet ‘runner’  the cart would wait for me perhaps half a mile down our onward road which i was already following  and i told myself that in a few minutes’ walking bowstreet runner or not i should have him at my mercy  and then reflection came to me in time  of all things one was out of the question  upon no account must this obtrusive fellow see the cart until i had killed or shook him off i was quite divorced from my companions—alone in the midst of england on a frosty byway leading whither i knew not with a sleuthhound at my heels and never a friend but the hollystick  we came at the same time to a crossing of lanes  the branch to the left was overhung with trees deeply sunken and dark  not a ray of moonlight penetrated its recesses and i took it at a venture  the wretch followed my example in silence and for some time we crunched together over frozen pools without a word  then he found his voice with a chuckle  ‘this is not the way to mr merton’s’ said he  ‘no’ said i ‘it is mine however’  ‘and therefore mine’ said he  again we fell silent and we may thus have covered half a mile before the lane taking a sudden turn brought us forth again into the moonshine with his hooded greatcoat on his back his valise in his hand his black wig adjusted and footing it on the ice with a sort of sober doggedness of manner my enemy was changed almost beyond recognition changed in everything but a certain dry polemical pedantic air that spoke of a sedentary occupation and high stools  i observed too that his valise was heavy and putting this and that together hit upon a plan  ‘a seasonable night sir’ said i  ‘what do you say to a bit of running the frost has me by the toes’  ‘with all the pleasure in life’ says he  his voice seemed well assured which pleased me little  however there was nothing else to try except violence for which it would always be too soon  i took to my heels accordingly he after me and for some time the slapping of our feet on the hard road might have been heard a mile away  he had started a pace behind me and he finished in the same position  for all his extra years and the weight of his valise he had not lost a hair’s breadth  the devil might race him for me—i had enough of it  and besides to run so fast was contrary to my interests  we could not run long without arriving somewhere  at any moment we might turn a corner and find ourselves at the lodgegate of some squire merton in the midst of a village whose constable was sober or in the hands of a patrol  there was no help for it—i must finish with him on the spot as long as it was possible  i looked about me and the place seemed suitable never a light never a house—nothing but stubblefields fallows and a few stunted trees  i stopped and eyed him in the moonlight with an angry stare  ‘enough of this foolery’ said i  he had tamed and now faced me full very pale but with no sign of shrinking  ‘i am quite of your opinion’ said he  ‘you have tried me at the running you can try me next at the high jump  it will be all the same it must end the one way’  i made my holly whistle about my head  ‘i believe you know what way’ said i  ‘we are alone it is night and i am wholly resolved  are you not frightened’  ‘no’ he said ‘not in the smallest  i do not box sir but i am not a coward as you may have supposed  perhaps it will simplify our relations if i tell you at the outset that i walk armed’  quick as lightning i made a feint at his head as quickly he gave ground and at the same time i saw a pistol glitter in his hand  ‘no more of that mr frenchprisoner’ he said  ‘it will do me no good to have your death at my door’  ‘faith nor me either’ said i and i lowered my stick and considered the man not without a twinkle of admiration  ‘you see’ i said ‘there is one consideration that you appear to overlook there are a great many chances that your pistol may miss fire’  ‘i have a pair’ he returned  ‘never travel without a brace of barkers’  ‘i make you my compliment’ said i  ‘you are able to take care of yourself and that is a good trait  but my good man let us look at this matter dispassionately  you are not a coward and no more am i we are both men of excellent sense i have good reason whatever it may be to keep my concerns to myself and to walk alone  now i put it to you pointedly am i likely to stand it  am i likely to put up with your continued and—excuse me—highly impudent ingérence into my private affairs’  ‘another french word’ says he composedly  ‘oh damn your french words’ cried i  ‘you seem to be a frenchman yourself’  ‘i have had many opportunities by which i have profited’ he explained ‘few men are better acquainted with the similarities and differences whether of idiom or accent of the two languages’  ‘you are a pompous fellow too’ said i  ‘oh i can make distinctions sir’ says he  ‘i can talk with bedfordshire peasants and i can express myself becomingly i hope in the company of a gentleman of education like yourself’  ‘if you set up to be a gentleman—’ i began  ‘pardon me’ he interrupted ‘i make no such claim  i only see the nobility and gentry in the way of business  i am quite a plain person’  ‘for the lord’s sake’ i exclaimed ‘set my mind at rest upon one point in the name of mystery who and what are you’  ‘i have no cause to be ashamed of my name sir’ said he ‘nor yet my trade  i am thomas dudgeon at your service clerk to mr daniel romaine solicitor of london high holborn is our address sir’  it was only by the ecstasy of the relief that i knew how horribly i had been frightened  i flung my stick on the road  ‘romaine’ i cried  ‘daniel romaine  an old hunks with a red face and a big head and got up like a quaker  my dear friend to my arms’  ‘keep back i say’ said dudgeon weakly  i would not listen to him  with the end of my own alarm i felt as if i must infallibly be at the end of all dangers likewise as if the pistol that he held in one hand were no more to be feared than the valise that he carried with the other and now put up like a barrier against my advance  ‘keep back or i declare i will fire’ he was crying  ‘have a care for god’s sake  my pistol—’  he might scream as be pleased  willy nilly i folded him to my breast i pressed him there i kissed his ugly mug as it had never been kissed before and would never be kissed again and in the doing so knocked his wig awry and his hat off  he bleated in my embrace so bleats the sheep in the arms of the butcher  the whole thing on looking back appears incomparably reckless and absurd i no better than a madman for offering to advance on dudgeon and he no better than a fool for not shooting me while i was about it  but all’s well that ends well or as the people in these days kept singing and whistling on the streets—      ‘there’s a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft     and looks out for the life of poor jack’  ‘there’ said i releasing him a little but still keeping my hands on his shoulders ‘je vous ai bel et bien embrassé—and as you would say there is another french word’  with his wig over one eye he looked incredibly rueful and put out  ‘cheer up dudgeon the ordeal is over you shall be embraced no more  but do first of all for god’ssake put away your pistol you handle it as if you were a cockatrice some time or other depend upon it it will certainly go off  here is your hat  no let me put it on square and the wig before it  never suffer any stress of circumstances to come between you and the duty you owe to yourself if you have nobody else to dress for dress for god      ‘put your wig straight     on your bald pate     keep your chin scraped     and your figure draped  can you match me that  the whole duty of man in a quatrain  and remark i do not set up to be a professional bard these are the outpourings of a dilettante’  ‘but my dear sir’ he exclaimed  ‘but my dear sir’ i echoed ‘i will allow no man to interrupt the flow of my ideas  give me your opinion on my quatrain or i vow we shall have a quarrel of it’  ‘certainly you are quite an original’ he said  ‘quite’ said i ‘and i believe i have my counterpart before me’  ‘well for a choice’ says he smiling ‘and whether for sense or poetry give me      ‘“worth makes the man and want of it the fellow     the rest is all but leather and prunello”’  ‘oh but that’s not fair—that’s pope  it’s not original dudgeon understand me’ said i wringing his breastbutton ‘the first duty of all poetry is to be mine sir—mine  inspiration now swells in my bosom because—to tell you the plain truth and descend a little in style—i am devilish relieved at the turn things have taken  so i dare say are you yourself dudgeon if you would only allow it  and à propos let me ask you a home question  between friends have you ever fired that pistol’  ‘why yes sir’ he replied  ‘twice—at hedgesparrows’  ‘and you would have fired at me you bloodyminded man’ i cried  ‘if you go to that you seemed mighty reckless with your stick’ said dudgeon  ‘did i indeed  well well ’tis all past history ancient as king pharamond—which is another french word if you cared to accumulate more evidence’ says i  ‘but happily we are now the best of friends and have all our interests in common’  ‘you go a little too fast if you’ll excuse me mr  i do not know your name that i am aware’ said dudgeon  ‘no to be sure’ said i  ‘never heard of it’  ‘a word of explanation—’ he began  ‘no dudgeon’ i interrupted  ‘be practical i know what you want and the name of it is supper  rien ne creuse comme l’emotion  i am hungry myself and yet i am more accustomed to warlike palpitations than you who are but a hunter of hedgesparrows  let me look at your face critically your bill of fare is three slices of cold rare roast beef a welsh rabbit a pot of stout and a glass or two of sound tawny port old in bottle—the right milk of englishmen’  methought there seemed a brightening in his eye and a melting about his mouth at this enumeration  ‘the night is young’ i continued ‘not much past eleven for a wager where can we find a good inn  and remark that i say good for the port must be up to the occasion—not a headache in a pipe of it’  ‘really sir’ he said smiling a little ‘you have a way of carrying things—’  ‘will nothing make you stick to the subject’ i cried ‘you have the most irrelevant mind  how do you expect to rise in your profession  the inn’  ‘well i will say you are a facetious gentleman’ said he  ‘you must have your way i see  we are not three miles from bedford by this very road’  ‘done’ cried i  ‘bedford be it’  i tucked his arm under mine possessed myself of the valise and walked him off unresisting  presently we came to an open piece of country lying a thought downhill  the road was smooth and free of ice the moonshine thin and bright over the meadows and the leafless trees  i was now honestly done with the purgatory of the covered cart i was close to my greatuncle’s i had no more fear of mr dudgeon which were all grounds enough for jollity  and i was aware besides of us two as of a pair of tiny and solitary dolls under the vast frosty cupola of the midnight the rooms decked the moon burnished the least of the stars lighted the floor swept and waxed and nothing wanting but for the band to strike up and the dancing to begin  in the exhilaration of my heart i took the music on myself—      ‘merrily danced the quaker’s wife     and merrily danced the quaker’  i broke into that animated and appropriate air clapped my arm about dudgeon’s waist and away down the hill at a dancing step  he hung back a little at the start but the impulse of the tune the night and my example were not to be resisted  a man made of putty must have danced and even dudgeon showed himself to be a human being  higher and higher were the capers that we cut the moon repeated in shadow our antic footsteps and gestures and it came over my mind of a sudden—really like balm—what appearance of man i was dancing with what a long bilious countenance he had shown under his shaven pate and what a world of trouble the rascal had given me in the immediate past  presently we began to see the lights of bedford  my puritanic companion stopped and disengaged himself  ‘this is a trifle infra dig sir is it not’ said he  ‘a party might suppose we had been drinking’  ‘and so you shall be dudgeon’ said i  ‘you shall not only be drinking you old hypocrite but you shall be drunk—dead drunk sir—and the boots shall put you to bed  we’ll warn him when we go in  never neglect a precaution never put off till tomorrow what you can do today’  but he had no more frivolity to complain of  we finished our stage and came to the inndoor with decorum to find the house still alight and in a bustle with many late arrivals to give our orders with a prompt severity which ensured obedience and to be served soon after at a sidetable close to the fire and in a blaze of candlelight with such a meal as i had been dreaming of for days past  for days you are to remember i had been skulking in the covered cart a prey to cold hunger and an accumulation of discomforts that might have daunted the most brave and the white table napery the bright crystal the reverberation of the fire the red curtains the turkey carpet the portraits on the coffeeroom wall the placid faces of the two or three late guests who were silently prolonging the pleasures of digestion and last but not by any means least a glass of an excellent light dry port put me in a humour only to be described as heavenly  the thought of the colonel of how he would have enjoyed this snug room and roaring fire and of his cold grave in the wood by market bosworth lingered on my palate amari aliquid like an aftertaste but was not able—i say it with shame—entirely to dispel my selfcomplacency  after all in this world every dog hangs by its own tail  i was a free adventurer who had just brought to a successful end—or at least within view of it—an adventure very difficult and alarming and i looked across at mr dudgeon as the port rose to his cheeks and a smile that was semiconfidential and a trifle foolish began to play upon his leathery features not only with composure but with a suspicion of kindness  the rascal had been brave a quality for which i would value the devil and if he had been pertinacious in the beginning he had more than made up for it before the end  ‘and now dudgeon to explain’ i began  ‘i know your master he knows me and he knows and approves of my errand  so much i may tell you that i am on my way to amersham place’  ‘oho’ quoth dudgeon ‘i begin to see’  ‘i am heartily glad of it’ said i passing the bottle ‘because that is about all i can tell you  you must take my word for the remainder either believe me or don’t  if you don’t let’s take a chaise you can carry me tomorrow to high holborn and confront me with mr romaine the result of which will be to set your mind at rest—and to make the holiest disorder in your master’s plans  if i judge you aright for i find you a shrewd fellow this will not be at all to your mind  you know what a subordinate gets by officiousness if i can trust my memory old romaine has not at all the face that i should care to see in anger and i venture to predict surprising results upon your weekly salary—if you are paid by the week that is  in short let me go free and ’tis an end of the matter take me to london and ’tis only a beginning—and by my opinion a beginning of troubles  you can take your choice’  ‘and that is soon taken’ said he  ‘go to amersham tomorrow or go to the devil if you prefer—i wash my hands of you and the whole transaction no you don’t find me putting my head in between romaine and a client  a good man of business sir but hard as millstone grit  i might get the sack and i shouldn’t wonder  but it’s a pity too’ he added and sighed shook his head and took his glass off sadly  ‘that reminds me’ said i  ‘i have a great curiosity and you can satisfy it  why were you so forward to meddle with poor mr dubois  why did you transfer your attentions to me  and generally what induced you to make yourself such a nuisance’  he blushed deeply  ‘why sir’ says he ‘there is such a thing as patriotism i hope’     chapter xvi—the homecoming of mr rowley’s viscount   by eight the next morning dudgeon and i had made our parting  by that time we had grown to be extremely familiar and i would very willingly have kept him by me and even carried him to amersham place  but it appeared he was due at the publichouse where we had met on some affairs of my greatuncle the count who had an outlying estate in that part of the shire  if dudgeon had had his way the night before i should have been arrested on my uncle’s land and by my uncle’s agent a culmination of illluck  a little after noon i started in a hired chaise by way of dunstable the mere mention of the name amersham place made every one supple and smiling  it was plainly a great house and my uncle lived there in style  the fame of it rose as we approached like a chain of mountains at bedford they touched their caps but in dunstable they crawled upon their bellies  i thought the landlady would have kissed me such a flutter of cordiality such smiles such affectionate attentions were called forth and the good lady bustled on my service in such a pother of ringlets and with such a jingling of keys  ‘you’re probably expected sir at the place  i do trust you may ’ave better accounts of his lordship’s ’elth sir  we understood that his lordship mosha de carwell was main bad  ha sir we shall all feel his loss poor dear noble gentleman and i’m sure nobody more polite  they do say sir his wealth is enormous and before the revolution quite a prince in his own country  but i beg your pardon sir ’ow i do run on to be sure and doubtless all beknown to you already  for you do resemble the family sir  i should have known you anywheres by the likeness to the dear viscount  ha poor gentleman he must ’ave a ’eavy ’eart these days’  in the same place i saw out of the innwindows a manservant passing in the livery of my house which you are to think i had never before seen worn or not that i could remember  i had often enough indeed pictured myself advanced to be a marshal a duke of the empire a grand cross of the legion of honour and some other kickshaws of the kind with a perfect rout of flunkeys correctly dressed in my own colours  but it is one thing to imagine and another to see it would be one thing to have these liveries in a house of my own in paris—it was quite another to find them flaunting in the heart of hostile england and i fear i should have made a fool of myself if the man had not been on the other side of the street and i at a onepane window  there was something illusory in this transplantation of the wealth and honours of a family a thing by its nature so deeply rooted in the soil something ghostly in this sense of homecoming so far from home  from dunstable i rolled away into a crescendo of similar impressions there are certainly few things to be compared with these castles or rather country seats of the english nobility and gentry nor anything at all to equal the servility of the population that dwells in their neighbourhood  though i was but driving in a hired chaise word of my destination seemed to have gone abroad and the women curtseyed and the men louted to me by the wayside  as i came near i began to appreciate the roots of this widespread respect  the look of my uncle’s park wall even from the outside had something of a princely character and when i came in view of the house itself a sort of madness of vicarious vainglory struck me dumb and kept me staring  it was about the size of the tuileries  it faced due north and the last rays of the sun that was setting like a redhot shot amidst a tumultuous gathering of snow clouds were reflected on the endless rows of windows  a portico of doric columns adorned the front and would have done honour to a temple the servant who received me at the door was civil to a fault—i had almost said to offence and the hall to which he admitted me through a pair of glass doors was warmed and already partly lighted by a liberal chimney heaped with the roots of beeches  ‘vicomte anne de st yves’ said i in answer to the man’s question whereupon he bowed before me lower still and stepping upon one side introduced me to the truly awful presence of the majordomo  i have seen many dignitaries in my time but none who quite equalled this eminent being who was good enough to answer to the unassuming name of dawson from him i learned that my uncle was extremely low a doctor in close attendance mr romaine expected at any moment and that my cousin the vicomte de st yves had been sent for the same morning  ‘it was a sudden seizure then’ i asked  well he would scarcely go as far as that  it was a decline a fading away sir but he was certainly took bad the day before had sent for mr romaine and the majordomo had taken it on himself a little later to send word to the viscount  ‘it seemed to me my lord’ said he ‘as if this was a time when all the fambly should be called together’  i approved him with my lips but not in my heart  dawson was plainly in the interests of my cousin  ‘and when can i expect to see my greatuncle the count’ said i  in the evening i was told in the meantime he would show me to my room which had been long prepared for me and i should be expected to dine in about an hour with the doctor if my lordship had no objections  my lordship had not the faintest  ‘at the same time’ i said ‘i have had an accident i have unhappily lost my baggage and am here in what i stand in  i don’t know if the doctor be a formalist but it is quite impossible i should appear at table as i ought’  he begged me to be under no anxiety  ‘we have been long expecting you’ said he  ‘all is ready’  such i found to be the truth  a great room had been prepared for me through the mullioned windows the last flicker of the winter sunset interchanged with the reverberation of a royal fire the bed was open a suit of evening clothes was airing before the blaze and from the far corner a boy came forward with deprecatory smiles  the dream in which i had been moving seemed to have reached its pitch  i might have quitted this house and room only the night before it was my own place that i had come to and for the first time in my life i understood the force of the words home and welcome  ‘this will be all as you would want sir’ said mr dawson  ‘this ’ere boy rowley we place entirely at your disposition  ’e’s not exactly a trained vallet but mossho powl the viscount’s gentleman ’ave give him the benefick of a few lessons and it is ’oped that he may give sitisfection  hanythink that you may require if you will be so good as to mention the same to rowley i will make it my business myself sir to see you sitisfied’  so saying the eminent and already detested mr dawson took his departure and i was left alone with rowley  a man who may be said to have wakened to consciousness in the prison of the abbaye among those ever graceful and ever tragic figures of the brave and fair awaiting the hour of the guillotine and denuded of every comfort i had never known the luxuries or the amenities of my rank in life  to be attended on by servants i had only been accustomed to in inns  my toilet had long been military to a moment at the note of a bugle too often at a ditchside and it need not be wondered at if i looked on my new valet with a certain diffidence  but i remembered that if he was my first experience of a valet i was his first trial as a master  cheered by which consideration i demanded my bath in a style of good assurance  there was a bathroom contiguous in an incredibly short space of time the hot water was ready and soon after arrayed in a shawl dressinggown and in a luxury of contentment and comfort i was reclined in an easychair before the mirror while rowley with a mixture of pride and anxiety which i could well understand laid out his razors  ‘hey rowley’ i asked not quite resigned to go under fire with such an inexperienced commander  ‘it’s all right is it  you feel pretty sure of your weapons’  ‘yes my lord’ he replied  ‘it’s all right i assure your lordship’  ‘i beg your pardon mr rowley ‘but for the sake of shortness would you mind not belording me in private’ said i  ‘it will do very well if you call me mr anne  it is the way of my country as i dare say you know’  mr rowley looked blank  ‘but you’re just as much a viscount as mr powl’s are you not’ he said  ‘as mr powl’s viscount’ said i laughing  ‘oh keep your mind easy mr rowley’s is every bit as good  only you see as i am of the younger line i bear my christian name along with the title  alain is the viscount i am the viscount anne  and in giving me the name of mr anne i assure you you will be quite regular’  ‘yes mr anne’ said the docile youth  ‘but about the shaving sir you need be under no alarm  mr powl says i ’ave excellent dispositions’  ‘mr powl’ said i  ‘that doesn’t seem to me very like a french name’  ‘no sir indeed my lord’ said he with a burst of confidence  ‘no indeed mr anne and it do not surely  i should say now it was more like mr pole’  ‘and mr powl is the viscount’s man’  ‘yes mr anne’ said he  ‘he ’ave a hard billet he do  the viscount is a very particular gentleman  i don’t think as you’ll be mr anne’ he added with a confidential smile in the mirror  he was about sixteen well set up with a pleasant merry freckled face and a pair of dancing eyes  there was an air at once deprecatory and insinuating about the rascal that i thought i recognised  there came to me from my own boyhood memories of certain passionate admirations long passed away and the objects of them long ago discredited or dead  i remembered how anxious i had been to serve those fleeting heroes how readily i told myself i would have died for them how much greater and handsomer than life they had appeared  and looking in the mirror it seemed to me that i read the face of rowley like an echo or a ghost by the light of my own youth  i have always contended somewhat against the opinion of my friends that i am first of all an economist and the last thing that i would care to throw away is that very valuable piece of property—a boy’s heroworship  ‘why’ said i ‘you shave like an angel mr rowley’  ‘thank you my lord’ says he  ‘mr powl had no fear of me you may be sure sir i should never ’ave had this berth if i ’adn’t ’ave been up to dick  we been expecting of you this month back  my eye  i never see such preparations  every day the fires has been kep’ up the bed made and all  as soon as it was known you were coming sir i got the appointment and i’ve been up and down since then like a jackinthebox a wheel couldn’t sound in the avenue but what i was at the window  i’ve had a many disappointments but tonight as soon as you stepped out of the shay i knew it was my—it was you  oh you had been expected  why when i go down to supper i’ll be the ’ero of the servants’ ’all the ’ole of the staff is that curious’  ‘well’ said i ‘i hope you may be able to give a fair account of me—sober steady industrious goodtempered and with a firstrate character from my last place’  he laughed an embarrassed laugh  ‘your hair curls beautiful’ he said by way of changing the subject  ‘the viscount’s the boy for curls though and the richness of it is mr powl tells me his don’t curl no more than that much twine—by nature  gettin’ old the viscount is  he ’ave gone the pace ’aven’t ’e sir’  ‘the fact is’ said i ‘that i know very little about him  our family has been much divided and i have been a soldier from a child’  ‘a soldier mr anne sir’ cried rowley with a sudden feverish animation  ‘was you ever wounded’  it is contrary to my principles to discourage admiration for myself and slipping back the shoulder of the dressinggown i silently exhibited the scar which i had received in edinburgh castle  he looked at it with awe  ‘ah well’ he continued ‘there’s where the difference comes in  it’s in the training  the other viscount have been horseracing and dicing and carrying on all his life  all right enough no doubt but what i do say is that it don’t lead to nothink  whereas—’  ‘whereas mr rowley’s’ i put in  ‘my viscount’ said he  ‘well sir i did say it and now that i’ve seen you i say it again’  i could not refrain from smiling at this outburst and the rascal caught me in the mirror and smiled to me again  ‘i’d say it again mr hanne’ he said  ‘i know which side my bread’s buttered  i know when a gen’leman’s a gen’leman  mr powl can go to putney with his one  beg your pardon mr anne for being so familiar’ said he blushing suddenly scarlet  ‘i was especially warned against it by mr powl’  ‘discipline before all’ said i  ‘follow your frontrank man  with that we began to turn our attention to the clothes  i was amazed to find them fit so well not à la diable in the haphazard manner of a soldier’s uniform or a readymade suit but with nicety as a trained artist might rejoice to make them for a favourite subject  ‘’tis extraordinary’ cried i ‘these things fit me perfectly’  ‘indeed mr anne you two be very much of a shape’ said rowley  ‘who  what two’ said i  ‘the viscount’ he said  ‘damnation  have i the man’s clothes on me too’ cried i  but rowley hastened to reassure me  on the first word of my coming the count had put the matter of my wardrobe in the hands of his own and my cousin’s tailors and on the rumour of our resemblance my clothes had been made to alain’s measure  ‘but they were all made for you express mr anne  you may be certain the count would never do nothing by ’alf fires kep’ burning the finest of clothes ordered i’m sure and a bodyservant being trained apurpose’  ‘well’ said i ‘it’s a good fire and a good setout of clothes and what a valet mr rowley  and there’s one thing to be said for my cousin—i mean for mr powl’s viscount—he has a very fair figure’  ‘oh don’t you be took in mr anne’ quoth the faithless rowley ‘he has to be hyked into a pair of stays to get them things on’  ‘come come mr rowley’ said i ‘this is telling tales out of school do not you be deceived  the greatest men of antiquity including caesar and hannibal and pope joan may have been very glad at my time of life or alain’s to follow his example  ’tis a misfortune common to all and really’ said i bowing to myself before the mirror like one who should dance the minuet ‘when the result is so successful as this who would do anything but applaud’  my toilet concluded i marched on to fresh surprises  my chamber my new valet and my new clothes had been beyond hope the dinner the soup the whole bill of fare was a revelation of the powers there are in man  i had not supposed it lay in the genius of any cook to create out of common beef and mutton things so different and dainty  the wine was of a piece the doctor a most agreeable companion nor could i help reflecting on the prospect that all this wealth comfort and handsome profusion might still very possibly become mine  here were a change indeed from the common soldier and the camp kettle the prisoner and his prison rations the fugitive and the horrors of the covered cart     chapter xvii—the despatchbox   the doctor had scarce finished his meal before he hastened with an apology to attend upon his patient and almost immediately after i was myself summoned and ushered up the great staircase and along interminable corridors to the bedside of my greatuncle the count  you are to think that up to the present moment i had not set eyes on this formidable personage only on the evidences of his wealth and kindness  you are to think besides that i had heard him miscalled and abused from my earliest childhood up  the first of the émigrés could never expect a good word in the society in which my father moved  even yet the reports i received were of a doubtful nature even romaine had drawn of him no very amiable portrait and as i was ushered into the room it was a critical eye that i cast on my greatuncle  he lay propped on pillows in a little cot no greater than a campbed not visibly breathing  he was about eighty years of age and looked it not that his face was much lined but all the blood and colour seemed to have faded from his body and even his eyes which last he kept usually closed as though the light distressed him  there was an unspeakable degree of slyness in his expression which kept me ill at ease he seemed to lie there with his arms folded like a spider waiting for prey  his speech was very deliberate and courteous but scarce louder than a sigh  ‘i bid you welcome monsieur le vicomte anne’ said he looking at me hard with his pale eyes but not moving on his pillows  ‘i have sent for you and i thank you for the obliging expedition you have shown  it is my misfortune that i cannot rise to receive you  i trust you have been reasonably well entertained’  ‘monsieur mon oncle’ i said bowing very low ‘i am come at the summons of the head of my family’  ‘it is well’ he said  ‘be seated  i should be glad to hear some news—if that can be called news that is already twenty years old—of how i have the pleasure to see you here’  by the coldness of his address not more than by the nature of the times that he bade me recall i was plunged in melancholy  i felt myself surrounded as with deserts of friendlessness and the delight of my welcome was turned to ashes in my mouth  ‘that is soon told monseigneur’ said i  ‘i understand that i need tell you nothing of the end of my unhappy parents  it is only the story of the lost dog’  ‘you are right  i am sufficiently informed of that deplorable affair it is painful to me  my nephew your father was a man who would not be advised’ said he  ‘tell me if you please simply of yourself’  ‘i am afraid i must run the risk of harrowing your sensibility in the beginning’ said i with a bitter smile ‘because my story begins at the foot of the guillotine  when the list came out that night and her name was there i was already old enough not in years but in sad experience to understand the extent of my misfortune  she—’  i paused  ‘enough that she arranged with a friend madame de chasserades that she should take charge of me and by the favour of our jailers i was suffered to remain in the shelter of the abbaye  that was my only refuge there was no corner of france that i could rest the sole of my foot upon except the prison  monsieur le comte you are as well aware as i can be what kind of a life that was and how swiftly death smote in that society  i did not wait long before the name of madame de chasserades succeeded to that of my mother on the list  she passed me on to madame de noytot she in her turn to mademoiselle de braye and there were others  i was the one thing permanent they were all transient as clouds a day or two of their care and then came the last farewell and—somewhere far off in that roaring paris that surrounded us—the bloody scene  i was the cherished one the last comfort of these dying women  i have been in pitched fights my lord and i never knew such courage  it was all done smiling in the tone of good society belle maman was the name i was taught to give to each and for a day or two the new “pretty mamma” would make much of me show me off teach me the minuet and to say my prayers and then with a tender embrace would go the way of her predecessors smiling  there were some that wept too  there was a childhood  all the time monsieur de culemberg kept his eye on me and would have had me out of the abbaye and in his own protection but my “pretty mammas” one after another resisted the idea  where could i be safer they argued and what was to become of them without the darling of the prison  well it was soon shown how safe i was  the dreadful day of the massacre came the prison was overrun none paid attention to me not even the last of my “pretty mammas” for she had met another fate  i was wandering distracted when i was found by some one in the interests of monsieur de culemberg  i understand he was sent on purpose i believe in order to reach the interior of the prison he had set his hand to nameless barbarities such was the price paid for my worthless whimpering little life  he gave me his hand it was wet and mine was reddened he led me unresisting  i remember but the one circumstance of my flight—it was my last view of my last pretty mamma  shall i describe it to you’ i asked the count with a sudden fierceness  ‘avoid unpleasant details’ observed my greatuncle gently  at these words a sudden peace fell upon me  i had been angry with the man before i had not sought to spare him and now in a moment i saw that there was nothing to spare  whether from natural heartlessness or extreme old age the soul was not at home and my benefactor who had kept the fire lit in my room for a month past—my only relative except alain whom i knew already to be a hired spy—had trodden out the last sparks of hope and interest  ‘certainly’ said i ‘and indeed the day for them is nearly over  i was taken to monsieur de culemberg’s—i presume sir that you know the abbe de culemberg’  he indicated assent without opening his eyes  ‘he was a very brave and a very learned man—’  ‘and a very holy one’ said my uncle civilly  ‘and a very holy one as you observe’ i continued  ‘he did an infinity of good and through all the terror kept himself from the guillotine  he brought me up and gave me such education as i have  it was in his house in the country at dammarie near melun that i made the acquaintance of your agent mr vicary who lay there in hiding only to fall a victim at the last to a gang of chauffeurs’  ‘that poor mr vicary’ observed my uncle  ‘he had been many times in my interests to france and this was his first failure  quel charmant homme n’estce pas’  ‘infinitely so’ said i  ‘but i would not willingly detain you any further with a story the details of which it must naturally be more or less unpleasant for you to hear  suffice it that by m de culemberg’s own advice i said farewell at eighteen to that kind preceptor and his books and entered the service of france and have since then carried arms in such a manner as not to disgrace my family’  ‘you narrate well vous aves la voix chaude’ said my uncle turning on his pillows as if to study me  ‘i have a very good account of you by monsieur de mauseant whom you helped in spain  and you had some education from the abbe de culemberg a man of a good house  yes you will do very well  you have a good manner and a handsome person which hurts nothing  we are all handsome in the family even i myself i have had my successes the memories of which still charm me  it is my intention my nephew to make of you my heir  i am not very well content with my other nephew monsieur le vicomte he has not been respectful which is the flattery due to age  and there are other matters’  i was half tempted to throw back in his face that inheritance so coldly offered  at the same time i had to consider that he was an old man and after all my relation and that i was a poor one in considerable straits with a hope at heart which that inheritance might yet enable me to realise  nor could i forget that however icy his manners he had behaved to me from the first with the extreme of liberality and—i was about to write kindness but the word in that connection would not come  i really owed the man some measure of gratitude which it would be an ill manner to repay if i were to insult him on his deathbed  ‘your will monsieur must ever be my rule’ said i bowing  ‘you have wit monsieur mon neveu’ said he ‘the best wit—the wit of silence  many might have deafened me with their gratitude  gratitude’ he repeated with a peculiar intonation and lay and smiled to himself ‘but to approach what is more important  as a prisoner of war will it be possible for you to be served heir to english estates  i have no idea long as i have dwelt in england i have never studied what they call their laws  on the other hand how if romaine should come too late i have two pieces of business to be transacted—to die and to make my will and however desirous i may be to serve you i cannot postpone the first in favour of the second beyond a very few hours’  ‘well sir i must then contrive to be doing as i did before’ said i  ‘not so’ said the count  ‘i have an alternative  i have just drawn my balance at my banker’s a considerable sum and i am now to place it in your hands  it will be so much for you and so much less—’ he paused and smiled with an air of malignity that surprised me  ‘but it is necessary it should be done before witnesses  monsieur le vicomte is of a particular disposition and an unwitnessed donation may very easily be twisted into a theft’  he touched a bell which was answered by a man having the appearance of a confidential valet  to him he gave a key  ‘bring me the despatchbox that came yesterday la ferriere’ said he ‘you will at the same time present my compliments to dr hunter and m l’abbe and request them to step for a few moments to my room’  the despatchbox proved to be rather a bulky piece of baggage covered with russia leather  before the doctor and an excellent old smiling priest it was passed over into my hands with a very clear statement of the disposer’s wishes immediately after which though the witnesses remained behind to draw up and sign a joint note of the transaction monsieur de kéroual dismissed me to my own room la ferriere following with the invaluable box  at my chamber door i took it from him with thanks and entered alone everything had been already disposed for the night the curtains drawn and the fire trimmed and rowley was still busy with my bedclothes  he turned round as i entered with a look of welcome that did my heart good indeed i had never a much greater need of human sympathy however trivial than at that moment when i held a fortune in my arms  in my uncle’s room i had breathed the very atmosphere of disenchantment  he had gorged my pockets he had starved every dignified or affectionate sentiment of a man  i had received so chilling an impression of age and experience that the mere look of youth drew me to confide in rowley he was only a boy his heart must beat yet he must still retain some innocence and natural feelings he could blurt out follies with his mouth he was not a machine to utter perfect speech  at the same time i was beginning to outgrow the painful impressions of my interview my spirits were beginning to revive and at the jolly empty looks of mr rowley as he ran forward to relieve me of the box st ives became himself again  ‘now rowley don’t be in a hurry’ said i  ‘this is a momentous juncture  man and boy you have been in my service about three hours you must already have observed that i am a gentleman of a somewhat morose disposition and there is nothing that i more dislike than the smallest appearance of familiarity  mr pole or mr powl probably in the spirit of prophecy warned you against this danger’  ‘yes mr anne’ said rowley blankly  ‘now there has just arisen one of those rare cases in which i am willing to depart from my principles  my uncle has given me a box—what you would call a christmas box  i don’t know what’s in it and no more do you perhaps i am an april fool or perhaps i am already enormously wealthy there might be five hundred pounds in this apparently harmless receptacle’  ‘lord mr anne’ cried rowley  ‘now rowley hold up your right hand and repeat the words of the oath after me’ said i laying the despatchbox on the table  ‘strike me blue if i ever disclose to mr powl or mr powl’s viscount or anything that is mr powl’s not to mention mr dawson and the doctor the treasures of the following despatchbox and strike me skyblue scarlet if i do not continually maintain uphold love honour and obey serve and follow to the four corners of the earth and the waters that are under the earth the hereinafter beforementioned only that i find i have neglected to mention him viscount anne de kéroual de styves commonly known as mr rowley’s viscount  so be it  amen’  he took the oath with the same exaggerated seriousness as i gave it to him  ‘now’ said i  ‘here is the key for you i will hold the lid with both hands in the meanwhile’  he turned the key  ‘bring up all the candles in the room and range them alongside  what is it to be  a live gorgon a jackinthebox or a spring that fires a pistol  on your knees sir before the prodigy’  so saying i turned the despatchbox upside down upon the table  at sight of the heap of bank paper and gold that lay in front of us between the candles or rolled upon the floor alongside i stood astonished  ‘o lord’ cried mr rowley ‘oh lordy lordy lord’ and he scrambled after the fallen guineas  ‘o my mr anne what a sight o’ money  why it’s like a blessed storybook  it’s like the forty thieves’  ‘now rowley let’s be cool let’s be businesslike’ said i  ‘riches are deceitful particularly when you haven’t counted them and the first thing we have to do is to arrive at the amount of my—let me say modest competency  if i’m not mistaken i have enough here to keep you in gold buttons all the rest of your life  you collect the gold and i’ll take the paper’  accordingly down we sat together on the hearthrug and for some time there was no sound but the creasing of bills and the jingling of guineas broken occasionally by the exulting exclamations of rowley  the arithmetical operation on which we were embarked took long and it might have been tedious to others not to me nor to my helper  ‘ten thousand pounds’ i announced at last  ‘ten thousand’ echoed mr rowley  and we gazed upon each other  the greatness of this fortune took my breath away  with that sum in my hands i need fear no enemies  people are arrested in nine cases out of ten not because the police are astute but because they themselves run short of money and i had here before me in the despatchbox a succession of devices and disguises that insured my liberty  not only so but as i felt with a sudden and overpowering thrill with ten thousand pounds in my hands i was become an eligible suitor  what advances i had made in the past as a private soldier in a military prison or a fugitive by the wayside could only be qualified or indeed excused as acts of desperation  and now i might come in by the front door i might approach the dragon with a lawyer at my elbow and rich settlements to offer  the poor french prisoner champdivers might be in a perpetual danger of arrest but the rich travelling englishman stives in his postchaise with his despatchbox by his side could smile at fate and laugh at locksmiths  i repeated the proverb exulting love laughs at locksmiths  in a moment by the mere coming of this money my love had become possible—it had come near it was under my hand—and it may be by one of the curiosities of human nature but it burned that instant brighter  ‘rowley’ said i ‘your viscount is a made man’  ‘why we both are sir’ said rowley  ‘yes both’ said i ‘and you shall dance at the wedding’ and i flung at his head a bundle of bank notes and had just followed it up with a handful of guineas when the door opened and mr romaine appeared upon the threshold     chapter xviii—mr romaine calls me names   feeling very much of a fool to be thus taken by surprise i scrambled to my feet and hastened to make my visitor welcome  he did not refuse me his hand but he gave it with a coldness and distance for which i was quite unprepared and his countenance as he looked on me was marked in a strong degree with concern and severity  ‘so sir i find you here’ said he in tones of little encouragement ‘is that you george  you can run away i have business with your master’  he showed rowley out and locked the door behind him  then he sat down in an armchair on one side of the fire and looked at me with uncompromising sternness  ‘i am hesitating how to begin’ said he  ‘in this singular labyrinth of blunders and difficulties that you have prepared for us i am positively hesitating where to begin  it will perhaps be best that you should read first of all this paragraph’  and he handed over to me a newspaper  the paragraph in question was brief  it announced the recapture of one of the prisoners recently escaped from edinburgh castle gave his name clausel and added that he had entered into the particulars of the recent revolting murder in the castle and denounced the murderer—      ‘it is a common soldier called champdivers who had himself escaped     and is in all probability involved in the common fate of his     comrades  in spite of the activity along all the forth and the east     coast nothing has yet been seen of the sloop which these desperadoes     seized at grangemouth and it is now almost certain that they have     found a watery grave’  at the reading of this paragraph my heart turned over  in a moment i saw my castle in the air ruined myself changed from a mere military fugitive into a hunted murderer fleeing from the gallows my love which had a moment since appeared so near to me blotted from the field of possibility  despair which was my first sentiment did not however endure for more than a moment  i saw that my companions had indeed succeeded in their unlikely design and that i was supposed to have accompanied and perished along with them by shipwreck—a most probable ending to their enterprise  if they thought me at the bottom of the north sea i need not fear much vigilance on the streets of edinburgh champdivers was wanted what was to connect him with st ives  major chevenix would recognise me if he met me that was beyond bargaining he had seen me so often his interest had been kindled to so high a point that i could hope to deceive him by no stratagem of disguise  well even so he would have a competition of testimony before him he knew clausel he knew me and i was sure he would decide for honour  at the same time the image of flora shot up in my mind’s eye with such a radiancy as fairly overwhelmed all other considerations the blood sprang to every corner of my body and i vowed i would see and win her if it cost my neck  ‘very annoying no doubt’ said i as i returned the paper to mr romaine  ‘is annoying your word for it’ said he  ‘exasperating if you like’ i admitted  ‘and true’ he inquired  ‘well true in a sense’ said i  ‘but perhaps i had better answer that question by putting you in possession of the facts’  ‘i think so indeed’ said he  i narrated to him as much as seemed necessary of the quarrel the duel the death of goguelat and the character of clausel  he heard me through in a forbidding silence nor did he at all betray the nature of his sentiments except that at the episode of the scissors i could observe his mulberry face to turn three shades paler  ‘i suppose i may believe you’ said he when i had done  ‘or else conclude this interview’ said i  ‘can you not understand that we are here discussing matters of the gravest import  can you not understand that i feel myself weighed with a load of responsibility on your account—that you should take this occasion to air your fireeating manners against your own attorney  there are serious hours in life mr anne’ he said severely  ‘a capital charge and that of a very brutal character and with singularly unpleasant details the presence of the man clausel who according to your account of it is actuated by sentiments of real malignity and prepared to swear black white all the other witnesses scattered and perhaps drowned at sea the natural prejudice against a frenchman and a runaway prisoner this makes a serious total for your lawyer to consider and is by no means lessened by the incurable folly and levity of your own disposition’  ‘i beg your pardon’ said i  ‘oh my expressions have been selected with scrupulous accuracy’ he replied  ‘how did i find you sir when i came to announce this catastrophe  you were sitting on the hearthrug playing like a silly baby with a servant were you not and the floor all scattered with gold and bank paper  there was a tableau for you  it was i who came and you were lucky in that  it might have been any one—your cousin as well as another’  ‘you have me there sir’ i admitted  ‘i had neglected all precautions and you do right to be angry  apropos mr romaine how did you come yourself and how long have you been in the house’ i added surprised on the retrospect not to have heard him arrive  ‘i drove up in a chaise and pair’ he returned  ‘any one might have heard me  but you were not listening i suppose being so extremely at your ease in the very house of your enemy and under a capital charge and i have been long enough here to do your business for you  ah yes i did it god forgive me—did it before i so much as asked you the explanation of the paragraph  for some time back the will has been prepared now it is signed and your uncle has heard nothing of your recent piece of activity  why  well i had no fancy to bother him on his deathbed you might be innocent and at bottom i preferred the murderer to the spy’  no doubt of it but the man played a friendly part no doubt also that in his illtemper and anxiety he expressed himself unpalatably  ‘you will perhaps find me over delicate’ said i  ‘there is a word you employed—’  ‘i employ the words of my brief sir’ he cried striking with his hand on the newspaper  ‘it is there in six letters  and do not be so certain—you have not stood your trial yet  it is an ugly affair a fishy business  it is highly disagreeable  i would give my hand off—i mean i would give a hundred pound down to have nothing to do with it  and situated as we are we must at once take action  there is here no choice  you must at once quit this country and get to france or holland or indeed to madagascar’  ‘there may be two words to that’ said i  ‘not so much as one syllable’ he retorted  ‘here is no room for argument  the case is nakedly plain  in the disgusting position in which you have found means to place yourself all that is to be hoped for is delay  a time may come when we shall be able to do better  it cannot be now now it would be the gibbet’  ‘you labour under a false impression mr romaine’ said i  ‘i have no impatience to figure in the dock  i am even as anxious as yourself to postpone my first appearance there  on the other hand i have not the slightest intention of leaving this country where i please myself extremely  i have a good address a ready tongue an english accent that passes and thanks to the generosity of my uncle as much money as i want  it would be hard indeed if with all these advantages mr st ives should not be able to live quietly in a private lodging while the authorities amuse themselves by looking for champdivers  you forget there is no connection between these two personages’  ‘and you forget your cousin’ retorted romaine  ‘there is the link there is the tongue of the buckle  he knows you are champdivers’  he put up his hand as if to listen  ‘and for a wager here he is himself’ he exclaimed  as when a tailor takes a piece of goods upon his counter and rends it across there came to our ears from the avenue the long tearing sound of a chaise and four approaching at the top speed of the horses  and looking out between the curtains we beheld the lamps skimming on the smooth ascent  ‘ay’ said romaine wiping the windowpane that he might see more clearly  ‘ay that is he by the driving  so he squanders money along the king’s highway the triple idiot gorging every man he meets with gold for the pleasure of arriving—where  ah yes where but a debtor’s jail if not a criminal prison’  ‘is he that kind of a man’ i said staring on these lamps as though i could decipher in them the secret of my cousin’s character  ‘you will find him a dangerous kind’ answered the lawyer  ‘for you these are the lights on a lee shore  i find i fall in a muse when i consider of him what a formidable being he once was and what a personable and how near he draws to the moment that must break him utterly we none of us like him here we hate him rather and yet i have a sense—i don’t think at my time of life it can be pity—but a reluctance rather to break anything so big and figurative as though he were a big porcelain pot or a big picture of high price  ay there is what i was waiting for’ he cried as the lights of a second chaise swam in sight ‘it is he beyond a doubt  the first was the signature and the next the flourish  two chaises the second following with the baggage which is always copious and ponderous and one of his valets he cannot go a step without a valet’  ‘i hear you repeat the word big’ said i  ‘but it cannot be that he is anything out of the way in stature’  ‘no’ said the attorney  ‘about your height as i guessed for the tailors and i see nothing wrong with the result  but somehow he commands an atmosphere he has a spacious manner and he has kept up all through life such a volume of racket about his personality with his chaises and his racers and his dicings and i know not what—that somehow he imposes  it seems when the farce is done and he locked in fleet prison—and nobody left but buonaparte and lord wellington and the hetman platoff to make a work about—the world will be in a comparison quite tranquil  but this is beside the mark’ he added with an effort turning again from the window  ‘we are now under fire mr anne as you soldiers would say and it is high time we should prepare to go into action  he must not see you that would be fatal  all that he knows at present is that you resemble him and that is much more than enough  if it were possible it would be well he should not know you were in the house’  ‘quite impossible depend upon it’ said i  ‘some of the servants are directly in his interests perhaps in his pay dawson for an example’  ‘my own idea’ cried romaine  ‘and at least’ he added as the first of the chaises drew up with a dash in front of the portico ‘it is now too late  here he is’  we stood listening with a strange anxiety to the various noises that awoke in the silent house the sound of doors opening and closing the sound of feet near at hand and farther off  it was plain the arrival of my cousin was a matter of moment almost of parade to the household and suddenly out of this confused and distant bustle a rapid and light tread became distinguishable  we heard it come upstairs draw near along the corridor pause at the door and a stealthy and hasty rapping succeeded  ‘mr anne—mr anne sir  let me in’ said the voice of rowley  we admitted the lad and locked the door again behind him  ‘it’s him sir’ he panted  ‘he’ve come’  ‘you mean the viscount’ said i  ‘so we supposed  but come rowley—out with the rest of it  you have more to tell us or your face belies you’  ‘mr anne i do’ he said  ‘mr romaine sir you’re a friend of his ain’t you’  ‘yes george i am a friend of his’ said romaine and to my great surprise laid his hand upon my shoulder  ‘well it’s this way’ said rowley—‘mr powl have been at me  it’s to play the spy  i thought he was at it from the first  from the first i see what he was after—coming round and round and hinting things  but tonight he outs with it plump  i’m to let him hear all what you’re to do beforehand he says and he gave me this for an arnest’—holding up half a guinea ‘and i took it so i did  strike me skyblue scarlet’ says he adducing the words of the mock oath and he looked askance at me as he did so  i saw that he had forgotten himself and that he knew it  the expression of his eye changed almost in the passing of the glance from the significant to the appealing—from the look of an accomplice to that of a culprit and from that moment he became the model of a welldrilled valet  ‘skyblue scarlet’ repeated the lawyer  ‘is the fool delirious’  ‘no’ said i ‘he is only reminding me of something’  ‘well—and i believe the fellow will be faithful’ said romaine  ‘so you are a friend of mr anne’s’ too’ he added to rowley  ‘if you please sir’ said rowley  ‘’tis something sudden’ observed romaine ‘but it may be genuine enough i believe him to be honest  he comes of honest people  well george rowley you might embrace some early opportunity to earn that halfguinea by telling mr powl that your master will not leave here till noon tomorrow if he go even then  tell him there are a hundred things to be done here and a hundred more that can only be done properly at my office in holborn  come to think of it—we had better see to that first of all’ he went on unlocking the door  ‘get hold of powl and see  and be quick back and clear me up this mess’  mr rowley was no sooner gone than the lawyer took a pinch of snuff and regarded me with somewhat of a more genial expression  ‘sir’ said he ‘it is very fortunate for you that your face is so strong a letter of recommendation  here am i a tough old practitioner mixing myself up with your very distressing business and here is this farmer’s lad who has the wit to take a bribe and the loyalty to come and tell you of it—all i take it on the strength of your appearance  i wish i could imagine how it would impress a jury’ says he  ‘and how it would affect the hangman sir’ i asked  ‘absit omen’ said mr romaine devoutly  we were just so far in our talk when i heard a sound that brought my heart into my mouth the sound of some one slyly trying the handle of the door  it had been preceded by no audible footstep  since the departure of rowley our wing of the house had been entirely silent  and we had every right to suppose ourselves alone and to conclude that the newcomer whoever he might be was come on a clandestine if not a hostile errand  ‘who is there’ asked romaine  ‘it’s only me sir’ said the soft voice of dawson  ‘it’s the viscount sir  he is very desirous to speak with you on business’  ‘tell him i shall come shortly dawson’ said the lawyer  ‘i am at present engaged’  ‘thank you sir’ said dawson  and we heard his feet draw off slowly along the corridor  ‘yes’ said mr romaine speaking low and maintaining the attitude of one intently listening ‘there is another foot  i cannot be deceived’  ‘i think there was indeed’ said i  ‘and what troubles me—i am not sure that the other has gone entirely away  by the time it got the length of the head of the stair the tread was plainly single’  ‘ahem—blockaded’ asked the lawyer  ‘a siege en règle’ i exclaimed  ‘let us come farther from the door’ said romaine ‘and reconsider this damnable position  without doubt alain was this moment at the door  he hoped to enter and get a view of you as if by accident  baffled in this has he stayed himself or has he planted dawson here by way of sentinel’  ‘himself beyond a doubt’ said i  ‘and yet to what end  he cannot think to pass the night there’  ‘if it were only possible to pay no heed’ said mr romaine  ‘but this is the accursed drawback of your position  we can do nothing openly  i must smuggle you out of this room and out of this house like seizable goods and how am i to set about it with a sentinel planted at your very door’  ‘there is no good in being agitated’ said i  ‘none at all’ he acquiesced  ‘and come to think of it it is droll enough that i should have been that very moment commenting on your personal appearance when your cousin came upon this mission  i was saying if you remember that your face was as good or better than a letter of recommendation  i wonder if m alain would be like the rest of us—i wonder what he would think of it’  mr romaine was sitting in a chair by the fire with his back to the windows and i was myself kneeling on the hearthrug and beginning mechanically to pick up the scattered bills when a honeyed voice joined suddenly in our conversation  ‘he thinks well of it mr romaine  he begs to join himself to that circle of admirers which you indicate to exist already’     chapter xix—the devil and all at amersham place   never did two human creatures get to their feet with more alacrity than the lawyer and myself  we had locked and barred the main gates of the citadel but unhappily we had left open the bathroom sallyport and here we found the voice of the hostile trumpets sounding from within and all our defences taken in reverse  i took but the time to whisper mr romaine in the ear ‘here is another tableau for you’ at which he looked at me a moment with a kind of pathos as who should say ‘don’t hit a man when he’s down’  then i transferred my eyes to my enemy  he had his hat on a little on one side it was a very tall hat raked extremely and had a narrow curling brim  his hair was all curled out in masses like an italian mountebank—a most unpardonable fashion  he sported a huge tippeted overcoat of frieze such as watchmen wear only the inside was lined with costly furs and he kept it half open to display the exquisite linen the manycoloured waistcoat and the profuse jewellery of watchchains and brooches underneath  the leg and the ankle were turned to a miracle  it is out of the question that i should deny the resemblance altogether since it has been remarked by so many different persons whom i cannot reasonably accuse of a conspiracy  as a matter of fact i saw little of it and confessed to nothing  certainly he was what some might call handsome of a pictorial exuberant style of beauty all attitude profile and impudence a man whom i could see in fancy parade on the grand stand at a racemeeting or swagger in piccadilly staring down the women and stared at himself with admiration by the coalporters  of his frame of mind at that moment his face offered a lively if an unconscious picture  he was lividly pale and his lip was caught up in a smile that could almost be called a snarl of a sheer arid malignity that appalled me and yet put me on my mettle for the encounter  he looked me up and down then bowed and took off his hat to me  ‘my cousin i presume’ he said  ‘i understand i have that honour’ i replied  ‘the honour is mine’ said he and his voice shook as he said it  ‘i should make you welcome i believe’ said i  ‘why’ he inquired  ‘this poor house has been my home for longer than i care to claim  that you should already take upon yourself the duties of host here is to be at unnecessary pains  believe me that part would be more becomingly mine  and by the way i must not fail to offer you my little compliment  it is a gratifying surprise to meet you in the dress of a gentleman and to see’—with a circular look upon the scattered bills—‘that your necessities have already been so liberally relieved’  i bowed with a smile that was perhaps no less hateful than his own  ‘there are so many necessities in this world’ said i  ‘charity has to choose  one gets relieved and some other no less indigent perhaps indebted must go wanting’  ‘malice is an engaging trait’ said he  ‘and envy i think’ was my reply  he must have felt that he was not getting wholly the better of this passage at arms perhaps even feared that he should lose command of his temper which he reined in throughout the interview as with a redhot curb for he flung away from me at the word and addressed the lawyer with insulting arrogance  ‘mr romaine’ he said ‘since when have you presumed to give orders in this house’  ‘i am not prepared to admit that i have given any’ replied romaine ‘certainly none that did not fall in the sphere of my responsibilities’  ‘by whose orders then am i denied entrance to my uncle’s room’ said my cousin  ‘by the doctor’s sir’ replied romaine ‘and i think even you will admit his faculty to give them’  ‘have a care sir’ cried alain  ‘do not be puffed up with your position  it is none so secure master attorney  i should not wonder in the least if you were struck off the rolls for this night’s work and the next i should see of you were when i flung you alms at a pothouse door to mend your ragged elbows  the doctor’s orders  but i believe i am not mistaken  you have tonight transacted business with the count and this needy young gentleman has enjoyed the privilege of still another interview in which as i am pleased to see his dignity has not prevented his doing very well for himself  i wonder that you should care to prevaricate with me so idly’  ‘i will confess so much’ said mr romaine ‘if you call it prevarication  the order in question emanated from the count himself he does not wish to see you’  ‘for which i must take the word of mr daniel romaine’ asked alain  ‘in default of any better’ said romaine  there was an instantaneous convulsion in my cousin’s face and i distinctly heard him gnash his teeth at this reply but to my surprise he resumed in tones of almost good humour  ‘come mr romaine do not let us be petty’  he drew in a chair and sat down  ‘understand you have stolen a march upon me  you have introduced your soldier of napoleon and how i cannot conceive he has been apparently accepted with favour  i ask no better proof than the funds with which i find him literally surrounded—i presume in consequence of some extravagance of joy at the first sight of so much money  the odds are so far in your favour but the match is not yet won  questions will arise of undue influence of sequestration and the like i have my witnesses ready  i tell it you cynically for you cannot profit by the knowledge and if the worst come to the worst i have good hopes of recovering my own and of ruining you’  ‘you do what you please’ answered romaine ‘but i give it you for a piece of good advice you had best do nothing in the matter  you will only make yourself ridiculous you will only squander money of which you have none too much and reap public mortification’  ‘ah but there you make the common mistake mr romaine’ returned alain ‘you despise your adversary  consider if you please how very disagreeable i could make myself if i chose  consider the position of your protégé—an escaped prisoner  but i play a great game  i condemn such petty opportunities’  at this romaine and i exchanged a glance of triumph  it seemed manifest that alain had as yet received no word of clausel’s recapture and denunciation  at the same moment the lawyer thus relieved of the instancy of his fear changed his tactics  with a great air of unconcern he secured the newspaper which still lay open before him on the table  ‘i think monsieur alain that you labour under some illusion’ said he ‘believe me this is all beside the mark  you seem to be pointing to some compromise  nothing is further from my views  you suspect me of an inclination to trifle with you to conceal how things are going  i cannot on the other hand be too early or too explicit in giving you information which concerns you i must say capitally  your greatuncle has tonight cancelled his will and made a new one in favour of your cousin anne  nay and you shall hear it from his own lips if you choose  i will take so much upon me’ said the lawyer rising  ‘follow me if you please gentlemen’  mr romaine led the way out of the room so briskly and was so briskly followed by alain that i had hard ado to get the remainder of the money replaced and the despatchbox locked and to overtake them even by running ere they should be lost in that maze of corridors my uncle’s house  as it was i went with a heart divided and the thought of my treasure thus left unprotected save by a paltry lid and lock that any one might break or pick open put me in a perspiration whenever i had the time to remember it  the lawyer brought us to a room begged us to be seated while he should hold a consultation with the doctor and slipping out of another door left alain and myself closeted together  truly he had done nothing to ingratiate himself his every word had been steeped in unfriendliness envy and that contempt which as it is born of anger it is possible to support without humiliation  on my part i had been little more conciliating and yet i began to be sorry for this man hired spy as i knew him to be  it seemed to me less than decent that he should have been brought up in the expectation of this great inheritance and now at the eleventh hour be tumbled forth out of the house door and left to himself his poverty and his debts—those debts of which i had so ungallantly reminded him so short a time before  and we were scarce left alone ere i made haste to hang out a flag of truce  ‘my cousin’ said i ‘trust me you will not find me inclined to be your enemy’  he paused in front of me—for he had not accepted the lawyer’s invitation to be seated but walked to and fro in the apartment—took a pinch of snuff and looked at me while he was taking it with an air of much curiosity  ‘is it even so’ said he  ‘am i so far favoured by fortune as to have your pity  infinitely obliged my cousin anne  but these sentiments are not always reciprocal and i warn you that the day when i set my foot on your neck the spine shall break  are you acquainted with the properties of the spine’ he asked with an insolence beyond qualification  it was too much  ‘i am acquainted also with the properties of a pair of pistols’ said i toising him  ‘no no no’ says he holding up his finger  ‘i will take my revenge how and when i please  we are enough of the same family to understand each other perhaps and the reason why i have not had you arrested on your arrival why i had not a picket of soldiers in the first clump of evergreens to await and prevent your coming—i who knew all before whom that pettifogger romaine has been conspiring in broad daylight to supplant me—is simply this that i had not made up my mind how i was to take my revenge’  at that moment he was interrupted by the tolling of a bell  as we stood surprised and listening it was succeeded by the sound of many feet trooping up the stairs and shuffling by the door of our room  both i believe had a great curiosity to set it open which each owing to the presence of the other resisted and we waited instead in silence and without moving until romaine returned and bade us to my uncle’s presence  he led the way by a little crooked passage which brought us out in the sickroom and behind the bed  i believe i have forgotten to remark that the count’s chamber was of considerable dimensions  we beheld it now crowded with the servants and dependants of the house from the doctor and the priest to mr dawson and the housekeeper from dawson down to rowley and the last footman in white calves the last plump chambermaid in her clean gown and cap and the last ostler in a stable waiscoat this large congregation of persons and i was surprised to see how large it was had the appearance for the most part of being ill at ease and heartily bewildered standing on one foot gaping like zanies and those who were in the corners nudging each other and grinning aside  my uncle on the other hand who was raised higher than i had yet seen him on his pillows wore an air of really imposing gravity  no sooner had we appeared behind him than he lifted his voice to a good loudness and addressed the assemblage  ‘i take you all to witness—can you hear me—i take you all to witness that i recognise as my heir and representative this gentleman whom most of you see for the first time the viscount anne de styves my nephew of the younger line  and i take you to witness at the same time that for very good reasons known to myself i have discarded and disinherited this other gentleman whom you all know the viscount de styves  i have also to explain the unusual trouble to which i have put you all—and since your supper was not over i fear i may even say annoyance  it has pleased m alain to make some threats of disputing my will and to pretend that there are among your number certain estimable persons who may be trusted to swear as he shall direct them  it pleases me thus to put it out of his power and to stop the mouths of his false witnesses  i am infinitely obliged by your politeness and i have the honour to wish you all a very good evening’  as the servants still greatly mystified crowded out of the sickroom door curtseying pulling the forelock scraping with the foot and so on according to their degree i turned and stole a look at my cousin he had borne this crushing public rebuke without change of countenance he stood now very upright with folded arms and looking inscrutably at the roof of the apartment  i could not refuse him at that moment the tribute of my admiration  still more so when the last of the domestics having filed through the doorway and left us alone with my greatuncle and the lawyer he took one step forward towards the bed made a dignified reverence and addressed the man who had just condemned him to ruin  ‘my lord’ said he ‘you are pleased to treat me in a manner which my gratitude and your state equally forbid me to call in question  it will be only necessary for me to call your attention to the length of time in which i have been taught to regard myself as your heir  in that position i judged it only loyal to permit myself a certain scale of expenditure  if i am now to be cut off with a shilling as the reward of twenty years of service i shall be left not only a beggar but a bankrupt’  whether from the fatigue of his recent exertion or by a wellinspired ingenuity of hate my uncle had once more closed his eyes nor did he open them now  ‘not with a shilling’ he contented himself with replying and there stole as he said it a sort of smile over his face that flickered there conspicuously for the least moment of time and then faded and left behind the old impenetrable mask of years cunning and fatigue  there could be no mistake my uncle enjoyed the situation as he had enjoyed few things in the last quarter of a century  the fires of life scarce survived in that frail body but hatred like some immortal quality was still erect and unabated  nevertheless my cousin persevered  ‘i speak at a disadvantage’ he resumed  ‘my supplanter with perhaps more wisdom than delicacy remains in the room’ and he cast a glance at me that might have withered an oak tree  i was only too willing to withdraw and romaine showed as much alacrity to make way for my departure  but my uncle was not to be moved  in the same breath of a voice and still without opening his eyes he bade me remain  ‘it is well’ said alain  ‘i cannot then go on to remind you of the twenty years that have passed over our heads in england and the services i may have rendered you in that time  it would be a position too odious your lordship knows me too well to suppose i could stoop to such ignominy  i must leave out all my defence—your lordship wills it so  i do not know what are my faults i know only my punishment and it is greater than i have the courage to face  my uncle i implore your pity pardon me so far do not send me for life into a debtors’ jail—a pauper debtor’  ‘chat et vieux pardonnez’ said my uncle quoting from la fontaine and then opening a paleblue eye full on alain he delivered with some emphasis      ‘la jeunesse se flatte et croit tout obtenir     la vieillesse est impitoyable’  the blood leaped darkly into alain’s face  he turned to romaine and me and his eyes flashed  ‘it is your turn now’ he said  ‘at least it shall be prison for prison with the two viscounts’  ‘not so mr alain by your leave’ said romaine  ‘there are a few formalities to be considered first’  but alain was already striding towards the door  ‘stop a moment stop a moment’ cried romaine  ‘remember your own counsel not to despise an adversary’  alain turned  ‘if i do not despise i hate you’ he cried giving a loose to his passion  ‘be warned of that both of you’  ‘i understand you to threaten monsieur le vicomte anne’ said the lawyer ‘do you know i would not do that  i am afraid i am very much afraid if you were to do as you propose you might drive me into extremes’  ‘you have made me a beggar and a bankrupt’ said alain  what extreme is left’  ‘i scarce like to put a name upon it in this company’ replied romaine ‘but there are worse things than even bankruptcy and worse places than a debtors’ jail’  the words were so significantly said that there went a visible thrill through alain sudden as a swordstroke he fell pale again  ‘i do not understand you’ said he  ‘o yes you do’ returned romaine  ‘i believe you understand me very well  you must not suppose that all this time while you were so very busy others were entirely idle  you must not fancy because i am an englishman that i have not the intelligence to pursue an inquiry  great as is my regard for the honour of your house m alain de styves if i hear of you moving directly or indirectly in this matter i shall do my duty let it cost what it will that is i shall communicate the real name of the buonapartist spy who signs his letters rue grégoire de tours’  i confess my heart was already almost altogether on the side of my insulted and unhappy cousin and if it had not been before it must have been so now so horrid was the shock with which he heard his infamy exposed  speech was denied him he carried his hand to his neckcloth he staggered i thought he must have fallen  i ran to help him and at that he revived recoiled before me and stood there with arms stretched forth as if to preserve himself from the outrage of my touch  ‘hands off’ he somehow managed to articulate  ‘you will now i hope’ pursued the lawyer without any change of voice ‘understand the position in which you are placed and how delicately it behoves you to conduct yourself  your arrest hangs if i may so express myself by a hair and as you will be under the perpetual vigilance of myself and my agents you must look to it narrowly that you walk straight  upon the least dubiety i will take action’  he snuffed looking critically at the tortured man  ‘and now let me remind you that your chaise is at the door  this interview is agitating to his lordship—it cannot be agreeable for you—and i suggest that it need not be further drawn out  it does not enter into the views of your uncle the count that you should again sleep under this roof’  as alain turned and passed without a word or a sign from the apartment i instantly followed  i suppose i must be at bottom possessed of some humanity at least this accumulated torture this slow butchery of a man as by quarters of rock had wholly changed my sympathies  at that moment i loathed both my uncle and the lawyer for their coldblooded cruelty  leaning over the banisters i was but in time to hear his hasty footsteps in that hall that had been crowded with servants to honour his coming and was now left empty against his friendless departure  a moment later and the echoes rang and the air whistled in my ears as he slammed the door on his departing footsteps  the fury of the concussion gave me had one been still wanted a measure of the turmoil of his passions  in a sense i felt with him i felt how he would have gloried to slam that door on my uncle the lawyer myself and the whole crowd of those who had been witnesses to his humiliation     chapter xx—after the storm   no sooner was the house clear of my cousin than i began to reckon up ruefully enough the probable results of what had passed  here were a number of pots broken and it looked to me as if i should have to pay for all  here had been this proud mad beast goaded and baited both publicly and privately till he could neither hear nor see nor reason whereupon the gate had been set open and he had been left free to go and contrive whatever vengeance he might find possible  i could not help thinking it was a pity that whenever i myself was inclined to be upon my good behaviour some friends of mine should always determine to play a piece of heroics and cast me for the hero—or the victim—which is very much the same  the first duty of heroics is to be of your own choosing  when they are not that they are nothing  and i assure you as i walked back to my own room i was in no very complaisant humour thought my uncle and mr romaine to have played knucklebones with my life and prospects cursed them for it roundly had no wish more urgent than to avoid the pair of them and was quite knocked out of time as they say in the ring to find myself confronted with the lawyer  he stood on my hearthrug leaning on the chimneypiece with a gloomy thoughtful brow as i was pleased to see and not in the least as though he were vain of the late proceedings  ‘well’ said i  ‘you have done it now’  ‘is he gone’ he asked  ‘he is gone’ said i  ‘we shall have the devil to pay with him when he comes back’  ‘you are right’ said the lawyer ‘and very little to pay him with but flams and fabrications like tonight’s’  ‘tonight’s’ i repeated  ‘ay tonight’s’ said he  ‘tonight’s what’ i cried  ‘tonight’s flams and fabrications’  ‘god be good to me sir’ said i ‘have i something more to admire in your conduct than ever i had suspected  you cannot think how you interest me  that it was severe i knew i had already chuckled over that  but that it should be false also  in what sense dear sir’  i believe i was extremely offensive as i put the question but the lawyer paid no heed  ‘false in all senses of the word’ he replied seriously  ‘false in the sense that they were not true and false in the sense that they were not real false in the sense that i boasted and in the sense that i lied how can i arrest him  your uncle burned the papers  i told you so—but doubtless you have forgotten—the day i first saw you in edinburgh castle it was an act of generosity i have seen many of these acts and always regretted—always regretted  “that shall be his inheritance” he said as the papers burned he did not mean that it should have proved so rich a one  how rich time will tell’  ‘i beg your pardon a hundred thousand times my dear sir but it strikes me you have the impudence—in the circumstances i may call it the indecency—to appear cast down’  ‘it is true’ said he ‘i am  i am cast down  i am literally cast down i feel myself quite helpless against your cousin’  ‘now really’ i asked  ‘is this serious  and is it perhaps the reason why you have gorged the poor devil with every species of insult and why you took such surprising pains to supply me with what i had so little need of—another enemy  that you were helpless against them  “here is my last missile” say you “my ammunition is quite exhausted just wait till i get the last in—it will irritate it cannot hurt him  there—you see—he is furious now and i am quite helpless  one more prod another kick now he is a mere lunatic  stand behind me i am quite helpless” mr romaine i am asking myself as to the background or motive of this singular jest and whether the name of it should not be called treachery’  ‘i can scarce wonder’ said he  ‘in truth it has been a singular business and we are very fortunate to be out of it so well  yet it was not treachery no no mr anne it was not treachery and if you will do me the favour to listen to me for the inside of a minute i shall demonstrate the same to you beyond cavil’  he seemed to wake up to his ordinary briskness  ‘you see the point’ he began  ‘he had not yet read the newspaper but who could tell when he might  he might have had that damned journal in his pocket and how should we know  we were—i may say we are—at the mercy of the merest twopenny accident’  ‘why true’ said i ‘i had not thought of that’  ‘i warrant you’ cried romaine ‘you had supposed it was nothing to be the hero of an interesting notice in the journals  you had supposed as like as not it was a form of secrecy  but not so in the least  a part of england is already buzzing with the name of champdivers a day or two more and the mail will have carried it everywhere so wonderful a machine is this of ours for disseminating intelligence  think of it  when my father was born—but that is another story  to return we had here the elements of such a combustion as i dread to think of—your cousin and the journal  let him but glance an eye upon that column of print and where were we  it is easy to ask not so easy to answer my young friend  and let me tell you this sheet is the viscount’s usual reading  it is my conviction he had it in his pocket’  ‘i beg your pardon sir’ said i  ‘i have been unjust  i did not appreciate my danger’  ‘i think you never do’ said he  ‘but yet surely that public scene—’ i began  ‘it was madness  i quite agree with you’ mr romaine interrupted  ‘but it was your uncle’s orders mr anne and what could i do  tell him you were the murderer of goguelat  i think not’  ‘no sure’ said i  ‘that would but have been to make the trouble thicker  we were certainly in a very ill posture’  ‘you do not yet appreciate how grave it was’ he replied  ‘it was necessary for you that your cousin should go and go at once  you yourself had to leave tonight under cover of darkness and how could you have done that with the viscount in the next room  he must go then he must leave without delay  and that was the difficulty’  ‘pardon me mr romaine but could not my uncle have bidden him go’ i asked  ‘why i see i must tell you that this is not so simple as it sounds’ he replied  ‘you say this is your uncle’s house and so it is  but to all effects and purposes it is your cousin’s also  he has rooms here has had them coming on for thirty years now and they are filled with a prodigious accumulation of trash—stays i dare say and powderpuffs and such effeminate idiocy—to which none could dispute his title even suppose any one wanted to  we had a perfect right to bid him go and he had a perfect right to reply “yes i will go but not without my stays and cravats  i must first get together the ninehundredandninetynine chestsfull of insufferable rubbish that i have spent the last thirty years collecting—and may very well spend the next thirty hours apacking of”  and what should we have said to that’  ‘by way of repartee’ i asked  ‘two tall footmen and a pair of crabtree cudgels i suggest’  ‘the lord deliver me from the wisdom of laymen’ cried romaine  ‘put myself in the wrong at the beginning of a lawsuit  no indeed  there was but one thing to do and i did it and burned my last cartridge in the doing of it  i stunned him  and it gave us three hours by which we should make haste to profit for if there is one thing sure it is that he will be up to time again tomorrow in the morning’  ‘well’ said i ‘i own myself an idiot  well do they say an old soldier an old innocent  for i guessed nothing of all this’  ‘and guessing it have you the same objections to leave england’ he inquired  ‘the same’ said i  ‘it is indispensable’ he objected  ‘and it cannot be’ i replied  ‘reason has nothing to say in the matter and i must not let you squander any of yours  it will be enough to tell you this is an affair of the heart’  ‘is it even so’ quoth romaine nodding his head  ‘and i might have been sure of it  place them in a hospital put them in a jail in yellow overalls do what you will young jessamy finds young jenny  o have it your own way i am too old a hand to argue with young gentlemen who choose to fancy themselves in love i have too much experience thank you  only be sure that you appreciate what you risk the prison the dock the gallows and the halter—terribly vulgar circumstances my young friend grim sordid earnest no poetry in that’  ‘and there i am warned’ i returned gaily  ‘no man could be warned more finely or with a greater eloquence  and i am of the same opinion still until i have again seen that lady nothing shall induce me to quit great britain  i have besides—’  and here i came to a full stop  it was upon my tongue to have told him the story of the drovers but at the first word of it my voice died in my throat  there might be a limit to the lawyer’s toleration i reflected i had not been so long in britain altogether for the most part of that time i had been by the heels in limbo in edinburgh castle and already i had confessed to killing one man with a pair of scissors and now i was to go on and plead guilty to having settled another with a holly stick a wave of discretion went over me as cold and as deep as the sea  ‘in short sir this is a matter of feeling’ i concluded ‘and nothing will prevent my going to edinburgh’  if i had fired a pistol in his ear he could not have been more startled  ‘to edinburgh’ he repeated  ‘edinburgh where the very pavingstones know you’  ‘then is the murder out’ said i  ‘but mr romaine is there not sometimes safety in boldness  is it not a commonplace of strategy to get where the enemy least expects you  and where would he expect me less’  ‘faith there is something in that too’ cried the lawyer  ‘ay certainly a great deal in that  all the witnesses drowned but one and he safe in prison you yourself changed beyond recognition—let us hope—and walking the streets of the very town you have illustrated by your—well your eccentricity  it is not badly combined indeed’  ‘you approve it then’ said i  ‘o approve’ said he ‘there is no question of approval  there is only one course which i could approve and that were to escape to france instanter’  ‘you do not wholly disapprove at least’ i substituted  ‘not wholly and it would not matter if i did’ he replied  ‘go your own way you are beyond argument  and i am not sure that you will run more danger by that course than by any other  give the servants time to get to bed and fall asleep then take a country crossroad and walk as the rhyme has it like blazes all night  in the morning take a chaise or take the mail at pleasure and continue your journey with all the decorum and reserve of which you shall be found capable’  ‘i am taking the picture in’ i said  ‘give me time  ’tis the tout ensemble i must see the whole as opposed to the details’  ‘mountebank’ he murmured  ‘yes i have it now and i see myself with a servant and that servant is rowley’ said i  ‘so as to have one more link with your uncle’ suggested the lawyer ‘very judicious’  ‘and pardon me but that is what it is’ i exclaimed  ‘judicious is the word  i am not making a deception fit to last for thirty years i do not found a palace in the living granite for the night  this is a shelter tent—a flying picture—seen admired and gone again in the wink of an eye  what is wanted in short is a trompel’œil that shall be good enough for twelve hours at an inn is it not so’  ‘it is and the objection holds  rowley is but another danger’ said romaine  ‘rowley’ said i ‘will pass as a servant from a distance—as a creature seen poised on the dicky of a bowling chaise  he will pass at hand as a smart civil fellow one meets in the inn corridor and looks back at and asks and is told “gentleman’s servant in number 4”  he will pass in fact all round except with his personal friends  my dear sir pray what do you expect  of course if we meet my cousin or if we meet anybody who took part in the judicious exhibition of this evening we are lost and who’s denying it  to every disguise however good and safe there is always the weak point you must always take let us say—and to take a simile from your own waistcoat pocket a snuff boxfull of risk you’ll get it just as small with rowley as with anybody else  and the long and short of it is the lad’s honest he likes me i trust him he is my servant or nobody’  ‘he might not accept’ said romaine  ‘i bet you a thousand pounds he does’ cried i  ‘but no matter all you have to do is to send him out tonight on this crosscountry business and leave the thing to me  i tell you he will be my servant and i tell you he will do well’  i had crossed the room and was already overhauling my wardrobe as i spoke  ‘well’ concluded the lawyer with a shrug ‘one risk with another à la guerre comme à la guerre as you would say  let the brat come and be useful at least’  and he was about to ring the bell when his eye was caught by my researches in the wardrobe  ‘do not fall in love with these coats waistcoats cravats and other panoply and accoutrements by which you are now surrounded  you must not run the post as a dandy  it is not the fashion even’  ‘you are pleased to be facetious sir’ said i ‘and not according to knowledge  these clothes are my life they are my disguise and since i can take but few of them i were a fool indeed if i selected hastily will you understand once and for all what i am seeking  to be invisible is the first point the second to be invisible in a postchaise and with a servant  can you not perceive the delicacy of the quest  nothing must be too coarse nothing too fine rien de voyant rien qui détonne so that i may leave everywhere the inconspicuous image of a handsome young man of a good fortune travelling in proper style whom the landlord will forget in twelve hours—and the chambermaid perhaps remember god bless her with a sigh  this is the very fine art of dress’  ‘i have practised it with success for fifty years’ said romaine with a chuckle  ‘a black suit and a clean shirt is my infallible recipe’  ‘you surprise me i did not think you would be shallow’ said i lingering between two coats  ‘pray mr romaine have i your head or did you travel post and with a smartish servant’  ‘neither i admit’ said he  ‘which change the whole problem’ i continued  ‘i have to dress for a smartish servant and a russia leather despatchbox’  that brought me to a stand  i came over and looked at the box with a moment’s hesitation ‘yes’ i resumed  ‘yes and for the despatchbox  it looks moneyed and landed it means i have a lawyer  it is an invaluable property  but i could have wished it to hold less money  the responsibility is crushing should i not do more wisely to take five hundred pounds and intrust the remainder with you mr romaine’  ‘if you are sure you will not want it’ answered romaine  ‘i am far from sure of that’ cried i  ‘in the first place as a philosopher  this is the first time i have been at the head of a large sum and it is conceivable—who knows himself—that i may make it fly  in the second place as a fugitive  who knows what i may need  the whole of it may be inadequate  but i can always write for more’  ‘you do not understand’ he replied  ‘i break off all communication with you here and now  you must give me a power of attorney ere you start tonight and then be done with me trenchantly until better days’  i believe i offered some objection  ‘think a little for once of me’ said romaine  ‘i must not have seen you before tonight  tonight we are to have had our only interview and you are to have given me the power and tonight i am to have lost sight of you again—i know not whither you were upon business it was none of my affairs to question you  and this you are to remark in the interests of your own safety much more than mine’  ‘i am not even to write to you’ i said a little bewildered  ‘i believe i am cutting the last strand that connects you with common sense’ he replied  ‘but that is the plain english of it  you are not even to write and if you did i would not answer’  ‘a letter however—’ i began  ‘listen to me’ interrupted romaine  ‘so soon as your cousin reads the paragraph what will he do  put the police upon looking into my correspondence  so soon as you write to me in short you write to bow street and if you will take my advice you will date that letter from france’  ‘the devil’ said i for i began suddenly to see that this might put me out of the way of my business  ‘what is it now’ says he  ‘there will be more to be done then before we can part’ i answered  ‘i give you the whole night’ said he  ‘so long as you are off ere daybreak i am content’  ‘in short mr romaine’ said i ‘i have had so much benefit of your advice and services that i am loth to sever the connection and would even ask a substitute  i would be obliged for a letter of introduction to one of your own cloth in edinburgh—an old man for choice very experienced very respectable and very secret  could you favour me with such a letter’  ‘why no’ said he  ‘certainly not  i will do no such thing indeed’  ‘it would be a great favour sir’ i pleaded  ‘it would be an unpardonable blunder’ he replied  ‘what  give you a letter of introduction and when the police come i suppose i must forget the circumstance  no indeed  talk of it no more’  ‘you seem to be always in the right’ said i  ‘the letter would be out of the question i quite see that  but the lawyer’s name might very well have dropped from you in the way of conversation having heard him mentioned i might profit by the circumstance to introduce myself and in this way my business would be the better done and you not in the least compromised’  ‘what is this business’ said romaine  ‘i have not said that i had any’ i replied  ‘it might arise  this is only a possibility that i must keep in view’  ‘well’ said he with a gesture of the hands ‘i mention mr robbie and let that be an end of it—or wait’ he added ‘i have it  here is something that will serve you for an introduction and cannot compromise me’  and he wrote his name and the edinburgh lawyer’s address on a piece of card and tossed it to me     chapter xxi—i become the owner of a claretcoloured chaise   what with packing signing papers and partaking of an excellent cold supper in the lawyer’s room it was past two in the morning before we were ready for the road  romaine himself let us out of a window in a part of the house known to rowley it appears it served as a kind of postern to the servants’ hall by which when they were in the mind for a clandestine evening they would come regularly in and out and i remember very well the vinegar aspect of the lawyer on the receipt of this piece of information—how he pursed his lips jutted his eyebrows and kept repeating ‘this must be seen to indeed this shall be barred tomorrow in the morning’  in this preoccupation i believe he took leave of me without observing it our things were handed out we heard the window shut behind us and became instantly lost in a horrid intricacy of blackness and the shadow of woods  a little wet snow kept sleepily falling pausing and falling again it seemed perpetually beginning to snow and perpetually leaving off and the darkness was intense  time and again we walked into trees time and again found ourselves adrift among garden borders or stuck like a ram in the thicket  rowley had possessed himself of the matches and he was neither to be terrified nor softened  ‘no i will not mr anne sir’ he would reply  ‘you know he tell me to wait till we were over the ’ill it’s only a little way now  why and i thought you was a soldier too’ i was at least a very glad soldier when my valet consented at last to kindle a thieves’ match  from this we easily lit the lantern and thenceforward through a labyrinth of woodland paths were conducted by its uneasy glimmer  both booted and greatcoated with tall hats much of a shape and laden with booty in the form of a despatchbox a case of pistols and two plump valises i thought we had very much the look of a pair of brothers returning from the sack of amersham place  we issued at last upon a country byroad where we might walk abreast and without precaution  it was nine miles to aylesbury our immediate destination by a watch which formed part of my new outfit it should be about halfpast three in the morning and as we did not choose to arrive before daylight time could not be said to press  i gave the order to march at ease  ‘now rowley’ said i ‘so far so good  you have come in the most obliging manner in the world to carry these valises  the question is what next  what are we to do at aylesbury or more particularly what are you  thence i go on a journey  are you to accompany me’  he gave a little chuckle  ‘that’s all settled already mr anne sir’ he replied  ‘why i’ve got my things here in the valise—a half a dozen shirts and what not i’m all ready sir just you lead on you’ll see’  ‘the devil you have’ said i  ‘you made pretty sure of your welcome’  ‘if you please sir’ said rowley  he looked up at me in the light of the lantern with a boyish shyness and triumph that awoke my conscience  i could never let this innocent involve himself in the perils and difficulties that beset my course without some hint of warning which it was a matter of extreme delicacy to make plain enough and not too plain  ‘no no’ said i ‘you may think you have made a choice but it was blindfold and you must make it over again  the count’s service is a good one what are you leaving it for  are you not throwing away the substance for the shadow  no do not answer me yet  you imagine that i am a prosperous nobleman just declared my uncle’s heir on the threshold of the best of good fortune and from the point of view of a judicious servant a jewel of a master to serve and stick to  well my boy i am nothing of the kind nothing of the kind’  as i said the words i came to a full stop and held up the lantern to his face  he stood before me brilliantly illuminated on the background of impenetrable night and falling snow stricken to stone between his double burden like an ass between two panniers and gaping at me like a blunderbuss  i had never seen a face so predestined to be astonished or so susceptible of rendering the emotion of surprise and it tempted me as an open piano tempts the musician  ‘nothing of the sort rowley’ i continued in a churchyard voice ‘these are appearances petty appearances  i am in peril homeless hunted  i count scarce any one in england who is not my enemy  from this hour i drop my name my title i become nameless my name is proscribed  my liberty my life hang by a hair  the destiny which you will accept if you go forth with me is to be tracked by spies to hide yourself under a false name to follow the desperate pretences and perhaps share the fate of a murderer with a price upon his head’  his face had been hitherto beyond expectation passing from one depth to another of tragic astonishment and really worth paying to see but at this it suddenly cleared  ‘oh i ain’t afraid’ he said and then choking into laughter ‘why i see it from the first’  i could have beaten him  but i had so grossly overshot the mark that i suppose it took me two good miles of road and half an hour of elocution to persuade him i had been in earnest  in the course of which i became so interested in demonstrating my present danger that i forgot all about my future safety and not only told him the story of goguelat but threw in the business of the drovers as well and ended by blurting out that i was a soldier of napoleon’s and a prisoner of war  this was far from my views when i began and it is a common complaint of me that i have a long tongue  i believe it is a fault beloved by fortune  which of you considerate fellows would have done a thing at once so foolhardy and so wise as to make a confidant of a boy in his teens and positively smelling of the nursery  and when had i cause to repent it  there is none so apt as a boy to be the adviser of any man in difficulties such as mine  to the beginnings of virile common sense he adds the last lights of the child’s imagination and he can fling himself into business with that superior earnestness that properly belongs to play  and rowley was a boy made to my hand  he had a high sense of romance and a secret cultus for all soldiers and criminals  his travelling library consisted of a chapbook life of wallace and some sixpenny parts of the ‘old bailey sessions papers’ by gurney the shorthand writer and the choice depicts his character to a hair  you can imagine how his new prospects brightened on a boy of this disposition  to be the servant and companion of a fugitive a soldier and a murderer rolled in one—to live by stratagems disguises and false names in an atmosphere of midnight and mystery so thick that you could cut it with a knife—was really i believe more dear to him than his meals though he was a great trencherman and something of a glutton besides  for myself as the peg by which all this romantic business hung i was simply idolised from that moment and he would rather have sacrificed his hand than surrendered the privilege of serving me  we arranged the terms of our campaign trudging amicably in the snow which now with the approach of morning began to fall to purpose  i chose the name of ramornie i imagine from its likeness to romaine rowley from an irresistible conversion of ideas i dubbed gammon  his distress was laughable to witness his own choice of an unassuming nickname had been claude duval  we settled our procedure at the various inns where we should alight rehearsed our little manners like a piece of drill until it seemed impossible we should ever be taken unprepared and in all these dispositions you maybe sure the despatchbox was not forgotten  who was to pick it up who was to set it down who was to remain beside it who was to sleep with it—there was no contingency omitted all was gone into with the thoroughness of a drillsergeant on the one hand and a child with a new plaything on the other  ‘i say wouldn’t it look queer if you and me was to come to the posthouse with all this luggage’ said rowley  ‘i dare say’ i replied  ‘but what else is to be done’  ‘well now sir—you hear me’ says rowley  ‘i think it would look more naturallike if you was to come to the posthouse alone and with nothing in your ’ands—more like a gentleman you know  and you might say that your servant and baggage was awaiting for you up the road  i think i could manage somehow to make a shift with all them dratted things—leastways if you was to give me a ’and up with them at the start’  ‘and i would see you far enough before i allowed you to try mr rowley’ i cried  ‘why you would be quite defenceless  a footpad that was an infant child could rob you  and i should probably come driving by to find you in a ditch with your throat cut  but there is something in your idea for all that and i propose we put it in execution no farther forward than the next corner of a lane’  accordingly instead of continuing to aim for aylesbury we headed by crossroads for some point to the northward of it whither i might assist rowley with the baggage and where i might leave him to await my return in the postchaise  it was snowing to purpose the country all white and ourselves walking snowdrifts when the first glimmer of the morning showed us an inn upon the highwayside  some distance off under the shelter of a corner of the road and a clump of trees i loaded rowley with the whole of our possessions and watched him till he staggered in safety into the doors of the green dragon which was the sign of the house  thence i walked briskly into aylesbury rejoicing in my freedom and the causeless good spirits that belong to a snowy morning though to be sure long before i had arrived the snow had again ceased to fall and the eaves of aylesbury were smoking in the level sun  there was an accumulation of gigs and chaises in the yard and a great bustle going forward in the coffeeroom and about the doors of the inn  at these evidences of so much travel on the road i was seized with a misgiving lest it should be impossible to get horses and i should be detained in the precarious neighbourhood of my cousin  hungry as i was i made my way first of all to the postmaster where he stood—a big athletic horseylooking man blowing into a key in the corner of the yard  on my making my modest request he awoke from his indifference into what seemed passion  ‘a po’shay and ’osses’ he cried  ‘do i look as if i ’ad a po’shay and ’osses  damn me if i ’ave such a thing on the premises  i don’t make ’osses and chaises—i ’ire ’em  you might be god almighty’ said he and instantly as if he had observed me for the first time he broke off and lowered his voice into the confidential  ‘why now that i see you are a gentleman’ said he ‘i’ll tell you what  if you like to buy i have the article to fit you  second’and shay by lycett of london latest style good as new  superior fittin’s net on the roof baggage platform pistol ’olsters—the most complete and the most genteel turnout i ever see  the ’ole for seventyfive pound  it’s as good as givin’ her away’  ‘do you propose i should trundle it myself like a hawker’s barrow’ said i  ‘why my good man if i had to stop here anyway i should prefer to buy a house and garden’  ‘come and look at her’ he cried and with the word links his arm in mine and carries me to the outhouse where the chaise was on view  it was just the sort of chaise that i had dreamed of for my purpose eminently rich inconspicuous and genteel for though i thought the postmaster no great authority i was bound to agree with him so far  the body was painted a dark claret and the wheels an invisible green  the lamp and glasses were bright as silver and the whole equipage had an air of privacy and reserve that seemed to repel inquiry and disarm suspicion with a servant like rowley and a chaise like this i felt that i could go from the land’s end to john o’ groat’s house amid a population of bowing ostlers  and i suppose i betrayed in my manner the degree in which the bargain tempted me  ‘come’ cried the postmaster—‘i’ll make it seventy to oblige a friend’  ‘the point is the horses’ said i  ‘well’ said he consulting his watch ‘it’s now gone the ’alf after eight  what time do you want her at the door’  ‘horses and all’ said i  ‘’osses and all’ says he  ‘one good turn deserves another  you give me seventy pound for the shay and i’ll ’oss it for you  i told you i didn’t make ’osses but i can make ’em to oblige a friend’  what would you have  it was not the wisest thing in the world to buy a chaise within a dozen miles of my uncle’s house but in this way i got my horses for the next stage  and by any other it appeared that i should have to wait  accordingly i paid the money down—perhaps twenty pounds too much though it was certainly a wellmade and wellappointed vehicle—ordered it round in half an hour and proceeded to refresh myself with breakfast  the table to which i sat down occupied the recess of a baywindow and commanded a view of the front of the inn where i continued to be amused by the successive departures of travellers—the fussy and the offhand the niggardly and the lavish—all exhibiting their different characters in that diagnostic moment of the farewell some escorted to the stirrup or the chaise door by the chamberlain the chambermaids and the waiters almost in a body others moving off under a cloud without human countenance  in the course of this i became interested in one for whom this ovation began to assume the proportions of a triumph not only the underservants but the barmaid the landlady and my friend the postmaster himself crowding about the steps to speed his departure  i was aware at the same time of a good deal of merriment as though the traveller were a man of a ready wit and not too dignified to air it in that society  i leaned forward with a lively curiosity and the next moment i had blotted myself behind the teapot  the popular traveller had turned to wave a farewell and behold he was no other than my cousin alain  it was a change of the sharpest from the angry pallid man i had seen at amersham place  ruddy to a fault illuminated with vintages crowned with his curls like bacchus he now stood before me for an instant the perfect master of himself smiling with airs of conscious popularity and insufferable condescension  he reminded me at once of a royal duke or an actor turned a little elderly and of a blatant bagman who should have been the illegitimate son of a gentleman  a moment after he was gliding noiselessly on the road to london  i breathed again  i recognised with heartfelt gratitude how lucky i had been to go in by the stableyard instead of the hostelry door and what a fine occasion of meeting my cousin i had lost by the purchase of the claretcoloured chaise  the next moment i remembered that there was a waiter present  no doubt but he must have observed me when i crouched behind the breakfast equipage no doubt but he must have commented on this unusual and undignified behaviour and it was essential that i should do something to remove the impression  ‘waiter’ said i ‘that was the nephew of count carwell that just drove off wasn’t it’  ‘yes sir viscount carwell we calls him’ he replied  ‘ah i thought as much’ said i  ‘well well damn all these frenchmen say i’  ‘you may say so indeed sir’ said the waiter  ‘they ain’t not to say in the same field with our ’omeraised gentry’  ‘nasty tempers’ i suggested  ‘beas’ly temper sir the viscount ’ave’ said the waiter with feeling ‘why no longer agone than this morning he was sitting breakfasting and reading in his paper  i suppose sir he come on some pilitical information or it might be about ’orses but he raps his ’and upon the table sudden and calls for curacoa  it gave me quite a turn it did he did it that sudden and ’ard  now sir that may be manners in france but hall i can say is that i’m not used to it’  ‘reading the paper was he’ said i  ‘what paper eh’  ‘here it is sir’ exclaimed the waiter  ‘seems like as if he’d dropped it’  and picking it off the floor he presented it to me  i may say that i was quite prepared that i already knew what to expect but at sight of the cold print my heart stopped beating  there it was the fulfilment of romaine’s apprehension was before me the paper was laid open at the capture of clausel  i felt as if i could take a little curacoa myself but on second thoughts called for brandy  it was badly wanted and suddenly i observed the waiter’s eye to sparkle as it were with some recognition made certain he had remarked the resemblance between me and alain and became aware—as by a revelation—of the fool’s part i had been playing  for i had now managed to put my identification beyond a doubt if alain should choose to make his inquiries at aylesbury and as if that were not enough i had added at an expense of seventy pounds a clue by which he might follow me through the length and breadth of england in the shape of the claretcoloured chaise  that elegant equipage which i began to regard as little better than a claretcoloured anteroom to the hangman’s cart coming presently to the door i left my breakfast in the middle and departed posting to the north as diligently as my cousin alain was posting to the south and putting my trust such as it was in an opposite direction and equal speed     chapter xxii—character and acquirements of mr  rowley   i am not certain that i had ever really appreciated before that hour the extreme peril of the adventure on which i was embarked  the sight of my cousin the look of his face—so handsome so jovial at the first sight and branded with so much malignity as you saw it on the second—with his hyperbolical curls in order with his neckcloth tied as if for the conquests of love setting forth as i had no doubt in the world he was doing to clap the bow street runners on my trail and cover england with handbills each dangerous as a loaded musket convinced me for the first time that the affair was no less serious than death  i believe it came to a near touch whether i should not turn the horses’ heads at the next stage and make directly for the coast  but i was now in the position of a man who should have thrown his gage into the den of lions or better still like one who should have quarrelled overnight under the influence of wine and now at daylight in a cold winter’s morning and humbly sober must make good his words  it is not that i thought any the less or any the less warmly of flora  but as i smoked a grim segar that morning in a corner of the chaise no doubt i considered in the first place that the letterpost had been invented and admitted privately to myself in the second that it would have been highly possible to write her on a piece of paper seal it and send it skimming by the mail instead of going personally into these egregious dangers and through a country that i beheld crowded with gibbets and bow street officers  as for sim and candlish i doubt if they crossed my mind  at the green dragon rowley was waiting on the doorsteps with the luggage and really was bursting with unpalatable conversation  ‘who do you think we’ve ’ad ’ere sir’ he began breathlessly as the chaise drove off  ‘red breasts’ and he nodded his head portentously  ‘red breasts’ i repeated for i stupidly did not understand at the moment an expression i had often heard  ‘ah’ said he  ‘red weskits  runners  bow street runners  two on’ em and one was lavender himself  i hear the other say quite plain “now mr lavender if you’re ready”  they was breakfasting as nigh me as i am to that postboy  they’re all right they ain’t after us  it’s a forger and i didn’t send them off on a false scent—o no  i thought there was no use in having them over our way so i give them “very valuable information” mr lavender said and tipped me a tizzy for myself and they’re off to luton  they showed me the ’andcuffs too—the other one did—and he clicked the dratted things on my wrist and i tell you i believe i nearly went off in a swound  there’s something so beastly in the feel of them  begging your pardon mr anne’ he added with one of his delicious changes from the character of the confidential schoolboy into that of the trained respectful servant  well i must not be proud  i cannot say i found the subject of handcuffs to my fancy and it was with more asperity than was needful that i reproved him for the slip about the name  ‘yes mr ramornie’ says he touching his hat  ‘begging your pardon mr ramornie  but i’ve been very piticular sir up to now and you may trust me to be very piticular in the future  it were only a slip sir’  ‘my good boy’ said i with the most imposing severity ‘there must be no slips  be so good as to remember that my life is at stake’  i did not embrace the occasion of telling him how many i had made myself it is my principle that an officer must never be wrong  i have seen two divisions beating their brains out for a fortnight against a worthless and quite impregnable castle in a pass i knew we were only doing it for discipline because the general had said so at first and had not yet found any way out of his own words and i highly admired his force of character and throughout these operations thought my life exposed in a very good cause  with fools and children which included rowley the necessity was even greater  i proposed to myself to be infallible and even when he expressed some wonder at the purchase of the claretcoloured chaise i put him promptly in his place  in our situation i told him everything had to be sacrificed to appearances doubtless in a hired chaise we should have had more freedom but look at the dignity  i was so positive that i had sometimes almost convinced myself  not for long you may be certain  this detestable conveyance always appeared to me to be laden with bow street officers and to have a placard upon the back of it publishing my name and crimes  if i had paid seventy pounds to get the thing i should not have stuck at seven hundred to be safely rid of it  and if the chaise was a danger what an anxiety was the despatchbox and its golden cargo  i had never had a care but to draw my pay and spend it i had lived happily in the regiment as in my father’s house fed by the great emperor’s commissariat as by ubiquitous doves of elijah—or my faith if anything went wrong with the commissariat helping myself with the best grace in the world from the next peasant  and now i began to feel at the same time the burthen of riches and the fear of destitution there were ten thousand pounds in the despatchbox but i reckoned in french money and had two hundred and fifty thousand agonies i kept it under my hand all day i dreamed of it at night  in the inns i was afraid to go to dinner and afraid to go to sleep  when i walked up a hill i durst not leave the doors of the claretcoloured chaise sometimes i would change the disposition of the funds there were days when i carried as much as five or six thousand pounds on my own person and only the residue continued to voyage in the treasurechest—days when i bulked all over like my cousin crackled to a touch with bank paper and had my pockets weighed to burstingpoint with sovereigns  and there were other days when i wearied of the thing—or grew ashamed of it—and put all the money back where it had come from there let it take its chance like better people  in short i set rowley a poor example of consistency and in philosophy none at all  little he cared  all was one to him so long as he was amused and i never knew any one amused more easily  he was thrillingly interested in life travel and his own melodramatic position  all day he would be looking from the chaise windows with ebullitions of gratified curiosity that were sometimes justified and sometimes not and that taken altogether it occasionally wearied me to be obliged to share  i can look at horses and i can look at trees too although not fond of it but why should i look at a lame horse or a tree that was like the letter y  what exhilaration could i feel in viewing a cottage that was the same colour as ‘the second from the miller’s’ in some place where i had never been and of which i had not previously heard  i am ashamed to complain but there were moments when my juvenile and confidential friend weighed heavy on my hands  his cackle was indeed almost continuous but it was never unamiable  he showed an amiable curiosity when he was asking questions an amiable guilelessness when he was conferring information and both he did largely  i am in a position to write the biographies of mr rowley mr rowley’s father and mother his aunt eliza and the miller’s dog and nothing but pity for the reader and some misgivings as to the law of copyright prevail on me to withhold them  a general design to mould himself upon my example became early apparent and i had not the heart to check it  he began to mimic my carriage he acquired with servile accuracy a little manner i had of shrugging the shoulders and i may say it was by observing it in him that i first discovered it in myself  one day it came out by chance that i was of the catholic religion  he became plunged in thought at which i was gently glad  then suddenly—  ‘oddrabbit it  i’ll be catholic too’ he broke out  ‘you must teach me it mr anne—i mean ramornie’  i dissuaded him alleging that he would find me very imperfectly informed as to the grounds and doctrines of the church and that after all in the matter of religions it was a very poor idea to change  ‘of course my church is the best’ said i ‘but that is not the reason why i belong to it i belong to it because it was the faith of my house  i wish to take my chances with my own people and so should you  if it is a question of going to hell go to hell like a gentleman with your ancestors’  ‘well it wasn’t that’ he admitted  ‘i don’t know that i was exactly thinking of hell  then there’s the inquisition too  that’s rather a cawker you know’  ‘and i don’t believe you were thinking of anything in the world’ said i—which put a period to his respectable conversion  he consoled himself by playing for awhile on a cheap flageolet which was one of his diversions and to which i owed many intervals of peace  when he first produced it in the joints from his pocket he had the duplicity to ask me if i played upon it  i answered no and he put the instrument away with a sigh and the remark that he had thought i might for some while he resisted the unspeakable temptation his fingers visibly itching and twittering about his pocket even his interest in the landscape and in sporadic anecdote entirely lost  presently the pipe was in his hands again he fitted unfitted refitted and played upon it in dumb show for some time  ‘i play it myself a little’ says he  ‘do you’ said i and yawned  and then he broke down  ‘mr ramornie if you please would it disturb you sir if i was to play a chune’ he pleaded  and from that hour the tootling of the flageolet cheered our way  he was particularly keen on the details of battles single combats incidents of scouting parties and the like  these he would make haste to cap with some of the exploits of wallace the only hero with whom he had the least acquaintance  his enthusiasm was genuine and pretty  when he learned we were going to scotland ‘well then’ he broke out ‘i’ll see where wallace lived’  and presently after he fell to moralising ‘it’s a strange thing sir’ he began ‘that i seem somehow to have always the wrong sow by the ear  i’m english after all and i glory in it  my eye don’t i though  let some of your frenchies come over here to invade and you’ll see whether or not  oh yes i’m english to the backbone i am  and yet look at me  i got hold of this ’ere william wallace and took to him right off i never heard of such a man before and then you came along and i took to you  and both the two of you were my born enemies  i—i beg your pardon mr ramornie but would you mind it very much if you didn’t go for to do anything against england’—he brought the word out suddenly like something hot—‘when i was along of you’  i was more affected than i can tell  ‘rowley’ i said ‘you need have no fear  by how much i love my own honour by so much i will take care to protect yours  we are but fraternising at the outposts as soldiers do  when the bugle calls my boy we must face each other one for england one for france and may god defend the right’  so i spoke at the moment but for all my brave airs the boy had wounded me in a vital quarter  his words continued to ring in my hearing  there was no remission all day of my remorseful thoughts and that night which we lay at lichfield i believe there was no sleep for me in my bed  i put out the candle and lay down with a good resolution and in a moment all was light about me like a theatre and i saw myself upon the stage of it playing ignoble parts  i remembered france and my emperor now depending on the arbitrament of war bent down fighting on their knees and with their teeth against so many and such various assailants  and i burned with shame to be here in england cherishing an english fortune pursuing an english mistress and not there to handle a musket in my native fields and to manure them with my body if i fell  i remembered that i belonged to france  all my fathers had fought for her and some had died the voice in my throat the sight of my eyes the tears that now sprang there the whole man of me was fashioned of french earth and born of a french mother i had been tended and caressed by a succession of the daughters of france the fairest the most illstarred and i had fought and conquered shoulder to shoulder with her sons  a soldier a noble of the proudest and bravest race in europe it had been left to the prattle of a hobbledehoy lackey in an english chaise to recall me to the consciousness of duty  when i saw how it was i did not lose time in indecision  the old classical conflict of love and honour being once fairly before me it did not cost me a thought  i was a saintyves de kéroual and i decided to strike off on the morrow for wakefield and burchell fenn and embark as soon as it should be morally possible for the succour of my downtrodden fatherland and my beleaguered emperor  pursuant on this resolve i leaped from bed made a light and as the watchman was crying halfpast two in the dark streets of lichfield sat down to pen a letter of farewell to flora  and then—whether it was the sudden chill of the night whether it came by association of ideas from the remembrance of swanston cottage i know not but there appeared before me—to the barking of sheepdogs—a couple of snuffy and shambling figures each wrapped in a plaid each armed with a rude staff and i was immediately bowed down to have forgotten them so long and of late to have thought of them so cavalierly  sure enough there was my errand  as a private person i was neither french nor english i was something else first a loyal gentleman an honest man  sim and candlish must not be left to pay the penalty of my unfortunate blow  they held my honour tacitly pledged to succour them and it is a sort of stoical refinement entirely foreign to my nature to set the political obligation above the personal and private  if france fell in the interval for the lack of anne de styves fall she must but i was both surprised and humiliated to have had so plain a duty bound upon me for so long—and for so long to have neglected and forgotten it i think any brave man will understand me when i say that i went to bed and to sleep with a conscience very much relieved and woke again in the morning with a light heart  the very danger of the enterprise reassured me to save sim and candlish suppose the worst to come to the worst it would be necessary for me to declare myself in a court of justice with consequences which i did not dare to dwell upon it could never be said that i had chosen the cheap and the easy—only that in a very perplexing competition of duties i had risked my life for the most immediate  we resumed the journey with more diligence thenceforward posted day and night did not halt beyond what was necessary for meals and the postillions were excited by gratuities after the habit of my cousin alain  for twopence i could have gone farther and taken four horses so extreme was my haste running as i was before the terrors of an awakened conscience  but i feared to be conspicuous  even as it was we attracted only too much attention with our pair and that white elephant the seventypoundsworth of claretcoloured chaise  meanwhile i was ashamed to look rowley in the face  the young shaver had contrived to put me wholly in the wrong he had cost me a night’s rest and a severe and healthful humiliation and i was grateful and embarrassed in his society  this would never do it was contrary to all my ideas of discipline if the officer has to blush before the private or the master before the servant nothing is left to hope for but discharge or death  i hit upon the idea of teaching him french and accordingly from lichfield i became the distracted master and he the scholar—how shall i say indefatigable but uninspired  his interest never flagged  he would hear the same word twenty times with profound refreshment mispronounce it in several different ways and forget it again with magical celerity  say it happened to be stirrup  ‘no i don’t seem to remember that word mr anne’ he would say ‘it don’t seem to stick to me that word don’t’  and then when i had told it him again ‘etrier’ he would cry  ‘to be sure  i had it on the tip of my tongue  eterier’ going wrong already as if by a fatal instinct ‘what will i remember it by now  why interior to be sure  i’ll remember it by its being something that ain’t in the interior of a horse’  and when next i had occasion to ask him the french for stirrup it was a tossup whether he had forgotten all about it or gave me exterior for an answer  he was never a hair discouraged  he seemed to consider that he was covering the ground at a normal rate  he came up smiling day after day  ‘now sir shall we do our french’ he would say and i would put questions and elicit copious commentary and explanation but never the shadow of an answer  my hands fell to my sides i could have wept to hear him  when i reflected that he had as yet learned nothing and what a vast deal more there was for him to learn the period of these lessons seemed to unroll before me vast as eternity and i saw myself a teacher of a hundred and rowley a pupil of ninety still hammering on the rudiments  the wretched boy i should say was quite unspoiled by the inevitable familiarities of the journey  he turned out at each stage the pink of servinglads deft civil prompt attentive touching his hat like an automaton raising the status of mr ramornie in the eyes of all the inn by his smiling service and seeming capable of anything in the world but the one thing i had chosen—learning french     chapter xxiii—the adventure of the runaway couple   the country had for some time back been changing in character  by a thousand indications i could judge that i was again drawing near to scotland  i saw it written in the face of the hills in the growth of the trees and in the glint of the waterbrooks that kept the highroad company  it might have occurred to me also that i was at the same time approaching a place of some fame in britain—gretna green  over these same leagues of road—which rowley and i now traversed in the claretcoloured chaise to the note of the flageolet and the french lesson—how many pairs of lovers had gone bowling northwards to the music of sixteen scampering horseshoes and how many irate persons parents uncles guardians evicted rivals had come tearing after clapping the frequent red face to the chaisewindow lavishly shedding their gold about the posthouses sedulously loading and reloading as they went their avenging pistols  but i doubt if i had thought of it at all before a wayside hazard swept me into the thick of an adventure of this nature and i found myself playing providence with other people’s lives to my own admiration at the moment—and subsequently to my own brief but passionate regret  at rather an ugly corner of an uphill reach i came on the wreck of a chaise lying on one side in the ditch a man and a woman in animated discourse in the middle of the road and the two postillions each with his pair of horses looking on and laughing from the saddle  ‘morning breezes here’s a smash’ cried rowley pocketing his flageolet in the middle of the tight little island  i was perhaps more conscious of the moral smash than the physical—more alive to broken hearts than to broken chaises for as plain as the sun at morning there was a screw loose in this runaway match  it is always a bad sign when the lower classes laugh their taste in humour is both poor and sinister and for a man running the posts with four horses presumably with open pockets and in the company of the most entrancing little creature conceivable to have come down so far as to be laughed at by his own postillions was only to be explained on the double hypothesis that he was a fool and no gentleman  i have said they were man and woman  i should have said man and child she was certainly not more than seventeen pretty as an angel just plump enough to damn a saint and dressed in various shades of blue from her stockings to her saucy cap in a kind of taking gamut the top note of which she flung me in a beam from her too appreciative eye  there was no doubt about the case i saw it all  from a boardingschool a blackboard a piano and clementi’s sonatinas the child had made a rash adventure upon life in the company of a halfbred hawbuck and she was already not only regretting it but expressing her regret with point and pungency  as i alighted they both paused with that unmistakable air of being interrupted in a scene  i uncovered to the lady and placed my services at their disposal  it was the man who answered  ‘there’s no use in shamming sir’ said he ‘this lady and i have run away and her father’s after us road to gretna sir  and here have these nincompoops spilt us in the ditch and smashed the chaise’  ‘very provoking’ said i  ‘i don’t know when i’ve been so provoked’ cried he with a glance down the road of mortal terror  ‘the father is no doubt very much incensed’ i pursued civilly  ‘o god’ cried the hawbuck  ‘in short you see we must get out of this and i’ll tell you what—it may seem cool but necessity has no law—if you would lend us your chaise to the next posthouse it would be the very thing sir’  ‘i confess it seems cool’ i replied  ‘what’s that you say sir’ he snapped  ‘i was agreeing with you’ said i  ‘yes it does seem cool and what is more to the point it seems unnecessary  this thing can be arranged in a more satisfactory manner otherwise i think  you can doubtless ride’  this opened a door on the matter of their previous dispute and the fellow appeared lifesized in his true colours  ‘that’s what i’ve been telling her that damn her she must ride’ he broke out  ‘and if the gentleman’s of the same mind why damme you shall’  as he said so he made a snatch at her wrist which she evaded with horror  i stepped between them  ‘no sir’ said i ‘the lady shall not’  he turned on me raging  ‘and who are you to interfere’ he roared  ‘there is here no question of who i am’ i replied  ‘i may be the devil or the archbishop of canterbury for what you know or need know  the point is that i can help you—it appears that nobody else can and i will tell you how i propose to do it  i will give the lady a seat in my chaise if you will return the compliment by allowing my servant to ride one of your horses’  i thought he would have sprung at my throat  ‘you have always the alternative before you to wait here for the arrival of papa’ i added  and that settled him  he cast another haggard look down the road and capitulated  ‘i am sure sir the lady is very much obliged to you’ he said with an ill grace  i gave her my hand she mounted like a bird into the chaise rowley grinning from ear to ear closed the door behind us the two impudent rascals of postboys cheered and laughed aloud as we drove off and my own postillion urged his horses at once into a rattling trot  it was plain i was supposed by all to have done a very dashing act and ravished the bride from the ravisher  in the meantime i stole a look at the little lady  she was in a state of pitiable discomposure and her arms shook on her lap in her black lace mittens  ‘madam—’ i began  and she in the same moment finding her voice ‘o what you must think of me’  ‘madam’ said i ‘what must any gentleman think when he sees youth beauty and innocence in distress  i wish i could tell you that i was old enough to be your father i think we must give that up’ i continued with a smile  ‘but i will tell you something about myself which ought to do as well and to set that little heart at rest in my society  i am a lover  may i say it of myself—for i am not quite used to all the niceties of english—that i am a true lover  there is one whom i admire adore obey she is no less good than she is beautiful if she were here she would take you to her arms conceive that she has sent me—that she has said to me “go be her knight”’  ‘o i know she must be sweet i know she must be worthy of you’ cried the little lady  ‘she would never forget female decorum—nor make the terrible erratum i’ve done’  and at this she lifted up her voice and wept  this did not forward matters it was in vain that i begged her to be more composed and to tell me a plain consecutive tale of her misadventures but she continued instead to pour forth the most extraordinary mixture of the correct school miss and the poor untutored little piece of womanhood in a false position—of engrafted pedantry and incoherent nature  ‘i am certain it must have been judicial blindness’ she sobbed  ‘i can’t think how i didn’t see it but i didn’t and he isn’t is he  and then a curtain rose    o what a moment was that  but i knew at once that you were you had but to appear from your carriage and i knew it o she must be a fortunate young lady  and i have no fear with you none—a perfect confidence’  ‘madam’ said i ‘a gentleman’  ‘that’s what i mean—a gentleman’ she exclaimed  ‘and he—and that—he isn’t  o how shall i dare meet father’  and disclosing to me her tearstained face and opening her arms with a tragic gesture ‘and i am quite disgraced before all the young ladies my schoolcompanions’ she added  ‘o not so bad as that’ i cried  ‘come come you exaggerate my dear miss—  excuse me if i am too familiar i have not yet heard your name’  ‘my name is dorothy greensleeves sir why should i conceal it  i fear it will only serve to point an adage to future generations and i had meant so differently  there was no young female in the county more emulous to be thought well of than i  and what a fall was there  o dear me what a wicked piggish donkey of a girl i have made of myself to be sure  and there is no hope o mr—’  and at that she paused and asked my name  i am not writing my eulogium for the academy i will admit it was unpardonably imbecile but i told it her  if you had been there—and seen her ravishingly pretty and little a baby in years and mind—and heard her talking like a book with so much of schoolroom propriety in her manner with such an innocent despair in the matter—you would probably have told her yours  she repeated it after me  ‘i shall pray for you all my life’ she said  ‘every night when i retire to rest the last thing i shall do is to remember you by name’  presently i succeeded in winning from her her tale which was much what i had anticipated a tale of a schoolhouse a walled garden a fruittree that concealed a bench an impudent raff posturing in church an exchange of flowers and vows over the garden wall a silly schoolmate for a confidante a chaise and four and the most immediate and perfect disenchantment on the part of the little lady  ‘and there is nothing to be done’ she wailed in conclusion  ‘my error is irretrievable i am quite forced to that conclusion  o monsieur de saintyves who would have thought that i could have been such a blind wicked donkey’  i should have said before—only that i really do not know when it came in—that we had been overtaken by the two postboys rowley and mr bellamy which was the hawbuck’s name bestriding the four posthorses and that these formed a sort of cavalry escort riding now before now behind the chaise and bellamy occasionally posturing at the window and obliging us with some of his conversation  he was so illreceived that i declare i was tempted to pity him remembering from what a height he had fallen and how few hours ago it was since the lady had herself fled to his arms all blushes and ardour  well these great strokes of fortune usually befall the unworthy and bellamy was now the legitimate object of my commiseration and the ridicule of his own postboys  ‘miss dorothy’ said i ‘you wish to be delivered from this man’  ‘o if it were possible’ she cried  ‘but not by violence’  ‘not in the least ma’am’ i replied  ‘the simplest thing in life  we are in a civilised country the man’s a malefactor—’  ‘o never’ she cried  ‘do not even dream it  with all his faults i know he is not that’  ‘anyway he’s in the wrong in this affair—on the wrong side of the law call it what you please’ said i and with that our four horsemen having for the moment headed us by a considerable interval i hailed my postboy and inquired who was the nearest magistrate and where he lived archdeacon clitheroe he told me a prodigious dignitary and one who lived but a lane or two back and at the distance of only a mile or two out of the direct road  i showed him the king’s medallion  ‘take the lady there and at full gallop’ i cried  ‘right sir  mind yourself’ says the postillion  and before i could have thought it possible he had turned the carriage to the rightabout and we were galloping south  our outriders were quick to remark and imitate the manoeuvre and came flying after us with a vast deal of indiscriminate shouting so that the fine sober picture of a carriage and escort that we had presented but a moment back was transformed in the twinkling of an eye into the image of a noisy foxchase  the two postillions and my own saucy rogue were of course disinterested actors in the comedy they rode for the mere sport keeping in a body their mouths full of laughter waving their hats as they came on and crying as the fancy struck them tallyho’  ‘stop thief’  ‘a highwayman  a highwayman’  it was otherguess work with bellamy  that gentleman no sooner observed our change of direction than he turned his horse with so much violence that the poor animal was almost cast upon its side and launched her in immediate and desperate pursuit as he approached i saw that his face was deadly white and that he carried a drawn pistol in his hand  i turned at once to the poor little bride that was to have been and now was not to be she upon her side deserting the other window turned as if to meet me  ‘o o don’t let him kill me’ she screamed  ‘never fear’ i replied  her face was distorted with terror  her hands took hold upon me with the instinctive clutch of an infant  the chaise gave a flying lurch which took the feet from under me and tumbled us anyhow upon the seat  and almost in the same moment the head of bellamy appeared in the window which missy had left free for him  conceive the situation  the little lady and i were falling—or had just fallen—backward on the seat and offered to the eye a somewhat ambiguous picture  the chaise was speeding at a furious pace and with the most violent leaps and lurches along the highway  into this bounding receptacle bellamy interjected his head his pistol arm and his pistol and since his own horse was travelling still faster than the chaise he must withdraw all of them again in the inside of the fraction of a minute  he did so but he left the charge of the pistol behind him—whether by design or accident i shall never know and i dare say he has forgotten  probably he had only meant to threaten in hopes of causing us to arrest our flight  in the same moment came the explosion and a pitiful cry from missy and my gentleman making certain he had struck her went down the road pursued by the furies turned at the first corner took a flying leap over the thorn hedge and disappeared across country in the least possible time  rowley was ready and eager to pursue but i withheld him thinking we were excellently quit of mr bellamy at no more cost than a scratch on the forearm and a bullethole in the lefthand claretcoloured panel and accordingly but now at a more decent pace we proceeded on our way to archdeacon clitheroe’s missy’s gratitude and admiration were aroused to a high pitch by this dramatic scene and what she was pleased to call my wound  she must dress it for me with her handkerchief a service which she rendered me even with tears  i could well have spared them not loving on the whole to be made ridiculous and the injury being in the nature of a cat’s scratch  indeed i would have suggested for her kind care rather the cure of my coatsleeve which had suffered worse in the encounter but i was too wise to risk the anticlimax  that she had been rescued by a hero that the hero should have been wounded in the affray and his wound bandaged with her handkerchief which it could not even bloody ministered incredibly to the recovery of her selfrespect and i could hear her relate the incident to ‘the young ladies my schoolcompanions’ in the most approved manner of mrs radcliffe  to have insisted on the torn coatsleeve would have been unmannerly if not inhuman  presently the residence of the archdeacon began to heave in sight  a chaise and four smoking horses stood by the steps and made way for us on our approach and even as we alighted there appeared from the interior of the house a tall ecclesiastic and beside him a little headstrong ruddy man in a towering passion and brandishing over his head a roll of paper  at sight of him miss dorothy flung herself on her knees with the most moving adjurations calling him father assuring him she was wholly cured and entirely repentant of her disobedience and entreating forgiveness and i soon saw that she need fear no great severity from mr greensleeves who showed himself extraordinarily fond loud greedy of caresses and prodigal of tears  to give myself a countenance as well as to have all ready for the road when i should find occasion i turned to quit scores with bellamy’s two postillions  they had not the least claim on me but one of which they were quite ignorant—that i was a fugitive  it is the worst feature of that false position that every gratuity becomes a case of conscience you must not leave behind you any one discontented nor any one grateful but the whole business had been such a ‘hurrahboys’ from the beginning and had gone off in the fifth act so like a melodrama in explosions reconciliations and the rape of a posthorse that it was plainly impossible to keep it covered  it was plain it would have to be talked over in all the innkitchens for thirty miles about and likely for six months to come  it only remained for me therefore to settle on that gratuity which should be least conspicuous—so large that nobody could grumble so small that nobody would be tempted to boast  my decision was hastily and nor wisely taken  the one fellow spat on his tip so he called it for luck the other developing a sudden streak of piety prayed god bless me with fervour  it seemed a demonstration was brewing and i determined to be off at once  bidding my own postboy and rowley be in readiness for an immediate start i reascended the terrace and presented myself hat in hand before mr greensleeves and the archdeacon  ‘you will excuse me i trust’ said i  ‘i think shame to interrupt this agreeable scene of family effusion which i have been privileged in some small degree to bring about’  and at these words the storm broke  ‘small degree small degree sir’ cries the father ‘that shall not pass mr st eaves  if i’ve got my darling back and none the worse for that vagabone rascal i know whom i have to thank  shake hands with me—up to the elbows sir  a frenchman you may be but you’re one of the right breed by god  and by god sir you may have anything you care to ask of me down to dolly’s hand by god’  all this he roared out in a voice surprisingly powerful from so small a person  every word was thus audible to the servants who had followed them out of the house and now congregated about us on the terrace as well as to rowley and the five postillions on the gravel sweep below the sentiments expressed were popular some ass whom the devil moved to be my enemy proposed three cheers and they were given with a will  to hear my own name resounding amid acclamations in the hills of westmorland was flattering perhaps but it was inconvenient at a moment when as i was morally persuaded police handbills were already speeding after me at the rate of a hundred miles a day  nor was that the end of it  the archdeacon must present his compliments and pressed upon me some of his west india sherry and i was carried into a vastly fine library where i was presented to his lady wife  while we were at sherry in the library ale was handed round upon the terrace speeches were made hands were shaken missy at her father’s request kissed me farewell and the whole party reaccompanied me to the terrace where they stood waving hats and handkerchiefs and crying farewells to all the echoes of the mountains until the chaise had disappeared  the echoes of the mountains were engaged in saying to me privately ‘you fool you have done it now’  ‘they do seem to have got ’old of your name mr anne’ said rowley  ‘it weren’t my fault this time’  ‘it was one of those accidents that can never be foreseen’ said i affecting a dignity that i was far from feeling  ‘some one recognised me’  ‘which on ’em mr anne’ said the rascal  ‘that is a senseless question it can make no difference who it was’ i returned  ‘no nor that it can’t’ cried rowley  ‘i say mr anne sir it’s what you would call a jolly mess ain’t it looks like “clean bowledout in the middle stump” don’t it’  ‘i fail to understand you rowley’  ‘well what i mean is what are we to do about this one’ pointing to the postillion in front of us as he alternately hid and revealed his patched breeches to the trot of his horse  ‘he see you get in this morning under mr ramornie—i was very piticular to mr ramornie you if you remember sir—and he see you get in again under mr saint eaves and whatever’s he going to see you get out under that’s what worries me sir  it don’t seem to me like as if the position was what you call stratetegic’  ‘parrrbleu will you let me be’ i cried  ‘i have to think you cannot imagine how your constant idiotic prattle annoys me’  ‘beg pardon mr anne’ said he and the next moment ‘you wouldn’t like for us to do our french now would you mr anne’  ‘certainly not’ said i  ‘play upon your flageolet’  the which he did with what seemed to me to be irony  conscience doth make cowards of us all  i was so downcast by my pitiful mismanagement of the morning’s business that i shrank from the eye of my own hired infant and read offensive meanings into his idle tootling  i took off my coat and set to mending it soldierfashion with a needle and thread  there is nothing more conducive to thought above all in arduous circumstances and as i sewed i gradually gained a clearness upon my affairs  i must be done with the claretcoloured chaise at once it should be sold at the next stage for what it would bring  rowley and i must take back to the road on our four feet and after a decent interval of trudging get places on some coach for edinburgh again under new names  so much trouble and toil so much extra risk and expense and loss of time and all for a slip of the tongue to a little lady in blue     chapter xxiv—the innkeeper of kirkbylonsdale   i had hitherto conceived and partly carried out an ideal that was dear to my heart  rowley and i descended from our claretcoloured chaise a couple of correctly dressed brisk brighteyed young fellows like a pair of aristocratic mice attending singly to our own affairs communicating solely with each other and that with the niceties and civilities of drill  we would pass through the little crowd before the door with highbred preoccupation inoffensively haughty after the best english pattern and disappear within followed by the envy and admiration of the bystanders a model master and servant pointdevice in every part  it was a heavy thought to me as we drew up before the inn at kirkbylonsdale that this scene was now to be enacted for the last time  alas and had i known it it was to go of with so inferior a grace  i had been injudiciously liberal to the postboys of the chaise and four my own postboy he of the patched breeches now stood before me his eyes glittering with greed his hand advanced  it was plain he anticipated something extraordinary by way of a pourboire and considering the marches and countermarches by which i had extended the stage the military character of our affairs with mr bellamy and the bad example i had set before him at the archdeacon’s something exceptional was certainly to be done  but these are always nice questions to a foreigner above all a shade too little will suggest niggardliness a shilling too much smells of hushmoney  fresh from the scene at the archdeacon’s and flushed by the idea that i was now nearly done with the responsibilities of the claretcoloured chaise i put into his hands five guineas and the amount served only to waken his cupidity  ‘o come sir you ain’t going to fob me of with this  why i seen fire at your side’ he cried  it would never do to give him more i felt i should become the fable of kirkbylonsdale if i did and i looked him in the face sternly but still smiling and addressed him with a voice of uncompromising firmness  ‘if you do not like it give it back’ said i  he pocketed the guineas with the quickness of a conjurer and like a baseborn cockney as he was fell instantly to casting dirt  ‘’ave your own way of it mr ramornie—leastways mr st eaves or whatever your blessed name may be  look ’ere’—turning for sympathy to the stableboys—‘this is a blessed business  blessed ’ard i calls it ’ere i takes up a blessed son of a popgun what calls hisself anything you care to mention and turns out to be a blessed mounseer at the end of it  ’ere ’ave i been drivin’ of him up and down all day acarrying off of gals ashootin’ of pistyils and adrinkin’ of sherry and hale and wot does he up and give me but a blank blank blanketing blank’  the fellow’s language had become too powerful for reproduction and i passed it by  meanwhile i observed rowley fretting visibly at the bit another moment and he would have added a last touch of the ridiculous to our arrival by coming to his hands with the postillion  ‘rowley’ cried i reprovingly  strictly it should have been gammon but in the hurry of the moment my fault i can only hope passed unperceived  at the same time i caught the eye of the postmaster  he was long and lean and brown and bilious he had the drooping nose of the humourist and the quick attention of a man of parts  he read my embarrassment in a glance stepped instantly forward sent the postboy to the rightabout with half a word and was back next moment at my side  ‘dinner in a private room sir  very well  john no 4  what wine would you care to mention  very well sir  will you please to order fresh horses  not sir  very well’  each of these expressions was accompanied by something in the nature of a bow and all were prefaced by something in the nature of a smile which i could very well have done without  the man’s politeness was from the teeth outwards behind and within i was conscious of a perpetual scrutiny the scene at his doorstep the random confidences of the postboy had not been thrown away on this observer and it was under a strong fear of coming trouble that i was shown at last into my private room  i was in half a mind to have put off the whole business  but the truth is now my name had got abroad my fear of the mail that was coming and the handbills it should contain had waxed inordinately and i felt i could never eat a meal in peace till i had severed my connection with the claretcoloured chaise  accordingly as soon as i had done with dinner i sent my compliments to the landlord and requested he should take a glass of wine with me  he came we exchanged the necessary civilities and presently i approached my business  ‘by the bye’ said i ‘we had a brush down the road today  i dare say you may have heard of it’  he nodded  ‘and i was so unlucky as to get a pistol ball in the panel of my chaise’ i continued ‘which makes it simply useless to me  do you know any one likely to buy’  ‘i can well understand that’ said the landlord ‘i was looking at it just now it’s as good as ruined is that chaise  general rule people don’t like chaises with bulletholes’  ‘too much romance of the forest’ i suggested recalling my little friend of the morning and what i was sure had been her favourite reading—mrs radcliffe’s novels  ‘just so’ said he  ‘they may be right they may be wrong i’m not the judge  but i suppose it’s natural after all for respectable people to like things respectable about them not bulletholes nor puddles of blood nor men with aliases’  i took a glass of wine and held it up to the light to show that my hand was steady  ‘yes’ said i ‘i suppose so’  ‘you have papers of course showing you are the proper owner’ he inquired  ‘there is the bill stamped and receipted’ said i tossing it across to him  he looked at it  ‘this all you have’ he asked  ‘it is enough at least’ said i  ‘it shows you where i bought and what i paid for it’  ‘well i don’t know’ he said  ‘you want some paper of identification’  ‘to identify the chaise’ i inquired  ‘not at all to identify you’ said he  ‘my good sir remember yourself’ said i  ‘the titledeeds of my estate are in that despatchbox but you do not seriously suppose that i should allow you to examine them’  ‘well you see this paper proves that some mr ramornie paid seventy guineas for a chaise’ said the fellow  ‘that’s all well and good but who’s to prove to me that you are mr ramornie’  ‘fellow’ cried i  ‘o fellow as much as you please’ said he  ‘fellow with all my heart that changes nothing  i am fellow of course—obtrusive fellow impudent fellow if you like—but who are you  i hear of you with two names i hear of you running away with young ladies and getting cheered for a frenchman which seems odd and one thing i will go bail for that you were in a blue fright when the postboy began to tell tales at my door in short sir you may be a very good gentleman but i don’t know enough about you and i’ll trouble you for your papers or to go before a magistrate  take your choice if i’m not fine enough i hope the magistrates are’  ‘my good man’ i stammered for though i had found my voice i could scarce be said to have recovered my wits ‘this is most unusual most rude  is it the custom in westmorland that gentlemen should be insulted’  ‘that depends’ said he  ‘when it’s suspected that gentlemen are spies it is the custom and a good custom too  no no’ he broke out perceiving me to make a movement  ‘both hands upon the table my gentleman  i want no pistol balls in my chaise panels’  ‘surely sir you do me strange injustice’ said i now the master of myself  ‘you see me sitting here a monument of tranquillity pray may i help myself to wine without umbraging you’  i took this attitude in sheer despair  i had no plan no hope  the best i could imagine was to spin the business out some minutes longer then capitulate  at least i would not capituatle one moment too soon  ‘am i to take that for no’ he asked  ‘referring to your former obliging proposal’ said i  ‘my good sir you are to take it as you say for “no”  certainly i will not show you my deeds certainly i will not rise from table and trundle out to see your magistrates  i have too much respect for my digestion and too little curiosity in justices of the peace’  he leaned forward looked me nearly in the face and reached out one hand to the bellrope  ‘see here my fine fellow’ said he  ‘do you see that bellrope  let me tell you there’s a boy waiting below one jingle and he goes to fetch the constable’  ‘do you tell me so’ said i  ‘well there’s no accounting for tastes  i have a prejudice against the society of constables but if it is your fancy to have one in for the dessert—’  i shrugged my shoulders lightly ‘really you know’ i added ‘this is vastly entertaining  i assure you i am looking on with all the interest of a man of the world at the development of your highly original character’  he continued to study my face without speech his hand still on the button of the bellrope his eyes in mine this was the decisive heat my face seemed to myself to dislimn under his gaze my expression to change the smile with which i had began to degenerate into the grin of the man upon the rack  i was besides harassed with doubts  an innocent man i argued would have resented the fellow’s impudence an hour ago and by my continued endurance of the ordeal i was simply signing and sealing my confession in short i had reached the end of my powers  ‘have you any objection to my putting my hands in my breeches pockets’ i inquired  ‘excuse me mentioning it but you showed yourself so extremely nervous a moment back’  my voice was not all i could have wished but it sufficed  i could hear it tremble but the landlord apparently could not  he turned away and drew a long breath and you may be sure i was quick to follow his example  ‘you’re a cool hand at least and that’s the sort i like’ said he  ‘be you what you please i’ll deal square  i’ll take the chaise for a hundred pound down and throw the dinner in’  ‘i beg your pardon’ i cried wholly mystified by this form of words  ‘you pay me a hundred down’ he repeated ‘and i’ll take the chaise it’s very little more than it cost’ he added with a grin ‘and you know you must get it off your hands somehow’  i do not know when i have been better entertained than by this impudent proposal  it was broadly funny and i suppose the least tempting offer in the world  for all that it came very welcome for it gave me the occasion to laugh  this i did with the most complete abandonment till the tears ran down my cheeks and ever and again as the fit abated i would get another view of the landlord’s face and go off into another paroxysm  ‘you droll creature you will be the death of me yet’ i cried drying my eyes  my friend was now wholly disconcerted he knew not where to look nor yet what to say and began for the first time to conceive it possible he was mistaken  ‘you seem rather to enjoy a laugh sir’ said he  ‘o yes  i am quite an original’ i replied and laughed again  presently in a changed voice he offered me twenty pounds for the chaise i ran him up to twentyfive and closed with the offer indeed i was glad to get anything and if i haggled it was not in the desire of gain but with the view at any price of securing a safe retreat  for although hostilities were suspended he was yet far from satisfied and i could read his continued suspicions in the cloudy eye that still hovered about my face  at last they took shape in words  ‘this is all very well’ says he ‘you carry it off well but for all that i must do my duty’  i had my strong effect in reserve it was to burn my ships with a vengeance  i rose  ‘leave the room’ said i  ‘this is insuperable  is the man mad’  and then as if already halfashamed of my passion ‘i can take a joke as well as any one’ i added ‘but this passes measure  send my servant and the bill’  when he had left me alone i considered my own valour with amazement  i had insulted him i had sent him away alone now if ever he would take what was the only sensible resource and fetch the constable  but there was something instinctively treacherous about the man which shrank from plain courses  and with all his cleverness he missed the occasion of fame  rowley and i were suffered to walk out of his door with all our baggage on foot with no destination named except in the vague statement that we were come ‘to view the lakes’ and my friend only watched our departure with his chin in his hand still moodily irresolute  i think this one of my great successes  i was exposed unmasked summoned to do a perfectly natural act which must prove my doom and which i had not the slightest pretext for refusing  i kept my head stuck to my guns and against all likelihood here i was once more at liberty and in the king’s highway  this was a strong lesson never to despair and at the same time how many hints to be cautious and what a perplexed and dubious business the whole question of my escape now appeared  that i should have risked perishing upon a trumpery question of a pourboire depicted in lively colours the perils that perpetually surrounded us  though to be sure the initial mistake had been committed before that and if i had not suffered myself to be drawn a little deep in confidences to the innocent dolly there need have been no tumble at the inn of kirkbylonsdale  i took the lesson to heart and promised myself in the future to be more reserved  it was none of my business to attend to broken chaises or shipwrecked travellers  i had my hands full of my own affairs and my best defence would be a little more natural selfishness and a trifle less imbecile goodnature     chapter xxv—i meet a cheerful extravagant   i pass over the next fifty or sixty leagues of our journey without comment  the reader must be growing weary of scenes of travel and for my own part i have no cause to recall these particular miles with any pleasure  we were mainly occupied with attempts to obliterate our trail which as the result showed were far from successful for on my cousin following he was able to run me home with the least possible loss of time following the claretcoloured chaise to kirkbylonsdale where i think the landlord must have wept to learn what he had missed and tracing us thereafter to the doors of the coachoffice in edinburgh without a single check  fortune did not favour me and why should i recapitulate the details of futile precautions which deceived nobody and wearisome arts which proved to be artless  the day was drawing to an end when mr rowley and i bowled into edinburgh to the stirring sound of the guard’s bugle and the clattering team  i was here upon my field of battle on the scene of my former captivity escape and exploits and in the same city with my love  my heart expanded i have rarely felt more of a hero  all down the bridges i sat by the driver with my arms folded and my face set unflinchingly meeting every eye and prepared every moment for a cry of recognition  hundreds of the population were in the habit of visiting the castle where it was my practice before the days of flora to make myself conspicuous among the prisoners and i think it an extraordinary thing that i should have encountered so few to recognise me  but doubtless a clean chin is a disguise in itself and the change is great from a suit of sulphuryellow to fine linen a wellfitting mousecoloured greatcoat furred in black a pair of tight trousers of fashionable cut and a hat of inimitable curl  after all it was more likely that i should have recognised our visitors than that they should have identified the modish gentleman with the miserable prisoner in the castle  i was glad to set foot on the flagstones and to escape from the crowd that had assembled to receive the mail  here we were with but little daylight before us and that on saturday afternoon the eve of the famous scottish sabbath adrift in the new town of edinburgh and overladen with baggage  we carried it ourselves  i would not take a cab nor so much as hire a porter who might afterwards serve as a link between my lodgings and the mail and connect me again with the claretcoloured chaise and aylesbury  for i was resolved to break the chain of evidence for good and to begin life afresh so far as regards caution with a new character  the first step was to find lodgings and to find them quickly  this was the more needful as mr rowley and i in our smart clothes and with our cumbrous burthen made a noticeable appearance in the streets at that time of the day and in that quarter of the town which was largely given up to fine folk bucks and dandies and young ladies or respectable professional men on their way home to dinner  on the north side of st james’ square i was so happy as to spy a bill in a thirdfloor window  i was equally indifferent to cost and convenience in my choice of a lodging—‘any port in a storm’ was the principle on which i was prepared to act and rowley and i made at once for the common entrance and sealed the stair  we were admitted by a very sourlooking female in bombazine  i gathered she had all her life been depressed by a series of bereavements the last of which might very well have befallen her the day before and i instinctively lowered my voice when i addressed her  she admitted she had rooms to let—even showed them to us—a sittingroom and bedroom in a suite commanding a fine prospect to the firth and fifeshire and in themselves well proportioned and comfortably furnished with pictures on the wall shells on the mantelpiece and several books upon the table which i found afterwards to be all of a devotional character and all presentation copies ‘to my christian friend’ or ‘to my devout acquaintance in the lord bethiah mcrankine’  beyond this my ‘christian friend’ could not be made to advance no not even to do that which seemed the most natural and pleasing thing in the world—i mean to name her price—but stood before us shaking her head and at times mourning like the dove the picture of depression and defence  she had a voice the most querulous i have ever heard and with this she produced a whole regiment of difficulties and criticisms  she could not promise an attendance  ‘well madam’ said i ‘and what is my servant for’  ‘him’ she asked  ‘be gude to us  is he your servant’  ‘i am sorry ma’am he meets with your disapproval’  ‘na i never said that  but he’s young  he’ll be a great breaker i’m thinkin’  ay he’ll be a great responsibeelity to ye like  does he attend to his releegion’  ‘yes m’m’ returned rowley with admirable promptitude and immediately closing his eyes as if from habit repeated the following distich with more celerity than fervour—      ‘matthew mark luke and john     bless the bed that i lie on’  ‘nhm’ said the lady and maintained an awful silence  ‘well ma’am’ said i ‘it seems we are never to hear the beginning of your terms let alone the end of them  come—a good movement and let us be either off or on’  she opened her lips slowly  ‘ony raferences’ she inquired in a voice like a bell  i opened my pocketbook and showed her a handful of bank bills  ‘i think madam that these are unexceptionable’ said i  ‘ye’ll be wantin’ breakfast late’ was her reply  ‘madam we want breakfast at whatever hour it suits you to give it from four in the morning till four in the afternoon’ i cried  ‘only tell us your figure if your mouth be large enough to let it out’  ‘i couldnae give ye supper the nicht’ came the echo  ‘we shall go out to supper you incorrigible female’ i vowed between laughter and tears  ‘here—this is going to end  i want you for a landlady—let me tell you that—and i am going to have my way  you won’t tell me what you charge  very well i will do without  i can trust you you don’t seem to know when you have a good lodger but i know perfectly when i have an honest landlady  rowley unstrap the valises’  will it be credited  the monomaniac fell to rating me for my indiscretion  but the battle was over these were her last guns and more in the nature of a salute than of renewed hostilities  and presently she condescended on very moderate terms and rowley and i were able to escape in quest of supper  much time had however been lost the sun was long down the lamps glimmered along the streets and the voice of a watchman already resounded in the neighbouring leith road  on our first arrival i had observed a place of entertainment not far off in a street behind the register house  thither we found our way and sat down to a late dinner alone  but we had scarce given our orders before the door opened and a tall young fellow entered with something of a lurch looked about him and approached the same table  ‘give you good evening most grave and reverend seniors’ said he  ‘will you permit a wanderer a pilgrim—the pilgrim of love in short—to come to temporary anchor under your lee  i care not who knows it but i have a passionate aversion from the bestial practice of solitary feeding’  ‘you are welcome sir’ said i ‘if i may take upon me so far to play the host in a public place’  he looked startled and fixed a hazy eye on me as he sat down  ‘sir’ said he ‘you are a man not without some tincture of letters i perceive  what shall we drink sir’  i mentioned i had already called for a pot of porter  ‘a modest pot—the seasonable quencher’ said he  ‘well i do not know but what i could look at a modest pot myself  i am for the moment in precarious health  much study hath heated my brain much walking wearied my—well it seems to be more my eyes’  ‘you have walked far i dare say’ i suggested  ‘not so much far as often’ he replied  ‘there is in this city—to which i think you are a stranger  sir to your very good health and our better acquaintance—there is in this city of dunedin a certain implication of streets which reflects the utmost credit on the designer and the publicans—at every hundred yards is seated the judicious tavern so that persons of contemplative mind are secure at moderate distances of refreshment  i have been doing a trot in that favoured quarter favoured by art and nature  a few chosen comrades—enemies of publicity and friends to wit and wine—obliged me with their society  “along the cool sequestered vale of register street we kept the uneven tenor of our way” sir’  ‘it struck me as you came in—’ i began  ‘o don’t make any bones about it’ he interrupted  ‘of course it struck you and let me tell you i was devilish lucky not to strike myself  when i entered this apartment i shone “with all the pomp and prodigality of brandy and water” as the poet gray has in another place expressed it powerful bard gray but a niminypiminy creature afraid of a petticoat and a bottle—not a man sir not a man  excuse me for being so troublesome but what the devil have i done with my fork  thank you i am sure  temulentia quoad me ipsum brevis colligo est  i sit and eat sir in a london fog  i should bring a linkboy to table with me and i would too if the little brutes were only washed  i intend to found a philanthropical society for washing the deserving poor and shaving soldiers  i am pleased to observe that although not of an unmilitary bearing you are apparently shaved  in my calendar of the virtues shaving comes next to drinking  a gentleman may be a lowminded ruffian without sixpence but he will always be close shaved  see me with the eye of fancy in the chill hours of the morning say about a quarter to twelve noon—see me awake  first thing of all without one thought of the plausible but unsatisfactory small beer or the healthful though insipid sodawater i take the deadly razor in my vacillating grasp i proceed to skate upon the margin of eternity  stimulating thought  i bleed perhaps but with medicable wounds  the stubble reaped i pass out of my chamber calm but triumphant  to employ a hackneyed phrase i would not call lord wellington my uncle  i too have dared perhaps bled before the imminent deadly shavingtable’  in this manner the bombastic fellow continued to entertain me all through dinner and by a common error of drunkards because he had been extremely talkative himself leaped to the conclusion that he had chanced on very genial company  he told me his name his address he begged we should meet again finally he proposed that i should dine with him in the country at an early date  ‘the dinner is official’ he explained  ‘the officebearers and senatus of the university of cramond—an educational institution in which i have the honour to be professor of nonsense—meet to do honour to our friend icarus at the oldestablished howff cramond bridge  one place is vacant fascinating stranger—i offer it to you’  ‘and who is your friend icarus’ i asked  ‘the aspiring son of daedalus’ said he  ‘is it possible that you have never heard the name of byfield’  ‘possible and true’ said i  ‘and is fame so small a thing’ cried he  ‘byfield sir is an aeronaut he apes the fame of a lunardi and is on the point of offering to the inhabitants—i beg your pardon to the nobility and gentry of our neighbourhood—the spectacle of an ascension  as one of the gentry concerned i may be permitted to remark that i am unmoved  i care not a tinker’s damn for his ascension  no more—i breathe it in your ear—does anybody else  the business is stale sir stale  lunardi did it and overdid it  a whimsical fiddling vain fellow by all accounts—for i was at that time rocking in my cradle  but once was enough  if lunardi went up and came down there was the matter settled  we prefer to grant the point  we do not want to see the experiment repeated ad nauseam by byfield and brown and butler and brodie and bottomley  ah if they would go up and not come down again  but this is by the question  the university of cramond delights to honour merit in the man sir rather than utility in the profession and byfield though an ignorant dog is a sound reliable drinker and really not amiss over his cups  under the radiance of the kindly jar partiality might even credit him with wit’  it will be seen afterwards that this was more my business than i thought it at the time  indeed i was impatient to be gone  even as my friend maundered ahead a squall burst the jaws of the rain were opened against the coffeehouse windows and at that inclement signal i remembered i was due elsewhere     chapter xxvi—the cottage at night   at the door i was nearly blown back by the unbridled violence of the squall and rowley and i must shout our parting words  all the way along princes street whither my way led the wind hunted me behind and screamed in my ears  the city was flushed with bucketfuls of rain that tasted salt from the neighbouring ocean  it seemed to darken and lighten again in the vicissitudes of the gusts  now you would say the lamps had been blown out from end to end of the long thoroughfare now in a lull they would revive remultiply shine again on the wet pavements and make darkness sparingly visible  by the time i had got to the corner of the lothian road there was a distinct improvement  for one thing i had now my shoulder to the wind for a second i came in the lee of my old prisonhouse the castle and at any rate the excessive fury of the blast was itself moderating  the thought of what errand i was on reawoke within me and i seemed to breast the rough weather with increasing ease  with such a destination what mattered a little buffeting of wind or a sprinkle of cold water  i recalled flora’s image i took her in fancy to my arms and my heart throbbed  and the next moment i had recognised the inanity of that fool’s paradise  if i could spy her taper as she went to bed i might count myself lucky  i had about two leagues before me of a road mostly uphill and now deep in mire  so soon as i was clear of the last street lamp darkness received me—a darkness only pointed by the lights of occasional rustic farms where the dogs howled with uplifted heads as i went by  the wind continued to decline it had been but a squall not a tempest  the rain on the other hand settled into a steady deluge which had soon drenched me thoroughly  i continued to tramp forward in the night contending with gloomy thoughts and accompanied by the dismal ululation of the dogs what ailed them that they should have been thus wakeful and perceived the small sound of my steps amid the general reverberation of the rain was more than i could fancy  i remembered tales with which i had been entertained in childhood  i told myself some murderer was going by and the brutes perceived upon him the faint smell of blood and the next moment with a physical shock i had applied the words to my own case  here was a dismal disposition for a lover  ‘was ever lady in this humour wooed’ i asked myself and came near turning back  it is never wise to risk a critical interview when your spirits are depressed your clothes muddy and your hands wet  but the boisterous night was in itself favourable to my enterprise now or perhaps never i might find some way to have an interview with flora and if i had one interview wet clothes low spirits and all i told myself there would certainly be another  arrived in the cottagegarden i found the circumstances mighty inclement from the round holes in the shutters of the parlour shafts of candlelight streamed forth elsewhere the darkness was complete  the trees the thickets were saturated the lower parts of the garden turned into a morass  at intervals when the wind broke forth again there passed overhead a wild coil of clashing branches and between whiles the whole enclosure continuously and stridently resounded with the rain  i advanced close to the window and contrived to read the face of my watch it was halfpast seven they would not retire before ten they might not before midnight and the prospect was unpleasant  in a lull of the wind i could hear from the inside the voice of flora reading aloud the words of course inaudible—only a flow of undecipherable speech quiet cordial colourless more intimate and winning more eloquent of her personality but not less beautiful than song  and the next moment the clamour of a fresh squall broke out about the cottage the voice was drowned in its bellowing and i was glad to retreat from my dangerous post  for three egregious hours i must now suffer the elements to do their worst upon me and continue to hold my ground in patience  i recalled the least fortunate of my services in the field being outsentry of the pickets in weather no less vile sometimes unsuppered and with nothing to look forward to by way of breakfast but musketballs and they seemed light in comparison  so strangely are we built so much more strong is the love of woman than the mere love of life  at last my patience was rewarded  the light disappeared from the parlour and reappeared a moment after in the room above  i was pretty well informed for the enterprise that lay before me  i knew the lair of the dragon—that which was just illuminated  i knew the bower of my rosamond and how excellently it was placed on the groundlevel round the flank of the cottage and out of earshot of her formidable aunt  nothing was left but to apply my knowledge  i was then at the bottom of the garden whether i had gone heaven save the mark for warmth that i might walk to and fro unheard and keep myself from perishing  the night had fallen still the wind ceased the noise of the rain had much lightened if it had not stopped and was succeeded by the dripping of the garden trees in the midst of this lull and as i was already drawing near to the cottage i was startled by the sound of a windowsash screaming in its channels and a step or two beyond i became aware of a gush of light upon the darkness  it fell from flora’s window which she had flung open on the night and where she now sat roseate and pensive in the shine of two candles falling from behind her tresses deeply embowering and shading her the suspended comb still in one hand the other idly clinging to the iron stanchions with which the window was barred  keeping to the turf and favoured by the darkness of the night and the patter of the rain which was now returning though without wind i approached until i could almost have touched her  it seemed a grossness of which i was incapable to break up her reverie by speech  i stood and drank her in with my eyes how the light made a glory in her hair and what i have always thought the most ravishing thing in nature how the planes ran into each other and were distinguished and how the hues blended and varied and were shaded off between the cheek and neck  at first i was abashed she wore her beauty like an immediate halo of refinement she discouraged me like an angel or what i suspect to be the next most discouraging a modern lady  but as i continued to gaze hope and life returned to me i forgot my timidity i forgot the sickening pack of wet clothes with which i stood burdened i tingled with new blood  still unconscious of my presence still gazing before her upon the illuminated image of the window the straight shadows of the bars the glinting of pebbles on the path and the impenetrable night on the garden and the hills beyond it she heaved a deep breath that struck upon my heart like an appeal  ‘why does miss gilchrist sigh’ i whispered  ‘does she recall absent friends’  she turned her head swiftly in my direction it was the only sign of surprise she deigned to make  at the same time i stepped into the light and bowed profoundly  ‘you’ she said  ‘here’  ‘yes i am here’ i replied  ‘i have come very far it may be a hundred and fifty leagues to see you  i have waited all this night in your garden  will miss gilchrist not offer her hand—to a friend in trouble’  she extended it between the bars and i dropped upon one knee on the wet path and kissed it twice  at the second it was withdrawn suddenly methought with more of a start than she had hitherto displayed  i regained my former attitude and we were both silent awhile  my timidity returned on me tenfold  i looked in her face for any signals of anger and seeing her eyes to waver and fall aside from mine augured that all was well  ‘you must have been mad to come here’ she broke out  ‘of all places under heaven this is no place for you to come  and i was just thinking you were safe in france’  ‘you were thinking of me’ i cried  ‘mr st ives you cannot understand your danger’ she replied  ‘i am sure of it and yet i cannot find it in my heart to tell you  o be persuaded and go’  ‘i believe i know the worst  but i was never one to set an undue value on life the life that we share with beasts  my university has been in the wars not a famous place of education but one where a man learns to carry his life in his hand as lightly as a glove and for his lady or his honour to lay it as lightly down  you appeal to my fears and you do wrong  i have come to scotland with my eyes quite open to see you and to speak with you—it may be for the last time  with my eyes quite open i say and if i did not hesitate at the beginning do you think that i would draw back now’  ‘you do not know’ she cried with rising agitation  ‘this country even this garden is death to you  they all believe it i am the only one that does not  if they hear you now if they heard a whisper—i dread to think of it  o go go this instant  it is my prayer’  ‘dear lady do not refuse me what i have come so far to seek and remember that out of all the millions in england there is no other but yourself in whom i can dare confide  i have all the world against me you are my only ally and as i have to speak you have to listen  all is true that they say of me and all of it false at the same time  i did kill this man goguelat—it was that you meant’  she mutely signed to me that it was she had become deadly pale  ‘but i killed him in fair fight  till then i had never taken a life unless in battle which is my trade  but i was grateful i was on fire with gratitude to one who had been good to me who had been better to me than i could have dreamed of an angel who had come into the darkness of my prison like sunrise  the man goguelat insulted her  o he had insulted me often it was his favourite pastime and he might insult me as he pleased—for who was i  but with that lady it was different  i could never forgive myself if i had let it pass  and we fought and he fell and i have no remorse’  i waited anxiously for some reply  the worst was now out and i knew that she had heard of it before but it was impossible for me to go on with my narrative without some shadow of encouragement  ‘you blame me’  ‘no not at all  it is a point i cannot speak on—i am only a girl  i am sure you were in the right i have always said so—to ronald  not of course to my aunt  i am afraid i let her speak as she will  you must not think me a disloyal friend and even with the major—i did not tell you he had become quite a friend of ours—major chevenix i mean—he has taken such a fancy to ronald  it was he that brought the news to us of that hateful clausel being captured and all that he was saying  i was indignant with him  i said—i dare say i said too much—and i must say he was very goodnatured  he said “you and i who are his friends know that champdivers is innocent  but what is the use of saying it”  all this was in the corner of the room in what they call an aside  and then he said “give me a chance to speak to you in private i have much to tell you”  and he did  and told me just what you did—that it was an affair of honour and no blame attached to you  o i must say i like that major chevenix’  at this i was seized with a great pang of jealousy  i remembered the first time that he had seen her the interest that he seemed immediately to conceive and i could not but admire the dog for the use he had been ingenious enough to make of our acquaintance in order to supplant me all is fair in love and war  for all that i was now no less anxious to do the speaking myself than i had been before to hear flora  at least i could keep clear of the hateful image of major chevenix  accordingly i burst at once on the narrative of my adventures  it was the same as you have read but briefer and told with a very different purpose  now every incident had a particular bearing every byway branched off to rome—and that was flora  when i had begun to speak i had kneeled upon the gravel withoutside the low window rested my arms upon the sill and lowered my voice to the most confidential whisper  flora herself must kneel upon the other side and this brought our heads upon a level with only the bars between us so placed so separated it seemed that our proximity and the continuous and low sounds of my pleading voice worked progressively and powerfully on her heart and perhaps not less so on my own  for these spells are doubleedged  the silly birds may be charmed with the pipe of the fowler which is but a tube of reeds  not so with a bird of our own feather  as i went on and my resolve strengthened and my voice found new modulations and our faces were drawn closer to the bars and to each other not only she but i succumbed to the fascination and were kindled by the charm  we make love and thereby ourselves fall the deeper in it  it is with the heart only that one captures a heart  ‘and now’ i continued ‘i will tell you what you can still do for me  i run a little risk just now and you see for yourself how unavoidable it is for any man of honour  but if—but in case of the worst i do not choose to enrich either my enemies or the prince regent  i have here the bulk of what my uncle gave me  eight thousand odd pounds  will you take care of it for me  do not think of it merely as money take and keep it as a relic of your friend or some precious piece of him  i may have bitter need of it ere long  do you know the old country story of the giant who gave his heart to his wife to keep for him thinking it safer to repose on her loyalty than his own strength  flora i am the giant—a very little one will you be the keeper of my life  it is my heart i offer you in this symbol  in the sight of god if you will have it i give you my name i endow you with my money  if the worst come if i may never hope to call you wife let me at least think that you will use my uncle’s legacy as my widow’  ‘no not that’ she said  ‘never that’  ‘what then’ i said  ‘what else my angel  what are words to me  there is but one name that i care to know you by  flora my love’  ‘anne’ she said  what sound is so full of music as one’s own name uttered for the first time in the voice of her we love  ‘my darling’ said i  the jealous bars set at the top and bottom in stone and lime obstructed the rapture of the moment but i took her to myself as wholly as they allowed  she did not shun my lips  my arms were wound round her body which yielded itself generously to my embrace  as we so remained entwined and yet severed bruising our faces unconsciously on the cold bars the irony of the universe—or as i prefer to say envy of some of the gods—again stirred up the elements of that stormy night  the wind blew again in the treetops a volley of cold searain deluged the garden and as the deuce would have it a gutter which had been hitherto choked up began suddenly to play upon my head and shoulders with the vivacity of a fountain  we parted with a shock i sprang to my feet and she to hers as though we had been discovered  a moment after but now both standing we had again approached the window on either side  ‘flora’ i said ‘this is but a poor offer i can make you’  she took my hand in hers and clasped it to her bosom  ‘rich enough for a queen’ she said with a lift in her breathing that was more eloquent than words  ‘anne my brave anne  i would be glad to be your maidservant i could envy that boy rowley  but no’ she broke off ‘i envy no one—i need not—i am yours’  ‘mine’ said i ‘for ever  by this and this mine’  ‘all of me’ she repeated  ‘altogether and forever’  and if the god were envious he must have seen with mortification how little he could do to mar the happiness of mortals  i stood in a mere waterspout she herself was wet not from my embrace only but from the splashing of the storm  the candles had guttered out we were in darkness  i could scarce see anything but the shining of her eyes in the dark room  to her i must have appeared as a silhouette haloed by rain and the spouting of the ancient gothic gutter above my head  presently we became more calm and confidential and when that squall which proved to be the last of the storm had blown by fell into a talk of ways and means  it seemed she knew mr robbie to whom i had been so slenderly accredited by romaine—was even invited to his house for the evening of monday and gave me a sketch of the old gentleman’s character which implied a great deal of penetration in herself and proved of great use to me in the immediate sequel  it seemed he was an enthusiastic antiquary and in particular a fanatic of heraldry  i heard it with delight for i was myself thanks to m de culemberg fairly grounded in that science and acquainted with the blazons of most families of note in europe  and i had made up my mind—even as she spoke it was my fixed determination though i was a hundred miles from saying it—to meet flora on monday night as a fellowguest in mr robbie’s house  i gave her my money—it was of course only paper i had brought  i gave it her to be her marriageportion i declared  ‘not so bad a marriageportion for a private soldier’ i told her laughing as i passed it through the bars  ‘o anne and where am i to keep it’ she cried  ‘if my aunt should find it  what would i say’  ‘next your heart’ i suggested  ‘then you will always be near your treasure’ she cried ‘for you are always there’  we were interrupted by a sudden clearness that fell upon the night  the clouds dispersed the stars shone in every part of the heavens and consulting my watch i was startled to find it already hard on five in the morning     chapter xxvii—the sabbath day   it was indeed high time i should be gone from swanston but what i was to do in the meanwhile was another question  rowley had received his orders last night he was to say that i had met a friend and mrs mcrankine was not to expect me before morning  a good enough tale in itself but the dreadful pickle i was in made it out of the question  i could not go home till i had found harbourage a fire to dry my clothes at and a bed where i might lie till they were ready  fortune favoured me again  i had scarce got to the top of the first hill when i spied a light on my left about a furlong away  it might be a case of sickness what else it was likely to be—in so rustic a neighbourhood and at such an ungodly time of the morning—was beyond my fancy  a faint sound of singing became audible and gradually swelled as i drew near until at last i could make out the words which were singularly appropriate both to the hour and to the condition of the singers  ‘the cock may craw the day may daw’ they sang and sang it with such laxity both in time and tune and such sentimental complaisance in the expression as assured me they had got far into the third bottle at least  i found a plain rustic cottage by the wayside of the sort called double with a signboard over the door and the lights within streaming forth and somewhat mitigating the darkness of the morning i was enabled to decipher the inscription ‘the hunters’ tryst by alexander hendry porter ales and british spirits  beds’  my first knock put a period to the music and a voice challenged tipsily from within  ‘who goes there’ it said and i replied ‘a lawful traveller’  immediately after the door was unbarred by a company of the tallest lads my eyes had ever rested on all astonishingly drunk and very decently dressed and one who was perhaps the drunkest of the lot carrying a tallow candle from which he impartially bedewed the clothes of the whole company  as soon as i saw them i could not help smiling to myself to remember the anxiety with which i had approached  they received me and my hastilyconcocted story that i had been walking from peebles and had lost my way with incoherent benignity jostled me among them into the room where they had been sitting a plain hedgerow alehouse parlour with a roaring fire in the chimney and a prodigious number of empty bottles on the floor and informed me that i was made by this reception a temporary member of the sixfeethigh club an athletic society of young men in a good station who made of the hunters’ tryst a frequent resort  they told me i had intruded on an ‘allnight sitting’ following upon an ‘allday saturday tramp’ of forty miles and that the members would all be up and ‘as right as ninepence’ for the noonday service at some neighbouring church—collingwood if memory serves me right  at this i could have laughed but the moment seemed illchosen  for though six feet was their standard they all exceeded that measurement considerably and i tasted again some of the sensations of childhood as i looked up to all these lads from a lower plane and wondered what they would do next but the sixfooters if they were very drunk proved no less kind  the landlord and servants of the hunters’ tryst were in bed and asleep long ago  whether by natural gift or acquired habit they could suffer pandemonium to reign all over the house and yet lie ranked in the kitchen like egyptian mummies only that the sound of their snoring rose and fell ceaselessly like the drone of a bagpipe  here the sixfooters invaded them—in their citadel so to speak counted the bunks and the sleepers proposed to put me in bed to one of the lasses proposed to have one of the lasses out to make room for me fell over chairs and made noise enough to waken the dead the whole illuminated by the same young torchbearer but now with two candles and rapidly beginning to look like a man in a snowstorm  at last a bed was found for me my clothes were hung out to dry before the parlour fire and i was mercifully left to my repose  i awoke about nine with the sun shining in my eyes  the landlord came at my summons brought me my clothes dried and decently brushed and gave me the good news that the sixfeethigh club were all abed and sleeping off their excesses  where they were bestowed was a puzzle to me until as i was strolling about the garden patch waiting for breakfast i came on a barn door and looking in saw all the red face mixed in the straw like plums in a cake  quoth the stalwart maid who brought me my porridge and bade me ’eat them while they were hot’ ‘ay they were a’ on the randan last nicht  hout they’re fine lads and they’ll be nane the waur of it forby farbes’s coat  i dinna see wha’s to get the creish off that’ she added with a sigh in which identifying forbes as the torchbearer i mentally joined  it was a brave morning when i took the road the sun shone spring seemed in the air it smelt like april or may and some overventurous birds sang in the coppices as i went by  i had plenty to think of plenty to be grateful for that gallant morning and yet i had a twitter at my heart  to enter the city by daylight might be compared to marching on a battery every face that i confronted would threaten me like the muzzle of a gun and it came into my head suddenly with how much better a countenance i should be able to do it if i could but improvise a companion  hard by merchiston i was so fortunate as to observe a bulky gentleman in broadcloth and gaiters stooping with his head almost between his knees before a stone wall  seizing occasion by the forelock i drew up as i came alongside and inquired what he had found to interest him  he turned upon me a countenance not much less broad than his back  ‘why sir’ he replied ‘i was even marvelling at my own indefeasible stupeedity that i should walk this way every week of my life weather permitting and should never before have notticed that stone’ touching it at the same time with a goodly oak staff  i followed the indication  the stone which had been built sideways into the wall offered traces of heraldic sculpture  at once there came a wild idea into my mind his appearance tallied with flora’s description of mr robbie a knowledge of heraldry would go far to clinch the proof and what could be more desirable than to scrape an informal acquaintance with the man whom i must approach next day with my tale of the drovers and whom i yet wished to please  i stooped in turn  ‘a chevron’ i said ‘on a chief three mullets  looks like douglas does it not’  ‘yes sir it does you are right’ said he ‘it does look like douglas though without the tinctures and the whole thing being so battered and broken up who shall venture an opinion  but allow me to be more personal sir  in these degenerate days i am astonished you should display so much proficiency’  ‘o i was well grounded in my youth by an old gentleman a friend of my family and i may say my guardian’ said i ‘but i have forgotten it since  god forbid i should delude you into thinking me a herald sir  i am only an ungrammatical amateur’  ‘and a little modesty does no harm even in a herald’ says my new acquaintance graciously  in short we fell together on our onward way and maintained very amicable discourse along what remained of the country road past the suburbs and on into the streets of the new town which was as deserted and silent as a city of the dead  the shops were closed no vehicle ran cats sported in the midst of the sunny causeway and our steps and voices reechoed from the quiet houses  it was the highwater full and strange of that weekly trance to which the city of edinburgh is subjected the apotheosis of the sawbath and i confess the spectacle wanted not grandeur however much it may have lacked cheerfulness  there are few religious ceremonies more imposing  as we thus walked and talked in a public seclusion the bells broke out ringing through all the bounds of the city and the streets began immediately to be thronged with decent churchgoers  ‘ah’ said my companion ‘there are the bells  now sir as you are a stranger i must offer you the hospitality of my pew  i do not know whether you are at all used with our scottish form but in case you are not i will find your places for you and dr henry gray of st mary’s under whom i sit is as good a preacher as we have to show you’  this put me in a quandary  it was a degree of risk i was scarce prepared for  dozens of people who might pass me by in the street with no more than a second look would go on from the second to the third and from that to a final recognition if i were set before them immobilised in a pew during the whole time of service  an unlucky turn of the head would suffice to arrest their attention  ‘who is that’ they would think ‘surely i should know him’ and a church being the place in all the world where one has least to think of it was ten to one they would end by remembering me before the benediction  however my mind was made up i thanked my obliging friend and placed myself at his disposal  our way now led us into the northeast quarter of the town among pleasant new faubourgs to a decent new church of a good size where i was soon seated by the side of my good samaritan and looked upon by a whole congregation of menacing faces  at first the possibility of danger kept me awake but by the time i had assured myself there was none to be apprehended and the service was not in the least likely to be enlivened by the arrest of a french spy i had to resign myself to the task of listening to dr henry gray  as we moved out after this ordeal was over my friend was at once surrounded and claimed by his acquaintances of the congregation and i was rejoiced to hear him addressed by the expected name of robbie  so soon as we were clear of the crowd—‘mr robbie’ said i bowing  ‘the very same sir’ said he  ‘if i mistake not a lawyer’  ‘a writer to his majesty’s signet at your service’  ‘it seems we were predestined to be acquaintances’ i exclaimed  ‘i have here a card in my pocket intended for you  it is from my family lawyer it was his last word as i was leaving to ask to be remembered kindly and to trust you would pass over so informal an introduction’  and i offered him the card  ‘ay ay my old friend daniel’ says he looking on the card  ‘and how does my old friend daniel’  i gave a favourable view of mr romaine’s health  ‘well this is certainly a whimsical incident’ he continued  ‘and since we are thus met already—and so much to my advantage—the simplest thing will be to prosecute the acquaintance instantly  let me propose a snack between sermons a bottle of my particular green seal—and when nobody is looking we can talk blazons mr ducie’—which was the name i then used and had already incidentally mentioned in the vain hope of provoking a return in kind  ‘i beg your pardon sir do i understand you to invite me to your house’ said i  ‘that was the idea i was trying to convey’ said he  ‘we have the name of hospitable people up here and i would like you to try mine’  ‘mr robbie i shall hope to try it some day but not yet’ i replied ‘i hope you will not misunderstand me  my business which brings me to your city is of a peculiar kind  till you shall have heard it and indeed till its issue is known i should feel as if i had stolen your invitation’  ‘well well’ said he a little sobered ‘it must be as you wish though you would hardly speak otherwise if you had committed homicide  mine is the loss  i must eat alone a very pernicious thing for a person of my habit of body content myself with a pint of skinking claret and meditate the discourse  but about this business of yours if it is so particular as all that it will doubtless admit of no delay’  ‘i must confess sir it presses’ i acknowledged  ‘then let us say tomorrow at halfpast eight in the morning’ said he ‘and i hope when your mind is at rest and it does you much honour to take it as you do that you will sit down with me to the postponed meal not forgetting the bottle  you have my address’ he added and gave it me—which was the only thing i wanted  at last at the level of york place we parted with mutual civilities and i was free to pursue my way through the mobs of people returning from church to my lodgings in st james’ square  almost at the house door whom should i overtake but my landlady in a dress of gorgeous severity and dragging a prize in her wake no less than rowley with the cockade in his hat and a smart pair of tops to his boots  when i said he was in the lady’s wake i spoke but in metaphor as a matter of fact he was squiring her with the utmost dignity on his arm and i followed them up the stairs smiling to myself  both were quick to salute me as soon as i was perceived and mrs mcrankine inquired where i had been  i told her boastfully giving her the name of the church and the divine and ignorantly supposing i should have gained caste  but she soon opened my eyes  in the roots of the scottish character there are knots and contortions that not only no stranger can understand but no stranger can follow he walks among explosives and his best course is to throw himself upon their mercy—‘just as i am without one plea’ a citation from one of the lady’s favourite hymns  the sound she made was unmistakable in meaning though it was impossible to be written down and i at once executed the manoeuvre i have recommended  ‘you must remember i am a perfect stranger in your city’ said i  ‘if i have done wrong it was in mere ignorance my dear lady and this afternoon if you will be so good as to take me i shall accompany you’  but she was not to be pacified at the moment and departed to her own quarters murmuring  ‘well rowley’ said i ‘and have you been to church’  ‘if you please sir’ he said  ‘well you have not been any less unlucky than i have’ i returned  ‘and how did you get on with the scottish form’  ‘well sir it was pretty ’ard the form was and reether narrow’ he replied  ‘i don’t know w’y it is but it seems to me like as if things were a good bit changed since william wallace  that was a main queer church she took me to mr anne  i don’t know as i could have sat it out if she ’adn’t ’a’ give me peppermints  she ain’t a bad one at bottom the old girl she do pounce a bit and she do worry but law bless you mr anne it ain’t nothink really—she don’t mean it  w’y she was down on me like a ’undredweight of bricks this morning  you see last night she ’ad me in to supper and i beg your pardon sir but i took the freedom of playing her a chune or two  she didn’t mind a bit so this morning i began to play to myself and she flounced in and flew up and carried on no end about sunday’  ‘you see rowley’ said i ‘they’re all mad up here and you have to humour them  see and don’t quarrel with mrs mcrankine and above all don’t argue with her or you’ll get the worst of it  whatever she says touch your forelock and say “if you please” or “i beg pardon ma’am” and let me tell you one thing i am sorry but you have to go to church with her again this afternoon  that’s duty my boy’  as i had foreseen the bells had scarce begun before mrs mcrankine presented herself to be our escort upon which i sprang up with readiness and offered her my arm  rowley followed behind  i was beginning to grow accustomed to the risks of my stay in edinburgh and it even amused me to confront a new churchful  i confess the amusement did not last until the end for if dr gray were long mr mccraw was not only longer but more incoherent and the matter of his sermon which was a direct attack apparently on all the churches of the world my own among the number where it had not the tonic quality of personal insult rather inclined me to slumber  but i braced myself for my life kept up rowley with the end of a pin and came through it awake but no more  bethiah was quite conquered by this ‘mark of grace’ though i am afraid she was also moved by more worldly considerations  the first is the lady had not the least objection to go to church on the arm of an elegantly dressed young gentleman and be followed by a spruce servant with a cockade in his hat  i could see it by the way she took possession of us found us the places in the bible whispered to me the name of the minister passed us lozenges which i for my part handed on to rowley and at each fresh attention stole a little glance about the church to make sure she was observed  rowley was a pretty boy you will pardon me if i also remembered that i was a favourablelooking young man  when we grow elderly how the room brightens and begins to look as it ought to look on the entrance of youth grace health and comeliness  you do not want them for yourself perhaps not even for your son but you look on smiling and when you recall their images—again it is with a smile i defy you to see or think of them and not smile with an infinite and intimate but quite impersonal pleasure  well either i know nothing of women or that was the case with bethiah mcrankine  she had been to church with a cockade behind her on the one hand on the other her house was brightened by the presence of a pair of goodlooking young fellows of the other sex who were always pleased and deferential in her society and accepted her views as final  these were sentiments to be encouraged and on the way home from church—if church it could be called—i adopted a most insidious device to magnify her interest  i took her into the confidence that is of my love affair and i had no sooner mentioned a young lady with whom my affections were engaged than she turned upon me a face of awful gravity  ‘is she bonny’ she inquired  i gave her full assurances upon that  ‘to what denoamination does she beloang’ came next and was so unexpected as almost to deprive me of breath  ‘upon my word ma’am i have never inquired’ cried i ‘i only know that she is a heartfelt christian and that is enough’  ‘ay’ she sighed ‘if she has the root of the maitter  there’s a remnant practically in most of the denoaminations  there’s some in the mcglashanites and some in the glassites and mony in the mcmillanites and there’s a leeven even in the estayblishment’  ‘i have known some very good papists even if you go to that’ said i  ‘mr ducie think shame to yoursel’’ she cried  ‘why my dear madam  i only—’ i began  ‘you shouldnae jest in sairious maitters’ she interrupted  on the whole she entered into what i chose to tell her of our idyll with avidity like a cat licking her whiskers over a dish of cream and strange to say—and so expansive a passion is that of love—that i derived a perhaps equal satisfaction from confiding in that breast of iron  it made an immediate bond from that hour we seemed to be welded into a familyparty and i had little difficulty in persuading her to join us and to preside over our teatable  surely there was never so illmatched a trio as rowley mrs mcrankine and the viscount anne  but i am of the apostle’s way with a difference all things to all women  when i cannot please a woman hang me in my cravat     chapter xxviii—events of monday the lawyer’s party   by halfpast eight o’clock on the next morning i was ringing the bell of the lawyer’s office in castle street where i found him ensconced at a business table in a room surrounded by several tiers of green tin cases he greeted me like an old friend  ‘come away sir come away’ said he  ‘here is the dentist ready for you and i think i can promise you that the operation will be practically painless’  ‘i am not so sure of that mr robbie’ i replied as i shook hands with him  ‘but at least there shall be no time lost with me’  i had to confess to having gone aroving with a pair of drovers and their cattle to having used a false name to having murdered or halfmurdered a fellowcreature in a scuffle on the moors and to having suffered a couple of quite innocent men to lie some time in prison on a charge from which i could have immediately freed them  all this i gave him first of all to be done with the worst of it and all this he took with gravity but without the least appearance of surprise  ‘now sir’ i continued ‘i expect to have to pay for my unhappy frolic but i would like very well if it could be managed without my personal appearance or even the mention of my real name  i had so much wisdom as to sail under false colours in this foolish jaunt of mine my family would be extremely concerned if they had wind of it but at the same time if the case of this faa has terminated fatally and there are proceedings against todd and candlish i am not going to stand by and see them vexed far less punished and i authorise you to give me up for trial if you think that best—or if you think it unnecessary in the meanwhile to make preparations for their defence  i hope sir that i am as little anxious to be quixotic as i am determined to be just’  ‘very fairly spoken’ said mr robbie  ‘it is not much in my line as doubtless your friend mr romaine will have told you  i rarely mix myself up with anything on the criminal side or approaching it however for a young gentleman like you i may stretch a point and i dare say i may be able to accomplish more than perhaps another  i will go at once to the procurator fiscal’s office and inquire’  ‘wait a moment mr robbie’ said i  ‘you forget the chapter of expenses  i had thought for a beginning of placing a thousand pounds in your hands’  ‘my dear sir you will kindly wait until i render you my bill’ said mr robbie severely’  ‘it seemed to me’ i protested ‘that coming to you almost as a stranger and placing in your hands a piece of business so contrary to your habits some substantial guarantee of my good faith—’  ‘not the way that we do business in scotland sir’ he interrupted with an air of closing the dispute  ‘and yet mr robbie’ i continued ‘i must ask you to allow me to proceed  i do not merely refer to the expenses of the case  i have my eye besides on todd and candlish  they are thoroughly deserving fellows they have been subjected through me to a considerable term of imprisonment and i suggest sir that you should not spare money for their indemnification  this will explain’ i added smiling ‘my offer of the thousand pounds  it was in the nature of a measure by which you should judge the scale on which i can afford to have this business carried through’  ‘i take you perfectly mr ducie’ said he  ‘but the sooner i am off the better this affair is like to be guided  my clerk will show you into the waitingroom and give you the day’s caledonian mercury and the last register to amuse yourself with in the interval’  i believe mr robbie was at least three hours gone  i saw him descend from a cab at the door and almost immediately after i was shown again into his study where the solemnity of his manner led me to augur the worst  for some time he had the inhumanity to read me a lecture as to the incredible silliness ‘not to say immorality’ of my behaviour  ‘i have the satisfaction in telling you my opinion because it appears that you are going to get off scot free’ he continued where indeed i thought he might have begun  ‘the man faa has been discharged cured and the two men todd and candlish would have been leeberated lone ago if it had not been for their extraordinary loyalty to yourself mr ducie—or mr st ivey as i believe i should now call you  never a word would either of the two old fools volunteer that in any manner pointed at the existence of such a person and when they were confronted with faa’s version of the affair they gave accounts so entirely discrepant with their own former declarations as well as with each other that the fiscal was quite nonplussed and imaigined there was something behind it  you may believe i soon laughed him out of that  and i had the satisfaction of seeing your two friends set free and very glad to be on the causeway again’  ‘oh sir’ i cried ‘you should have brought them here’  ‘no instructions mr ducie’ said he  ‘how did i know you wished to renew an acquaintance which you had just terminated so fortunately  and indeed to be frank with you i should have set my face against it if you had  let them go  they are paid and contented and have the highest possible opinion of mr st ivey  when i gave them fifty pounds apiece—which was rather more than enough mr ducie whatever you may think—the man todd who has the only tongue of the party struck his staff on the ground  “weel” says he “i aye said he was a gentleman” “man todd” said i “that was just what mr st ivey said of yourself”’  ‘so it was a case of “compliments fly when gentlefolk meet”’  ‘no no mr ducie man todd and man candlish are gone out of your life and a good riddance  they are fine fellows in their way but no proper associates for the like of yourself and do you finally agree to be done with all eccentricity—take up with no more drovers or tinkers but enjoy the naitural pleesures for which your age your wealth your intelligence and if i may be allowed to say it your appearance so completely fit you  and the first of these’ quoth he looking at his watch ‘will be to step through to my diningroom and share a bachelor’s luncheon’  over the meal which was good mr robbie continued to develop the same theme  ‘you’re no doubt what they call a dancingman’ said he ‘well on thursday night there is the assembly ball  you must certainly go there and you must permit me besides to do the honours of the ceety and send you a ticket  i am a thorough believer in a young man being a young man—but no more drovers or rovers if you love me  talking of which puts me in mind that you may be short of partners at the assembly—oh i have been young myself—and if ye care to come to anything so portentiously tedious as a teaparty at the house of a bachelor lawyer consisting mainly of his nieces and nephews and his grandnieces and grandnephews and his wards and generally the whole clan of the descendants of his clients you might drop in tonight towards seven o’clock  i think i can show you one or two that are worth looking at and you can dance with them later on at the assembly’  he proceeded to give me a sketch of one or two eligible young ladies’ whom i might expect to meet  ‘and then there’s my parteecular friend miss flora’ said he  ‘but i’ll make no attempt of a description  you shall see her for yourself’  it will be readily supposed that i accepted his invitation and returned home to make a toilette worthy of her i was to meet and the good news of which i was the bearer  the toilette i have reason to believe was a success  mr rowley dismissed me with a farewell ‘crikey  mr anne but you do look prime’  even the stony bethiah was—how shall i say—dazzled but scandalised by my appearance and while of course she deplored the vanity that led to it she could not wholly prevent herself from admiring the result  ‘ay mr ducie this is a poor employment for a wayfaring christian man’ she said  ‘wi’ christ despised and rejectit in all pairts of the world and the flag of the covenant flung doon you will be muckle better on your knees  however i’ll have to confess that it sets you weel  and if it’s the lassie ye’re gaun to see the nicht i suppose i’ll just have to excuse ye  bairns maun be bairns’ she said with a sigh  ‘i mind when mr mcrankine came courtin’ and that’s lang bygane—i mind i had a green gown passementit that was thocht to become me to admiration  i was nae just exactly what ye would ca’ bonny but i was pale penetratin’ and interestin’’  and she leaned over the stairrail with a candle to watch my descent as long as it should be possible  it was but a little party at mr robbie’s—by which i do not so much mean that there were few people for the rooms were crowded as that there was very little attempted to entertain them  in one apartment there were tables set out where the elders were solemnly engaged upon whist in the other and larger one a great number of youth of both sexes entertained themselves languidly the ladies sitting upon chairs to be courted the gentlemen standing about in various attitudes of insinuation or indifference  conversation appeared the sole resource except in so far as it was modified by a number of keepsakes and annuals which lay dispersed upon the tables and of which the young beaux displayed the illustrations to the ladies  mr robbie himself was customarily in the cardroom only now and again when he cut out he made an incursion among the young folks and rolled about jovially from one to another the very picture of the general uncle  it chanced that flora had met mr robbie in the course of the afternoon ‘now miss flora’ he had said ‘come early for i have a phoenix to show you—one mr ducie a new client of mine that i vow i have fallen in love with’ and he was so good as to add a word or two on my appearance from which flora conceived a suspicion of the truth  she had come to the party in consequence on the knifeedge of anticipation and alarm had chosen a place by the door where i found her on my arrival surrounded by a posse of vapid youths and when i drew near sprang up to meet me in the most natural manner in the world and obviously with a prepared form of words  ‘how do you do mr ducie’ she said  ‘it is quite an age since i have seen you’  ‘i have much to tell you miss gilchrist’ i replied  ‘may i sit down’  for the artful girl by sitting near the door and the judicious use of her shawl had contrived to keep a chair empty by her side  she made room for me as a matter of course and the youths had the discretion to melt before us  as soon as i was once seated her fan flew out and she whispered behind it  ‘are you mad’  ‘madly in love’ i replied ‘but in no other sense’  ‘i have no patience  you cannot understand what i am suffering’ she said  ‘what are you to say to ronald to major chevenix to my aunt’  your aunt’ i cried with a start  ‘peccavi is she here’  ‘she is in the cardroom at whist’ said flora  ‘where she will probably stay all the evening’ i suggested  ‘she may’ she admitted ‘she generally does’  ‘well then i must avoid the cardroom’ said i ‘which is very much what i had counted upon doing  i did not come here to play cards but to contemplate a certain young lady to my heart’s content—if it can ever be contented—and to tell her some good news’  ‘but there are still ronald and the major’ she persisted  ‘they are not cardroom fixtures  ronald will be coming and going  and as for mr chevenix he—’  ‘always sits with miss flora’ i interrupted  ‘and they talk of poor st ives  i had gathered as much my dear and mr ducie has come to prevent it  but pray dismiss these fears  i mind no one but your aunt’  ‘why my aunt’  ‘because your aunt is a lady my dear and a very clever lady and like all clever ladies a very rash lady’ said i  ‘you can never count upon them unless you are sure of getting them in a corner as i have got you and talking them over rationally as i am just engaged on with yourself it would be quite the same to your aunt to make the worst kind of a scandal with an equal indifference to my danger and to the feelings of our good host’  ‘well’ she said ‘and what of ronald then  do you think he is above making a scandal  you must know him very little’  ‘on the other hand it is my pretension that i know him very well’ i replied  ‘i must speak to ronald first—not ronald to me—that is all’  ‘then please go and speak to him at once’ she pleaded  he is there—do you see—at the upper end of the room talking to that girl in pink’  ‘and so lose this seat before i have told you my good news’ i exclaimed ‘catch me  and besides my dear one think a little of me and my good news  i thought the bearer of good news was always welcome  i hoped he might be a little welcome for himself  consider  i have but one friend and let me stay by her  and there is only one thing i care to hear and let me hear it’  ‘oh anne’ she sighed ‘if i did not love you why should i be so uneasy  i am turned into a coward dear  think if it were the other way round—if you were quite safe and i was in oh such danger’  she had no sooner said it than i was convicted of being a dullard  ‘god forgive me dear’  i made haste to reply  ‘i never saw before that there were two sides to this’  and i told her my tale as briefly as i could and rose to seek ronald  ‘you see my dear you are obeyed’ i said  she gave me a look that was a reward in itself and as i turned away from her with a strong sense of turning away from the sun i carried that look in my bosom like a caress  the girl in pink was an arch ogling person with a good deal of eyes and teeth and a great play of shoulders and rattle of conversation  there could be no doubt from mr ronald’s attitude that he worshipped the very chair she sat on  but i was quite ruthless  i laid my hand on his shoulder as he was stooping over her like a hen over a chicken  ‘excuse me for one moment mr gilchrist’ said i  he started and span about in answer to my touch and exhibited a face of inarticulate wonder   ‘yes’ i continued ‘it is even myself  pardon me for interrupting so agreeable a têteàtête but you know my good fellow we owe a first duty to mr robbie  it would never do to risk making a scene in the man’s drawingroom so the first thing i had to attend to was to have you warned  the name i go by is ducie too in case of accidents’  ‘i—i say you know’ cried ronald  ‘deuce take it what are you doing here’  ‘hush hush’ said i  ‘not the place my dear fellow—not the place come to my rooms if you like tonight after the party or tomorrow in the morning and we can talk it out over a segar  but here you know it really won’t do at all’  before he could collect his mind for an answer i had given him my address in st james square and had again mingled with the crowd  alas i was not fated to get back to flora so easily  mr robbie was in the path he was insatiably loquacious and as he continued to palaver i watched the insipid youths gather again about my idol and cursed my fate and my host  he remembered suddenly that i was to attend the assembly ball on thursday and had only attended tonight by way of a preparative this put it into his head to present me to another young lady but i managed this interview with so much art that while i was scrupulously polite and even cordial to the fair one i contrived to keep robbie beside me all the time and to leave along with him when the ordeal was over  we were just walking away arm in arm when i spied my friend the major approaching stiff as a ramrod and as usual obtrusively clean  ‘oh there’s a man i want to know’ said i taking the bull by the horns ‘won’t you introduce me to major chevenix’  ‘at a word my dear fellow’ said robbie and ‘major’ he cried ‘come here and let me present to you my friend mr ducie who desires the honour of your acquaintance’  the major flushed visibly but otherwise preserved his composure  he bowed very low  ‘i’m not very sure’ he said ‘i have an idea we have met before’  ‘informally’ i said returning his bow ‘and i have long looked forward to the pleasure of regularising our acquaintance’  ‘you are very good mr ducie’ he returned  ‘perhaps you could aid my memory a little  where was it that i had the pleasure’  ‘oh that would be telling tales out of school’ said i with a laugh ‘and before my lawyer too’  ‘i’ll wager’ broke in mr robbie ‘that when you knew my client chevenix—the past of our friend mr ducie is an obscure chapter full of horrid secrets—i’ll wager now you knew him as st ivey’ says he nudging me violently  ‘i think not sir’ said the major with pinched lips  ‘well i wish he may prove all right’ continued the lawyer with certainly the worstinspired jocularity in the world  ‘i know nothing by him  he may be a swell mobsman for me with his aliases  you must put your memory on the rack major and when ye’ve remembered when and where ye met him be sure ye tell me’  ‘i will not fail sir’ said chevenix  ‘seek to him’ cried robbie waving his hand as he departed  the major as soon as we were alone turned upon me his impassive countenance  ‘well’ he said ‘you have courage’  ‘it is undoubted as your honour sir’ i returned bowing  ‘did you expect to meet me may i ask’ said he  ‘you saw at least that i courted the presentation’ said i  ‘and you were not afraid’ said chevenix  ‘i was perfectly at ease  i knew i was dealing with a gentleman  be that your epitaph’  ‘well there are some other people looking for you’ he said ‘who will make no bones about the point of honour  the police my dear sir are simply agog about you’  ‘and i think that that was coarse’ said i  ‘you have seen miss gilchrist’ he inquired changing the subject  ‘with whom i am led to understand we are on a footing of rivalry’ i asked  ‘yes i have seen her’  ‘and i was just seeking her’ he replied  i was conscious of a certain thrill of temper so i suppose was he  we looked each other up and down  ‘the situation is original’ he resumed  ‘quite’ said i  ‘but let me tell you frankly you are blowing a cold coal  i owe you so much for your kindness to the prisoner champdivers’  ‘meaning that the lady’s affections are more advantageously disposed of’ he asked with a sneer  ‘thank you i am sure  and since you have given me a lead just hear a word of good advice in your turn  is it fair is it delicate is it like a gentleman to compromise the young lady by attentions which as you know very well can come to nothing’  i was utterly unable to find words in answer  ‘excuse me if i cut this interview short’ he went on  ‘it seems to me doomed to come to nothing and there is more attractive metal’  ‘yes’ i replied ‘as you say it cannot amount to much  you are impotent bound hand and foot in honour  you know me to be a man falsely accused and even if you did not know it from your position as my rival you have only the choice to stand quite still or to be infamous’  ‘i would not say that’ he returned with another change of colour  ‘i may hear it once too often’  with which he moved off straight for where flora was sitting amidst her court of vapid youths and i had no choice but to follow him a bad second and reading myself as i went a sharp lesson on the command of temper  it is a strange thing how young men in their teens go down at the mere wind of the coming of men of twentyfive and upwards  the vapid ones fled without thought of resistance before the major and me a few dallied awhile in the neighbourhood—so to speak with their fingers in their mouths—but presently these also followed the rout and we remained face to face before flora  there was a draught in that corner by the door she had thrown her pelisse over her bare arms and neck and the dark fur of the trimming set them off  she shone by contrast the light played on her smooth skin to admiration and the colour changed in her excited face  for the least fraction of a second she looked from one to the other of her pair of rival swains and seemed to hesitate  then she addressed chevenix—  ‘you are coming to the assembly of course major chevenix’ said she  ‘i fear not i fear i shall be otherwise engaged’ he replied  ‘even the pleasure of dancing with you miss flora must give way to duty’  for awhile the talk ran harmlessly on the weather and then branched off towards the war  it seemed to be by no one’s fault it was in the air and had to come  ‘good news from the scene of operations’ said the major  ‘good news while it lasts’ i said  ‘but will miss gilchrist tell us her private thought upon the war  in her admiration for the victors does not there mingle some pity for the vanquished’  ‘indeed sir’ she said with animation ‘only too much of it  war is a subject that i do not think should be talked of to a girl  i am i have to be—what do you call it—a noncombatant  and to remind me of what others have to do and suffer no it is not fair’  ‘miss gilchrist has the tender female heart’ said chevenix  ‘do not be too sure of that’ she cried  ‘i would love to be allowed to fight myself’  ‘on which side’ i asked  ‘can you ask’ she exclaimed  ‘i am a scottish girl’  ‘she is a scottish girl’ repeated the major looking at me  ‘and no one grudges you her pity’  ‘and i glory in every grain of it she has to spare’ said i  ‘pity is akin to love’  ‘well and let us put that question to miss gilchrist  it is for her to decide and for us to bow to the decision  is pity miss flora or is admiration nearest love’  ‘oh come’ said i ‘let us be more concrete  lay before the lady a complete case describe your man then i’ll describe mine and miss flora shall decide’  ‘i think i see your meaning’ said he ‘and i’ll try  you think that pity—and the kindred sentiments—have the greatest power upon the heart i think more nobly of women  to my view the man they love will first of all command their respect he will be steadfast—proud if you please dry possibly—but of all things steadfast  they will look at him in doubt at last they will see that stern face which he presents to all the rest of the world soften to them alone  first trust i say  it is so that a woman loves who is worthy of heroes’  ‘your man is very ambitious sir’ said i ‘and very much of a hero mine is a humbler and i would fain think a more human dog  he is one with no particular trust in himself with no superior steadfastness to be admired for who sees a lady’s face who hears her voice and without any phrase about the matter falls in love  what does he ask for then but pity—pity for his weakness pity for his love which is his life you would make women always the inferiors gaping up at your imaginary lover he like a marble statue with his nose in the air  but god has been wiser than you and the most steadfast of your heroes may prove human after all  we appeal to the queen for judgment’ i added turning and bowing before flora  ‘and how shall the queen judge’ she asked  ‘i must give you an answer that is no answer at all  “the wind bloweth where it listeth” she goes where her heart goes’  her face flushed as she said it mine also for i read in it a declaration and my heart swelled for joy  but chevenix grew pale  ‘you make of life a very dreadful kind of lottery ma’am’ said he  ‘but i will not despair  honest and unornamental is still my choice’  and i must say he looked extremely handsome and very amusingly like the marble statue with its nose in the air to which i had compared him  ‘i cannot imagine how we got upon this subject’ said flora  ‘madame it was through the war’ replied chevenix  ‘all roads lead to rome’ i commented  ‘what else would you expect mr chevenix and myself to talk of’  about this time i was conscious of a certain bustle and movement in the room behind me but did not pay to it that degree of attention which perhaps would have been wise  there came a certain change in flora’s face she signalled repeatedly with her fan her eyes appealed to me obsequiously there could be no doubt that she wanted something—as well as i could make out that i should go away and leave the field clear for my rival which i had not the least idea of doing  at last she rose from her chair with impatience  ‘i think it time you were saying goodnight mr ducie’ she said  i could not in the least see why and said so  whereupon she gave me this appalling answer ‘my aunt is coming out of the cardroom’  in less time than it takes to tell i had made my bow and my escape looking back from the doorway i was privileged to see for a moment the august profile and gold eyeglasses of miss gilchrist issuing from the cardroom and the sight lent me wings  i stood not on the order of my going and a moment after i was on the pavement of castle street and the lighted windows shone down on me and were crossed by ironical shadows of those who had remained behind     chapter xxix—events of tuesday the toils closing   this day began with a surprise  i found a letter on my breakfasttable addressed to edward ducie esquire and at first i was startled beyond measure  ‘conscience doth make cowards of us all’  when i had opened it it proved to be only a note from the lawyer enclosing a card for the assembly ball on thursday evening  shortly after as i was composing my mind with a segar at one of the windows of the sittingroom and rowley having finished the light share of work that fell to him sat not far off tootling with great spirit and a marked preference for the upper octave ronald was suddenly shown in  i got him a segar drew in a chair to the side of the fire and installed him there—i was going to say at his ease but no expression could be farther from the truth  he was plainly on pins and needles did not know whether to take or to refuse the segar and after he had taken it did not know whether to light or to return it  i saw he had something to say i did not think it was his own something and i was ready to offer a large bet it was really something of major chevenix’s  ‘well and so here you are’ i observed with pointless cordiality for i was bound i should do nothing to help him out  if he were indeed here running errands for my rival he might have a fair field but certainly no favour  ‘the fact is’ he began ‘i would rather see you alone’  ‘why certainly’ i replied  ‘rowley you can step into the bedroom  my dear fellow’ i continued ‘this sounds serious  nothing wrong i trust’  ‘well i’ll be quite honest’ said he  ‘i am a good deal bothered’  ‘and i bet i know why’ i exclaimed  ‘and i bet i can put you to rights too’  ‘what do you mean’ he asked  ‘you must be hard up’ said i ‘and all i can say is you’ve come to the right place  if you have the least use for a hundred pounds or any such trifling sum as that please mention it  it’s here quite at your service’  ‘i am sure it is most kind of you’ said ronald ‘and the truth is though i can’t think how you guessed it that i really am a little behind board  but i haven’t come to talk about that’  ‘no i dare say’ cried i  ‘not worth talking about  but remember ronald you and i are on different sides of the business  remember that you did me one of those services that make men friends for ever  and since i have had the fortune to come into a fair share of money just oblige me and consider so much of it as your own’  ‘no’ he said ‘i couldn’t take it i couldn’t really  besides the fact is i’ve come on a very different matter  it’s about my sister st ives’ and he shook his head menacingly at me  ‘you’re quite sure’ i persisted  ‘it’s here at your service—up to five hundred pounds if you like  well all right only remember where it is when you do want it’  ‘oh please let me alone’ cried ronald ‘i’ve come to say something unpleasant and how on earth can i do it if you don’t give a fellow a chance  it’s about my sister as i said  you can see for yourself that it can’t be allowed to go on  it’s compromising it don’t lead to anything and you’re not the kind of man you must feel it yourself that i can allow my female relatives to have anything to do with  i hate saying this st ives it looks like hitting a man when he’s down you know and i told the major i very much disliked it from the first however it had to be said and now it has been and between gentlemen it shouldn’t be necessary to refer to it again’  ‘it’s compromising it doesn’t lead to anything not the kind of man’ i repeated thoughtfully  ‘yes i believe i understand and shall make haste to put myself en règle’  i stood up and laid my segar down ‘mr gilchrist’ said i with a bow ‘in answer to your very natural observations i beg to offer myself as a suitor for your sister’s hand i am a man of title of which we think lightly in france but of ancient lineage which is everywhere prized  i can display thirtytwo quarterings without a blot  my expectations are certainly above the average i believe my uncle’s income averages about thirty thousand pounds though i admit i was not careful to inform myself  put it anywhere between fifteen and fifty thousand it is certainly not less’  ‘all this is very easy to say’ said ronald with a pitying smile ‘unfortunately these things are in the air’  ‘pardon me—in buckinghamshire’ said i smiling  ‘well what i mean is my dear st ives that you can’t prove them’ he continued  ‘they might just as well not be do you follow me  you can’t bring us any third party to back you’  ‘oh come’ cried i springing up and hurrying to the table  ‘you must excuse me’  i wrote romaine’s address  ‘there is my reference mr gilchrist  until you have written to him and received his negative answer i have a right to be treated and i shall see that you treat me as a gentleman’  he was brought up with a round turn at that  ‘i beg your pardon st ives’ said he  ‘believe me i had no wish to be offensive  but there’s the difficulty of this affair i can’t make any of my points without offence  you must excuse me it’s not my fault but at any rate you must see for yourself this proposal of marriage is—is merely impossible my dear fellow  it’s nonsense  our countries are at war you are a prisoner’  ‘my ancestor of the time of the ligue’ i replied ‘married a huguenot lady out of the saintonge riding two hundred miles through an enemy’s country to bring off his bride and it was a happy marriage’  ‘well’ he began and then looked down into the fire and became silent  ‘well’ i asked  ‘well there’s this business of—goguelat’ said he still looking at the coals in the grate  ‘what’ i exclaimed starting in my chair  ‘what’s that you say’  ‘this business about goguelat’ he repeated  ‘ronald’ said i ‘this is not your doing  these are not your own words i know where they came from a coward put them in your mouth’  ‘st ives’ he cried ‘why do you make it so hard for me and where’s the use of insulting other people  the plain english is that i can’t hear of any proposal of marriage from a man under a charge like that  you must see it for yourself man  it’s the most absurd thing i ever heard of  and you go on forcing me to argue with you too’  ‘because i have had an affair of honour which terminated unhappily you—a young soldier or nextdoor to it—refuse my offer  do i understand you aright’ said i  ‘my dear fellow’ he wailed ‘of course you can twist my words if you like  you say it was an affair of honour  well i can’t of course tell you that—i can’t—i mean you must see that that’s just the point was it  i don’t know’  ‘i have the honour to inform you’ said i  ‘well other people say the reverse you see’  ‘they lie ronald and i will prove it in time’  ‘the short and the long of it is that any man who is so unfortunate as to have such things said about him is not the man to be my brotherinlaw’ he cried  ‘do you know who will be my first witness at the court  arthur chevenix’ said i  ‘i don’t care’ he cried rising from his chair and beginning to pace outrageously about the room  ‘what do you mean st ives  what is this about  it’s like a dream i declare  you made an offer and i have refused it  i don’t like it i don’t want it and whatever i did or didn’t wouldn’t matter—my aunt wouldn’t bear of it anyway  can’t you take your answer man’  ‘you must remember ronald that we are playing with edged tools’ said i  ‘an offer of marriage is a delicate subject to handle  you have refused and you have justified your refusal by several statements first that i was an impostor second that our countries were at war and third— no i will speak’ said i ‘you can answer when i have done—and third that i had dishonourably killed—or was said to have done so—the man goguelat  now my dear fellow these are very awkward grounds to be taking  from any one else’s lips i need scarce tell you how i should resent them but my hands are tied  i have so much gratitude to you without talking of the love i bear your sister that you insult me when you do so under the cover of a complete impunity  i must feel the pain—and i do feel it acutely—i can do nothing to protect myself’  he had been anxious enough to interrupt me in the beginning but now and after i had ceased he stood a long while silent  ‘st ives’ he said at last ‘i think i had better go away  this has been very irritating  i never at all meant to say anything of the kind and i apologise to you  i have all the esteem for you that one gentleman should have for another  i only meant to tell you—to show you what had influenced my mind and that in short the thing was impossible  one thing you may be quite sure of i shall do nothing against you  will you shake hands before i go away’ he blurted out  ‘yes’ said i ‘i agree with you—the interview has been irritating  let bygones be bygones  goodbye ronald’  ‘goodbye st ives’ he returned  ‘i’m heartily sorry’  and with that he was gone  the windows of my own sittingroom looked towards the north but the entrance passage drew its light from the direction of the square  hence i was able to observe ronald’s departure his very disheartened gait and the fact that he was joined about halfway by no less a man than major chevenix  at this i could scarce keep from smiling so unpalatable an interview must be before the pair of them and i could hear their voices clashing like crossed swords in that eternal antiphony of ‘i told you’ and ‘i told you not’  without doubt they had gained very little by their visit but then i had gained less than nothing and had been bitterly dispirited into the bargain  ronald had stuck to his guns and refused me to the last  it was no news but on the other hand it could not be contorted into good news  i was now certain that during my temporary absence in france all irons would be put into the fire and the world turned upside down to make flora disown the obtrusive frenchman and accept chevenix  without doubt she would resist these instances but the thought of them did not please me and i felt she should be warned and prepared for the battle  it was no use to try and see her now but i promised myself early that evening to return to swanston  in the meantime i had to make all my preparations and look the coming journey in the face  here in edinburgh i was within four miles of the sea yet the business of approaching random fishermen with my hat in the one hand and a knife in the other appeared so desperate that i saw nothing for it but to retrace my steps over the northern counties and knock a second time at the doors of birchell fenn  to do this money would be necessary and after leaving my paper in the hands of flora i had still a balance of about fifteen hundred pounds  or rather i may say i had them and i had them not for after my luncheon with mr robbie i had placed the amount all but thirty pounds of change in a bank in george street on a deposit receipt in the name of mr rowley  this i had designed to be my gift to him in case i must suddenly depart  but now thinking better of the arrangement i despatched my little man cockade and all to lift the fifteen hundred  he was not long gone and returned with a flushed face and the deposit receipt still in his hand  ‘no go mr anne’ says he  ‘how’s that’ i inquired  ‘well sir i found the place all right and no mistake’ said he  ‘but i tell you what gave me a blue fright  there was a customer standing by the door and i reckonised him  who do you think it was mr anne  w’y that same redbreast—him i had breakfast with near aylesbury’  ‘you are sure you are not mistaken’ i asked  ‘certain sure’ he replied  ‘not mr lavender i don’t mean sir i mean the other party  “wot’s he doing here’ says i  it don’t look right”’  ‘not by any means’ i agreed  i walked to and fro in the apartment reflecting  this particular bow street runner might be here by accident but it was to imagine a singular play of coincidence that he who had met rowley and spoken with him in the ‘green dragon’ hard by aylesbury should be now in scotland where he could have no legitimate business and by the doors of the bank where rowley kept his account  ‘rowley’ said i ‘he didn’t see you did he’  ‘never a fear’ quoth rowley  ‘w’y mr anne sir if he ’ad you wouldn’t have seen me any more  i ain’t a hass sir’  ‘well my boy you can put that receipt in your pocket  you’ll have no more use for it till you’re quite clear of me  don’t lose it though it’s your share of the christmasbox fifteen hundred pounds all for yourself’  ‘begging your pardon mr anne sir but wot for’ said rowley  ‘to set up a publichouse upon’ said i  ‘if you’ll excuse me sir i ain’t got any call to set up a publichouse sir’ he replied stoutly  ‘and i tell you wot sir it seems to me i’m reether young for the billet  i’m your body servant mr anne or else i’m nothink’  ‘well rowley’ i said ‘i’ll tell you what it’s for  it’s for the good service you have done me of which i don’t care—and don’t dare—to speak it’s for your loyalty and cheerfulness my dear boy  i had meant it for you but to tell you the truth it’s past mending now—it has to be yours since that man is waiting by the bank the money can’t be touched until i’m gone’  ‘until you’re gone sir’ reechoed rowley  ‘you don’t go anywheres without me i can tell you that mr anne sir’  ‘yes my boy’ said i ‘we are going to part very soon now probably tomorrow  and it’s for my sake rowley  depend upon it if there was any reason at all for that bow street man being at the bank he was not there to look out for you  how they could have found out about the account so early is more than i can fathom some strange coincidence must have played me false  but there the fact is and rowley i’ll not only have to say farewell to you presently i’ll have to ask you to stay indoors until i can say it  remember my boy it’s only so that you can serve me now’  ‘w’y sir you say the word and of course i’ll do it’ he cried ‘“nothink by ’alves” is my motto  i’m your man through thick and thin live or die i am’  in the meantime there was nothing to be done till towards sunset  my only chance now was to come again as quickly as possible to speech of flora who was my only practicable banker and not before evening was it worth while to think of that  i might compose myself as well as i was able over the caledonian mercury with its ill news of the campaign of france and belated documents about the retreat from russia and as i sat there by the fire i was sometimes all awake with anger and mortification at what i was reading and sometimes again i would be three parts asleep as i dozed over the barren items of home intelligence  ‘lately arrived’—this is what i suddenly stumbled on—‘at dumbreck’s hotel the viscount of saintyves’  ‘rowley’ said i  ‘if you please mr anne sir’ answered the obsequious lowering his pipe  ‘come and look at this my boy’ said i holding out the paper  ‘my crikey’ said he  ‘that’s ’im sir sure enough’  ‘sure enough rowley’ said i  ‘he’s on the trail  he has fairly caught up with us  he and this bow street man have come together i would swear  and now here is the whole field quarry hounds and hunters all together in this city of edinburgh’  ‘and wot are you goin’ to do now sir  tell you wot let me take it in ’and please  gimme a minute and i’ll disguise myself and go out to this dum to this hotel leastways sir—and see wot he’s up to  you put your trust in me mr anne i’m fly don’t you make no mistake about it  i’m all agrowing and ablowing i am’  ‘not one foot of you’ said i  ‘you are a prisoner rowley and make up your mind to that  so am i or next door to it  i showed it you for a caution if you go on the streets it spells death to me rowley’  ‘if you please sir’ says rowley  ‘come to think of it’ i continued ‘you must take a cold or something no good of awakening mrs mcrankine’s suspicions’  ‘a cold’ he cried recovering immediately from his depression  ‘i can do it mr anne’  and he proceeded to sneeze and cough and blow his nose till i could not restrain myself from smiling  ‘oh i tell you i know a lot of them dodges’ he observed proudly  ‘well they come in very handy’ said i  ‘i’d better go at once and show it to the old gal ’adn’t i’ he asked  i told him by all means and he was gone upon the instant gleeful as though to a game of football  i took up the paper and read carelessly on my thoughts engaged with my immediate danger till i struck on the next paragraph—      ‘in connection with the recent horrid murder in the castle we are     desired to make public the following intelligence  the soldier     champdivers is supposed to be in the neighbourhood of this city  he     is about the middle height or rather under of a pleasing appearance     and highly genteel address  when last heard of he wore a fashionable     suit of pearlgrey and boots with fawncoloured tops  he is     accompanied by a servant about sixteen years of age speaks english     without any accent and passed under the alias of ramornie  a     reward is offered for his apprehension’  in a moment i was in the next room stripping from me the pearlcoloured suit  i confess i was now a good deal agitated  it is difficult to watch the toils closing slowly and surely about you and to retain your composure and i was glad that rowley was not present to spy on my confusion  i was flushed my breath came thick i cannot remember a time when i was more put out  and yet i must wait and do nothing and partake of my meals and entertain the evergarrulous rowley as though i were entirely my own man  and if i did not require to entertain mrs mcrankine also that was but another drop of bitterness in my cup  for what ailed my landlady that she should hold herself so severely aloof that she should refuse conversation that her eyes should be reddened that i should so continually hear the voice of her private supplications sounding through the house  i was much deceived or she had read the insidious paragraph and recognised the comminated pearlgrey suit  i remember now a certain air with which she had laid the paper on my table and a certain sniff between sympathy and defiance with which she had announced it ‘there’s your mercury for ye’  in this direction at least i saw no pressing danger her tragic countenance betokened agitation it was plain she was wrestling with her conscience and the battle still hung dubious  the question of what to do troubled me extremely  i could not venture to touch such an intricate and mysterious piece of machinery as my landlady’s spiritual nature it might go off at a word and in any direction like a badlymade firework and while i praised myself extremely for my wisdom in the past that i had made so much a friend of her i was all abroad as to my conduct in the present  there seemed an equal danger in pressing and in neglecting the accustomed marks of familiarity  the one extreme looked like impudence and might annoy the other was a practical confession of guilt  altogether it was a good hour for me when the dusk began to fall in earnest on the streets of edinburgh and the voice of an early watchman bade me set forth  i reached the neighbourhood of the cottage before seven and as i breasted the steep ascent which leads to the garden wall i was struck with surprise to hear a dog  dogs i had heard before but only from the hamlet on the hillside above  now this dog was in the garden itself where it roared aloud in paroxysms of fury and i could hear it leaping and straining on the chain  i waited some while until the brute’s fit of passion had roared itself out  then with the utmost precaution i drew near again and finally approached the garden wall  so soon as i had clapped my head above the level however the barking broke forth again with redoubled energy  almost at the same time the door of the cottage opened and ronald and the major appeared upon the threshold with a lantern  as they so stood they were almost immediately below me strongly illuminated and within easy earshot  the major pacified the dog who took instead to low uneasy growling intermingled with occasional yelps  ‘good thing i brought towzer’ said chevenix  ‘damn him i wonder where he is’ said ronald and he moved the lantern up and down and turned the night into a shifting puzzlework of gleam and shadow  ‘i think i’ll make a sally’  ‘i don’t think you will’ replied chevenix  ‘when i agreed to come out here and do sentrygo it was on one condition master ronald don’t you forget that  military discipline my boy  our beat is this path close about the house  down towzer good boy good boy—gently then’ he went on caressing his confounded monster  ‘to think  the beggar may be hearing us this minute’ cried ronald  ‘nothing more probable’ said the major  ‘you there st ives’ he added in a distinct but guarded voice  ‘i only want to tell you you had better go home  mr gilchrist and i take watch and watch’  the game was up  ‘beaucoup de plaisir’ i replied in the same tones ‘il fait un peu froid pour veiller gardezvous des engelures’  i suppose it was done in a moment of ungovernable rage but in spite of the excellent advice he had given to ronald the moment before chevenix slipped the chain and the dog sprang straight as an arrow up the bank i stepped back picked up a stone of about twelve pounds weight and stood ready  with a bound the beast landed on the copestone of the wall and almost in the same instant my missile caught him fair in the face  he gave a stifled cry went tumbling back where he had come from and i could hear the twelvepounder accompany him in his fall  chevenix at the same moment broke out in a roaring voice ‘the hellhound  if he’s killed my dog’ and i judged upon all grounds it was as well to be off     chapter xxx—events of wednesday the university of cramond   i awoke to much diffidence even to a feeling that might be called the beginnings of panic and lay for hours in my bed considering the situation  seek where i pleased there was nothing to encourage me and plenty to appal  they kept a close watch about the cottage they had a beast of a watchdog—at least unless i had settled it and if i had i knew its bereaved master would only watch the more indefatigably for the loss  in the pardonable ostentation of love i had given all the money i could spare to flora i had thought it glorious that the hunted exile should come down like jupiter in a shower of gold and pour thousands in the lap of the beloved  then i had in an hour of arrant folly buried what remained to me in a bank in george street  and now i must get back the one or the other and which and how  as i tossed in my bed i could see three possible courses all extremely perilous  first rowley might have been mistaken the bank might not be watched it might still be possible for him to draw the money on the deposit receipt  second i might apply again to robbie  or third i might dare everything go to the assembly ball and speak with flora under the eyes of all edinburgh  this last alternative involving as it did the most horrid risks and the delay of fortyeight hours i did but glance at with an averted head and turned again to the consideration of the others  it was the likeliest thing in the world that robbie had been warned to have no more to do with me the whole policy of the gilchrists was in the hands of chevenix and i thought this was a precaution so elementary that he was certain to have taken it  if he had not of course i was all right robbie would manage to communicate with flora and by four o’clock i might be on the south road and i was going to say a free man  lastly i must assure myself with my own eyes whether the bank in george street were beleaguered  i called to rowley and questioned him tightly as to the appearance of the bow street officer  ‘what sort of looking man is he rowley’ i asked as i began to dress  ‘wot sort of a looking man he is’ repeated rowley  ‘well i don’t very well know wot you would say mr anne  he ain’t a beauty any’ow’  ‘is he tall’  ‘tall  well no i shouldn’t say tall mr anne’  ‘well then is he short’  ‘short  no i don’t think i would say he was what you would call short  no not piticular short sir’  ‘then i suppose he must be about the middle height’  ‘well you might say it sir but not remarkable so’  i smothered an oath  ‘is he cleanshaved’ i tried him again  ‘cleanshaved’ he repeated with the same air of anxious candour  ‘good heaven man don’t repeat my words like a parrot’ i cried  ‘tell me what the man was like it is of the first importance that i should be able to recognise him’  ‘i’m trying to mr anne  but cleanshaved  i don’t seem to rightly get hold of that p’int  sometimes it might appear to me like as if he was and sometimes like as if he wasn’t  no it wouldn’t surprise me now if you was to tell me he ’ad a bit o’ whisker’  ‘was the man redfaced’ i roared dwelling on each syllable  ‘i don’t think you need go for to get cross about it mr anne’ said he ‘i’m tellin’ you every blessed thing i see  redfaced  well no not as you would remark upon’  a dreadful calm fell upon me  ‘was he anywise pale’ i asked  ‘well it don’t seem to me as though he were  but i tell you truly i didn’t take much heed to that’  ‘did he look like a drinking man’  ‘well no  if you please sir he looked more like an eating one’  ‘oh he was stout was he’  ‘no sir  i couldn’t go so far as that  no he wasn’t not to say stout  if anything lean rather’  i need not go on with the infuriating interview  it ended as it began except that rowley was in tears and that i had acquired one fact  the man was drawn for me as being of any height you like to mention and of any degree of corpulence or leanness cleanshaved or not as the case might be the colour of his hair rowley ‘could not take it upon himself to put a name on’ that of his eyes he thought to have been blue—nay it was the one point on which he attained to a kind of tearful certainty ‘i’ll take my davy on it’ he asseverated  they proved to have been as black as sloes very little and very near together  so much for the evidence of the artless  and the fact or rather the facts acquired well they had to do not with the person but with his clothing  the man wore kneebreeches and white stockings his coat was ‘some kind of a lightish colour—or betwixt that and dark’ and he wore a ‘moleskin weskit’  as if this were not enough he presently haled me from my breakfast in a prodigious flutter and showed me an honest and rather venerable citizen passing in the square  ‘that’s him sir’ he cried ‘the very moral of him  well this one is better dressed and p’r’aps a trifler taller and in the face he don’t favour him noways at all sir  no not when i come to look again ’e don’t seem to favour him noways’  ‘jackass’ said i and i think the greatest stickler for manners will admit the epithet to have been justified  meanwhile the appearance of my landlady added a great load of anxiety to what i already suffered  it was plain that she had not slept equally plain that she had wept copiously  she sighed she groaned she drew in her breath she shook her head as she waited on table  in short she seemed in so precarious a state like a petard three times charged with hysteria that i did not dare to address her and stole out of the house on tiptoe and actually ran downstairs in the fear that she might call me back  it was plain that this degree of tension could not last long  it was my first care to go to george street which i reached by good luck as a boy was taking down the bank shutters  a man was conversing with him he had white stockings and a moleskin waistcoat and was as illlooking a rogue as you would want to see in a day’s journey  this seemed to agree fairly well with rowley’s signalement he had declared emphatically if you remember and had stuck to it besides that the companion of the great lavender was no beauty  thence i made my way to mr robbie’s where i rang the bell  a servant answered the summons and told me the lawyer was engaged as i had half expected  ‘wha shall i say was callin’’ she pursued and when i had told her ‘mr ducie’ ‘i think this’ll be for you then’ she added and handed me a letter from the hall table  it ran      ‘dear mr ducie      ‘my single advice to you is to leave quam primum for the south                                                          yours t robbie’  that was short and sweet  it emphatically extinguished hope in one direction  no more was to be gotten of robbie and i wondered from my heart how much had been told him  not too much i hoped for i liked the lawyer who had thus deserted me and i placed a certain reliance in the discretion of chevenix  he would not be merciful on the other hand i did not think he would be cruel without cause  it was my next affair to go back along george street and assure myself whether the man in the moleskin vest was still on guard  there was no sign of him on the pavement  spying the door of a common stair nearly opposite the bank i took it in my head that this would be a good point of observation crossed the street entered with a businesslike air and fell immediately against the man in the moleskin vest  i stopped and apologised to him he replied in an unmistakable english accent thus putting the matter almost beyond doubt  after this encounter i must of course ascend to the top story ring the bell of a suite of apartments inquire for mr vavasour learn with no great surprise that he did not live there come down again and again politely saluting the man from bow street make my escape at last into the street  i was now driven back upon the assembly ball  robbie had failed me  the bank was watched it would never do to risk rowley in that neighbourhood all i could do was to wait until the morrow evening and present myself at the assembly let it end as it might  but i must say i came to this decision with a good deal of genuine fright and here i came for the first time to one of those places where my courage stuck  i do not mean that my courage boggled and made a bit of a bother over it as it did over the escape from the castle i mean stuck like a stopped watch or a dead man  certainly i would go to the ball certainly i must see this morning about my clothes  that was all decided  but the most of the shops were on the other side of the valley in the old town and it was now my strange discovery that i was physically unable to cross the north bridge  it was as though a precipice had stood between us or the deep sea had intervened  nearer to the castle my legs refused to bear me  i told myself this was mere superstition i made wagers with myself—and gained them i went down on the esplanade of princes street walked and stood there alone and conspicuous looking across the garden at the old grey bastions of the fortress where all these troubles had begun  i cocked my hat set my hand on my hip and swaggered on the pavement confronting detection  and i found i could do all this with a sense of exhilaration that was not unpleasing and with a certain crânerie of manner that raised me in my own esteem  and yet there was one thing i could not bring my mind to face up to or my limbs to execute and that was to cross the valley into the old town  it seemed to me i must be arrested immediately if i had done so i must go straight into the twilight of a prison cell and pass straight thence to the gross and final embraces of the nightcap and the halter  and yet it was from no reasoned fear of the consequences that i could not go  i was unable  my horse baulked and there was an end  my nerve was gone here was a discovery for a man in such imminent peril set down to so desperate a game which i could only hope to win by continual luck and unflagging effrontery  the strain had been too long continued and my nerve was gone  i fell into what they call panic fear as i have seen soldiers do on the alarm of a night attack and turned out of princes street at random as though the devil were at my heels  in st andrew square i remember vaguely hearing some one call out  i paid no heed but pressed on blindly  a moment after a hand fell heavily on my shoulder and i thought i had fainted  certainly the world went black about me for some seconds and when that spasm passed i found myself standing face to face with the ‘cheerful extravagant’ in what sort of disarray i really dare not imagine dead white at least shaking like an aspen and mowing at the man with speechless lips  and this was the soldier of napoleon and the gentleman who intended going next night to an assembly ball  i am the more particular in telling of my breakdown because it was my only experience of the sort and it is a good tale for officers  i will allow no man to call me coward i have made my proofs few men more  and yet i come of the best blood in france and inured to danger from a child did for some ten or twenty minutes make this hideous exhibition of myself on the streets of the new town of edinburgh  with my first available breath i begged his pardon  i was of an extremely nervous disposition recently increased by late hours i could not bear the slightest start  he seemed much concerned  ‘you must be in a devil of a state’ said he ‘though of course it was my fault—damnably silly vulgar sort of thing to do  a thousand apologies  but you really must be run down you should consult a medico  my dear sir a hair of the dog that bit you is clearly indicated  a touch of blue ruin now  or come it’s early but is man the slave of hours what do you say to a chop and a bottle in dumbreck’s hotel’  i refused all false comfort but when he went on to remind me that this was the day when the university of cramond met and to propose a fivemile walk into the country and a dinner in the company of young asses like himself i began to think otherwise  i had to wait until tomorrow evening at any rate this might serve as well as anything else to bridge the dreary hours  the country was the very place for me and walking is an excellent sedative for the nerves  remembering poor rowley feigning a cold in our lodgings and immediately under the guns of the formidable and now doubtful bethiah i asked if i might bring my servant  ‘poor devil it is dull for him’ i explained  ‘the merciful man is merciful to his ass’ observed my sententious friend  ‘bring him by all means      “the harp his sole remaining joy     was carried by an orphan boy”  and i have no doubt the orphan boy can get some cold victuals in the kitchen while the senatus dines’  accordingly being now quite recovered from my unmanly condition except that nothing could yet induce me to cross the north bridge i arranged for my ball dress at a shop in leith street where i was not served ill cut out rowley from his seclusion and was ready along with him at the trystingplace the corner of duke street and york place by a little after two  the university was represented in force eleven persons including ourselves byfield the aeronaut and the tall lad forbes whom i had met on the sunday morning bedewed with tallow at the ‘hunters’ rest’  i was introduced and we set off by way of newhaven and the sea beach at first through pleasant country roads and afterwards along a succession of bays of a fairylike prettiness to our destination—cramond on the almond—a little hamlet on a little river embowered in woods and looking forth over a great flat of quicksand to where a little islet stood planted in the sea  it was miniature scenery but charming of its kind  the air of this good february afternoon was bracing but not cold all the way my companions were skylarking jesting and making puns and i felt as if a load had been taken off my lungs and spirits and skylarked with the best of them  byfield i observed because i had heard of him before and seen his advertisements not at all because i was disposed to feel interest in the man  he was dark and bilious and very silent frigid in his manners but burning internally with a great fire of excitement and he was so good as to bestow a good deal of his company and conversation such as it was upon myself who was not in the least grateful  if i had known how i was to be connected with him in the immediate future i might have taken more pains  in the hamlet of cramond there is a hostelry of no very promising appearance and here a room had been prepared for us and we sat down to table  ‘here you will find no guttling or gormandising no turtle or nightingales’ tongues’ said the extravagant whose name by the way was dalmahoy  ‘the device sir of the university of cramond is plain living and high drinking’  grace was said by the professor of divinity in a macaronic latin which i could by no means follow only i could hear it rhymed and i guessed it to be more witty than reverent  after which the senatus academicus sat down to rough plenty in the shape of rizzar’d haddocks and mustard a sheep’s head a haggis and other delicacies of scotland  the dinner was washed down with brown stout in bottle and as soon as the cloth was removed glasses boiling water sugar and whisky were set out for the manufacture of toddy  i played a good knife and fork did not shun the bowl and took part so far as i was able in the continual fire of pleasantry with which the meal was seasoned  greatly daring i ventured before all these scotsmen to tell sim’s tale of tweedie’s dog and i was held to have done such extraordinary justice to the dialect ‘for a southron’ that i was immediately voted into the chair of scots and became from that moment a full member of the university of cramond  a little after i found myself entertaining them with a song and a little after—perhaps a little in consequence—it occurred to me that i had had enough and would be very well inspired to take french leave  it was not difficult to manage for it was nobody’s business to observe my movements and conviviality had banished suspicion  i got easily forth of the chamber which reverberated with the voices of these merry and learned gentlemen and breathed a long breath  i had passed an agreeable afternoon and evening and i had apparently escaped scot free  alas when i looked into the kitchen there was my monkey drunk as a lord toppling on the edge of the dresser and performing on the flageolet to an audience of the house lasses and some neighbouring ploughmen  i routed him promptly from his perch stuck his hat on put his instrument in his pocket and set off with him for edinburgh  his limbs were of paper his mind quite in abeyance i must uphold and guide him prevent his frantic dives and set him continually on his legs again  at first he sang wildly with occasional outbursts of causeless laughter  gradually an inarticulate melancholy succeeded he wept gently at times would stop in the middle of the road say firmly ‘no no no’ and then fall on his back or else address me solemnly as ‘m’lord’ and fall on his face by way of variety  i am afraid i was not always so gentle with the little pig as i might have been but really the position was unbearable  we made no headway at all and i suppose we were scarce gotten a mile away from cramond when the whole senatus academicus was heard hailing and doubling the pace to overtake its  some of them were fairly presentable and they were all christian martyrs compared to rowley but they were in a frolicsome and rollicking humour that promised danger as we approached the town  they sang songs they ran races they fenced with their walkingsticks and umbrellas and in spite of this violent exercise the fun grew only the more extravagant with the miles they traversed  their drunkenness was deepseated and permanent like fire in a peat or rather—to be quite just to them—it was not so much to be called drunkenness at all as the effect of youth and high spirits—a fine night and the night young a good road under foot and the world before you  i had left them once somewhat unceremoniously i could not attempt it a second time and burthened as i was with mr rowley i was really glad of assistance  but i saw the lamps of edinburgh draw near on their hilltop with a good deal of uneasiness which increased after we had entered the lighted streets to positive alarm  all the passersby were addressed some of them by name  a worthy man was stopped by forbes ‘sir’ said he ‘in the name of the senatus of the university of cramond i confer upon you the degree of lld’ and with the words he bonneted him  conceive the predicament of st ives committed to the society of these outrageous youths in a town where the police and his cousin were both looking for him  so far we had pursued our way unmolested although raising a clamour fit to wake the dead but at last in abercromby place i believe—at least it was a crescent of highly respectable houses fronting on a garden—byfield and i having fallen somewhat in the rear with rowley came to a simultaneous halt  our ruffians were beginning to wrench off bells and doorplates  ‘oh i say’ says byfield ‘this is too much of a good thing  confound it i’m a respectable man—a public character by george  i can’t afford to get taken up by the police’  ‘my own case exactly’ said i  ‘here let’s bilk them’ said he  and we turned back and took our way down hill again  it was none too soon voices and alarm bells sounded watchmen here and there began to spring their rattles it was plain the university of cramond would soon be at blows with the police of edinburgh  byfield and i running the semiinanimate rowley before us made good despatch and did not stop till we were several streets away and the hubbub was already softened by distance  ‘well sir’ said he ‘we are well out of that  did ever any one see such a pack of young barbarians’  ‘we are properly punished mr byfield we had no business there’ i replied  ‘no indeed sir you may well say that  outrageous  and my ascension announced for friday you know’ cried the aeronaut  ‘a pretty scandal byfield the aeronaut at the policecourt  tuttut  will you be able to get your rascal home sir  allow me to offer you my card  i am staying at walker and poole’s hotel sir where i should be pleased to see you’  ‘the pleasure would be mutual sir’ said i but i must say my heart was not in my words and as i watched mr byfield departing i desired nothing less than to pursue the acquaintance  one more ordeal remained for me to pass  i carried my senseless load upstairs to our lodging and was admitted by the landlady in a tall white nightcap and with an expression singularly grim  she lighted us into the sittingroom where when i had seated rowley in a chair she dropped me a castiron courtesy  i smelt gunpowder on the woman  her voice tottered with emotion  ‘i give ye nottice mr ducie’ said she  ‘dacent folks’ houses   ’  and at that apparently temper cut off her utterance and she took herself off without more words  i looked about me at the room the goggling rowley the extinguished fire my mind reviewed the laughable incidents of the day and night and i laughed out loud to myself—lonely and cheerless laughter
