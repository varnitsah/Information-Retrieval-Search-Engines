59485277	ixion in heaven  by benjamin disraeli          advertisement       ixion king of thessaly famous for its horses married      dia daughter of deioneus who in consequence of his son      inlaws nonfulfilment of his engagements stole away some      of the monarchs steeds ixion concealed his resentment      under the mask of friendship he invited his fatherinlaw      to a feast at larissa the capital of his kingdom and when      deioneus arrived according to his appointment he threw him      into a pit which he had previously filled with burning      coals this treachery so irritated the neighbouring princes      that all of them refused to perform the usual ceremony by      which a man was then purified of murder and ixion was      shunned and despised by all mankind jupiter had compassion      upon him carried him to heaven and introduced him to the      father of the gods such a favour which ought to have      awakened gratitude in ixion only served to inflame his bad      passions he became enamoured of juno and attempted to      seduce her juno was willing to gratify the passion of      ixion though according to others cclassical      dictionary art ixion     ixion in heaven     part i       an errant king  the thunder groaned the wind howled the rain fell in hissing torrents impenetrable darkness covered the earth a blue and forky flash darted a momentary light over the landscape a doric temple rose in the centre of a small and verdant plain surrounded on all sides by green and hanging woods  jove is my only friend exclaimed a wanderer as he muffled himself up in his mantle and were it not for the porch of his temple this night methinks would complete the work of my loving wife and my dutiful subjects  the thunder died away the wind sank into silence the rain ceased and the parting clouds exhibited the glittering crescent of the young moon a sonorous and majestic voice sounded from the skies  who art thou that hast no other friend than jove one whom all mankind unite in calling a wretch art thou a philosopher  if philosophy be endurance but for the rest i was sometime a king and am now a scatterling how do they call thee ixion of thessaly  ixion of thessaly i thought he was a happy man i heard that he was just married  father of gods and men for i deem thee such thessaly is not olympus conjugal felicity is only the portion of the immortals  hem what was dia jealous which is common or false which is commoner or both which is commonest  it may be neither we quarrelled about nothing where there is little sympathy or too much the splitting of a straw is plot enough for a domestic tragedy i was careless her friends stigmatised me as callous she cold her friends styled her magnanimous public opinion was all on her side merely because i did not choose that the world should interfere between me and my wife dia took the worlds advice upon every point and the world decided that she always acted rightly however life is life either in a palace or a cave i am glad you ordered it to leave off thundering  a cool dog this and dia left thee no i left her what craven  not exactly the truth istis a long story  i was over head and ears in debt  ah that accounts for everything nothing so harassing as a want of money but what lucky fellows you mortals are with your postobits we immortals are deprived of this resource i was obliged to get up a rebellion against my father because he kept me so short and could not die  you could have married for money i did i had no opportunity there was so little female society in those days when i came out there were no heiresses except the parcae confirmed old maids and no very rich dowager except my grandmother old terra  just the thing the older the better however i married dia the daughter of deioneus with a prodigious portion but after the ceremony the old gentleman would not fulfil his part of the contract without my giving up my stud can you conceive anything more unreasonable i smothered my resentment at the time for the truth is my tradesmen all renewed my credit on the strength of the match and so we went on very well for a year but at last they began to smell a rat and grew importunate i entreated dia to interfere but she was a paragon of daughters and always took the side of her father if she had only been dutiful to her husband she would have been a perfect woman at last i invited deioneus to the larissa races with the intention of conciliating him the unprincipled old man bought the horse that i had backed and by which i intended to have redeemed my fortunes and withdrew it my book was ruined i dissembled my rage i dug a pit in our garden and filled it with burning coals as my fatherinlaw and myself were taking a stroll after dinner the worthy deioneus fell in merely by accident dia proclaimed me the murderer of her father and as a satisfaction to her wounded feelings earnestly requested her subjects to decapitate her husband she certainly was the best of daughters there was no withstanding public opinion an infuriated rabble and a magnanimous wife at the same time they surrounded my palace i cut my way through the greasycapped multitude sword in hand and gained a neighbouring court where i solicited my brother princes to purify me from the supposed murder if i had only murdered a subject they would have supported me against the people but deioneus being a crowned head like themselves they declared they would not countenance so immoral a being as his soninlaw and so at length after much wandering and shunned by all my species i am here jove in much higher society than i ever expected to mingle  well thou art a frank dog and in a sufficiently severe scrape the gods must have pity on those for whom men have none it is evident that earth is too hot for thee at present so i think thou hadst better come and stay a few weeks with us in heaven take my thanks for hecatombs great jove thou art indeed a god  i hardly know whether our life will suit you we dine at sunset for apollo is so much engaged that he cannot join us sooner and no dinner goes off well without him in the morning you are your own master and must find amusement where you can diana will show you some tolerable sport do you shoot  no arrow surer fear not for me Ægiochus i am always at home but how am i to get to you i will send mercury he is the best travelling companion in the world what ho my eagle  the clouds joined and darkness again fell over the earth  so tread softly dont be nervous are you sick  a little nausea tis nothing  the novelty of the motion the best thing is a beefsteak we will stop at taurus and take one  you have been a great traveller mercury  i have seen the world  ah a wondrous spectacle i long to travel  the same thing over and over again little novelty and much change i am wearied with exertion and if i could get a pension would retire  and yet travel brings wisdom  it cures us of care seeing much we feel little and learn how very petty are all those great affairs which cost us such anxiety  i feel that already myself floating in this blue aether what the devil is my wife to me and her dirty earth my persecuting enemies seem so many pismires and as for my debts which have occasioned me so many brooding moments honour and infamy credit and beggary seem to me alike ridiculous  your mind is opening ixion you will soon be a man of the world to the left and keep clear of that star  who lives there  the fates know not i some low people who are trying to shine into notice tis a parvenu planet and only sprung into space within this century we do not visit them  poor devils i feel hungry  all right we shall get into heaven by the first dinner bolt you cannot arrive at a strange house at a better moment we shall just have time to dress i would not spoil my appetite by luncheon jupiter keeps a capital cook  i have heard of nectar and ambrosia poh nobody touches them they are regular oldfashioned celestial food and merely put upon the sidetable nothing goes down in heaven now but infernal cookery we took our chef from proserpine  were you ever in hell  several times tis the fashion now among the olympians to pass the winter there is this the season in heaven yes you are lucky olympus is quite full it was kind of jupiter to invite me ay he has his good points and no doubt he has taken a liking to you which is all very well but be upon your guard he has no heart and is as capricious as he is tyrannical  gods cannot be more unkind to me than men have been  all those who have suffered think they have seen the worst a great mistake however you are now in the high road to preferment so we will not be dull there are some good fellows enough amongst us you will like old neptune is he there now  yes he generally passes his summer with us there is little stirring in the ocean at that season i am anxious to see mars  oh a brute more a bully than a hero not at all in the best set these mustachioed gentry are by no means the rage at present in olympus the women are all literary now and minerva has quite eclipsed venus apollo is our hero you must read his last work  i hate reading  so do i i have no time and seldom do anything in that way but glance at a newspaper study and action will not combine  i suppose i shall find the goddesses very proud  you will find them as you find women below of different dispositions with the same object venus is a flirt minerva a prude who fancies she has a correct taste and a strong mind and juno a politician as for the rest faint heart never won fair lady take a friendly hint and do not be alarmed  i fear nothing my mind mounts with my fortunes we are above the clouds they form beneath us a vast and snowy region dim and irregular as i have sometimes seen them clustering upon the horizons ridge at sunset like a raging sea stilled by some sudden supernatural frost and frozen into form how bright the air above us and how delicate its fragrant breath i scarcely breathe and yet my pulses beat like my first youth i hardly feel my being a splendour falls upon your presence you seem indeed a god am i so glorious this this is heaven  the travellers landed on a vast flight of sparkling steps of lapislazuli ascending they entered beautiful gardens winding walks that yielded to the feet and accelerated your passage by their rebounding pressure fragrant shrubs covered with dazzling flowers the fleeting tints of which changed every moment groups of tall trees with strange birds of brilliant and variegated plumage singing and reposing in their sheeny foliage and fountains of perfumes  before them rose an illimitable and golden palace with high spreading domes of pearl and long windows of crystal around the huge portal of ruby was ranged a company of winged genii who smiled on mercury as he passed them with his charge  the father of gods and men is dressing said the son of maia i shall attend his toilet and inform him of your arrival these are your rooms dinner will be ready in half an hour i will call for you as i go down you can be formally presented in the evening at that time inspired by liqueurs and his matchless band of wind instruments you will agree with the world that Ægiochus is the most finished god in existence  now ixion are you ready even so what says jove he smiled but said nothing he was trying on a new robe by this time he is seated hark the thunder come on  they entered a cupolaed hall seats of ivory and gold were ranged round a circular table of cedar inlaid with the campaigns against the titans in silver exquisitely worked a nuptial present of vulcan the service of gold plate threw all the ideas of the king of thessaly as to royal magnificence into the darkest shade the enormous plateau represented the constellations ixion viewed the father of gods and men with great interest who however did not notice him he acknowledged the majesty of that countenance whose nod shook olympus majestically robust and luxuriantly lusty his tapering waist was evidently immortal for it defied time and his splendid auburn curls parted on his forehead with celestial precision descended over cheeks glowing with the purple radiancy of perpetual manhood  the haughty juno was seated on his left hand and ceres on his right for the rest of the company there was neptune latona minerva and apollo and when mercury and ixion had taken their places one seat was still vacant  where is diana inquired jupiter with a frown  my sister is hunting said apollo  she is always too late for dinner said jupiter no habit is less goddesslike  godlike pursuits cannot be expected to induce goddesslike manners said juno with a sneer  i have no doubt diana will be here directly said latona mildly  jupiter seemed pacified and at that instant the absent guest returned  good sport di inquired neptune  very fair uncle mamma continued the sister of apollo addressing herself to juno whom she ever thus styled when she wished to conciliate her i have brought you a new peacock  juno was fond of pets and was conciliated by the present  bacchus made a great noise about this wine mercury said jupiter but i think with little cause what think you  it pleases me but i am fatigued and then all wine is agreeable  you have had a long journey replied the thunderer ixion i am glad to see you in heaven  your majesty arrived today inquired minerva to whom the king of thessaly sat next  within this hour  you must leave off talking of time now said minerva with a severe smile pray is there anything new in greece  i have not been at all in society lately  no new edition of homer i admire him exceedingly  all about greece interests me said apollo who although handsome was a somewhat melancholy lackadaisical looking personage with his shirt collar thrown open and his long curls theatrically arranged all about greece interests me i always consider greece my peculiar property my best poems were written at delphi i travelled in greece when i was young i envy mankind  indeed said ixion  yes they at least can look forward to a termination of the ennui of existence but for us celestials there is no prospect say what they like immortality is a bore  you eat nothing apollo said ceres  nor drink said neptune  to eat to drink what is it but to live and what is life but death if death be that which all men deem it a thing insufferable and to be shunned i refresh myself now only with sodawater and biscuits ganymede bring some  now although the cuisine of olympus was considered perfect the forlorn poet had unfortunately fixed upon the only two articles which were not comprised in its cellar or larder in heaven there was neither sodawater nor biscuits a great confusion consequently ensued but at length the bard whose love of fame was only equalled by his horror of getting fat consoled himself with a swan stuffed with truffles and a bottle of strong tenedos wine  what do you think of homer inquired minerva of apollo is he not delightful  if you think so  nay i am desirous of your opinion  then you should not have given me yours for your taste is too fine for me to dare to differ with it  i have suspected for some time that you are rather a heretic  why the truth is replied apollo playing with his rings i do not think much of homer homer was not esteemed in his own age and our contemporaries are generally our best judges the fact is there are very few people who are qualified to decide upon matters of taste a certain set for certain reasons resolve to cry up a certain writer and the great mass soon join in all is cant and the present admiration of homer is not less so they say i have borrowed a great deal from him the truth is i never read homer since i was a child and i thought of him then what i think of him now a writer of some wild irregular power totally deficient in taste depend upon it our contemporaries are our best judges and his contemporaries decided that homer was nothing a great poet cannot be kept down look at my case marsyas said of my first volume that it was pretty good poetry for a god and in answer i wrote a satire and flayed marsyas alive but what is poetry and what is criticism and what is life air and what is air do you know i dont all is mystery and all is gloom and ever and anon from out the clouds a star breaks forth and glitters and that star is poetry  splendid exclaimed minerva  i do not exactly understand you said neptune  have you heard from proserpine lately inquired jupiter of ceres  yesterday said the domestic mother they talk of soon joining us but pluto is at present so busy owing to the amazing quantity of wars going on now that i am almost afraid he will scarcely be able to accompany her  juno exchanged a telegraphic nod with ceres the goddesses rose and retired  come old boy said jupiter to ixion instantly throwing off all his chivalric majesty i drink your welcome in a magnum of maraschino damn your poetry apollo and mercury give us one of your good stories  well what do you think of him asked juno  he appears to have a fine mind said minerva  poh he has very fine eyes said juno  he seems a very nice quiet young gentleman said ceres  i have no doubt he is very amiable said latona  he must have felt very strange said diana  hercules arrived with his bride hebe soon after the graces dropped in the most delightful personages in the world for a soiree so useful and ready for anything afterwards came a few of the muses thalia melpomene and terpsichore famous for a charade or a proverb jupiter liked to be amused in the evening bacchus also came but finding that the gods had not yet left their wine retired to pay them a visit  ganymede announced coffee in the saloon of juno jupiter was in superb good humour he was amused by his mortal guest he had condescended to tell one of his best stories in his best style about leda not too scandalous but gay  those were bright days said neptune  we can remember said the thunderer with a twinkling eye these youths have fallen upon duller times there are no fine women now ixion i drink to the health of your wife  with all my heart and may we never be nearer than we are at present  good ifaith apollo your arm now for the ladies la la la la la la la la  the thunderer entered the saloon of juno with that bow which no god could rival all rose and the king of heaven seated himself between ceres and latona the melancholy apollo stood apart and was soon carried off by minerva to an assembly at the house of mnemosyne mercury chatted with the graces and bacchus with diana the three muses favoured the company with singing and the queen of heaven approached ixion  does your majesty dance she haughtily inquired  on earth i have few accomplishments even there and none in heaven  you have led a strange life i have heard of your adventures  a king who has lost his crown may generally gain at least experience  your courage is firm  i have felt too much to care for much yesterday i was a vagabond exposed to every pitiless storm and now i am the guest of jove while there is life there is hope and he who laughs at destiny will gain fortune i would go through the past again to enjoy the present and feel that after all i am my wifes debtor since through her conduct i can gaze upon you  no great spectacle if that be all i wish you better fortune  i desire no greater  you are moderate  i am perhaps more unreasonable than you imagine  indeed  their eyes met the dark orbs of the thessalian did not quail before the flashing vision of the goddess juno grew pale juno turned away     part ii       others say it was only a cloud       a mortal among the gods  mercury and ganymede were each lolling on an opposite couch in the antechamber of olympus  it is wonderful said the son of maia yawning it is incredible rejoined the cupbearer of jove stretching his legs  a miserable mortal exclaimed the god elevating his eyebrows  a vile thessalian said the beautiful phrygian shrugging his shoulders  not three days back an outcast among his own wretched species  and now commanding everybody in heaven he shall not command me though said mercury  will he not replied ganymede why what do you think only last night hark here he comes  the companions jumped up from their couches a light laugh was heard the cedar portal was flung open and ixion lounged in habited in a loose morning robe and kicking before him one of his slippers ah exclaimed the king of thessaly the very fellows i wanted to see ganymede bring me some nectar and mercury run and tell jove that i shall not dine at home today  the messenger and the page exchanged looks of indignant consternation  well what are you waiting for continued ixion looking round from the mirror in which he was arranging his locks the messenger and the page disappeared  so this is heaven exclaimed the husband of dia flinging himself upon one of the couches and a very pleasant place too these worthy immortals required their minds to be opened and i trust i have effectually performed the necessary operation they wanted to keep me down with their dull oldfashioned celestial airs but i fancy i have given them change for their talent to make your way in heaven you must command these exclusives sink under the audacious invention of an aspiring mind jove himself is really a fine old fellow with some notions too i am a prime favourite and no one is greater authority with Ægiochus on all subjects from the character of the fair sex or the pedigree of a courser down to the cut of a robe or the flavour of a dish thanks ganymede continued the thessalian as he took the goblet from his returning attendant  i drink to your bonnes fortunes splendid this nectar makes me feel quite immortal bythebye i hear sweet sounds who is in the hall of music  the goddesses royal sir practise a new air of euterpe the words by apollo tis pretty and will doubtless be very popular for it is all about moonlight and the misery of existence  i warrant it  you have a taste for poetry yourself inquired ganymede  not the least replied ixion  apollo continued the heavenly page is a great genius though marsyas said that he never would be a poet because he was a god and had no heart but do you think sir that a poet does indeed need a heart  i really cannot say i know my wife always said i had a bad heart and worse head but what she meant upon my honour i never could understand  minerva will ask you to write in her album  will she indeed i am sorry to hear it for i can scarcely scrawl my signature i should think that jove himself cared little for all this nonsense  jove loves an epigram he does not esteem apollos works at all jove is of the classical school and admires satire provided there be no allusions to gods and kings  of course i quite agree with him i remember we had a confounded poet at larissa who proved my family lived before the deluge and asked me for a pension i refused him and then he wrote an epigram asserting that i sprang from the veritable stones thrown by deucalion and pyrrha at the repeopling of the earth and retained all the properties of my ancestors  ha ha hark theres a thunderbolt i must run to jove  and i will look in on the musicians this way i think  up the ruby staircase turn to your right down the amethyst gallery farewell  goodbye a lively lad that  the king of thessaly entered the hall of music with its golden walls and crystal dome the queen of heaven was reclining in an easy chair cutting out peacocks in small sheets of note paper minerva was making a pencil observation on a manuscript copy of the song apollo listened with deference to her laudatory criticisms another divine dame standing by the side of euterpe who was seated by the harp looked up as ixion entered the wild liquid glance of her soft but radiant countenance denoted the famed goddess of beauty  juno just acknowledged the entrance of ixion by a slight and haughty inclination of the head and then resumed her employment minerva asked him his opinion of her amendment of which he greatly approved apollo greeted him with a melancholy smile and congratulated him on being mortal venus complimented him on his visit to olympus and expressed the pleasure that she experienced in making his acquaintance  what do you think of heaven inquired venus in a soft still voice and with a smile like summer lightning  i never found it so enchanting as at this moment replied ixion  a little dull for myself i pass my time chiefly at cnidos you must come and visit me there tis the most charming place in the world tis said you know that our onions are like other peoples roses we will take care of you if your wife come  no fear of that she always remains at home and piques herself on her domestic virtues which means pickling and quarrelling with her husband  ah i see you are a droll very good indeed well for my part i like a wateringplace existence cnidos paphos cythera you will usually find me at one of these places i like the easy distraction of a career without any visible result at these fascinating spots your gloomy race to whom bythebye i am exceedingly partial appear emancipated from the wearing fetters of their regular dull orderly methodical moral political toiling existence i pride myself upon being the goddess of wateringplaces you really must pay me a visit at cnidos  such an invitation requires no repetition and cnidos is your favourite spot  why it was so but of late it has become so inundated with invalid asiatics and valetudinarian persians that the simultaneous influx of the handsome heroes who swarm in from the islands to look after their daughters scarcely compensates for the annoying presence of their yellow faces and shaking limbs no i think on the whole paphos is my favourite  i have heard of its magnificent luxury  oh tis lovely quite my idea of country life not a single tree when cyprus is very hot you run to paphos for a seabreeze and are sure to meet every one whose presence is in the least desirable all the bores remain behind as if by instinct  i remember when we married we talked of passing the honeymoon at cythera but dia would have her waitingmaid and a bandbox stuffed between us in the chariot so i got sulky after the first stage and returned by myself  you were quite right i hate bandboxes they are always in the way you would have liked cythera if you had been in the least in love high rocks and green knolls bowery woods winding walks and delicious sunsets i have not been there much of late continued the goddess looking somewhat sad and serious sincebut i will not talk sentiment to ixion  do you think then i am insensible  yes  perhaps you are right we mortals grow callous  so i have heard how very odd so saying the goddess glided away and saluted mars who at that moment entered the hall ixion was presented to the military hero who looked fierce and bowed stiffly the king of thessaly turned upon his heel minerva opened her album and invited him to inscribe a stanza  goddess of wisdom replied the king unless you inspire me the virgin page must remain pure as thyself i can scarcely sign a decree  is it ixion of thessaly who says this one who has seen so much and if i am not mistaken has felt and thought so much i can easily conceive why such a mind may desire to veil its movements from the common herd but pray concede to minerva the gratifying compliment of assuring her that she is the exception for whom this rule has been established  i seem to listen to the inspired music of an oracle give me a pen  here is one plucked from a sacred owl so i write there will it do minerva read the inscription       i have seen the world and more than the world      i have studied the heart of man      and now i consort with immortals      the fruit of my tree of   knowledge   is   plucked       and  it  is  this      adventures are to the adventurous      written in the album of minerva by      ixion in heaven  tis brief said the goddess with a musing air but full of meaning you have a daring soul and pregnant mind  i have dared much what i may produce we have yet to see  i must to jove said minerva to council we shall meet again farewell ixion  farewell glaucopis  the king of thessaly stood away from the remaining guests and leant with folded arms and pensive brow against a wreathed column mars listened to venus with an air of deep devotion euterpe played an inspiring accompaniment to their conversation the queen of heaven seemed engrossed in the creation of her paper peacocks  ixion advanced and seated himself on a couch near juno his manner was divested of that reckless bearing and careless coolness by which it was in general distinguished he was perhaps even a little embarrassed his ready tongue deserted him at length he spoke  has your majesty ever heard of the peacock of the queen of mesopotamia  no replied juno with stately reserve and then she added with an air of indifferent curiosity is it in any way remarkable  its breast is of silver its wings of gold its eyes of carbuncle its claws of amethyst  and its tail eagerly inquired juno  that is a secret replied ixion the tail is the most wonderful part of all  oh tell me pray tell me  i forget  no no no it is impossible exclaimed the animated juno provoking mortal continued the goddess let me entreat you tell me immediately  there is a reason which prevents me  what can it be how very odd what reason can it possibly be now tell me as a particular a personal favour i request you do tell me  what the tail or the reason the tail is wonderful but the reason is much more so i can only tell one now choose  what provoking things these human beings are the tail is wonderful but the reason is much more so well then the reason no the tail stop now as a particular favour pray tell me both what can the tail be made of and what can the reason be i am literally dying of curiosity  your majesty has cut out that peacock wrong remarked ixion it is more like one of minervas owls  who cares about paper peacocks when the queen of mesopotamia has got such a miracle exclaimed juno and she tore the labours of the morning to pieces and threw away the fragments with vexation now tell me instantly if you have the slightest regard for me tell me instantly what was the tail made of  and you do not wish to hear the reason  that afterwards now i am all ears at this moment ganymede entered and whispered the goddess who rose in evident vexation and retired to the presence of jove  the king of thessaly quitted the hall of music moody yet not uninfluenced by a degree of wild excitement he wandered forth into the gardens of olympus he came to a beautiful green retreat surrounded by enormous cedars so vast that it seemed they must have been coeval with the creation so fresh and brilliant you would have deemed them wet with the dew of their first spring the turf softer than down and exhaling as you pressed it an exquisite perfume invited him to recline himself upon this natural couch he threw himself upon the aromatic herbage and leaning on his arm fell into a deep reverie  hours flew away the sunshiny glades that opened in the distance had softened into shade  ixion how do you do inquired a voice wild sweet and thrilling as a bird the king of thessaly started and looked up with the distracted air of a man roused from a dream or from complacent meditation over some strange sweet secret his cheek was flushed his dark eyes flashed fire his brow trembled his dishevelled hair played in the fitful breeze the king of thessaly looked up and beheld a most beautiful youth  apparently he had attained about the age of puberty his stature however was rather tall for his age but exquisitely moulded and proportioned very fair his somewhat round cheeks were tinted with a rich but delicate glow like the rose of twilight and lighted by dimples that twinkled like stars his large and deepblue eyes sparkled with exultation and an air of illsuppressed mockery quivered round his pouting lips his light auburn hair braided off his white forehead clustered in massy curls on each side of his face and fell in sunny torrents down his neck and from the back of the beautiful youth there fluttered forth two wings the tremulous plumage of which seemed to have been bathed in a sunset so various so radiant and so novel were its shifting and wondrous tints purple and crimson and gold streaks of azure dashes of orange and glossy black now a single feather whiter than light and sparkling like the frost stars of emerald and carbuncle and then the prismatic blaze of an enormous brilliant a quiver hung at the side of the beautiful youth and he leant upon a bow  oh god for god thou must be at length exclaimed ixion do i behold the bright divinity of love  i am indeed cupid replied the youth and am curious to know what ixion is thinking about thought is often bolder than speech oracular though a mortal you need not be afraid to trust me my aid i am sure you must need who ever was found in a reverie on the green turf under the shade of spreading trees without requiring the assistance of cupid come be frank who is the heroine some lovesick nymph deserted on the far earth or worse some treacherous mistress whose frailty is more easily forgotten than her charms tis a miserable situation no doubt it cannot be your wife  assuredly not replied ixion with energy  another mans  no  what an obdurate maiden  ixion shook his head  it must be a widow then continued cupid who ever heard before of such a piece of work about a widow  have pity upon me dread cupid exclaimed the king of thessaly rising suddenly from the ground and falling on his knee before the god thou art the universal friend of man and all nations alike throw their incense on thy altars thy divine discrimination has not deceived thee i am in love desperately madly fatally enamoured the object of my passion is neither my own wife nor another mans in spite of all they have said and sworn i am a moral member of society she is neither a maid nor a widow she is  what what exclaimed the impatient deity  a goddess replied the king  wheugh whistled cupid what has my mischievous mother been indulging you with an innocent flirtation  yes but it produced no effect upon me  you have a stout heart then perhaps you have been reading poetry with minerva and are caught in one of her platonic mantraps  she set one but i broke away  you have a stout leg then but where are you where are you is it hebe it can hardly be diana she is so cold is it a muse or is it one of the graces  ixion again shook his head  come my dear fellow said cupid quite in a confidential tone you have told enough to make further reserve mere affectation ease your heart at once and if i can assist you depend upon my exertions  beneficent god exclaimed ixion if i ever return to larissa the brightest temple in greece shall hail thee for its inspiring deity i address thee with all the confiding frankness of a devoted votary know then the heroine of my reverie was no less a personage than the queen of heaven herself  juno by all that is sacred shouted cupid i am here responded a voice of majestic melody the stately form of the queen of heaven advanced from a neighbouring bower ixion stood with his eyes fixed upon the ground with a throbbing heart and burning cheeks juno stood motionless pale and astounded the god of love burst into excessive laughter  illustration page28  a pretty pair he exclaimed fluttering between both and laughing in their faces truly a pretty pair well i see i am in your way goodbye and so saying the god pulled a couple of arrows from his quiver and with the rapidity of lightning shot one in the respective breasts of the queen of heaven and the king of thessaly  the amethystine twilight of olympus died away the stars blazed with tints of every hue ixion and juno returned to the palace she leant upon his arm her eyes were fixed upon the ground they were in sight of the gorgeous pile and yet she had not spoken ixion too was silent and gazed with abstraction upon the glowing sky  suddenly when within a hundred yards of the portal juno stopped and looking up into the face of ixion with an irresistible smile she said i am sure you cannot now refuse to tell me what the queen of mesopotamias peacocks tail was made of  it is impossible now said ixion know then beautiful goddess that the tail of the queen of mesopotamias peacock was made of some plumage she had stolen from the wings of cupid  and what was the reason that prevented you from telling me before  because beautiful juno i am the most discreet of men and respect the secret of a lady however trifling  i am glad to hear that replied juno and they reentered the palace  mercury met juno and ixion in the gallery leading to the grand banqueting hall  i was looking for you said the god shaking his head jove is in a sublime rage dinner has been ready this hour  the king of thessaly and the queen of heaven exchanged a glance and entered the saloon jove looked up with a brow of thunder but did not condescend to send forth a single flash of anger jove looked up and jove looked down all olympus trembled as the father of gods and men resumed his soup the rest of the guests seemed nervous and reserved except cupid who said immediately to juno your majesty has been detained  i fell asleep in a bower reading apollos last poem replied juno i am lucky however in finding a companion in my negligence ixion where have you been  take a glass of nectar juno said cupid with eyes twinkling with mischief and perhaps ixion will join us  this was the most solemn banquet ever celebrated in olympus everyone seemed out of humour or out of spirits jupiter spoke only in monosyllables of suppressed rage that sounded like distant thunder apollo whispered to minerva mercury never opened his lips but occasionally exchanged significant glances with ganymede mars compensated by his attentions to venus for his want of conversation cupid employed himself in asking disagreeable questions at length the goddesses retired mercury exerted himself to amuse jove but the thunderer scarcely deigned to smile at his best stories mars picked his teeth apollo played with his rings ixion was buried in a profound reverie  it was a great relief to all when ganymede summoned them to the presence of their late companions  i have written a comment upon your inscription said minerva to ixion and am anxious for your opinion of it  i am a wretched critic said the king breaking away from her juno smiled upon him in the distance  ixion said venus as he passed by come and talk to me  the bold thessalian blushed he stammered out an unmeaning excuse he quitted the astonished but goodnatured goddess and seated himself by juno and as he seated himself his moody brow seemed suddenly illumined with brilliant light  is it so said venus  hem said minerva  ha ha said cupid  jupiter played piquette with mercury  everything goes wrong today said the king of heaven cards wretched and kept waiting for dinner and bya mortal  your majesty must not be surprised said the goodnatured mercury with whom ixion was no favourite your majesty must not be very much surprised at the conduct of this creature considering what he is and where he is i am only astonished that his head is not more turned than it appears to be a man a thing made of mud and in heaven only think sire is it not enough to inflame the brain of any child of clay to be sure keeping your majesty from dinner is little short of celestial high treason i hardly expected that indeed to order me about to treat ganymede as his own lacquey and in short to command the whole household all this might be expected from such a person in such a situation but i confess i did think he had some little respect left for your majesty  and he does order you about eh inquired jove i have the spades  oh tis quite ludicrous responded the son of maia your majesty would not expect from me the offices that this upstart daily requires  eternal destiny ist possible that is my trick and ganymede too  oh quite shocking i assure you sire said the beautiful cupbearer leaning over the chair of jove with all the easy insolence of a privileged favourite really sire if ixion is to go on in the way he does either he or i must quit  is it possible exclaimed jupiter but i can believe anything of a man who keeps me waiting for dinner two and three make five  it is juno that encourages him so said ganymede  does she encourage him inquired jove  everybody notices it protested ganymede  it is indeed a little noticed observed mercury  what business has such a fellow to speak to juno exclaimed jove a mere mortal a mere miserable mortal you have the point how i have been deceived in this fellow who ever could have supposed that after all my generosity to him he would ever have kept me waiting for dinner  he was walking with juno said ganymede it was all a sham about their having met by accident cupid saw them  ha said jupiter turning pale you dont say so repiqued as i am a god that is mine where is the queen  talking to ixion sire said mercury oh i beg your pardon sire i did not know you meant the queen of diamonds  never mind i am repiqued and i have been kept waiting for dinner accursed be this day is ixion really talking to juno we will not endure this  where is juno demanded jupiter  i am sure i cannot say said venust with a smile  i am sure i do not know said minerva with a sneer  where is ixion said cupid laughing outright  mercury ganymede find the queen of heaven instantly thundered the father of gods and men  the celestial messenger and the heavenly page flew away out of different doors there was a terrible an immortal silence sublime rage lowered on the brow of jove like a storm upon the mountaintop minerva seated herself at the cardtable and played at patience venus and cupid tittered in the background shortly returned the envoys mercury looking solemn ganymede malignant  well inquired jove and all olympus trembled at the monosyllable  mercury shook his head  her majesty has been walking on the terrace with the king of thessaly replied ganymede  where is she now sir demanded jupiter  mercury shrugged his shoulders  her majesty is resting herself in the pavilion of cupid with the king of thessaly replied ganymede  confusion exclaimed the father of gods and men and he rose and seized a candle from the table scattering the cards in all directions every one present minerva and venus and mars and apollo and mercury and ganymede and the muses and the graces and all the winged geniieach seized a candle rifling the chandeliers each followed jove  this way said mercury  this way said ganymede  this way this way echoed the celestial crowd  mischief cried cupid i must save my victims  they were all upon the terrace the father of gods and men though both in a passion and a hurry moved with dignity it was as customary in heaven a clear and starry night but this eve diana was indisposed or otherwise engaged and there was no moonlight they were in sight of the pavilion  what are you inquired cupid of one of the genii who accidentally extinguished his candle  i am a cloud answered the winged genius  a cloud just the thing now do me a shrewd turn and cupid is ever your debtor fly fly pretty cloud and encompass yon pavilion with your form away ask no questions swift as my word  i declare there is a fog said venus  an evening mist in heaven said minerva  where is nox said jove everything goes wrong who ever heard of a mist in heaven  my candle is out said apollo  and mine too said mars  and mine and mine and mine said mercury and ganymede and the muses and the graces  all the candles are out said cupid a regular fog i cannot even see the pavilion it must be hereabouts though said the god to himself so so i should be at home in my own pavilion and am tolerably accustomed to stealing about in the dark there is a step and here surely is the lock the door opens but the cloud enters before me juno juno whispered the god of love we are all here be contented to escape like many other innocent dames with your reputation only under a cloud it will soon disperse and lo the heaven is clearing  it must have been the heat of our flambeaux said venus for see the mist is vanished here is the pavilion  ganymede ran forward and dashed open the door ixion was alone  seize him said jove  juno is not here said mercury with an air of blended congratulation and disappointment  never mind said jove seize him he kept me waiting for dinner  is this your hospitality Ægiochus exclaimed ixion in a tone of bullying innocence i shall defend myself  seize him seize him exclaimed jupiter what do you all falter are you afraid of a mortal  and a thessalian added ganymede  no one advanced  send for hercules said jove  i will fetch him in an instant said ganymede  i protest said the king of thessaly against this violation of the most sacred rights  the marriage tie said mercury  the dinnerhour said jove  it is no use talking sentiment to ixion said venus all mortals are callous  adventures are to the adventurous said minerva  here is hercules here is hercules  seize him said jove seize that man  in vain the mortal struggled with the irresistible demigod  shall i fetch your thunderbolt jove inquired ganymede  anything short of eternal punishment is unworthy of a god answered jupiter with great dignity apollo bring me a wheel of your chariot  what shall i do tomorrow morning inquired the god of light  order an eclipse replied jove bind the insolent wretch to the wheel hurl him to hades its motion shall be perpetual  what am i to bind him with inquired hercules  the girdle of venus replied the thunderer  what is all this inquired juno advancing pale and agitated  come along you shall see answered jupiter follow me follow me  they all followed the leader all the gods all the genii in the midst the brawny husband of hebe bearing ixion aloft bound to the fatal wheel they reached the terrace they descended the sparkling steps of lapislazuli hercules held his burthen on high ready at a nod to plunge the hapless but presumptuous mortal through space into hades the heavenly group surrounded him and peeped over the starry abyss it was a fine moral and demonstrated the usual infelicity that attends unequal connection  celestial despot said ixion  in a moment all sounds were hushed as they listened to the last words of the unrivalled victim juno in despair leant upon the respective arms of venus and minerva  celestial despot said ixion i defy the immortal ingenuity of thy cruelty my memory must be as eternal as thy torture that will support me
