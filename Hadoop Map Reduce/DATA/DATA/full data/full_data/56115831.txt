56115831	a wonderbook for girls and boys                       by nathaniel hawthorne                        the three golden apples     contents    tanglewood firesideintroductory to the three golden apples   the three golden apples   tanglewood firesideafter the story     introductory to the three golden apples  the snowstorm lasted another day but what became of it afterwards i cannot possibly imagine  at any rate it entirely cleared away during the night and when the sun arose the next morning it shone brightly down on as bleak a tract of hillcountry here in berkshire as could be seen anywhere in the world  the frostwork had so covered the windowpanes that it was hardly possible to get a glimpse at the scenery outside  but while waiting for breakfast the small populace of tanglewood had scratched peepholes with their fingernails and saw with vast delight thatunless it were one or two bare patches on a precipitous hillside or the gray effect of the snow intermingled with the black pine forestall nature was as white as a sheet  how exceedingly pleasant  and to make it all the better it was cold enough to nip ones nose short off  if people have but life enough in them to bear it there is nothing that so raises the spirits and makes the blood ripple and dance so nimbly like a brook down the slope of a hill as a bright hard frost  no sooner was breakfast over than the whole party well muffled in furs and woollens floundered forth into the midst of the snow  well what a day of frosty sport was this  they slid down hill into the valley a hundred times nobody knows how far and to make it all the merrier upsetting their sledges and tumbling head over heels quite as often as they came safely to the bottom  and once eustace bright took periwinkle sweet fern and squashblossom on the sledge with him by way of insuring a safe passage and down they went full speed  but behold halfway down the sledge hit against a hidden stump and flung all four of its passengers into a heap and on gathering themselves up there was no little squashblossom to be found  why what could have become of the child  and while they were wondering and staring about up started squashblossom out of a snowbank with the reddest face you ever saw and looking as if a large scarlet flower had suddenly sprouted up in midwinter  then there was a great laugh  when they had grown tired of sliding down hill eustace set the children to digging a cave in the biggest snowdrift that they could find unluckily just as it was completed and the party had squeezed themselves into the hollow down came the roof upon their heads and buried every soul of them alive  the next moment up popped all their little heads out of the ruins and the tall students head in the midst of them looking hoary and venerable with the snowdust that had got amongst his brown curls  and then to punish cousin eustace for advising them to dig such a tumbledown cavern the children attacked him in a body and so bepelted him with snowballs that he was fain to take to his heels  so he ran away and went into the woods and thence to the margin of shadow brook where he could hear the streamlet grumbling along under great overhanging banks of snow and ice which would scarcely let it see the light of day  there were adamantine icicles glittering around all its little cascades  thence be strolled to the shore of the lake and beheld a white untrodden plain before him stretching from his own feet to the foot of monument mountain  and it being now almost sunset eustace thought that he had never beheld anything so fresh and beautiful as the scene  he was glad that the children were not with him for their lively spirits and tumbleabout activity would quite have chased away his higher and graver mood so that he would merely have been merry as he had already been the whole day long and would not have known the loveliness of the winter sunset among the hills  when the sun was fairly down our friend eustace went home to eat his supper  after the meal was over he betook himself to the study with a purpose i rather imagine to write an ode or two or three sonnets or verses of some kind or other in praise of the purple and golden clouds which he had seen around the setting sun  but before he had hammered out the very first rhyme the door opened and primrose and periwinkle made their appearance  go away children  i cant be troubled with you now cried the student looking over his shoulder with the pen between his fingers what in the world do you want here  i thought you were all in bed  hear him periwinkle trying to talk like a grown man said primrose and he seems to forget that i am now thirteen years old and may sit up almost as late as i please  but cousin eustace you must put off your airs and come with us to the drawingroom  the children have talked so much about your stories that my father wishes to hear one of them in order to judge whether they are likely to do any mischief  poh poh primrose exclaimed the student rather vexed  i dont believe i can tell one of my stories in the presence of grown people besides your father is a classical scholar not that i am much afraid of his scholarship neither for i doubt not it is as rusty as an old caseknife by this time  but then he will be sure to quarrel with the admirable nonsense that i put into these stories out of my own head and which makes the great charm of the matter for children like yourself  no man of fifty who has read the classical myths in his youth can possibly understand my merit as a reinventor and improver of them  all this may be very true said primrose but come you must  my father will not open his book nor will mamma open the piano till you have given us some of your nonsense as you very correctly call it so be a good boy and come along  whatever he might pretend the student was rather glad than otherwise on second thoughts to catch at the opportunity of proving to mr pringle what an excellent faculty he had in modernizing the myths of ancient times  until twenty years of age a young man may indeed be rather bashful about showing his poetry and his prose but for all that he is pretty apt to think that these very productions would place him at the tiptop of literature if once they could be known accordingly without much more resistance eustace suffered primrose and periwinkle to drag him into the drawingroom  it was a large handsome apartment with a semicircular window at one end in the recess of which stood a marble copy of greenoughs angel and child  on one side of the fireplace there were many shelves of books gravely but richly bound  the white light of the astrallamp and the red glow of the bright coalfire made the room brilliant and cheerful and before the fire in a deep armchair sat mr pringle looking just fit to be seated in such a chair and in such a room  he was a tall and quite a handsome gentleman with a bald brow and was always so nicely dressed that even eustace bright never liked to enter his presence without at least pausing at the threshold to settle his shirtcollar but now as primrose had hold of one of his hands and periwinkle of the other he was forced to make his appearance with a roughandtumble sort of look as if he had been rolling all day in a snowbank  and so he had  mr pringle turned towards the student benignly enough but in a way that made him feel how uncombed and unbrushed he was and how uncombed and unbrushed likewise were his mind and thoughts  eustace said mr pringle with a smile i find that you are producing a great sensation among the little public of tanglewood by the exercise of your gifts of narrative  primrose here as the little folks choose to call her and the rest of the children have been so loud in praise of your stories that mrs pringle and myself are really curious to hear a specimen  it would be so much the more gratifying to myself as the stories appear to be an attempt to render the fables of classical antiquity into the idiom of modern fancy and feeling  at least so i judge from a few of the incidents which have come to me at second hand  you are not exactly the auditor that i should have chosen sir observed the student for fantasies of this nature  possibly not replied mr pringle  i suspect however that a young authors most useful critic is precisely the one whom he would be least apt to choose  pray oblige me therefore  sympathy methinks should have some little share in the critics qualifications murmured eustace bright  however sir if you will find patience i will find stories  but be kind enough to remember that i am addressing myself to the imagination and sympathies of the children not to your own  accordingly the student snatched hold of the first theme which presented itself  it was suggested by a plate of apples that he happened to spy on the mantelpiece    the three golden apples  did you ever hear of the golden apples that grew in the garden of the hesperides  ah those were such apples as would bring a great price by the bushel if any of them could be found growing in the orchards of nowadays  but there is not i suppose a graft of that wonderful fruit on a single tree in the wide world  not so much as a seed of those apples exists any longer  and even in the old old halfforgotten times before the garden of the hesperides was overrun with weeds a great many people doubted whether there could be real trees that bore apples of solid gold upon their branches  all had heard of them but nobody remembered to have seen any  children nevertheless used to listen openmouthed to stories of the golden appletree and resolved to discover it when they should be big enough  adventurous young men who desired to do a braver thing than any of their fellows set out in quest of this fruit  many of them returned no more none of them brought back the apples  no wonder that they found it impossible to gather them  it is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree with a hundred terrible heads fifty of which were always on the watch while the other fifty slept  in my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple  had the apples been sweet mellow and juicy indeed that would be another matter  there might then have been some sense in trying to get at them in spite of the hundredheaded dragon  but as i have already told you it was quite a common thing with young persons when tired of too much peace and rest to go in search of the garden of the hesperides  and once the adventure was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed very little peace or rest since he came into the world  at the time of which i am going to speak he was wandering through the pleasant land of italy with a mighty club in his hand and a bow and quiver slung across his shoulders  he was wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion that ever had been seen and which he himself had killed and though on the whole he was kind and generous and noble there was a good deal of the lions fierceness in his heart as he went on his way he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden  but none of the country people knew anything about the matter and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question if the stranger had not carried so very big a club  so he journeyed on and on still making the same inquiry until at last he came to the brink of a river where some beautiful young women sat twining wreaths of flowers  can you tell me pretty maidens asked the stranger whether this is the right way to the garden of the hesperides  the young women had been having a fine time together weaving the flowers into wreaths and crowning one anothers heads  and there seemed to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers that made the flowers more fresh and dewy and of brighter lines and sweeter fragrance while they played with them than even when they had been growing on their native stems  but on hearing the strangers question they dropped all their flowers on the grass and gazed at him with astonishment  the garden of the hesperides cried one  we thought mortals had been weary of seeking it after so many disappointments  and pray adventurous traveller what do you want there  a certain king who is my cousin replied he has ordered me to get him three of the golden apples  most of the young men who go in quest of these apples observed another of the damsels desire to obtain them for themselves or to present them to some fair maiden whom they love  do you then love this king your cousin so very much  perhaps not replied the stranger sighing  he has often been severe and cruel to me  but it is my destiny to obey him  and do you know asked the damsel who had first spoken that a terrible dragon with a hundred heads keeps watch under the golden appletree  i know it well answered the stranger calmly  but from my cradle upwards it has been my business and almost my pastime to deal with serpents and dragons  the young women looked at his massive club and at the shaggy lions skin which he wore and likewise at his heroic limbs and figure and they whispered to each other that the stranger appeared to be one who might reasonably expect to perform deeds far beyond the might of other men  but then the dragon with a hundred heads  what mortal even if he possessed a hundred lives could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster  so kindhearted were the maidens that they could not bear to see this brave and handsome traveller attempt what was so very dangerous and devote himself most probably to become a meal for the dragons hundred ravenous mouths  go back cried they allgo back to your own home  your mother beholding you safe and sound will shed tears of joy and what can she do more should you win ever so great a victory  no matter for the golden apples  no matter for the king your cruel cousin  we do not wish the dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up  the stranger seemed to grow impatient at these remonstrances  he carelessly lifted his mighty club and let it fall upon a rock that lay half buried in the earth near by  with the force of that idle blow the great rock was shattered all to pieces  it cost the stranger no more effort to achieve this feat of a giants strength than for one of the young maidens to touch her sisters rosy cheek with a flower  do you not believe said he looking at the damsels with a smile that such a blow would have crushed one of the dragons hundred heads  then he sat down on the grass and told them the story of his life or as much of it as he could remember from the day when he was first cradled in a warriors brazen shield  while he lay there two immense serpents came gliding over the floor and opened their hideous jaws to devour him and he a baby of a few months old had griped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little fists and strangled them to death when he was but a stripling he had killed a huge lion almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders  the next thing that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster called a hydra which had no less than nine heads and exceedingly sharp teeth in every one of them  but the dragon of the hesperides you know observed one of the damsels has a hundred heads  nevertheless replied the stranger i would rather fight two such dragons than a single hydra  for as fast as i cut off a head two others grew in its place and besides there was one of the heads that could not possibly be killed but kept biting as fiercely as ever long after it was cut off  so i was forced to bury it under a stone where it is doubtless alive to this vary day  but the hydras body and its eight other heads will never do any further mischief  the damsels judging that the story was likely to last a good while had been preparing a repast of bread and grapes that the stranger might refresh himself in the intervals of his talk  they took pleasure in helping him to this simple food and now and then one of them would put a sweet grape between her rosy lips lest it should make him bashful to eat alone  the traveller proceeded to tell how he had chased a very swift stag for a twelvemonth together without ever stopping to take breath and had at last caught it by the antlers and carried it home alive  and he had fought with a very odd race of people half horses and half men and had put them all to death from a sense of duty in order that their ugly figures might never be seen any more  besides all this he took to himself great credit for having cleaned out a stable  do you call that a wonderful exploit asked one of the young maidens with a smile  any clown in the country has done as much  had it been an ordinary stable replied the stranger i should not have mentioned it  but this was so gigantic a task that it would have taken me all my life to perform it if i had not luckily thought of turning the channel of a river through the stabledoor  that did the business in a very short time  seeing how earnestly his fair auditors listened he next told them how he had shot some monstrous birds and had caught a wild bull alive and let him go again and had tamed a number of very wild horses and had conquered hippolyta the warlike queen of the amazons  he mentioned likewise that he had taken off hippolytas enchanted girdle and had given it to the daughter of his cousin the king  was it the girdle of venus inquired the prettiest of the damsels which makes women beautiful  no answered the stranger  it had formerly been the swordbelt of mars and it can only make the wearer valiant and courageous  an old swordbelt cried the damsel tossing her head  then i should not care about having it  you are right said the stranger  going on with his wonderful narrative he informed the maidens that as strange an adventure as ever happened was when he fought with geryon the sixlegged man  this was a very odd and frightful sort of figure as you may well believe  any person looking at his tracks in the sand or snow would suppose that three sociable companions had been walking along together  on hearing his footsteps at a little distance it was no more than reasonable to judge that several people must be coming but it was only the strange man geryon clattering onward with his six legs  six legs and one gigantic body  certainly he must have been a very queer monster to look at and my stars what a waste of shoeleather  when the stranger had finished the story of his adventures he looked around at the attentive faces of the maidens  perhaps you may have heard of me before said he modestly  my name is hercules  we had already guessed it replied the maidens for your wonderful deeds are known all over the world  we do not think it strange any longer that you should set out in quest of the golden apples of the hesperides  come sisters let us crown the hero with flowers  then they flung beautiful wreaths over his stately head and mighty shoulders so that the lions skin was almost entirely covered with roses  they took possession of his ponderous club and so entwined it about with the brightest softest and most fragrant blossoms that not a fingers breadth of its oaken substance could be seen  it looked all like a huge bunch of flowers  lastly they joined hands and danced around him chanting words which became poetry of their own accord and grew into a choral song in honor of the illustrious hercules  and hercules was rejoiced as any other hero would have been to know that these fair young girls had heard of the valiant deeds which it had cost him so much toil and danger to achieve  but still he was not satisfied  he could not think that what he had already done was worthy of so much honor while there remained any bold or difficult adventure to be undertaken  dear maidens said he when they paused to take breath now that you know my name will you not tell me how i am to reach the garden of the hesperides  ah must you go so soon they exclaimed  youthat have performed so many wonders and spent such a toilsome lifecannot you content yourself to repose a little while on the margin of this peaceful river  hercules shook his head  i must depart now said he  we will then give you the best directions we can replied the damsels you must go to the seashore and find out the old one and compel him to inform you where the golden apples are to be found  the old one repeated hercules laughing at this odd name  and pray who may the old one be  why the old man of the sea to be sure answered one of the damsels he has fifty daughters whom some people call very beautiful but we do not think it proper to be acquainted with them because they have seagreen hair and taper away like fishes  you must talk with this old man of the sea  he is a seafaring person and knows all about the garden of the hesperides for it is situated in an island which he is often in the habit of visiting  hercules then asked whereabouts the old one was most likely to be met with  when the damsels had informed him he thanked them for all their kindnessfor the bread and grapes with which they had fed him the lovely flowers with which they had crowned him and the songs and dances wherewith they had done him honorand he thanked them most of all for telling him the right wayand immediately set forth upon his journey  but before he was out of hearing one of the maidens called after him  keep fast hold of the oldone when you catch him cried she smiling and lifting her finger to make the caution more impressive  do not be astonished at anything that may happen  only hold him fast and he will tell you what you wish to know  hercules again thanked her and pursued his way while the maidens resumed their pleasant labor of making flowerwreaths  they talked about the hero long after he was gone  we will crown him with the loveliest of our garlands said they when he returns hither with the three golden apples after slaying the dragon with a hundred heads  meanwhile hercules travelled constantly onward over hill and dale and through the solitary woods  sometimes he swung his club aloft and splintered a mighty oak with a downright blow  his mind was so full of the giants and monsters with whom it was the business of his life to fight that perhaps he mistook the great tree for a giant or a monster and so eager was hercules to achieve what he had undertaken that he almost regretted to have spent so much time with the damsels wasting idle breath upon the story of his adventures  but thus it always is with persons who are destined to perform great things  what they have already done seems less than nothing  what they have taken in hand to do seems worth toil danger and life itself  persons who happened to be passing through the forest must have been affrighted to see him smite the trees with his great club  with but a single blow the trunk was riven as by the stroke of lightning and the broad boughs came rustling and crashing down  hastening forward without ever pausing or looking behind he by and by heard the sea roaring at a distance  at this sound he increased his speed and soon came to a beach where the great surfwaves tumbled themselves upon the hard sand in a long line of snowy foam  at one end of the beach however there was a pleasant spot where some green shrubbery clambered up a cliff making its rocky face look soft and beautiful  a carpet of verdant grass largely intermixed with sweetsmelling clover covered the narrow space between the bottom of the cliff and the sea  and what should hercules espy there but an old man fast asleep  but was it really and truly an old man  certainly at first sight it looked very like one but on closer inspection it rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in the sea  for on his legs and arms there were scales such as fishes have he was webfooted and webfingered after the fashion of a duck and his long beard being of a greenish tinge had more the appearance of a tuft of seaweed than of an ordinary beard  have you never seen a stick of timber that has been long tossed about by the waves and has got all overgrown with barnacles and at last drifting ashore seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest bottom of the sea  well the old man would have put you in mind of just such a wavetost spar  but hercules the instant he set eyes on this strange figure was convinced that it could be no other than the old one who was to direct him on his way  yes it was the selfsame old man of the sea whom the hospitable maidens had talked to him about  thanking his stars for the lucky accident of finding the old fellow asleep hercules stole on tiptoe towards him and caught him by the arm and leg  tell me cried he before the old one was well awake which is the way to the garden of the hesperides  as you may easily imagine the old man of the sea awoke in a fright but his astonishment could hardly have been greater than was that of hercules the next moment  for all of a sudden the old one seemed to disappear out of his grasp and he found himself holding a stag by the fore and hind leg  but still he kept fast hold  then the stag disappeared and in its stead there was a seabird fluttering and screaming while hercules clutched it by the wing and claw  but the bird could not get away  immediately afterwards there was an ugly threeheaded dog which growled and barked at hercules and snapped fiercely at the hands by which he held him  but hercules would not let him go  in another minute instead of the threeheaded dog what should appear but geryon the sixlegged manmonster kicking at hercules with five of his legs in order to get the remaining one at liberty  but hercules held on  by and by no geryou was there but a huge snake like one of those which hercules had strangled in his babyhood only a hundred times as big and it twisted and twined about the heros neck and body and threw its tail high into the air and opened its deadly jaws as if to devour him outright so that it was really a very terrible spectacle  but hercules was no whit disheartened and squeezed the great snake so tightly that he soon began to hiss with pain  you must understand that the old man of the sea though he generally looked so much like the wavebeaten figurehead of a vessel had the power of assuming any shape he pleased  when he found himself so roughly seized by hercules he had been in hopes of putting him into such surprise and terror by these magical transformations that the hero would be glad to let him go  if hercules had relaxed his grasp the old one would certainly have plunged down to the very bottom of the sea whence he would not soon have given himself the trouble of coming up in order to answer any impertinent questions  ninetynine people out of a hundred i suppose would have been frightened out of their wits by the very first of his ugly shapes and would have taken to their heels at once  for one of the hardest things in this world is to see the difference between real dangers and imaginary ones  but as hercules held on so stubbornly and only squeezed the old one so much the tighter at every change of shape and really put him to no small torture he finally thought it best to reappear in his own figure so there he was again a fishy scaly webfooted sort of personage with something like a tuft of seaweed at his chin  pray what do you want with me cried the old one as soon as he could take breath for it is quite a tiresome affair to go through so many false shapes  why do you squeeze me so hard  let me go this moment or i shall begin to consider you an extremely uncivil person  my name is hercules roared the mighty stranger  and you will never get out of my clutch until you tell me the nearest way to the garden of the hesperides  when the old fellow heard who it was that had caught him he saw with half an eye that it would be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted to know  the old one was an inhabitant of the sea you must recollect and roamed about everywhere like other seafaring people of course he had often heard of the fame of hercules and of the wonderful things that he was constantly performing in various parts of the earth and how determined he always was to accomplish whatever he undertook  he therefore made no more attempts to escape but told the hero how to find the garden of the hesperides and likewise warned him of many difficulties which must be overcome before he could arrive thither  you must go on thus and thus said the old man of the sea after taking the points of the compass till you come in sight of a very tall giant who holds the sky on his shoulders  and the giant if he happens to be in the humor will tell you exactly where the garden of the hesperides lies  and if the giant happens not to be in the humor remarked hercules balancing his club on the tip of his finger perhaps i shall find means to persuade him  thanking the old man of the sea and begging his pardon for having squeezed him so roughly the hero resumed his journey  he met with a great many strange adventures which would be well worth your hearing if i had leisure to narrate them as minutely as they deserve  it was in this journey if i mistake not that he encountered a prodigious giant who was so wonderfully contrived by nature that every time he touched the earth he became ten times as strong as ever he had been before  his name was antreus  you may see plainly enough that it was a very difficult business to fight with such a fellow for as often as he got a knockdown blow up he started again stronger fiercer and abler to use his weapons than if his enemy had let him alone thus the harder hercules pounded the giant with his club the further be seemed from winning the victory  i have sometimes argued with such people but never fought with one  the only way in which hercules found it possible to finish the battle was by lifting antaeus off his feet into the air and squeezing and squeezing and squeezing him until finally the strength was quite squeezed out of his enormous body  when this affair was finished hercules continued his travels and went to the land of egypt where he was taken prisoner and would have been put to death if he had not slain the king of the country and made his escape  passing through the deserts of africa and going as fast as he could he arrived at last on the shore of the great ocean  and here unless he could walk on the crests of the billows it seemed as if his journey must needs be at an end  nothing was before him save the foaming dashing measureless ocean but suddenly as he looked towards the horizon he saw something a great way off which he had not seen the moment before  it gleamed very brightly almost as you may have beheld the round golden disk of the sun when it rises or sets over the edge of the world  it evidently drew nearer for at every instant this wonderful object became larger and more lustrous  at length it had come so nigh that hercules discovered it to be an immense cup or bowl made either of gold or burnished brass  how it had got afloat upon the sea is more than i can tell you  there it was at all events rolling on the tumultuous billows which tossed it up and down and heaved their foamy tops against its sides but without ever throwing their spray over the brim  i have seen many giants in my time thought hercules but never one that would need to drink his wine out of a cup like this  and true enough what a cup it must have been  it was as largeas largebut in short i am afraid to say how immeasurably large it was to speak within bounds it was ten times larger than a great millwheel and all of metal as it was it floated over the heaving surges more lightly than an acorncup adown the brook  the waves tumbled it onward until it grazed against the shore within a short distance of the spot where hercules was standing  as soon as this happened he knew what was to be done for he had not gone through so many remarkable adventures without learning pretty well how to conduct himself whenever anything came to pass a little out of the common rule  it was just as clear as daylight that this marvellous cup had been set adrift by some unseen power and guided hitherward in order to carry hercules across the sea on his way to the garden of the hesperides  accordingly without a moments delay he clambered over the brim and slid down on the inside where spreading out his lions skin he proceeded to take a little repose  he had scarcely rested until now since he bade farewell to the damsels on the margin of the river  the waves dashed with a pleasant and ringing sound against the circumference of the hollow cup it rocked lightly to and fro and the motion was so soothing that it speedily rocked hercules into an agreeable slumber  his nap had probably lasted a good while when the cup chanced to graze against a rock and in consequence immediately resounded and reverberated through its golden or brazen substance a hundred times as loudly as ever you heard a churchbell  the noise awoke hercules who instantly started up and gazed around him wondering whereabouts he was he was not long in discovering that the cup had floated across a great part of the sea and was approaching the shore of what seemed to be an island  and on that island what do you think he saw  no you will never guess it not if you were to try fifty thousand times  it positively appears to me that this was the most marvellous spectacle that had ever been seen by hercules in the whole course of his wonderful travels and adventures  it was a greater marvel than the hydra with nine heads which kept growing twice as fast as they were cut off greater than the sixlegged manmonster greater than antreus greater than anything that was ever beheld by anybody before or since the days of hercules or than anything that remains to be beheld by travellers in all time to come  it was a giant  but such an intolerably big giant  a giant as tall as a mountain so vast a giant that the clouds rested about his midst like a girdle and hung like a hoary beard from his chin and flitted before his huge eyes so that he could neither see hercules nor the golden cup in which he was voyaging  and most wonderful of all the giant held up his great hands and appeared to support the sky which so far as hercules could discern through the clouds was resting upon his head  this does really seem almost too much to believe  meanwhile the bright cup continued to float onward and finally touched the strand  just then a breeze wafted away the clouds from before the giants visage and hercules beheld it with all its enormous features eyes each of them as big as yonder lake a nose a mile long and a mouth of the same width  it was a countenance terrible from its enormity of size but disconsolate and weary even as you may see the faces of many people nowadays who are compelled to sustain burdens above their strength  what the sky was to the giant such are the cares of earth to those who let themselves be weighed down by them  and whenever men undertake what is beyond the just measure of their abilities they encounter precisely such a doom as had befallen this poor giant  poor fellow  he had evidently stood there a long while  an ancient forest had been growing and decaying around his feet and oaktrees of six or seven centuries old had sprung from the acorn and forced themselves between his toes  the giant now looked down from the far height of his great eyes and perceiving hercules roared out in a voice that resembled thunder proceeding out of the cloud that had just flitted away from his face  who are you down at my feet there  and whence do you come in that little cup  i am hercules  thundered back the hero in a voice pretty nearly or quite as loud as the giants own  and i am seeking for the garden of the hesperides  ho ho ho roared the giant in a fit of immense laughter  that is a wise adventure truly  and why not  cried hercules getting a little angry at the giants mirth  do you think i am afraid of the dragon with a hundred heads  just at this time while they were talking together some black clouds gathered about the giants middle and burst into a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning causing such a pother that hercules found it impossible to distinguish a word  only the giants immeasurable legs were to be seen standing up into the obscurity of the tempest and now and then a momentary glimpse of his whole figure mantled in a volume of mist  he seemed to be speaking most of the time but his big deep rough voice chimed in with the reverberations of the thunderclaps and rolled away over the hills like them  thus by talking out of season the foolish giant expended an incalculable quantity of breath to no purpose for the thunder spoke quite as intelligibly as he  at last the storm swept over as suddenly as it had come  and there again was the clear sky and the weary giant holding it up and the pleasant sunshine beaming over his vast height and illuminating it against the background of the sullen thunderclouds  so far above the shower had been his head that not a hair of it was moistened by the raindrops  when the giant could see hercules still standing on the seashore he roared out to him anew  i am atlas the mightiest giant in the world  and i hold the sky upon my head  so i see answered hercules  but can you show me the way to the garden of the hesperides  what do you want there  asked the giant  i want three of the golden apples shouted hercules for my cousin the king  there is nobody but myself quoth the giant that can go to the garden of the hesperides and gather the golden apples  if it were not for this little business of holding up the sky i would make half a dozen steps across the sea and get them for you  you are very kind replied hercules  and cannot you rest the sky upon a mountain  none of them are quite high enough said atlas shaking his head but if you were to take your stand on the summit of that nearest one your head would be pretty nearly on a level with mine  you seem to be a fellow of some strength  what if you should take my burden on your shoulders while i do your errand for you  hercules as you must be careful to remember was a remarkably strong man and though it certainly requires a great deal of muscular power to uphold the sky yet if any mortal could be supposed capable of such an exploit he was the one  nevertheless it seemed so difficult an undertaking that for the first time in his life he hesitated  is the sky very heavy he inquired  why not particularly so at first answered the giant shrugging his shoulders  but it gets to be a little burdensome after a thousand years  and how long a time asked the hero will it take you to get the golden apples  o that will be done in a few moments cried atlas  i shall take ten or fifteen miles at a stride and be at the garden and back again before your shoulders begin to ache  well then answered hercules i will climb the mountain behind you there and relieve you of your burden  the truth is hercules had a kind heart of his own and considered that he should be doing the giant a favor by allowing him this opportunity for a ramble  and besides he thought that it would be still more for his own glory if he could boast of upholding the sky than merely to do so ordinary a thing as to conquer a dragon with a hundred heads accordingly without more words the sky was shifted from the shoulders of atlas and placed upon those of hercules  when this was safely accomplished the first thing that the giant did was to stretch himself and you may imagine what a prodigious spectacle be was then  next he slowly lifted one of his feet out of the forest that had grown up around it then the other  then all at once he began to caper and leap and dance for joy at his freedom flinging himself nobody knows how high into the air and floundering down again with a shock that made the earth tremble  then he laughedho ho howith a thunderous roar that was echoed from the mountains far and near as if they and the giant had been so many rejoicing brothers when his joy had a little subsided he stepped into the sea ten miles at the first stride which brought him midleg deep and ten miles at the second when the water came just above his knees and ten miles more at the third by which he was immersed nearly to his waist  this was the greatest depth of the sea  hercules watched the giant as he still went onward for it was really a wonderful sight this immense human form more than thirty miles off half hidden in the ocean but with his upper half as tall and misty and blue as a distant mountain  at last the gigantic shape faded entirely out of view  and now hercules began to consider what he should do in case atlas should be drowned in the sea or if he were to be stung to death by the dragon with the hundred beads which guarded the golden apples of the hesperides  if any such misfortune were to happen how could he ever get rid of the sky  and by the by its weight began already to be a little irksome to his head and shoulders  i really pity the poor giant thought hercules  if it wearies me so much in ten minutes how must it have wearied him in a thousand years  o my sweet little people you have no idea what a weight there was in that same blue sky which looks so soft and aerial above our heads  and there too was the bluster of the wind and the chill and watery clouds and the blazing sun all taking their turns to make hercules uncomfortable  he began to be afraid that the giant would never come back  he gazed wistfully at the world beneath him and acknowledged to himself that it was a far happier kind of life to be a shepherd at the foot of a mountain than to stand on its dizzy summit and bear up the firmament with his might and main  for of course as you will easily understand hercules had an immense responsibility on his mind as well as a weight on his head and shoulders  why if he did not stand perfectly still and keep the sky immovable the sun would perhaps be put ajar  or after nightfall a great many of the stars might be loosened from their places and shower down like fiery rain upon the peoples heads  and how ashamed would the hero be if owing to his unsteadiness beneath its weight the sky should crack and show a great fissure quite across it  i know not how long it was before to his unspeakable joy he beheld the huge shape of the giant like a cloud on the faroff edge of the sea at his nearer approach atlas held up his hand in which hercules could perceive three magnificent golden apples as big as pumpkins all banging from one branch  i am glad to see you again shouted hercules when the giant was within hearing  so you have got the golden apples  certainly certainly answered atlas and very fair apples they are i took the finest that grew on the tree i assure you  ah it is a beautiful spot that garden of the hesperides  yes and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight worth any mans seeing  after all you had better have gone for the apples yourself  no matter replied hercules  you have had a pleasant ramble and have done the business as well as i could  i heartily thank you for your trouble  and now as i have a long way to go and am rather in hasteand as the king my cousin is anxious to receive the golden appleswill you be kind enough to take the sky off my shoulders again  why as to that said the giant chucking the golden apples into the air twenty miles high or thereabouts and catching them as they came downas to that my good friend i consider you a little unreasonable  cannot i carry the golden apples to the king your cousin much quicker than you could  as his majesty is in such a hurry to get them i promise you to take my longest strides  and besides i have no fancy for burdening myself with the sky just now  here hercules grew impatient and gave a great shrug of his shoulders it being now twilight you might have seen two or three stars tumble out of their places  everybody on earth looked upward in affright thinking that the sky might be going to fall next  o that will never do cried giant atlas with a great roar of laughter  i have not let fall so many stars within the last five centuries  by the time you have stood there as long as i did you will begin to learn patience  what shouted hercules very wrathfully do you intend to make me bear this burden forever  we will see about that one of these days answered the giant  at all events you ought not to complain if you have to bear it the next hundred years or perhaps the next thousand  i bore it a good while longer in spite of the backache  well then after a thousand years if i happen to feel in the mood we may possibly shift about again  you are certainly a very strong man and can never have a better opportunity to prove it  posterity will talk of you i warrant it  pish a fig for its talk cried hercules with another hitch of his shoulders  just take the sky upon your head one instant will you  i want to make a cushion of my lions skin for the weight to rest upon it really chafes me and will cause unnecessary inconvenience in so many centuries as i am to stand here  thats no more than fair and ill do it quoth the giant for he had no unkind feeling towards hercules and was merely acting with a too selfish consideration of his own ease  for just five minutes then ill take back the sky  only for five minutes recollect  i have no idea of spending another thousand years as i spent the last  variety is the spice of life say i  ah the thickwitted old rogue of a giant  he threw down the golden apples and received back the sky from the head and shoulders of hercules upon his own where it rightly belonged  and hercules picked up the three golden apples that were as big or bigger than pumpkins and straightway set out on his journey homeward without paying the slightest heed to the thundering tones of the giant who bellowed after him to come back  another forest sprang up around his feet and grew ancient there and again might be seen oaktrees of six or seven centuries old that had waxed thus again betwixt his enormous toes  and there stands the giant to this day or at any rate there stands a mountain as tall as he and which bears his name and when the thunder rumples about its summit we may imagine it to be the voice of giant atlas bellowing after hercules    tanglewood fireside  after the story  cousin eustace demanded sweet fern who had been sitting at the storytellers feet with his mouth wide open exactly how tall was this giant  o sweet fern sweet fern  cried the student do you think i was there to measure him with a yardstick  well if you must know to a hairsbreadth i suppose he might be from three to fifteen miles straight upward and that he might have seated himself on taconic and had monument mountain for a footstool  dear me ejaculated the good little boy with a contented sort of a grunt that was a giant sure enough  and how long was his little finger  as long as from tanglewood to the lake said eustace  sure enough that was a giant  repeated sweet fern in an ecstasy at the precision of these measurements  and how broad i wonder were the shoulders of hercules  that is what i have never been able to find out answered the student but i think they must have been a great deal broader than mine or than your fathers or than almost any shoulders which one sees nowadays  i wish whispered sweet fern with his mouth close to the students ear that you would tell me how big were some of the oaktrees that grew between the giants toes  they were bigger said eustace than the great chestnuttree which stands beyond captain smiths house  eustace remarked mr pringle after some deliberation i find it impossible to express such an opinion of this story as will be likely to gratify in the smallest degree your pride of authorship  pray let me advise you never more to meddle with a classical myth  your imagination is altogether gothic and will inevitably gothicize everything that you touch  the effect is like bedaubing a marble statue with paint  this giant now  how can you have ventured to thrust his huge disproportioned mass among the seemly outlines of grecian fable the tendency of which is to reduce even the extravagant within limits by its pervading elegance  i described the giant as he appeared to me replied the student rather piqued  and sir if you would only bring your mind into such a relation with these fables as is necessary in order to remodel them you would see at once that an old greek had no more exclusive right to them than a modern yankee has  they are the common property of the world and of all time  the ancient poets remodelled them at pleasure and held them plastic in their hands and why should they not be plastic in my hands as well  mr pringle could not forbear a smile  and besides continued eustace the moment you put any warmth of heart any passion or affection any human or divine morality into a classic mould you make it quite another thing from what it was before my own opinion is that the greeks by taking possession of these legends which were the immemorial birthright of mankind and putting them into shapes of indestructible beauty indeed but cold and heartless have done all subsequent ages an incalculable injury  which you doubtless were born to remedy said mr pringle laughing outright  well well go on but take my advice and never put any of your travesties on paper  and as your next effort what if you should try your hand on some one of the legends of apollo  ah sir you propose it as an impossibility observed the student after a moments meditation and to be sure at first thought the idea of a gothic apollo strikes one rather ludicrously  but i will turn over your suggestion in my mind and do not quite despair of success  during the above discussion the children who understood not a word of it had grown very sleepy and were now sent off to bed  their drowsy babble was heard ascending the staircase while a northwestwind roared loudly among the treetops of tanglewood and played an anthem around the house  eustace bright went back to the study and again endeavored to hammer out some verses but fell asleep between two of the rhymes
