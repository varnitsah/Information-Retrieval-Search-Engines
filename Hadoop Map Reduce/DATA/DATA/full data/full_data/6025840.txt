6025840	american notes  by rudyard kipling   with introduction     introduction  in an issue of the london world in april 1890 there appeared the following paragraph two small rooms connected by a tiny hall afford sufficient space to contain mr rudyard kipling the literary hero of the present hour the man who came from nowhere as he says himself and who a year ago was consciously nothing in the literary world  six months previous to this mr kipling then but twentyfour years old had arrived in england from india to find that fame had preceded him he had already gained fame in india where scores of cultured and critical people after reading departmental ditties plain tales from the hills and various other stories and verses had stamped him for a genius  fortunately for everybody who reads london interested and stimulated mr kipling and he settled down to writing the record of badalia herodsfoot and his first novel the light that failed appeared in 1890 and 1891 then a collection of verse lifes handicap being stories of mine own people was published simultaneously in london and new york city then followed more verse and so on through an unending series  in 1891 mr kipling met the young author wolcott balestier at that time connected with a london publishing house a strong attachment grew between the two and several months after their first meeting they came to mr balestiers vermont home where they collaborated on the naulahka a story of west and east for which the century paid the largest price ever given by an american magazine for a story the following year mr kipling married mr balestiers sister in london and brought her to america  the balestiers were of an aristocratic new york family the grandfather of mrs kipling was j m balestier a prominent lawyer in new york city and chicago who died in 1888 leaving a fortune of about a million her maternal grandfather was e peshine smith of rochester n y a noted author and jurist who was selected in 1871 by secretary hamilton fish to go to japan as the mikados adviser in international law the ancestral home of the balestiers was near brattleboro vt and here mr kipling brought his bride the young englishman was so impressed by the vermont scenery that he rented for a time the cottage on the bliss farm in which steele mackaye the playwright wrote the well known drama hazel kirke  the next spring mr kipling purchased from his brotherinlaw beatty balestier a tract of land about three miles north of brattleboro vt and on this erected a house at a cost of nearly 50000 which he named the naulahka this was his home during his sojourn in america here he wrote when in the mood and for recreation tramped abroad over the hills his social duties at this period were not arduous for to his home he refused admittance to all but tried friends he made a study of the yankee country dialect and character for the walking delegate and while captains courageous the story of new england fisher life was before him he spent some time among the gloucester fishermen with an acquaintance who had access to the household gods of these people  he returned to england in august 1896 and did not visit america again till 1899 when he came with his wife and three children for a limited time  it is hardly fair to mr kipling to call american notes first impressions for one reading them will readily see that the impressions are superficial little thought being put upon the writing they seem supersarcastic and would lead one to believe that mr kipling is antagonistic to america in every respect this however is not true these notes aroused much protest and severe criticism when they appeared in 1891 and are considered so far beneath mr kiplings real work that they have been nearly suppressed and are rarely found in a list of his writings their very caustic style is of interest to a student and lover of kipling and for this reason the publishers believe them worthy of a good binding  g p t     contents  at the golden gate  american politics  american salmon  the yellowstone  chicago  the american army  americas defenceless coasts      i at the golden gate      serene indifferent to fate      thou sittest at the western gate      thou seest the white seas fold their tents      oh warder of two continents      thou drawest all things small and great      to thee beside the western gate  this is what bret harte has written of the great city of san francisco and for the past fortnight i have been wondering what made him do it  there is neither serenity nor indifference to be found in these parts and evil would it be for the continents whose wardship were intrusted to so reckless a guardian  behold me pitched neckandcrop from twenty days of the high seas into the whirl of california deprived of any guidance and left to draw my own conclusions protect me from the wrath of an outraged community if these letters be ever read by american eyes san francisco is a mad cityinhabited for the most part by perfectly insane people whose women are of a remarkable beauty  when the city of pekin steamed through the golden gate i saw with great joy that the blockhouse which guarded the mouth of the finest harbor in the world sir could be silenced by two gunboats from hong kong with safety comfort and despatch also there was not a single american vessel of war in the harbor  this may sound bloodthirsty but remember i had come with a grievance upon methe grievance of the pirated english books  then a reporter leaped aboard and ere i could gasp held me in his toils he pumped me exhaustively while i was getting ashore demanding of all things in the world news about indian journalism it is an awful thing to enter a new land with a new lie on your lips i spoke the truth to the evilminded custom house man who turned my most sacred raiment on a floor composed of stable refuse and pine splinters but the reporter overwhelmed me not so much by his poignant audacity as his beautiful ignorance i am sorry now that i did not tell him more lies as i passed into a city of three hundred thousand white men think of it three hundred thousand white men and women gathered in one spot walking upon real pavements in front of plateglasswindowed shops and talking something that at first hearing was not very different from english it was only when i had tangled myself up in a hopeless maze of small wooden houses dust street refuse and children who played with empty kerosene tins that i discovered the difference of speech  you want to go to the palace hotel said an affable youth on a dray what in hell are you doing here then this is about the lowest ward in the city go six blocks north to corner of geary and markey then walk around till you strike corner of gutter and sixteenth and that brings you there  i do not vouch for the literal accuracy of these directions quoting but from a disordered memory  amen i said but who am i that i should strike the corners of such as you name peradventure they be gentlemen of repute and might hit back bring it down to dots my son  i thought he would have smitten me but he didnt he explained that no one ever used the word street and that every one was supposed to know how the streets ran for sometimes the names were upon the lamps and sometimes they werent fortified with these directions i proceeded till i found a mighty street full of sumptuous buildings four and five stories high but paved with rude cobblestones after the fashion of the year 1  here a tramcar without any visible means of support slid stealthily behind me and nearly struck me in the back this was the famous cable car of san francisco which runs by gripping an endless wire rope sunk in the ground and of which i will tell you more anon a hundred yards further there was a slight commotion in the street a gathering together of three or four something that glittered as it moved very swiftly a ponderous irish gentleman with priests cords in his hat and a small nickelplated badge on his fat bosom emerged from the knot supporting a chinaman who had been stabbed in the eye and was bleeding like a pig the bystanders went their ways and the chinaman assisted by the policeman his own of course this was none of my business but i rather wanted to know what had happened to the gentleman who had dealt the stab it said a great deal for the excellence of the municipal arrangement of the town that a surging crowd did not at once block the street to see what was going forward i was the sixth man and the last who assisted at the performance and my curiosity was six times the greatest indeed i felt ashamed of showing it  there were no more incidents till i reached the palace hotel a sevenstoried warren of humanity with a thousand rooms in it all the travel books will tell you about hotel arrangements in this country they should be seen to be appreciated understand clearlyand this letter is written after a thousand miles of experiencesthat money will not buy you service in the west when the hotel clerkthe man who awards your room to you and who is supposed to give you informationwhen that resplendent individual stoops to attend to your wants he does so whistling or humming or picking his teeth or pauses to converse with some one he knows these performances i gather are to impress upon you that he is a free man and your equal from his general appearance and the size of his diamonds he ought to be your superior there is no necessity for this swaggering selfconsciousness of freedom business is business and the man who is paid to attend to a man might reasonably devote his whole attention to the job out of office hours he can take his coach and four and pervade society if he pleases  in a vast marblepaved hall under the glare of an electric light sat forty or fifty men and for their use and amusement were provided spittoons of infinite capacity and generous gape most of the men wore frockcoats and tophatsthe things that we in india put on at a weddingbreakfast if we possess thembut they all spat they spat on principle the spittoons were on the staircases in each bedroomyea and in chambers even more sacred than these they chased one into retirement but they blossomed in chiefest splendor round the bar and they were all used every reeking one of them  just before i began to feel deathly sick another reporter grappled me what he wanted to know was the precise area of india in square miles i referred him to whittaker he had never heard of whittaker he wanted it from my own mouth and i would not tell him then he swerved off just like the other man to details of journalism in our own country i ventured to suggest that the interior economy of a paper most concerned the people who worked it  thats the very thing that interests us he said have you got reporters anything like our reporters on indian newspapers  we have not i said and suppressed the thank god rising to my lips  why havent you said he  because they would die i said  it was exactly like talking to a childa very rude little child he would begin almost every sentence with now tell me something about india and would turn aimlessly from one question to the other without the least continuity i was not angry but keenly interested the man was a revelation to me to his questions i returned answers mendacious and evasive after all it really did not matter what i said he could not understand i can only hope and pray that none of the readers of the pioneer will ever see that portentous interview the man made me out to be an idiot several sizes more drivelling than my destiny intended and the rankness of his ignorance managed to distort the few poor facts with which i supplied him into large and elaborate lies then thought i the matter of american journalism shall be looked into later on at present i will enjoy myself  no man rose to tell me what were the lions of the place no one volunteered any sort of conveyance i was absolutely alone in this big city of white folk by instinct i sought refreshment and came upon a barroom full of bad salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter it was the institution of the free lunch i had struck you paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat for something less than a rupee a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in san francisco even though he be a bankrupt remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts  later i began a vast but unsystematic exploration of the streets i asked for no names it was enough that the pavements were full of white men and women the streets clanging with traffic and that the restful roar of a great city rang in my ears the cable cars glided to all points of the compass at once i took them one by one till i could go no further san francisco has been pitched down on the sand bunkers of the bikaneer desert about one fourth of it is ground reclaimed from the seaany oldtimers will tell you all about that the remainder is just ragged unthrifty sand hills today pegged down by houses  from an english point of view there has not been the least attempt at grading those hills and indeed you might as well try to grade the hillocks of sind the cable cars have for all practical purposes made san francisco a dead level they take no count of rise or fall but slide equably on their appointed courses from one end to the other of a sixmile street they turn corners almost at right angles cross other lines and for aught i know may run up the sides of houses there is no visible agency of their flight but once in awhile you shall pass a fivestoried building humming with machinery that winds up an everlasting wire cable and the initiated will tell you that here is the mechanism i gave up asking questions if it pleases providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles and if for twopence halfpenny i can ride in that car why shall i seek the reasons of the miracle rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of wood to imitate stone each house just big enough for a man and his family let me watch the people in the cars and try to find out in what manner they differ from us their ancestors  it grieves me now that i cursed them in the matter of book piracy because i perceived that my curse is working and that their speech is becoming a horror already they delude themselves into the belief that they talk englishthe englishand i have already been pitied for speaking with an english accent the man who pitied me spoke so far as i was concerned the language of thieves and they all do where we put the accent forward they throw it back and vice versa where we give the long a they use the short and words so simple as to be past mistaking they pronounce somewhere up in the dome of their heads how do these things happen  oliver wendell holmes says that the yankee schoolmarm the cider and the salt codfish of the eastern states are responsible for what he calls a nasal accent i know better they stole books from across the water without paying for em and the snort of delight was fixed in their nostrils forever by a just providence that is why they talk a foreign tongue today  cats is dogs and rabbits is dogs and sos parrots but this ere tortoise is an insect so there aint no charge as the old porter said  a hindoo is a hindoo and a brother to the man who knows his vernacular and a frenchman is french because he speaks his own language but the american has no language he is dialect slang provincialism accent and so forth now that i have heard their voices all the beauty of bret harte is being ruined for me because i find myself catching through the roll of his rhythmical prose the cadence of his peculiar fatherland get an american lady to read to you how santa claus came to simpsons bar and see how much is under her tongue left of the beauty of the original  but i am sorry for bret harte it happened this way a reporter asked me what i thought of the city and i made answer suavely that it was hallowed ground to me because of bret harte that was true  well said the reporter bret harte claims california but california dont claim bret harte hes been so long in england that hes quite english have you seen our cracker factories or the new offices of the examiner  he could not understand that to the outside world the city was worth a great deal less than the man i never intended to curse the people with a provincialism so vast as this  but let us return to our sheepwhich means the sealions of the cliff house they are the great show of san francisco you take a train which pulls up the middle of the street it killed two people the day before yesterday being unbraked and driven absolutely regardless of consequences and you pull up somewhere at the back of the city on the pacific beach originally the cliffs and their approaches must have been pretty but they have been so carefully defiled with advertisements that they are now one big blistered abomination a hundred yards from the shore stood a big rock covered with the carcasses of the sleek seabeasts who roared and rolled and walloped in the spouting surges no bold man had painted the creatures skyblue or advertised newspapers on their backs wherefore they did not match the landscape which was chiefly hoarding some day perhaps whatever sort of government may obtain in this country will make a restoration of the place and keep it clean and neat at present the sovereign people of whom i have heard so much already are vending cherries and painting the virtues of little bile beans all over it  night fell over the pacific and the white seafog whipped through the streets dimming the splendors of the electric lights it is the use of this city her men and women folk to parade between the hours of eight and ten a certain street called cairn street where the finest shops are situated here the click of high heels on the pavement is loudest here the lights are brightest and here the thunder of the traffic is most overwhelming i watched young california and saw that it was at least expensively dressed cheerful in manner and selfasserting in conversation also the women were very fair perhaps eighteen days aboard ship had something to do with my unreserved admiration the maidens were of generous build large well groomed and attired in raiment that even to my inexperienced eyes must have cost much cairn street at nine oclock levels all distinctions of rank as impartially as the grave again and again i loitered at the heels of a couple of resplendent beings only to overhear when i expected the level voice of culture the staccato sez he sez i that is the mark of the white servantgirl all the world over  this was depressing because in spite of all that goes to the contrary fine feathers ought to make fine birds there was wealthunlimited wealthin the streets but not an accent that would not have been dear at fifty cents wherefore revolving in my mind that these folk were barbarians i was presently enlightened and made aware that they also were the heirs of all the ages and civilized after all there appeared before me an affable stranger of prepossessing appearance with a blue and an innocent eye addressing me by name he claimed to have met me in new york at the windsor and to this claim i gave a qualified assent i did not remember the fact but since he was so certain of it why theni waited developments  and what did you think of indiana when you came through was the next question  it revealed the mystery of previous acquaintance and one or two other things with reprehensible carelessness my friend of the lightblue eye had looked up the name of his victim in the hotel register and read indiana for india  the provincialism with which i had cursed his people extended to himself he could not imagine an englishman coming through the states from west to east instead of by the regularly ordained route my fear was that in his delight in finding me so responsive he would make remarks about new york and the windsor which i could not understand and indeed he adventured in this direction once or twice asking me what i thought of such and such streets which from his tone i gathered to be anything but respectable it is trying to talk unknown new york in almost unknown san francisco but my friend was merciful he protested that i was one after his own heart and pressed upon me rare and curious drinks at more than one bar these drinks i accepted with gratitude as also the cigars with which his pockets were stored he would show me the life of the city having no desire to watch a weary old play again i evaded the offer and received in lieu of the devils instruction much coarse flattery curiously constituted is the soul of man knowing how and where this man lied waiting idly for the finale i was distinctly conscious as he bubbled compliments in my ear of soft thrills of gratified pride stealing from hatrim to bootheels i was wise quoth heanybody could see that with half an eye sagacious versed in the ways of the world an acquaintance to be desired one who had tasted the cup of life with discretion  all this pleased me and in a measure numbed the suspicion that was thoroughly aroused eventually the blueeyed one discovered nay insisted that i had a taste for cards this was clumsily worked in but it was my fault for in that i met him halfway and allowed him no chance of good acting hereupon i laid my head upon one side and simulated unholy wisdom quoting odds and ends of poker talk all ludicrously misapplied my friend kept his countenance admirably and well he might for five minutes later we arrived always by the purest of chance at a place where we could play cards and also frivol with louisiana state lottery tickets would i play  nay said i for to me cards have neither meaning nor continuity but let us assume that i am going to play how would you and your friends get to work would you play a straight game or make me drunk orwell the fact is im a newspaper man and id be much obliged if youd let me know something about bunco steering  my blueeyed friend erected himself into an obelisk of profanity he cursed me by his godsthe right and left bower he even cursed the very good cigars he had given me but the storm over he quieted down and explained i apologized for causing him to waste an evening and we spent a very pleasant time together  inaccuracy provincialism and a too hasty rushing to conclusions were the rocks that he had split on but he got his revenge when he saidhow would i play with you from all the poppycock anglice bosh you talked about poker id ha played a straight game and skinned you i wouldnt have taken the trouble to make you drunk you never knew anything of the game but how i was mistaken in going to work on you makes me sick  he glared at me as though i had done him an injury today i know how it is that year after year week after week the bunco steerer who is the confidence trick and the cardsharper man of other climes secures his prey he clavers them over with flattery as the snake clavers the rabbit the incident depressed me because it showed i had left the innocent east far behind and was come to a country where a man must look out for himself the very hotels bristled with notices about keeping my door locked and depositing my valuables in a safe the white man in a lump is bad weeping softly for otoyo little i knew then that my heart was to be torn afresh from my bosom i fell asleep in the clanging hotel  next morning i had entered upon the deferred inheritance there are no princes in americaat least with crowns on their headsbut a generousminded member of some royal family received my letter of introduction ere the day closed i was a member of the two clubs and booked for many engagements to dinner and party now this prince upon whose financial operations be continual increase had no reason nor had the others his friends to put himself out for the sake of one briton more or less but he rested not till he had accomplished all in my behalf that a mother could think of for her debutante daughter  do you know the bohemian club of san francisco they say its fame extends over the world it was created somewhat on the lines of the savage by men who wrote or drew things and has blossomed into most unrepublican luxury the ruler of the place is an owlan owl standing upon a skull and crossbones showing forth grimly the wisdom of the man of letters and the end of his hopes for immortality the owl stands on the staircase a statue four feet high is carved in the woodwork flutters on the frescoed ceiling is stamped on the notepaper and hangs on the walls he is an ancient and honorable bird under his wing twas my privilege to meet with white men whose lives were not chained down to routine of toil who wrote magazine articles instead of reading them hurriedly in the pauses of officework who painted pictures instead of contenting themselves with cheap etchings picked up at another mans sale of effects mine were all the rights of social intercourse craft by craft that india stonyhearted stepmother of collectors has swindled us out of treading soft carpets and breathing the incense of superior cigars i wandered from room to room studying the paintings in which the members of the club had caricatured themselves their associates and their aims there was a slick french audacity about the workmanship of these men of toil unbending that went straight to the heart of the beholder and yet it was not altogether french a dry grimness of treatment almost dutch marked the difference the men painted as they spokewith certainty the club indulges in revelries which it calls jinkshigh and low at intervalsand each of these gatherings is faithfully portrayed in oils by hands that know their business in this club were no amateurs spoiling canvas because they fancied they could handle oils without knowledge of shadows or anatomyno gentleman of leisure ruining the temper of publishers and an already ruined market with attempts to write because everybody writes something these days  my hosts were working or had worked for their daily bread with pen or paint and their talk for the most part was of the shopshoppythat is to say delightful they extended a large hand of welcome and were as brethren and i did homage to the owl and listened to their talk an indian club about christmastime will yield if properly worked an abundant harvest of queer tales but at a gathering of americans from the uttermost ends of their own continent the tales are larger thicker more spinous and even more azure than any indian variety tales of the war i heard told by an exofficer of the south over his evening drink to a colonel of the northern army my introducer who had served as a trooper in the northern horse throwing in emendations from time to time tales of the law which in this country is an amazingly elastic affair followed from the lips of a judge forgive me for recording one tale that struck me as new it may interest the upcountry bar in india  once upon a time there was samuelson a young lawyer who feared not god neither regarded the bench name age and town of the man were given at great length to him no case had ever come as a client partly because he lived in a district where lynch law prevailed and partly because the most desperate prisoner shrunk from intrusting himself to the mercies of a phenomenal stammerer but in time there happened an aggravated murderso bad indeed that by common consent the citizens decided as a prelude to lynching to give the real law a chance they could in fact gambol round that murder they metthe court in its shirtsleevesand against the raw square of the court house window a temptingly suggestive branch of a tree fretted the sky no one appeared for the prisoner and partly in jest the court advised young samuelson to take up the case  the prisoner is undefended sam said the court the square thing to do would be for you to take him aside and do the best you can for him  court jury and witness then adjourned to the veranda while samuelson led his client aside to the court house cells an hour passed ere the lawyer returned alone mutely the audience questioned  may it ppplease the ccourt said samuelson my clients case is a bbbbad onea ddamn bad one you told me to do the bbbest i ccould for him judge so ive jest given him yyour bbbay gelding an told him to light out for healthier cclimes my ppprofessional opinion being hed be hanged quickern hhhades if he dallied here bby this time my clients bout fifteen mile out yonder somewheres that was the bbbest i could do for him may it ppplease the court  the young man escaping punishment in lieu of the prisoner made his fortune ere five years  other voices followed with equally wondrous tales of riatathrowing in mexico and arizona of gambling at army posts in texas of newspaper wars waged in godless chicago i could not help being interested but they were not pretty tricks of deaths sudden and violent in montana and dakota of the loves of halfbreed maidens in the south and fantastic huntings for gold in mysterious alaska above all they told the story of the building of old san francisco when the finest collection of humanity on gods earth sir started this town and the water came up to the foot of market street very terrible were some of the tales grimly humorous the others and the men in broadcloth and fine linen who told them had played their parts in them  and now and again when things got too bad they would toll the city bell and the vigilance committee turned out and hanged the suspicious characters a man didnt begin to be suspected in those days till he had committed at least one unprovoked murder said a calmeyed portly old gentleman  i looked at the pictures around me the noiseless neatuniformed waiter behind me the oakribbed ceiling above the velvet carpet beneath it was hard to realize that even twenty years ago you could see a man hanged with great pomp later on i found reason to change my opinion the tales gave me a headache and set me thinking how in the world was it possible to take in even one thousandth of this huge roaring manysided continent in the tobaccoscented silence of the sumptuous library lay professor bryces book on the american republic  it is an omen said i he has done all things in all seriousness and he may be purchased for half a guinea those who desire information of the most undoubted must refer to his pages for me is the daily round of vagabondage the recording of the incidents of the hour and intercourse with the travellingcompanion of the day i will not do this country at all  and i forgot all about india for ten days while i went out to dinners and watched the social customs of the people which are entirely different from our customs and was introduced to men of many millions these persons are harmless in their earlier stagesthat is to say a man worth three or four million dollars may be a good talker clever amusing and of the world a man with twice that amount is to be avoided and a twenty million man isjust twenty millions take an instance i was speaking to a newspaper man about seeing the proprietor of his journal as in my innocence i supposed newspaper men occasionally did my friend snorted indignantlysee him great scott no if he happens to appear in the office i have to associate with him but thank heaven outside of that i move in circles where he cannot come  and yet the first thing i have been taught to believe is that money was everything in america     ii american politics  i have been watching machinery in repose after reading about machinery in action  an excellent gentleman who bears a name honored in the magazine writes much as disraeli orated of the sublime instincts of an ancient people the certainty with which they can be trusted to manage their own affairs in their own way and the speed with which they are making for all sorts of desirable goals this he called a statement or purview of american politics  i went almost directly afterward to a saloon where gentlemen interested in ward politics nightly congregate they were not pretty persons some of them were bloated and they all swore cheerfully till the heavy gold watchchains on their fat stomachs rose and fell again but they talked over their liquor as men who had power and unquestioned access to places of trust and profit  the magazine writer discussed theories of government these men the practice they had been there they knew all about it they banged their fists on the table and spoke of political pulls the vending of votes and so forth theirs was not the talk of village babblers reconstructing the affairs of the nation but of strong coarse lustful men fighting for spoil and thoroughly understanding the best methods of reaching it  i listened long and intently to speech i could not understandor but in spots  it was the speech of business however i had sense enough to know that and to do my laughing outside the door  then i began to understand why my pleasant and welleducated hosts in san francisco spoke with a bitter scorn of such duties of citizenship as voting and taking an interest in the distribution of offices scores of men have told me without false pride that they would as soon concern themselves with the public affairs of the city or state as rake muck with a steamshovel it may be that their lofty disdain covers selfishness but i should be very sorry habitually to meet the fat gentlemen with shiny tophats and plump cigars in whose society i have been spending the evening  read about politics as the cultured writer of the magazine regards em and then and not till then pay your respects to the gentlemen who run the grimy reality  im sick of interviewing night editors who lean their chair against the wall and in response to my demand for the record of a prominent citizen answer well you see he began by keeping a saloon etc i prefer to believe that my informants are treating me as in the old sinful days in india i was used to treat the wandering globetrotter they declare that they speak the truth and the news of dog politics lately vouchsafed to me in groggeries inclines me to believe but i wont the people are much too nice to slangander as recklessly as i have been doing  besides i am hopelessly in love with about eight american maidensall perfectly delightful till the next one comes into the room  otoyo was a darling but she lacked several thingsconversation for one you cannot live on giggles she shall remain unmarried at nagasaki while i roast a battered heart before the shrine of a big kentucky blonde who had for a nurse when she was little a negro mammy  by consequence she has welded on california beauty paris dresses eastern culture europe trips and wild western originality the queer dreamy superstitions of the quarters and the result is soulshattering and she is but one of many stars  item a maiden who believes in education and possesses it with a few hundred thousand dollars to boot and a taste for slumming  item the leader of a sort of informal salon where girls congregate read papers and daringly discuss metaphysical problems and candya sloeeyed blackbrowed imperious maiden she  item a very small maiden absolutely without reverence who can in one swift sentence trample upon and leave gasping half a dozen young men  item a millionairess burdened with her money lonely caustic with a tongue keen as a sword yearning for a sphere but chained up to the rock of her vast possessions  item a typewriter maiden earning her own bread in this big city because she doesnt think a girl ought to be a burden on her parents who quotes theophile gautier and moves through the world manfully much respected for all her twenty inexperienced summers  item a woman from cloudland who has no history in the past or future but is discreetly of the present and strives for the confidences of male humanity on the grounds of sympathy methinks this is not altogether a new type  item a girl in a dive blessed with a greek head and eyes that seem to speak all that is best and sweetest in the world but woe is me she has no ideas in this world or the next beyond the consumption of beer a commission on each bottle and protests that she sings the songs allotted to her nightly without more than the vaguest notion of their meaning  sweet and comely are the maidens of devonshire delicate and of gracious seeming those who live in the pleasant places of london fascinating for all their demureness the damsels of france clinging closely to their mothers with large eyes wondering at the wicked world excellent in her own place and to those who understand her is the angloindian spin in her second season but the girls of america are above and beyond them all they are clever they can talkyea it is said that they think certainly they have an appearance of so doing which is delightfully deceptive  they are original and regard you between the brows with unabashed eyes as a sister might look at her brother they are instructed too in the folly and vanity of the male mind for they have associated with the boys from babyhood and can discerningly minister to both vices or pleasantly snub the possessor they possess moreover a life among themselves independent of any masculine associations they have societies and clubs and unlimited teafights where all the guests are girls they are selfpossessed without parting with any tenderness that is their sexright they understand they can take care of themselves they are superbly independent when you ask them what makes them so charming they sayit is because we are better educated than your girls andand we are more sensible in regard to men we have good times all round but we arent taught to regard every man as a possible husband nor is he expected to marry the first girl he calls on regularly  yes they have good times their freedom is large and they do not abuse it they can go driving with young men and receive visits from young men to an extent that would make an english mother wink with horror and neither driver nor drivee has a thought beyond the enjoyment of a good time as certain also of their own poets have said      man is fire and woman is tow      and the devil he comes and begins to blow  in america the tow is soaked in a solution that makes it fireproof in absolute liberty and large knowledge consequently accidents do not exceed the regular percentage arranged by the devil for each class and climate under the skies  but the freedom of the young girl has its drawbacks she isi say it with all reluctanceirreverent from her fortydollar bonnet to the buckles in her eighteendollar shoes she talks flippantly to her parents and men old enough to be her grandfather she has a prescriptive right to the society of the man who arrives the parents admit it  this is sometimes embarrassing especially when you call on a man and his wife for the sake of informationthe one being a merchant of varied knowledge the other a woman of the world in five minutes your host has vanished in another five his wife has followed him and you are left alone with a very charming maiden doubtless but certainly not the person you came to see she chatters and you grin but you leave with the very strong impression of a wasted morning this has been my experience once or twice i have even said as pointedly as i dared to a mani came to see you  youd better see me in my office then the house belongs to my women folkto my daughter that is to say  he spoke the truth the american of wealth is owned by his family they exploit him for bullion the women get the hapence the kicks are all his own nothing is too good for an americans daughter i speak here of the moneyed classes  the girls take every gift as a matter of course and yet they develop greatly when a catastrophe arrives and the man of many millions goes up or goes down and his daughters take to stenography or typewriting i have heard many tales of heroism from the lips of girls who counted the principals among their friends the crash came mamie or hattie or sadie gave up their maid their carriages and candy and with a no 2 remington and a stout heart set about earning their daily bread  and did i drop her from the list of my friends no sir said a scarletlipped vision in white lace that might happen to us any day  it may be this sense of possible disaster in the air that makes san francisco society go with so captivating a rush and whirl recklessness is in the air i cant explain where it comes from but there it is the roaring winds of the pacific make you drunk to begin with the aggressive luxury on all sides helps out the intoxication and you spin forever down the ringing grooves of change there is no small change by the way west of the rockies as long as money lasts they make greatly and they spend lavishly not only the rich but the artisans who pay nearly five pounds for a suit of clothes and for other luxuries in proportion  the young men rejoice in the days of their youth they gamble yacht race enjoy prizefights and cockfights the one openly the other in secret they establish luxurious clubs they break themselves over horseflesh and other things and they are instant in a quarrel at twenty they are experienced in business embark in vast enterprises take partners as experienced as themselves and go to pieces with as much splendor as their neighbors remember that the men who stocked california in the fifties were physically and as far as regards certain tough virtues the pick of the earth the inept and the weakly died en route or went under in the days of construction to this nucleus were added all the races of the continentfrench italian german and of course the jew  the result you can see in the largeboned deepchested delicatehanded women and long elastic wellbuilt boys it needs no little golden badge swinging from the watchchain to mark the native son of the golden west the countrybred of california  him i love because he is devoid of fear carries himself like a man and has a heart as big as his books i fancy too he knows how to enjoy the blessings of life that his province so abundantly bestows upon him at least i heard a little rat of a creature with hockbottle shoulders explaining that a man from chicago could pull the eyeteeth of a californian in business  well if i lived in fairyland where cherries were as big as plums plums as big as apples and strawberries of no account where the procession of the fruits of the seasons was like a pageant in a drury lane pantomime and the dry air was wine i should let business slide once in a way and kick up my heels with my fellows the tale of the resources of californiavegetable and mineralis a fairytale you can read it in books you would never believe me  all manner of nourishing food from seafish to beef may be bought at the lowest prices and the people are consequently welldeveloped and of a high stomach they demand ten shillings for tinkering a jammed lock of a trunk they receive sixteen shillings a day for working as carpenters they spend many sixpences on very bad cigars which the poorest of them smoke and they go mad over a prizefight when they disagree they do so fatally with firearms in their hands and on the public streets i was just clear of mission street when the trouble began between two gentlemen one of whom perforated the other  when a policeman whose name i do not recollect fatally shot ed hearney for attempting to escape arrest i was in the next street for these things i am thankful it is enough to travel with a policeman in a tramcar and while he arranges his coattails as he sits down to catch sight of a loaded revolver it is enough to know that fifty per cent of the men in the public saloons carry pistols about them  the chinaman waylays his adversary and methodically chops him to pieces with his hatchet then the press roars about the brutal ferocity of the pagan  the italian reconstructs his friend with a long knife the press complains of the waywardness of the alien  the irishman and the native californian in their hours of discontent use the revolver not once but six times the press records the fact and asks in the next column whether the world can parallel the progress of san francisco the american who loves his country will tell you that this sort of thing is confined to the lower classes just at present an exjudge who was sent to jail by another judge upon my word i cannot tell whether these titles mean anything is breathing redhot vengeance against his enemy the papers have interviewed both parties and confidently expect a fatal issue  now let me draw breath and curse the negro waiter and through him the negro in service generally he has been made a citizen with a vote consequently both political parties play with him but that is neither here nor there he will commit in one meal every betise that a senllion fresh from the plowtail is capable of and he will continue to repeat those faults he is as complete a heavyfooted uncomprehending bunglefisted fool as any memsahib in the east ever took into her establishment but he is according to law a free and independent citizenconsequently above reproof or criticism he and he alone in this insane city will wait at table the chinaman doesnt count  he is untrained inept but he will fill the place and draw the pay now god and his fathers fate made him intellectually inferior to the oriental he insists on pretending that he serves tables by accidentas a sort of amusement he wishes you to understand this little fact you wish to eat your meals and if possible to have them properly served he is a big black vain baby and a man rolled into one  a colored gentleman who insisted on getting me pie when i wanted something else demanded information about india i gave him some facts about wages  oh hell said he cheerfully that wouldnt keep me in cigars for a month  then he fawned on me for a tencent piece later he took it upon himself to pity the natives of india heathens he called themthis woolly one whose race has been the butt of every comedy on the native stage since the beginning and i turned and saw by the head upon his shoulders that he was a yoruba man if there be any truth in ethnological castes he did his thinking in english but he was a yoruba negro and the race type had remained the same throughout his generations and the room was full of other racessome that looked exactly like gallas but the trade was never recruited from that side of africa some duplicates of cameroon heads and some kroomen if ever kroomen wore evening dress  the american does not consider little matters of descent though by this time he ought to know all about damnable heredity as a general rule he keeps himself very far from the negro and says things about him that are not pretty there are six million negroes more or less in the states and they are increasing the american once having made them citizens cannot unmake them he says in his newspapers they ought to be elevated by education he is trying this but it is likely to be a long job because black blood is much more adhesive than white and throws back with annoying persistence when the negro gets religion he returns directly as a hiving bee to the first instincts of his people just now a wave of religion is sweeping over some of the southern states  up to the present two messiahs and a daniel have appeared and several human sacrifices have been offered up to these incarnations the daniel managed to get three young men who he insisted were shadrach meshach and abednego to walk into a blast furnace guaranteeing noncombustion they did not return i have seen nothing of this kind but i have attended a negro church they pray or are caused to pray by themselves in this country the congregation were moved by the spirit to groans and tears and one of them danced up the aisle to the mourners bench the motive may have been genuine the movements of the shaken body were those of a zanzibar stick dance such as you see at aden on the coalboats and even as i watched the people the links that bound them to the white man snapped one by one and i saw before me the hubshi woolly hair praying to a god he did not understand those neatly dressed folk on the benches and the grayheaded elder by the window were savages neither more nor less  what will the american do with the negro the south will not consort with him in some states miscegenation is a penal offence the north is every year less and less in need of his services  and he will not disappear he will continue as a problem his friends will urge that he is as good as the white man his enemieswell you can guess what his enemies will do from a little incident that followed on a recent appointment by the president he made a negro an assistant in a postoffice wherethink of ithe had to work at the next desk to a white girl the daughter of a colonel one of the first families of georgias modern chivalry and all the weary weary rest of it the southern chivalry howled and hanged or burned some one in effigy perhaps it was the president and perhaps it was the negrobut the principle remains the same they said it was an insult it is not good to be a negro in the land of the free and the home of the brave  but this is nothing to do with san francisco and her merry maidens her strong swaggering men and her wealth of gold and pride they bore me to a banquet in honor of a brave lieutenantcarlin of the vandaliawho stuck by his ship in the great cyclone at apia and comported himself as an officer should on that occasiontwas at the bohemian clubi heard oratory with the roundest of os and devoured a dinner the memory of which will descend with me into the hungry grave  there were about forty speeches delivered and not one of them was average or ordinary it was my first introduction to the american eagle screaming for all it was worth the lieutenants heroism served as a peg from which the silvertongued ones turned themselves loose and kicked  they ransacked the clouds of sunset the thunderbolts of heaven the deeps of hell and the splendor of the resurrection for tropes and metaphors and hurled the result at the head of the guest of the evening  never since the morning stars sung together for joy i learned had an amazed creation witnessed such superhuman bravery as that displayed by the american navy in the samoa cyclone till earth rotted in the phosphorescent starandstripe slime of a decayed universe that godlike gallantry would not be forgotten i grieve that i cannot give the exact words my attempt at reproducing their spirit is pale and inadequate i sat bewildered on a coruscating niagara of blatherumskite it was magnificentit was stupendousand i was conscious of a wicked desire to hide my face in a napkin and grin then according to rule they produced their dead and across the snowy tablecloths dragged the corpse of every man slain in the civil war and hurled defiance at our natural enemy england so please you with her chain of fortresses across the world thereafter they glorified their nation afresh from the beginning in case any detail should have been overlooked and that made me uncomfortable for their sakes how in the world can a white man a sahib of our blood stand up and plaster praise on his own country he can think as highly as he likes but this openmouthed vehemence of adoration struck me almost as indelicate my hosts talked for rather more than three hours and at the end seemed ready for three hours more  but when the lieutenantsuch a big brave gentle giantrose to his feet he delivered what seemed to me as the speech of the evening i remember nearly the whole of it and it ran something in this waygentlemenits very good of you to give me this dinner and to tell me all these prettythings but what i want you to understandthe fact is what we want and what we ought to get at once is a navymore shipslots of em  then we howled the top of the roof off and i for one fell in love with carlin on the spot wallah he was a man  the prince among merchants bid me take no heed to the warlike sentiments of some of the old generals  the skyrockets are thrown in for effect quoth he and whenever we get on our hind legs we always express a desire to chaw up england its a sort of family affair  and indeed when you come to think of it there is no other country for the american public speaker to trample upon  france has germany we have russia for italy austria is provided and the humblest pathan possesses an ancestral enemy  only america stands out of the racket and therefore to be in fashion makes a sandbag of the mother country and hangs her when occasion requires  the chain of fortresses man a fascinating talker explained to me after the affair that he was compelled to blow off steam everybody expected it  when we had chanted the star spangled banner not more than eight times we adjourned america is a very great country but it is not yet heaven with electric lights and plush fittings as the speakers professed to believe my listening mind went back to the politicians in the saloon who wasted no time in talking about freedom but quietly made arrangements to impose their will on the citizens  the judge is a great man but give thy presents to the clerk as the proverb saith  and what more remains to tell i cannot write connectedly because i am in love with all those girls aforesaid and some others who do not appear in the invoice the typewriter is an institution of which the comic papers make much capital but she is vastly convenient she and a companion rent a room in a business quarter and aided by a typewriting machine copy mss at the rate of six annas a page only a woman can operate a typewriting machine because she has served apprenticeship to the sewing machine she can earn as much as one hundred dollars a month and professes to regard this form of breadwinning as her natural destiny but oh how she hates it in her heart of hearts when i had got over the surprise of doing business with and trying to give orders to a young woman of coldly clerkly aspect intrenched behind goldrimmed spectacles i made inquiries concerning the pleasures of this independence they liked itindeed they did twas the natural fate of almost all girlsthe recognized custom in americaand i was a barbarian not to see it in that light  well and after said i what happens  we work for our bread  and then what do you expect  then we shall work for our bread  till you die  yeesunless  unless what this is your business you know a man works until he dies  so shall wethis without enthusiasmi suppose  said the partner in the firm audaciouslysometimes we marry our employeesat least thats what the newspapers say  the hand banged on half a dozen of the keys of the machine at once yet i dont care i hate iti hate iti hate itand you neednt look so  the senior partner was regarding the rebel with graveeyed reproach  i thought you did said i i dont suppose american girls are much different from english ones in instinct  isnt it theophile gautier who says that the only difference between country and country lie in the slang and the uniform of the police  now in the name of all the gods at once what is one to say to a young lady who in england would be a person who earns her own bread and very naturally hates the employ and slings outoftheway quotations at your head that one falls in love with her goes without saying but that is not enough  a mission should be established     iii american salmon  the race is neither to the swift nor the battle to the strong but time and chance cometh to all  i have lived  the american continent may now sink under the sea for i have taken the best that it yields and the best was neither dollars love nor real estate  hear now gentlemen of the punjab fishing club who whip the reaches of the tavi and you who painfully import trout over to octamund and i will tell you how old man california and i went fishing and you shall envy  we returned from the dalles to portland by the way we had come the steamer stopping en route to pick up a nights catch of one of the salmon wheels on the river and to deliver it at a cannery downstream  when the proprietor of the wheel announced that his take was two thousand two hundred and thirty pounds weight of fish and not a heavy catch neither i thought he lied but he sent the boxes aboard and i counted the salmon by the hundredhuge fiftypounders hardly dead scores of twenty and thirty pounders and a host of smaller fish they were all chenook salmon as distinguished from the steel head and the silver side that is to say they were royal salmon and california and i dropped a tear over them as monarchs who deserved a better fate but the lust of slaughter entered into our souls and we talked fish and forgot the mountain scenery that had so moved us a day before  the steamer halted at a rude wooden warehouse built on piles in a lonely reach of the river and sent in the fish i followed them up a scalestrewn fishy incline that led to the cannery the crazy building was quivering with the machinery on its floors and a glittering bank of tin scraps twenty feet high showed where the waste was thrown after the cans had been punched  only chinamen were employed on the work and they looked like bloodbesmeared yellow devils as they crossed the rifts of sunlight that lay upon the floor when our consignment arrived the rough wooden boxes broke of themselves as they were dumped down under a jet of water and the salmon burst out in a stream of quicksilver a chinaman jerked up a twentypounder beheaded and detailed it with two swift strokes of a knife flicked out its internal arrangements with a third and case it into a blooddyed tank the headless fish leaped from under his hands as though they were facing a rapid other chinamen pulled them from the vat and thrust them under a thing like a chaffcutter which descending hewed them into unseemly red gobbets fit for the can  more chinamen with yellow crooked fingers jammed the stuff into the cans which slid down some marvellous machine forthwith soldering their own tops as they passed each can was hastily tested for flaws and then sunk with a hundred companions into a vat of boiling water there to be half cooked for a few minutes the cans bulged slightly after the operation and were therefore slidden along by the trolleyful to men with needles and solderingirons who vented them and soldered the aperture except for the label the finest columbia salmon was ready for the market i was impressed not so much with the speed of the manufacture as the character of the factory inside on a floor ninety by forty the most civilized and murderous of machinery outside three footsteps the thickgrowing pines and the immense solitude of the hills our steamer only stayed twenty minutes at that place but i counted two hundred and forty finished cans made from the catch of the previous night ere i left the slippery bloodstained scalespangled oily floors and the offalsmeared chinamen  we reached portland california and i crying for salmon and a realestate man to whom we had been intrusted by an insurance man met us in the street saying that fifteen miles away across country we should come upon a place called clackamas where we might perchance find what we desired and california his coattails flying in the wind ran to a liverystable and chartered a wagon and team forthwith i could push the wagon about with one hand so light was its structure the team was purely americanthat is to say almost human in its intelligence and docility some one said that the roads were not good on the way to clackamas and warned us against smashing the springs portland who had watched the preparations finally reckoned hed come along too and under heavenly skies we three companions of a day set forth california carefully lashing our rods into the carriage and the bystanders overwhelming us with directions as to the sawmills we were to pass the ferries we were to cross and the signposts we were to seek signs from half a mile from this city of fifty thousand souls we struck and this must be taken literally a plank road that would have been a disgrace to an irish village  then six miles of macadamized road showed us that the team could move a railway ran between us and the banks of the willamette and another above us through the mountains all the land was dotted with small townships and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons bunches of towhaired boggleeyed urchins sitting in the hay behind the men generally looked like loafers but their women were all well dressed  brown braiding on a tailormade jacket does not however consort with haywagons then we struck into the woods along what california called a camina realea good roadand portland a fair track it wound in and out among fireblackened stumps under pinetrees along the corners of log fences through hollows which must be hopeless marsh in the winter and up absurd gradients but nowhere throughout its length did i see any evidence of roadmaking there was a trackyou couldnt well get off it and it was all you could do to stay on it the dust lay a foot thick in the blind ruts and under the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into the air the journey in itself was a delight sometimes we crashed through bracken anon where the blackberries grew rankest we found a lonely little cemetery the wooden rails all awry and the pitiful stumpy headstones nodding drunkenly at the soft green mullions then with oaths and the sound of rent underwood a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a skid road hauling a fortyfoot log along a rudely made slide  a valley full of wheat and cherrytrees succeeded and halting at a house we bought tenpound weight of luscious black cherries for something less than a rupee and got a drink of icycold water for nothing while the untended team browsed sagaciously by the roadside once we found a wayside camp of horsedealers lounging by a pool ready for a sale or a swap and once two suntanned youngsters shot down a hill on indian ponies their full creels banging from the highpommelled saddle they had been fishing and were our brethren therefore we shouted aloud in chorus to scare a wild cat we squabbled over the reasons that had led a snake to cross a road we heaved bits of bark at a venturesome chipmunk who was really the little gray squirrel of india and had come to call on me we lost our way and got the wagon so beautifully fixed on a khudbound road that we had to tie the two hind wheels to get it down  above all california told tales of nevada and arizona of lonely nights spent out prospecting the slaughter of deer and the chase of men of womanlovely womanwho is a firebrand in a western city and leads to the popping of pistols and of the sudden changes and chances of fortune who delights in making the miner or the lumberman a quadruplicate millionaire and in busting the railroad king  that was a day to be remembered and it had only begun when we drew rein at a tiny farmhouse on the banks of the clackamas and sought horse feed and lodging ere we hastened to the river that broke over a weir not a quarter of a mile away imagine a stream seventy yards broad divided by a pebbly island running over seductive riffles and swirling into deep quiet pools where the good salmon goes to smoke his pipe after meals get such a stream amid fields of breasthigh crops surrounded by hills of pines throw in where you please quiet water longfenced meadows and a hundredfoot bluff just to keep the scenery from growing too monotonous and you will get some faint notion of the clackamas the weir had been erected to pen the chenook salmon from going further upstream we could see them twenty or thirty pounds by the score in the deep pools or flying madly against the weir and foolishly skinning their noses they were not our prey for they would not rise at a fly and we knew it all the same when one made his leap against the weir and landed on the footplank with a jar that shook the board i was standing on i would fain have claimed him for my own capture  portland had no rod he held the gaff and the whiskey california sniffed upstream and downstream across the racing water chose his ground and let the gaudy fly drop in the tail of a riffle i was getting my rod together when i heard the joyous shriek of the reel and the yells of california and three feet of living silver leaped into the air far across the water the forces were engaged  the salmon tore upstream the tense line cutting the water like a tiderip behind him and the light bamboo bowed to breaking what happened thereafter i cannot tell california swore and prayed and portland shouted advice and i did all three for what appeared to be half a day but was in reality a little over a quarter of an hour and sullenly our fish came home with spurts of temper dashes head on and sarabands in the air but home to the bank came he and the remorseless reel gathered up the thread of his life inch by inch we landed him in a little bay and the spring weight in his gorgeous gills checked at eleven and one half pounds eleven and one half pounds of fighting salmon we danced a wardance on the pebbles and california caught me round the waist in a hug that went near to breaking my ribs while he shoutedpartner partner this is glory now you catch your fish twentyfour years ive waited for this  i went into that icycold river and made my cast just above the weir and all but foulhooked a blueandblack watersnake with a coral mouth who coiled herself on a stone and hissed maledictions  the next castah the pride of it the regal splendor of it the thrill that ran down from fingertip to toe then the water boiled he broke for the fly and got it there remained enough sense in me to give him all he wanted when he jumped not once but twenty times before the upstream flight that ran my line out to the last halfdozen turns and i saw the nickelled reelbar glitter under the thinning green coils my thumb was burned deep when i strove to stopper the line  i did not feel it till later for my soul was out in the dancing weir praying for him to turn ere he took my tackle away and the prayer was heard as i bowed back the butt of the rod on my left hipbone and the top joint dipping like unto a weeping willow he turned and accepted each inch of slack that i could by any means get in as a favor from on high there lie several sorts of success in this world that taste well in the moment of enjoyment but i question whether the stealthy theft of line from an ablebodied salmon who knows exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it is not sweeter than any other victory within human scope like californias fish he ran at me head on and leaped against the line but the lord gave me two hundred and fifty pairs of fingers in that hour the banks and the pinetrees danced dizzily round me but i only reeledreeled as for lifereeled for hours and at the end of the reeling continued to give him the butt while he sulked in a pool california was further up the reach and with the corner of my eye i could see him casting with long casts and much skill then he struck and my fish broke for the weir in the same instant and down the reach we came california and i reel answering reel even as the morning stars sing together  the first wild enthusiasm of capture had died away we were both at work now in deadly earnest to prevent the lines fouling to stall off a downstream rush for shaggy water just above the weir and at the same time to get the fish into the shallow bay downstream that gave the best practicable landing portland bid us both be of good heart and volunteered to take the rod from my hands  i would rather have died among the pebbles than surrender my right to play and land a salmon weight unknown with an eightounce rod i heard california at my ear it seemed gasping hes a fighter from fightersville sure as his fish made a fresh break across the stream i saw portland fall off a log fence break the overhanging bank and clatter down to the pebbles all sand and landingnet and i dropped on a log to rest for a moment as i drew breath the weary hands slackened their hold and i forgot to give him the butt  a wild scutter in the water a plunge and a break for the headwaters of the clackamas was my reward and the weary toil of reeling in with one eye under the water and the other on the top joint of the rod was renewed worst of all i was blocking californias path to the little landing bay aforesaid and he had to halt and tire his prize where he was  the father of all the salmon he shouted for the love of heaven get your trout to bank johnny bull  but i could do no more even the insult failed to move me the rest of the game was with the salmon he suffered himself to be drawn skipping with pretended delight at getting to the haven where i would fain bring him yet no sooner did he feel shoal water under his ponderous belly than he backed like a torpedoboat and the snarl of the reel told me that my labor was in vain a dozen times at least this happened ere the line hinted he had given up the battle and would be towed in he was towed the landingnet was useless for one of his size and i would not have him gaffed i stepped into the shallows and heaved him out with a respectful hand under the gill for which kindness he battered me about the legs with his tail and i felt the strength of him and was proud california had taken my place in the shallows his fish hard held i was up the bank lying full length on the sweetscented grass and gasping in company with my first salmon caught played and landed on an eightounce rod my hands were cut and bleeding i was dripping with sweat spangled like a harlequin with scales water from my waist down nose peeled by the sun but utterly supremely and consummately happy  the beauty the darling the daisy my salmon bahadur weighed twelve pounds and i had been sevenandthirty minutes bringing him to bank he had been lightly hooked on the angle of the right jaw and the hook had not wearied him that hour i sat among princes and crowned heads greater than them all below the bank we heard california scuffling with his salmon and swearing spanish oaths portland and i assisted at the capture and the fish dragged the spring balance out by the roots it was only constructed to weigh up to fifteen pounds we stretched the three fish on the grassthe eleven and a half the twelve and fifteen pounderand we gave an oath that all who came after should merely be weighed and put back again  how shall i tell the glories of that day so that you may be interested again and again did california and i prance down that reach to the little bay each with a salmon in tow and land him in the shallows then portland took my rod and caught some tenpounders and my spoon was carried away by an unknown leviathan each fish for the merits of the three that had died so gamely was hastily hooked on the balance and flung back portland recorded the weight in a pocketbook for he was a realestate man each fish fought for all he was worth and none more savagely than the smallest a game little sixpounder at the end of six hours we added up the list read it total sixteen fish aggregate weight one hundred and forty pounds the score in detail runs something like thisit is only interesting to those concerned fifteen eleven and a half twelve ten nine and three quarters eight and so forth as i have said nothing under six pounds and three tenpounders  very solemnly and thankfully we put up our rodsit was glory enough for all timeand returned weeping in each others arms weeping tears of pure joy to that simple barelegged family in the packingcase house by the waterside  the old farmer recollected days and nights of fierce warfare with the indians way back in the fifties when every ripple of the columbia river and her tributaries hid covert danger god had dowered him with a queer crooked gift of expression and a fierce anxiety for the welfare of his two little sonstanned and reserved children who attended school daily and spoke good english in a strange tongue  his wife was an austere woman who had once been kindly and perhaps handsome  very many years of toil had taken the elasticity out of step and voice she looked for nothing better than everlasting workthe chafing detail of houseworkand then a grave somewhere up the hill among the blackberries and the pines  but in her grim way she sympathized with her eldest daughter a small and silent maiden of eighteen who had thoughts very far from the meals she tended and the pans she scoured  we stumbled into the household at a crisis and there was a deal of downright humanity in that same a bad wicked dressmaker had promised the maiden a dress in time for a tomorrows railway journey and though the barefooted georgy who stood in very wholesome awe of his sister had scoured the woods on a pony in search that dress never arrived so with sorrow in her heart and a hundred sisteranne glances up the road she waited upon the strangers and i doubt not cursed them for the wants that stood between her and her need for tears it was a genuine little tragedy the mother in a heavy passionless voice rebuked her impatience yet sat up far into the night bowed over a heap of sewing for the daughters benefit  these things i beheld in the long marigoldscented twilight and whispering night loafing round the little house with california who unfolded himself like a lotus to the moon or in the little boarded bunk that was our bedroom swapping tales with portland and the old man  most of the yarns began in this wayred larry was a bullpuncher back of lone county montana or there was a man riding the trail met a jackrabbit sitting in a cactus or bout the time of the san diego land boom a woman from monterey etc  you can try to piece out for yourselves what sort of stories they were     iv the yellowstone  once upon a time there was a carter who brought his team and a friend into the yellowstone park without due thought presently they came upon a few of the natural beauties of the place and that carter turned his team into his friends team howlingget out o this jim all hells alight under our noses  and they called the place hells halfacre to this day to witness if the carter lied  we too the old lady from chicago her husband tom and the good little mares came to hells halfacre which is about sixty acres in extent and when tom saidwould you like to drive over it  we saidcertainly not and if you do we shall report you to the park authorities  there was a plain blistered peeled and abominable and it was given over to the sportings and spoutings of devils who threw mud and steam and dirt at each other with whoops and halloos and bellowing curses  the places smelled of the refuse of the pit and that odor mixed with the clean wholesome aroma of the pines in our nostrils throughout the day  this yellowstone park is laid out like ollendorf in exercises of progressive difficulty hells halfacre was a prelude to ten or twelve miles of geyser formation  we passed hot streams boiling in the forest saw whiffs of steam beyond these and yet other whiffs breaking through the misty green hills in the far distance we trampled on sulphur in crystals and sniffed things much worse than any sulphur which is known to the upper world and so journeying bewildered with the novelty came upon a really parklike place where tom suggested we should get out and play with the geysers on foot  imagine mighty green fields splattered with limebeds all the flowers of the summer growing up to the very edge of the lime that was our first glimpse of the geyser basins  the buggy had pulled up close to a rough broken blistered cone of spelter stuff between ten and twenty feet high there was trouble in that placemoaning splashing gurgling and the clank of machinery a spurt of boiling water jumped into the air and a wash of water followed  i removed swiftly the old lady from chicago shrieked what a wicked waste said her husband  i think they call it the riverside geyser its spout was torn and ragged like the mouth of a gun when a shell has burst there it grumbled madly for a moment or two and then was still i crept over the steaming limeit was the burning marl on which satan layand looked fearfully down its mouth you should never look a gift geyser in the mouth  i beheld a horrible slippery slimy funnel with water rising and falling ten feet at a time then the water rose to lip level with a rush and an infernal bubbling troubled this devils bethesda before the sullen heave of the crest of a wave lapped over the edge and made me run  mark the nature of the human soul i had begun with awe not to say terror for this was my first experience of such things i stepped back from the banks of the riverside geyser sayingpooh is that all it can do  yet for aught i knew the whole thing might have blown up at a minutes notice she he or it being an arrangement of uncertain temper  we drifted on up that miraculous valley on either side of us were hills from a thousand or fifteen hundred feet high wooded from crest to heel as far as the eye could range forward were columns of steam in the air misshapen lumps of lime mistlike preadamite monsters still pools of turquoiseblue stretches of blue cornflowers a river that coiled on itself twenty times pointed bowlders of strange colors and ridges of glaring staring white  a moonfaced trooper of german extractionnever was park so carefully patrolledcame up to inform us that as yet we had not seen any of the real geysers that they were all a mile or so up the valley and tastefully scattered round the hotel in which we would rest for the night  america is a free country but the citizens look down on the soldier i had to entertain that trooper the old lady from chicago would have none of him so we loafed alone together now across halfrotten pine logs sunk in swampy ground anon over the ringing geyser formation then pounding through riversand or brushing kneedeep through long grass  and why did you enlist said i  the moonfaced ones face began to work i thought he would have a fit but he told me a story insteadsuch a nice tale of a naughty little girl who wrote pretty love letters to two men at once she was a simple village wife but a wicked family novelette countess couldnt have accomplished her ends better she drove one man nearly wild with the pretty little treachery and the other man abandoned her and came west to forget the trickery  moonface was that man  we rounded and limped over a low spur of hill and came out upon a field of aching snowy lime rolled in sheets twisted into knots riven with rents and diamonds and stars stretching for more than half a mile in every direction  on this place of despair lay most of the big bad geysers who know when there is trouble in krakatoa who tell the pines when there is a cyclone on the atlantic seaboard and who are exhibited to visitors under pretty and fanciful names  the first mound that i encountered belonged to a goblin who was splashing in his tub  i heard him kick pull a showerbath on his shoulders gasp crack his joints and rub himself down with a towel then he let the water out of the bath as a thoughtful man should and it all sunk down out of sight till another goblin arrived  so we looked and we wondered at the beehive whose mouth is built up exactly like a hive at the turban which is not in the least like a turban and at many many other geysers hot holes and springs some of them rumbled some hissed some went off spasmodically and others lay dead still in sheets of sapphire and beryl  would you believe that even these terrible creatures have to be guarded by the troopers to prevent the irreverent americans from chipping the cones to pieces or worse still making the geyser sick if you take a small barrel full of softsoap and drop it down a geysers mouth that geyser will presently be forced to lay all before you and for days afterward will be of an irritated and inconstant stomach  when they told me the tale i was filled with sympathy now i wish that i had softsoap and tried the experiment on some lonely little beast far away in the woods it sounds so probable and so human  yet he would be a bold man who would administer emetics to the giantess she is flatlipped having no mouth she looks like a pool fifty feet long and thirty wide and there is no ornamentation about her at irregular intervals she speaks and sends up a volume of water over two hundred feet high to begin with then she is angry for a day and a halfsometimes for two days  owing to her peculiarity of going mad in the night not many people have seen the giantess at her finest but the clamor of her unrest men say shakes the wooden hotel and echoes like thunder among the hills  the congregation returned to the hotel to put down their impressions in diaries and notebooks which they wrote up ostentatiously in the verandas it was a sweltering hot day albeit we stood somewhat higher than the level of simla and i left that raw pine creaking caravansary for the cool shade of a clump of pines between whose trunks glimmered tents  a batch of united states troopers came down the road and flung themselves across the country into their rough lines the mexican cavalryman can ride though he keeps his accoutrements pigfashion and his horse cowfashion  i was free of that camp in five minutesfree to play with the heavy lumpy carbines have the saddles stripped and punch the horses knowingly in the ribs one of the men had been in the fight with wrapuphistail and he told me how that great chief his horses tail tied up in red calico swaggered in front of the united states cavalry challenging all to single combat but he was slain and a few of his tribe with him  theres no use in an indian anyway concluded my friend  a couple of cowboysreal cowboysjingled through the camp amid a shower of mild chaff they were on their way to cook city i fancy and i know that they never washed but they were picturesque ruffians exceedingly with long spurs hooded stirrups slouch hats fur weathercloth over their knees and pistolbutts just easy to hand  the cowboys goin under before long said my friend soon as the countrys settled up hell have to go but hes mighty useful now what would we do without the cowboy  as how said i and the camp laughed  he has the money we have the skill he comes in winter to play poker at the military posts we play pokera few when hes lost his money we make him drunk and let him go sometimes we get the wrong man  and he told me a tale of an innocent cowboy who turned up cleaned out at an army post and played poker for thirtysix hours but it was the post that was cleaned out when that longhaired caucasian removed himself heavy with everybodys pay and declining the proffered liquor  noaw said the historian i dont play with no cowboy unless hes a little bit drunk first  ere i departed i gathered from more than one man the significant fact that up to one hundred yards he felt absolutely secure behind his revolver  in england i understand quoth the limber youth from the southin england a man isnt allowed to play with no firearms hes got to be taught all that when he enlists i didnt want much teaching how to shoot straight fore i served uncle sam and thats just where it is but you was talking about your horse guards now  i explained briefly some peculiarities of equipment connected with our crackest crack cavalry i grieve to say the camp roared  take em over swampy ground let em run around a bit an work the starch out of em an then almighty if we wouldnt plug em at ease id eat their horses  there was a maidena very little maidenwho had just stepped out of one of jamess novels she owned a delightful mother and an equally delightful fathera heavyeyed slowvoiced man of finance the parents thought that their daughter wanted change  she lived in new hampshire accordingly she had dragged them up to alaska and to the yosemite valley and was now returning leisurely via the yellowstone just in time for the tailend of the summer season at saratoga  we had met once or twice before in the park and i had been amazed and amused at her critical commendation of the wonders that she saw from that very resolute little mouth i received a lecture on american literature the nature and inwardness of washington society the precise value of cables works as compared with uncle remus harris and a few other things that had nothing whatever to do with geysers but were altogether pleasant  now an english maiden who had stumbled on a dustgrimed limewashed sunpeeled collarless wanderer come from and going to goodness knows where would her mother inciting her and her father brandishing an umbrella have regarded him as a dissolute adventurera person to be disregarded  not so those delightful people from new hampshire they were good enough to treat himit sounds almost incredibleas a human being possibly respectable probably not in immediate need of financial assistance  papa talked pleasantly and to the point  the little maiden strove valiantly with the accent of her birth and that of her rearing and mamma smiled benignly in the background  balance this with a story of a young english idiot i met mooning about inside his high collar attended by a valet he condescended to tell me that you cant be too careful who you talk to in these parts and stalked on fearing i suppose every minute for his social chastity  that man was a barbarian i took occasion to tell him so for he comported himself after the manner of the headhunters and hunted of assam who are at perpetual feud one with another  you will understand that these foolish stories are introduced in order to cover the fact that this pen cannot describe the glories of the upper geyser basin the evening i spent under the lee of the castle geyser sitting on a log with some troopers and watching a baronial keep forty feet high spouting hot water if the castle went off first they said the giantess would be quiet and vice versa and then they told tales till the moon got up and a party of campers in the woods gave us all something to eat  then came soft turfy forest that deadened the wheels and two troopers on detachment duty stole noiselessly behind us one was the wrapuphistail man and they talked merrily while the halfbroken horses bucked about among the trees and so a cavalry escort was with us for a mile till we got to a mighty hill strewn with moss agates and everybody had to jump out and pant in that thin air but how intoxicating it was the old lady from chicago ducked like an emancipated hen as she scuttled about the road cramming pieces of rock into her reticule she sent me fifty yards down to the hillside to pick up a piece of broken bottle which she insisted was moss agate  ive some o that at home an they shine yes you go get it young man  as we climbed the long path the road grew viler and viler till it became without disguise the bed of a torrent and just when things were at their rockiest we nearly fell into a little sapphire lakebut never sapphire was so bluecalled marys lake and that between eight and nine thousand feet above the sea  afterward grass downs all on a vehement slope so that the buggy following the newmade road ran on the two offwheels mostly till we dipped headfirst into a ford climbed up a cliff raced along down dipped again and pulled up dishevelled at larrys for lunch and an hours rest  then we lay on the grass and laughed with sheer bliss of being alive this have i known once in japan once on the banks of the columbia what time the salmon came in and california howled and once again in the yellowstone by the light of the eyes of the maiden from new hampshire four little pools lay at my elbow one was of black water tepid one clear water cold one clear water hot one red water boiling my newly washed handkerchief covered them all and we two marvelled as children marvel  this evening we shall do the grand canyon of the yellowstone said the maiden  together said i and she said yes  the sun was beginning to sink when we heard the roar of falling waters and came to a broad river along whose banks we ran and theni might at a pinch describe the infernal regions but not the other place the yellowstone river has occasion to run through a gorge about eight miles long to get to the bottom of the gorge it makes two leaps one of about one hundred and twenty and the other of three hundred feet i investigated the upper or lesser fall which is close to the hotel  up to that time nothing particular happens to the yellowstoneits banks being only rocky rather steep and plentifully adorned with pines  at the falls it comes round a corner green solid ribbed with a little foam and not more than thirty yards wide then it goes over still green and rather more solid than before after a minute or two you sitting upon a rock directly above the drop begin to understand that something has occurred that the river has jumped between solid cliff walls and that the gentle froth of water lapping the sides of the gorge below is really the outcome of great waves  and the river yells aloud but the cliffs do not allow the yells to escape  that inspection began with curiosity and finished in terror for it seemed that the whole world was sliding in chrysolite from under my feet i followed with the others round the corner to arrive at the brink of the canyon we had to climb up a nearly perpendicular ascent to begin with for the ground rises more than the river drops stately pine woods fringe either lip of the gorge which is the gorge of the yellowstone youll find all about it in the guide books  all that i can say is that without warning or preparation i looked into a gulf seventeen hundred feet deep with eagles and fishhawks circling far below and the sides of that gulf were one wild welter of colorcrimson emerald cobalt ochre amber honey splashed with port wine snow white vermilion lemon and silver gray in wide washes the sides did not fall sheer but were graven by time and water and air into monstrous heads of kings dead chiefsmen and women of the old time so far below that no sound of its strife could reach us the yellowstone river ran a fingerwide strip of jade green  the sunlight took those wondrous walls and gave fresh hues to those that nature had already laid there  evening crept through the pines that shadowed us but the full glory of the day flamed in that canyon as we went out very cautiously to a jutting piece of rockbloodred or pink it wasthat overhung the deepest deeps of all  now i know what it is to sit enthroned amid the clouds of sunset as the spirits sit in blakes pictures giddiness took away all sensation of touch or form but the sense of blinding color remained  when i reached the mainland again i had sworn that i had been floating  the maid from new hampshire said no word for a very long time then she quoted poetry which was perhaps the best thing she could have done  and to think that this showplace has been going on all these days an none of we ever saw it said the old lady from chicago with an acid glance at her husband  no only the injians said he unmoved and the maiden and i laughed  inspiration is fleeting beauty is vain and the power of the mind for wonder limited though the shining hosts themselves had risen choiring from the bottom of the gorge they would not have prevented her papa and one baser than he from rolling stones down those stupendous rainbowwashed slides seventeen hundred feet of steepest pitch and rather more than seventeen hundred colors for log or bowlder to whirl through  so we heaved things and saw them gather way and bound from white rock to red or yellow dragging behind them torrents of color till the noise of their descent ceased and they bounded a hundred yards clear at the last into the yellowstone  ive been down there said tom that evening its easy to get down if youre carefuljust sit an slide but getting up is worse an i found down below there two stones just marked with a picture of the canyon i wouldnt sell these rocks not for fifteen dollars  and papa and i crawled down to the yellowstonejust above the first little fallto wet a line for good luck the round moon came up and turned the cliffs and pines into silver and a twopound trout came up also and we slew him among the rocks nearly tumbling into that wild river                                              then out and away to livingstone once more the maiden from new hampshire disappeared papa and mamma with her disappeared too the old lady from chicago and the others     v chicago      i know thy cunning and thy greed      thy hard high lust and wilful deed      and all thy glory loves to tell      of specious gifts material  i have struck a citya real cityand they call it chicago  the other places do not count san francisco was a pleasureresort as well as a city and salt lake was a phenomenon  this place is the first american city i have encountered it holds rather more than a million of people with bodies and stands on the same sort of soil as calcutta having seen it i urgently desire never to see it again it is inhabited by savages its water is the water of the hooghly and its air is dirt also it says that it is the boss town of america  i do not believe that it has anything to do with this country they told me to go to the palmer house which is overmuch gilded and mirrored and there i found a huge hall of tessellated marble crammed with people talking about money and spitting about everywhere other barbarians charged in and out of this inferno with letters and telegrams in their hands and yet others shouted at each other a man who had drunk quite as much as was good for him told me that this was the finest hotel in the finest city on god almightys earth by the way when an american wishes to indicate the next country or state he says god amightys earth this prevents discussion and flatters his vanity  then i went out into the streets which are long and flat and without end and verily it is not a good thing to live in the east for any length of time your ideas grow to clash with those held by every rightthinking man i looked down interminable vistas flanked with nine ten and fifteenstoried houses and crowded with men and women and the show impressed me with a great horror  except in londonand i have forgotten what london was likei had never seen so many white people together and never such a collection of miserables there was no color in the street and no beautyonly a maze of wire ropes overhead and dirty stone flagging under foot  a cabdriver volunteered to show me the glory of the town for so much an hour and with him i wandered far he conceived that all this turmoil and squash was a thing to be reverently admired that it was good to huddle men together in fifteen layers one atop of the other and to dig holes in the ground for offices  he said that chicago was a live town and that all the creatures hurrying by me were engaged in business that is to say they were trying to make some money that they might not die through lack of food to put into their bellies he took me to canals as black as ink and filled with untold abominations and bid me watch the stream of traffic across the bridges  he then took me into a saloon and while i drank made me note that the floor was covered with coins sunk in cement a hottentot would not have been guilty of this sort of barbarism the coins made an effect pretty enough but the man who put them there had no thought of beauty and therefore he was a savage  then my cabdriver showed me business blocks gay with signs and studded with fantastic and absurd advertisements of goods and looking down the long street so adorned it was as though each vender stood at his door howlingfor the sake of my money employ or buy of me and me only  have you ever seen a crowd at a faminerelief distribution you know then how the men leap into the air stretching out their arms above the crowd in the hope of being seen while the women dolorously slap the stomachs of their children and whimper i had sooner watch famine relief than the white man engaged in what he calls legitimate competition the one i understand the other makes me ill  and the cabman said that these things were the proof of progress and by that i knew he had been reading his newspaper as every intelligent american should the papers tell their clientele in language fitted to their comprehension that the snarling together of telegraphwires the heaving up of houses and the making of money is progress  i spent ten hours in that huge wilderness wandering through scores of miles of these terrible streets and jostling some few hundred thousand of these terrible people who talked paisa bat through their noses  the cabman left me but after awhile i picked up another man who was full of figures and into my ears he poured them as occasion required or the big blank factories suggested here they turned out so many hundred thousand dollars worth of such and such an article there so many million other things this house was worth so many million dollars that one so many million more or less it was like listening to a child babbling of its hoard of shells it was like watching a fool playing with buttons but i was expected to do more than listen or watch he demanded that i should admire and the utmost that i could say wasare these things so then i am very sorry for you  that made him angry and he said that insular envy made me unresponsive so you see i could not make him understand  about four and a half hours after adam was turned out of the garden of eden he felt hungry and so bidding eve take care that her head was not broken by the descending fruit shinned up a cocoanutpalm that hurt his legs cut his breast and made him breathe heavily and eve was tormented with fear lest her lord should miss his footing and so bring the tragedy of this world to an end ere the curtain had fairly risen had i met adam then i should have been sorry for him today i find eleven hundred thousand of his sons just as far advanced as their father in the art of getting food and immeasurably inferior to him in that they think that their palmtrees lead straight to the skies consequently i am sorry in rather more than a million different ways  in the east bread comes naturally even to the poorest by a little scratching or the gift of a friend not quite so poor in less favored countries one is apt to forget then i went to bed and that was on a saturday night  sunday brought me the queerest experiences of alla revelation of barbarism complete i found a place that was officially described as a church it was a circus really but that the worshippers did not know there were flowers all about the building which was fitted up with plush and stained oak and much luxury including twisted brass candlesticks of severest gothic design  to these things and a congregation of savages entered suddenly a wonderful man completely in the confidence of their god whom he treated colloquially and exploited very much as a newspaper reporter would exploit a foreign potentate but unlike the newspaper reporter he never allowed his listeners to forget that he and not he was the centre of attraction with a voice of silver and with imagery borrowed from the auctionroom he built up for his hearers a heaven on the lines of the palmer house but with all the gilding real gold and all the plateglass diamond and set in the centre of it a loudvoiced argumentative very shrewd creation that he called god one sentence at this point caught my delighted ear it was apropos of some question of the judgment and ranno i tell you god doesnt do business that way  he was giving them a deity whom they could comprehend and a gold and jewelled heaven in which they could take a natural interest he interlarded his performance with the slang of the streets the counter and the exchange and he said that religion ought to enter into daily life consequently i presume he introduced it as daily lifehis own and the life of his friends  then i escaped before the blessing desiring no benediction at such hands but the persons who listened seemed to enjoy themselves and i understood that i had met with a popular preacher  later on when i had perused the sermons of a gentleman called talmage and some others i perceived that i had been listening to a very mild specimen yet that man with his brutal gold and silver idols his handsinpocket cigarinmouth and hatonthebackofthehead style of dealing with the sacred vessels would count himself spiritually quite competent to send a mission to convert the indians  all that sunday i listened to people who said that the mere fact of spiking down strips of iron to wood and getting a steam and iron thing to run along them was progress that the telephone was progress and the network of wires overhead was progress they repeated their statements again and again  one of them took me to their city hall and board of trade works and pointed it out with pride it was very ugly but very big and the streets in front of it were narrow and unclean when i saw the faces of the men who did business in that building i felt that there had been a mistake in their billeting  by the way tis a consolation to feel that i am not writing to an english audience then i should have to fall into feigned ecstasies over the marvellous progress of chicago since the days of the great fire to allude casually to the raising of the entire city so many feet above the level of the lake which it faces and generally to grovel before the golden calf but you who are desperately poor and therefore by these standards of no account know things will understand when i write that they have managed to get a million of men together on flat land and that the bulk of these men together appear to be lower than mahajans and not so companionable as a punjabi jat after harvest  but i dont think it was the blind hurry of the people their argot and their grand ignorance of things beyond their immediate interests that displeased me so much as a study of the daily papers of chicago  imprimis there was some sort of a dispute between new york and chicago as to which town should give an exhibition of products to be hereafter holden and through the medium of their more dignified journals the two cities were yahooing and hiyiing at each other like opposition newsboys they called it humor but it sounded like something quite different  that was only the first trouble the second lay in the tone of the productions leading articles which include gems such as back of such and such a place or we noticed tuesday such an event or dont for does not are things to be accepted with thankfulness all that made me want to cry was that in these papers were faithfully reproduced all the warcries and backtalk of the palmer house bar the slang of the barbershops the mental elevation and integrity of the pullman car porter the dignity of the dime museum and the accuracy of the excited fishwife i am sternly forbidden to believe that the paper educates the public then i am compelled to believe that the public educate the paper yet suicides on the press are rare  just when the sense of unreality and oppression was strongest upon me and when i most wanted help a man sat at my side and began to talk what he called politics  i had chanced to pay about six shillings for a travellingcap worth eighteenpence and he made of the fact a text for a sermon he said that this was a rich country and that the people liked to pay two hundred per cent on the value of a thing they could afford it he said that the government imposed a protective duty of from ten to seventy per cent on foreignmade articles and that the american manufacturer consequently could sell his goods for a healthy sum thus an imported hat would with duty cost two guineas the american manufacturer would make a hat for seventeen shillings and sell it for one pound fifteen in these things he said lay the greatness of america and the effeteness of england competition between factory and factory kept the prices down to decent limits but i was never to forget that this people were a rich people not like the pauper continentals and that they enjoyed paying duties  to my weak intellect this seemed rather like juggling with counters everything that i have yet purchased costs about twice as much as it would in england and when native made is of inferior quality  moreover since these lines were first thought of i have visited a gentleman who owned a factory which used to produce things he owned the factory still not a man was in it but he was drawing a handsome income from a syndicate of firms for keeping it closed in order that it might not produce things this man said that if protection were abandoned a tide of pauper labor would flood the country and as i looked at his factory i thought how entirely better it was to have no labor of any kind whatever rather than face so horrible a future  meantime do you remember that this peculiar country enjoys paying money for value not received i am an alien and for the life of me i cannot see why six shillings should be paid for eighteenpenny caps or eight shillings for halfcrown cigarcases when the country fills up to a decently populated level a few million people who are not aliens will be smitten with the same sort of blindness  but my friends assertion somehow thoroughly suited the grotesque ferocity of chicago  see now and judge in the village of isser jang on the road to montgomery there be four changar women who winnow cornsome seventy bushels a year beyond their hut lives purun dass the moneylender who on good security lends as much as five thousand rupees in a year jowala singh the smith mends the village plowssome thirty broken at the share in three hundred and sixtyfive days and hukm chund who is letterwriter and head of the little club under the travellers tree generally keeps the village posted in such gossip as the barber and the midwife have not yet made public property  chicago husks and winnows her wheat by the million bushels a hundred banks lend hundreds of millions of dollars in the year and scores of factories turn out plowgear and machinery by steam scores of daily papers do work which hukm chund and the barber and the midwife perform with due regard for public opinion in the village of isser jang so far as manufactories go the difference between chicago on the lake and isser jang on the montgomery road is one of degree only and not of kind as far as the understanding of the uses of life goes isser jang for all its seasonal cholers has the advantage over chicago  jowala singh knows and takes care to avoid the three or four ghoulhaunted fields on the outskirts of the village but he is not urged by millions of devils to run about all day in the sun and swear that his plowshares are the best in the punjab nor does purun dass fly forth in an ekka more than once or twice a year and he knows on a pinch how to use the railway and the telegraph as well as any son of israel in chicago but this is absurd  the east is not the west and these men must continue to deal with the machinery of life and to call it progress their very preachers dare not rebuke them they gloss over the hunting for money and the thricesharpened bitterness of adams curse by saying that such things dower a man with a larger range of thoughts and higher aspirations they do not say free yourselves from your own slavery but rather if you can possibly manage it do not set quite so much store on the things of this world  and they do not know what the things of this world are  i went off to see cattle killed by way of clearing my head which as you will perceive was getting muddled they say every englishman goes to the chicago stockyards you shall find them about six miles from the city and once having seen them you will never forget the sight  as far as the eye can reach stretches a township of cattlepens cunningly divided into blocks so that the animals of any pen can be speedily driven out close to an inclined timber path which leads to an elevated covered way straddling high above the pens these viaducts are twostoried on the upper story tramp the doomed cattle stolidly for the most part on the lower with a scuffling of sharp hoofs and multitudinous yells run the pigs the same end being appointed for each thus you will see the gangs of cattle waiting their turnas they wait sometimes for days and they need not be distressed by the sight of their fellows running about in the fear of death all they know is that a man on horseback causes their nextdoor neighbors to move by means of a whip certain bars and fences are unshipped and behold that crowd have gone up the mouth of a sloping tunnel and return no more  it is different with the pigs they shriek back the news of the exodus to their friends and a hundred pens skirl responsive  it was to the pigs i first addressed myself selecting a viaduct which was full of them as i could hear though i could not see i marked a sombre building whereto it ran and went there not unalarmed by stray cattle who had managed to escape from their proper quarters a pleasant smell of brine warned me of what was coming i entered the factory and found it full of pork in barrels and on another story more pork unbarrelled and in a huge room the halves of swine for whose behoof great lumps of ice were being pitched in at the window that room was the mortuary chamber where the pigs lay for a little while in state ere they began their progress through such passages as kings may sometimes travel  turning a corner and not noting an overhead arrangement of greased rail wheel and pulley i ran into the arms of four eviscerated carcasses all pure white and of a human aspect pushed by a man clad in vehement red when i leaped aside the floor was slippery under me also there was a flavor of farmyard in my nostrils and the shouting of a multitude in my ears but there was no joy in that shouting twelve men stood in two lines six a side between them and overhead ran the railway of death that had nearly shunted me through the window each man carried a knife the sleeves of his shirt were cut off at the elbows and from bosom to heel he was bloodred  beyond this perspective was a column of steam and beyond that was where i worked my awestruck way unwilling to touch beam or wall the atmosphere was stifling as a night in the rains by reason of the steam and the crowd i climbed to the beginning of things and perched upon a narrow beam overlooked very nearly all the pigs ever bred in wisconsin they had just been shot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddled together in a large pen thence they were flicked persuasively a few at a time into a smaller chamber and there a man fixed tackle on their hinder legs so that they rose in the air suspended from the railway of death  oh it was then they shrieked and called on their mothers and made promises of amendment till the tackleman punted them in their backs and they slid head down into a brickfloored passage very like a big kitchen sink that was bloodred there awaited them a red man with a knife which he passed jauntily through their throats and the fullvoiced shriek became a splutter and then a fall as of heavy tropical rain and the red man who was backed against the passagewall you will understand stood clear of the wildly kicking hoofs and passed his hand over his eyes not from any feeling of compassion but because the spurted blood was in his eyes and he had barely time to stick the next arrival then that first stuck swine dropped still kicking into a great vat of boiling water and spoke no more words but wallowed in obedience to some unseen machinery and presently came forth at the lower end of the vat and was heaved on the blades of a blunt paddlewheel things which said hough hough hough and skelped all the hair off him except what little a couple of men with knives could remove  then he was again hitched by the heels to that said railway and passed down the line of the twelve men each man with a knifelosing with each man a certain amount of his individuality which was taken away in a wheelbarrow and when he reached the last man he was very beautiful to behold but excessively unstuffed and limp preponderance of individuality was ever a bar to foreign travel that pig could have been in case to visit you in india had he not parted with some of his most cherished notions  the dissecting part impressed me not so much as the slaying they were so excessively alive these pigs and then they were so excessively dead and the man in the dripping clammy not passage did not seem to care and ere the blood of such a one had ceased to foam on the floor such another and four friends with him had shrieked and died but a pig is only the unclean animalthe forbidden of the prophet     vi the american army  i should very much like to deliver a dissertation on the american army and the possibilities of its extension you see it is such a beautiful little army and the dear people dont quite understand what to do with it the theory is that it is an instructional nucleus round which the militia of the country will rally and from which they will get a stiffening in time of danger yet other people consider that the army should be built like a pair of lazy tongson the principle of elasticity and extensionso that in time of need it may fill up its skeleton battalions and empty saddle troops this is real wisdom because the american army as at present constituted is made up oftwentyfive regiments infantry ten companies each  ten regiments cavalry twelve companies each  five regiments artillery twelve companies each  now there is a notion in the air to reorganize the service on these lineseighteen regiments infantry at four battalions four companies each third battalion skeleton fourth on paper  eight regiments cavalry at four battalions four troops each third battalion skeleton fourth on paper  five regiments artillery at four battalions four companies each third battalion skeleton fourth on paper  observe the beauty of this business the third battalion will have its officers but no men the fourth will probably have a rendezvous and some equipment  it is not contemplated to give it anything more definite at present assuming the regiments to be made up to full complement we get an army of fifty thousand men which after the need passes away must be cut down fifty per cent to the huge delight of the officers  the military needs of the states be three a frontier warfare an employment well within the grip of the present army of twentyfive thousand and in the nature of things growing less arduous year by year b internal riots and commotions which rise up like a dust devil whirl furiously and die out long before the authorities at washington could begin to fill up even the third skeleton battalions much less hunt about for material for the fourth c civil war in which as the case in the affair of the north and south the regular army would be swamped in the mass of militia and armed volunteers would turn the land into a hell  yet the authorities persist in regarding an external war as a thing to be seriously considered  the power that would disembark troops on american soil would be capable of heaving a shovelful of mud into the atlantic in the hope of filling it up consequently the authorities are fascinated with the idea of the sliding scale or concertina army this is an hereditary instinct for you know that when we english have got together two companies one machine gun a sick bullock forty generals and a mass of w o forms we say we possess an army corps capable of indefinite extension  the american army is a beautiful little army some day when all the indians are happily dead or drunk it ought to make the finest scientific and survey corps that the world has ever seen it does excellent work now but there is this defect in its nature it is officered as you know from west point  the mischief of it is that west point seems to be created for the purpose of spreading a general knowledge of military matters among the people a boy goes up to that institution gets his pass and returns to civil life so they tell me with a dangerous knowledge that he is a suckling von moltke and may apply his learning when occasion offers given trouble that man will be a nuisance because he is a hideously versatile american to begin with as cocksure of himself as a man can be and with all the racial disregard for human life to back him through any demisemiprofessional generalship  in a country where as the records of the daily papers show men engaged in a conflict with police or jails are all too ready to adopt a military formation and get heavily shot in a sort of cheap halfconstructed warfare instead of being decently scared by the appearance of the military this sort of arrangement does not seem wise  the bond between the states is of an amazing tenuity so long as they do not absolutely march into the district of columbia sit on the washington statues and invent a flag of their own they can legislate lynch hunt negroes through swamps divorce railroad and rampage as much as ever they choose they do not need knowledge of their own military strength to back their genial lawlessness  that regular army which is a dear little army should be kept to itself blooded on detachment duty turned into the paths of science and now and again assembled at feasts of free masons and so forth  it is too tiny to be a political power the immortal wreck of the grand army of the republic is a political power of the largest and most unblushing description it ought not to help to lay the foundations of an amateur military power that is blind and irresponsible  by great good luck the evilminded train already delayed twelve hours by a burned bridge brought me to the city on a saturday by way of that valley which the mormons over their efforts had caused to blossom like the rose twelve hours previously i had entered into a new world where in conversation every one was either a mormon or a gentile it is not seemly for a free and independent citizen to dub himself a gentile but the mayor of ogdenwhich is the gentile city of the valleytold me that there must be some distinction between the two flocks  long before the fruit orchards of logan or the shining levels of the salt lake had been reached that mayorhimself a gentile and one renowned for his dealings with the mormonstold me that the great question of the existence of the power within the power was being gradually solved by the ballot and by education  all the beauty of the valley could not make me forget it and the valley is very fair bench after bench of land flat as a table against the flanks of the ringing hills marks where the salt lake rested for awhile in its collapse from an inland sea to a lake fifty miles long and thirty broad  there are the makings of a very fine creed about mormonism to begin with the church is rather more absolute than that of rome drop the polygamy plank in the platform but on the other hand deal lightly with certain forms of excess keep the quality of the recruit down to the low mental level and see that the best of all the agricultural science available is in the hands of the elders and there you have a firstclass engine for pioneer work the tawdry mysticism and the borrowing from freemasonry serve the low caste swede and dane the welshman and the cornish cotter just as well as a highly organized heaven  then i went about the streets and peeped into peoples front windows and the decorations upon the tables were after the manner of the year 1850 main street was full of country folk from the desert come in to trade with the zion mercantile cooperative institute the church i fancy looks after the finances of this thing and it consequently pays good dividends  the faces of the women were not lovely indeed but for the certainty that ugly persons are just as irrational in the matter of undivided love as the beautiful it seems that polygamy was a blessed institution for the women and that only the dread threats of the spiritual power could drive the hulking boardfaced men into it the women wore hideous garments and the men appeared to be tied up with strings  they would market all that afternoon and on sunday go to the prayingplace i tried to talk to a few of them but they spoke strange tongues and stared and behaved like cows yet one woman and not an altogether ugly one confided to me that she hated the idea of salt lake city being turned into a showplace for the amusement of the gentiles  if we have our own institutions that aint no reason why people should come ere and stare at us his it  the dropped h betrayed her  and when did you leave england i said  summer of 84 i am dorset she said the mormon agent was very good to us and we was very poor now were better offmy father an mother an me  then you like the state  she misunderstood at first  oh i aint livin in the state of polygamy not me yet i aint married i like where i am ive got things o my ownand some land  but i suppose you will  not me i aint like them swedes an danes i aint got nothin to say for or against polygamy its the elders business an between you an me i dont think its going on much longer youll ear them in the ouse tomorrer talkin as if it was spreadin all over america the swedes they think it his i know it hisnt  but youve got your land all right  oh yes weve got our land an we never say aught against polygamy o coursefather an mother an me  on a tableland overlooking all the city stands the united states garrison of infantry and artillery the state of utah can do nearly anything it pleases until that muchtobedesired hour when the gentile vote shall quietly swamp out mormonism but the garrison is kept there in case of accidents the big sharkmouthed pigeared heavyboned farmers sometimes take to their creed with wildest fanaticism and in past years have made life excessively unpleasant for the gentile when he was few in the land but today so far from killing openly or secretly or burning gentile farms it is all the mormon dare do to feebly try to boycott the interloper his journals preach defiance to the united states government and in the tabernacle on a sunday the preachers follow suit  when i went there the place was full of people who would have been much better for a washing  a man rose up and told them that they were the chosen of god the elect of israel that they were to obey their priests and that there was a good time coming i fancy that they had heard all this before so many times it produced no impression whatever even as the sublimest mysteries of another faith lose salt through constant iteration they breathed heavily through their noses and stared straight in front of themimpassive as flat fish     vii americas defenceless coasts  just suppose that america were twenty days distant from england then a man could study its customs with undivided soul but being so very near next door he goes about the land with one eye on the smoke of the fleshpots of the old country across the seas while with the other he squints biliously and prejudicially at the alien  i can lay my hand upon my sacred heart and affirm that up to today i have never taken three consecutive trips by rail without being delayed by an accident that it was an accident to another train makes no difference my own turn may come next  a few miles from peaceful pleasureloving lakewood they had managed to upset an express goods train to the detriment of the flimsy permanent way and thus the train which should have left at three departed at seven in the evening i was not angry i was scarcely even interested when an american train starts on time i begin to anticipate disastera visitation for such good luck you understand  buffalo is a large village of a quarter of a million inhabitants situated on the seashore which is falsely called lake erie it is a peaceful place and more like an english county town than most of its friends  once clear of the main business streets you launch upon miles and miles of asphalted roads running between cottages and cutstone residences of those who have money and peace all the eastern cities own this fringe of elegance but except in chicago nowhere is the fringe deeper or more heavily widened than in buffalo  the american will go to a bad place because he cannot speak english and is proud of it but he knows how to make a home for himself and his mate knows how to keep the grass green in front of his veranda and how to fullest use the mechanism of lifehot water gas good bellropes telephones etc his shops sell him delightful household fitments at very moderate rates and he is encompassed with all manner of laborsaving appliances this does not prevent his wife and his daughter working themselves to death over household drudgery but the intention is good  when you have seen the outside of a few hundred thousand of these homes and the insides of a few score you begin to understand why the american the respectable one does not take a deep interest in what they call politics and why he is so vaguely and generally proud of the country that enables him to be so comfortable how can the owner of a dainty chalet with smokedoak furniture imitation venetian tapestry curtains hot and cold water laid on a bed of geraniums and hollyhocks a baby crawling down the veranda and a selfacting twirlywhirly hose gently hissing over the grass in the balmy dusk of an august eveninghow can such a man despair of the republic or descend into the streets on voting days and mix cheerfully with the boys  no it is the strangerthe homeless jackal of a strangerwhose interest in the country is limited to his hotelbill and a railwayticket that can run from dan to beersheba cryingall is barren  every good american wants a homea pretty house and a little piece of land of his very own and every other good american seems to get it  it was when my gigantic intellect was grappling with this question that i confirmed a discovery half made in the west the natives of most classes marry youngabsurdly young one of my informantsnot the twentytwoyearold husband i met on lake chautauquasaid that from twenty to twentyfour was about the usual time for this folly and when i asked whether the practice was confined to the constitutionally improvident classes he said no very quickly he said it was a general custom and nobody saw anything wrong with it  i guess perhaps very early marriage may account for a good deal of the divorce said he reflectively  whereat i was silent their marriages and their divorces only concern these people and neither i travelling nor you who may come after have any right to make rude remarks about them onlyonly coming from a land where a man begins to lightly turn to thoughts of love not before he is thirty i own that playing at housekeeping before that age rather surprised me out in the west though they marry boys and girls from sixteen upward and i have met more than one bride of fifteenhusband aged twenty  when man and woman are agreed what can the kazi do  from those peaceful homes and the envy they inspire two trunks and a walkingstick and a bit of pine forest in british columbia are not satisfactory any way you look at them i turned me to the lake front of buffalo where the steamers bellow to the grain elevators and the locomotives yell to the coalshutes and the canal barges jostle the lumberraft half a mile long as it snakes across the water in tow of a launch and earth and sky and sea alike are thick with smoke  in the old days before the railway ran into the city all the business quarters fringed the lakeshore where the traffic was largest today the business quarters have gone uptown to meet the railroad the lake traffic still exists but you shall find a narrow belt of redbrick desolation broken windows gaptoothed doors and streets where the grass grows between the crowded wharves and the bustling city to the lake front comes wheat from chicago lumber coal and ore and a large trade in cheap excursionists  it was my felicity to catch a grain steamer and an elevator emptying that same steamer the steamer might have been two thousand tons burden she was laden with wheat in bulk from stem to stern thirteen feet deep lay the clean red wheat there was no twentyfive per cent dirt admixture about it at all it was wheat fit for the grindstones as it lay they manoeuvred the forehatch of that steamer directly under an elevatora house of red tin a hundred and fifty feet high then they let down into that forehatch a trunk as if it had been the trunk of an elephant but stiff because it was a pipe of ironchamped wood and the trunk had a steelshod nose to it and contained an endless chain of steel buckets  then the captain swore raising his eyes to heaven and a gruff voice answered him from the place he swore at and certain machinery also in the firmament began to clack and the glittering steelshod nose of that trunk burrowed into the wheat and the wheat quivered and sunk upon the instant as water sinks when the siphon sucks because the steel buckets within the trunk were flying upon their endless round carrying away each its appointed morsel of wheat  the elevator was a persian well wheela wheel squashed out thin and cased in a pipe a wheel driven not by bullocks but by much horsepower licking up the grain at the rate of thousands of bushels the hour and the wheat sunk into the forehatch while a man lookedsunk till the brown timbers of the bulkheads showed bare and men leaped down through clouds of golden dust and shovelled the wheat furiously round the nose of the trunk and got a steamshovel of glittering steel and made that shovel also till there remained of the grain not more than a horse leaves in the fold of his nosebag  in this manner do they handle wheat at buffalo on one side of the elevator is the steamer on the other the railway track and the wheat is loaded into the cars in bulk wah wah god is great and i do not think he ever intended gar sahai or luckman narain to supply england with her wheat india can cut in not without profit to herself when her harvest is good and the american yield poor but this very big country can upon the average supply the earth with all the beef and bread that is required  a man in the train said to mewe kin feed all the earth jest as easily as we kin whip all the earth  now the second statement is as false as the first is true one of these days the respectable republic will find this out  unfortunately we the english will never be the people to teach her because she is a chartered libertine allowed to say and do anything she likes from demanding the head of the empress in an editorial wastebasket to chevying canadian schooners up and down the alaska seas it is perfectly impossible to go to war with these people whatever they may do  they are much too nice in the first place and in the second it would throw out all the passenger traffic of the atlantic and upset the financial arrangements of the english syndicates who have invested their money in breweries railways and the like and in the third its not to be done everybody knows that and no one better than the american  yet there are other powers who are not ohai band of the brotherhoodchina for instance try to believe an irresponsible writer when he assures you that chinas fleet today if properly manned could waft the entire american navy out of the water and into the blue the big fat republic that is afraid of nothing because nothing up to the present date has happened to make her afraid is as unprotected as a jellyfish not internally of courseit would be madness for any power to throw men into america they would diebut as far as regards coast defence  from five miles out at sea i have seen a test of her fortified ports a ship of the power of h m s collingwood they havent run her on a rock yet would wipe out any or every town from san francisco to long branch and three firstclass ironclads would account for new york bartholdis statue and all  reflect on this twould be pay up or go up round the entire coast of the united states to this furiously answers the patriotic americanwe should not pay we should invent a columbiad in pittsburg oror anywhere else and blow any outsider into hl  they might invent they might lay waste their cities and retire inland for they can subsist entirely on their own produce meantime in a war waged the only way it could be waged by an unscrupulous power their coast cities and their dockyards would be ashes they could construct their navy inland if they liked but you could never bring a ship down to the waterways as they stand now  they could not with an ordinary water patrol despatch one regiment of men six miles across the seas there would be about five million excessively angry armed men pent up within american limits these men would require ships to get themselves afloat the country has no such ships and until the ships were built new york need not be allowed a singlewheeled carriage within her limits  behold now the glorious condition of this republic which has no fear there is ransom and loot past the counting of man on her seaboard aloneplunder that would enrich a nationand she has neither a navy nor half a dozen firstclass ports to guard the whole no man catches a snake by the tail because the creature will sting but you can build a fire around a snake that will make it squirm  the country is supposed to be building a navy now when the ships are completed her alliance will be worth havingif the alliance of any republic can be relied upon for the next three years she can be hurt and badly hurt pity it is that she is of our own blood looking at the matter from a pindarris point of view dog cannot eat dog  these sinful reflections were prompted by the sight of the beautifully unprotected condition of buffaloa city that could be made to pay up five million dollars without feeling it there are her companies of infantry in a sort of port there a gunboat brought over in pieces from niagara could get the money and get away before she could be caught while an unarmored gunboat guarding toronto could ravage the towns on the lakes when one hears so much of the nation that can whip the earth it is to say the least of it surprising to find her so temptingly spankable  the average american citizen seems to have a notion that any power engaged in strife with the star spangled banner will disembark men from flatbottomed boats on a convenient beach for the purpose of being shot down by local militia in his own simple phraseologynot by a darned sight no sir  ransom at long range will be about the size of itcash or crash  let us revisit calmer scenes  in the heart of buffalo there stands a magnificent building which the population do innocently style a musichall everybody comes here of evenings to sit around little tables and listen to a firstclass orchestra the place is something like the gaiety theatre at simla enlarged twenty times the light brigade of buffalo occupy the boxes and the stage as it was at simla in the days of old and the others sit in the parquet here i went with a friendpoor or boor is the man who cannot pick up a friend for a season in americaand here was shown the really smart folk of the city i grieve to say i laughed because when an american wishes to be correct he sets himself to imitate the englishman this he does vilely and earns not only the contempt of his brethren but the amused scorn of the briton  i saw one man who was pointed out to me as being the glass of fashion hereabouts he was aggressively english in his getup from eyeglass to trouserhem the illusion was perfect buthe wore with eveningdress buttoned boots with brown cloth tops not till i wandered about this land did i understand why the comic papers belabor the anglomaniac  certain young men of the more idiotic sort launch into dogcarts and raiment of english cut and here in buffalo they play polo at four in the afternoon i saw three youths come down to the pologround faultlessly attired for the game and mounted on their best ponies expecting a game i lingered but i was mistaken these three shining ones with the very new yellow hide boots and the red silk sashes had assembled themselves for the purpose of knocking the ball about they smote with great solemnity up and down the grounds while the little boys looked on when they trotted which was not seldom they rose and sunk in their stirrups with a conscientiousness that cried out ridingschool from afar  other young men in the park were riding after the english manner in neatly cut ridingtrousers and light saddles fate in derision had made each youth bedizen his animal with a checkered enamelled leather browband visible half a mile awaya blackandwhite checkered browband they cant do it any more than an englishman by taking cold can add that indescribable nasal twang to his orchestra  the other sight of the evening was a horror the little tragedy played itself out at a neighboring table where two very young men and two very young women were sitting it did not strike me till far into the evening that the pimply young reprobates were making the girls drunk they gave them red wine and then white and the voices rose slightly with the maidens cheek flushes i watched wishing to stay and the youths drank till their speech thickened and their eyeballs grew watery it was sickening to see because i knew what was going to happen my friend eyed the group and saidmaybe theyre children of respectable people i hardly think though theyd be allowed out without any better escort than these boys and yet the place is a place where every one comes as you see they may be little immoralitiesin which case they wouldnt be so hopelessly overcome with two glasses of wine they may be  whatever they were they got indubitably drunkthere in that lovely hall surrounded by the best of buffalo society one could do nothing except invoke the judgment of heaven on the two boys themselves half sick with liquor at the close of the performance the quieter maiden laughed vacantly and protested she couldnt keep her feet the four linked arms and staggering flickered out into the streetdrunk gentlemen and ladies as davys swine drunk as lords they disappeared down a side avenue but i could hear their laughter long after they were out of sight  and they were all four children of sixteen and seventeen then recanting previous opinions i became a prohibitionist better it is that a man should go without his beer in public places and content himself with swearing at the narrowmindedness of the majority better it is to poison the inside with very vile temperance drinks and to buy lager furtively at backdoors than to bring temptation to the lips of young fools such as the four i had seen i understand now why the preachers rage against drink i have said there is no harm in it taken moderately and yet my own demand for beer helped directly to send those two girls reeling down the dark street togod alone knows what end  if liquor is worth drinking it is worth taking a little trouble to come atsuch trouble as a man will undergo to compass his own desires it is not good that we should let it lie before the eyes of children and i have been a fool in writing to the contrary very sorry for myself i sought a hotel and found in the hall a reporter who wished to know what i thought of the country him i lured into conversation about his own profession and from him gained much that confirmed me in my views of the grinding tyranny of that thing which they call the press here thusibut you talk about interviewing people whether they like it or not have you no bounds beyond which even your indecent curiosity must not go  hei havent struck em yet what do you think of interviewing a widow two hours after her husbands death to get her version of his life  ii think that is the work of a ghoul must the people have no privacy  hethere is no domestic privacy in america if there was what the deuce would the papers do see here some time ago i had an assignment to write up the floral tributes when a prominent citizen had died  itranslate please i do not understand your pagan rites and ceremonies  hei was ordered by the office to describe the flowers and wreaths and so on that had been sent to a dead mans funeral well i went to the house there was no one there to stop me so i yanked the tinklerpulled the belland drifted into the room where the corpse lay all among the roses and smilax i whipped out my notebook and pawed around among the floral tributes turning up the tickets on the wreaths and seeing who had sent them in the middle of this i heard some one saying please oh please behind me and there stood the daughter of the house just bathed in tearsiyou unmitigated brute  hepretty much what i felt myself im very sorry miss i said to intrude on the privacy of your grief trust me i shall make it as little painful as possible  ibut by what conceivable right did you outragehehold your horses im telling you well she didnt want me in the house at all and between her sobs fairly waved me away i had half the tributes described though and the balance i did partly on the steps when the stiff un came out and partly in the church the preacher gave the sermon that wasnt my assignment i skipped about among the floral tributes while he was talking i could have made no excuse if i had gone back to the office and said that a pretty girls sobs had stopped me obeying orders i had to do it what do you think of it all  i slowlydo you want to know  he with his notebook readyof course how do you regard it  iit makes me regard your interesting nation with the same shuddering curiosity that i should bestow on a pappan cannibal chewing the scalp off his mothers skull does that convey any idea to your mind it makes me regard the whole pack of you as heathensreal heathensnot the sort you send missions tocreatures of another flesh and blood you ought to have been shot not dead but through the stomach for your share in the scandalous business and the thing you call your newspaper ought to have been sacked by the mob and the managing proprietor hanged  hefrom which i suppose you have nothing of that kind in your country  oh pioneer venerable pioneer and you not less honest press of india who are occasionally dull but never blackguardly what could i say a mere no shouted never so loudly would not have met the needs of the case i said no word  the reporter went away and i took a train for niagara falls which are twentytwo miles distant from this bad town where girls get drunk of nights and reporters trample on corpses in the drawingrooms of the brave and the free
