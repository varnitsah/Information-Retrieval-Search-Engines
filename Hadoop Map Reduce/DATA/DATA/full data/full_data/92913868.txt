sketch the double alibi the complete bungler     dedication   to mrs herbert hills  no fisher but a wellwisher to the game  in memory of plesant days at corby     preface   several of the sketches in this volume have appeared in periodicals  the bloody doctor was in macmillans magazine the confessions of a duffer loch awe and the lady or the salmon were in the fishing gazette but have been to some extent rewritten  the double alibi was in longmans magazine  the author has to thank the editors and publishers for permission to reprint these papers  the gem engraved on the cover is enlarged from a small intaglio in the collection of mr m h n storymaskelyne mp  such gems were recommended by clemens of alexandria to the early christians  the figure of a man fishing will put them in mind of the apostle  perhaps the greek is using the red hackle described by aelian in the only known greek reference to flyfishing     note to new edition   the historical version of the black officers career very unlike the legend in loch awe may be read in mr macphersons social life in the highlands     the confessions of a duffer   these papers do not boast of great sport  they are truthful not like the tales some fishers tell  they should appeal to many sympathies there is no false modesty in the confidence with which i esteem myself a duffer at fishing  some men are born duffers others unlike persons of genius become so by an infinite capacity for not taking pains  others again among whom i would rank myself combine both these elements of incompetence  nature that made me enthusiastically fond of fishing gave me thumbs for fingers shortsighted eyes indolence carelessness and a temper which usually sweet and angelic is goaded to madness by the laws of matter and of gravitation  for example when another man is caught up in a branch he disengages his fly i jerk at it till something breaks  as for carelessness in boyhood i fished by preference with doubtful gut and knots illtied it made the risk greater and increased the excitement if one did hook a trout  i cant keep a flybook  i stuff the flies into my pockets at random or stick them into the leaves of a novel or bestow them in the lining of my hat or the case of my rods  never till 1890 in all my days did i possess a landingnet  if i can drag a fish up a bank or over the gravel well if not he goes on his way rejoicing  on the test i thought it seemly to carry a landing net  it had a hinge and doubled up  i put the handle through a button hole of my coat i saw a big fish rising i put a dry fly over him the idiot took it  up stream he ran then down stream then he yielded to the rod and came near me  i tried to unship my landingnet from my buttonhole  vain labour  i twisted and turned the handle it would not budge  finally i stooped and attempted to ladle the trout out with the short net but he broke the gut and went off  a landingnet is a tedious thing to carry so is a creel and a creel is to me a superfluity  there is never anything to put in it  if i do catch a trout i lay him under a big stone cover him with leaves and never find him again  i often break my top joint so as i never carry string i splice it with a bit of the line which i bite off for i really cannot be troubled with scissors and i always lose my knife  when a phantom minnow sticks in my clothes i snap the gut off and put on another so that when i reach home i look as if a shoal of fierce minnows had attacked me and hung on like leeches  when a boy i wasonce or twicea baitfisher but i never carried worms in box or bag  i found them under big stones or in the fields wherever i had the luck  i never tie nor otherwise fasten the joints of my rod they often slip out of the sockets and splash into the water  mr hardy however has invented a jointfastening which never slips  on the other hand by letting the joint rust you may find it difficult to take down your rod  when i see a trout rising i always cast so as to get hung up and i frighten him as i disengage my hook  i invariably fall in and get halfdrowned when i wade there being an insufficiency of nails in the soles of my brogues my waders let in water too and when i go out to fish i usually leave either my reel or my flies or my rod at home  perhaps no other mans average of lost flies in proportion to taken trout was ever so great as mine  i lose plenty by striking furiously after a series of short rises and breaking the gut with which the fish swims away  as to dressing a fly one would sooner think of dressing a dinner  the result of the flydressing would resemble a small blackingbrush perhaps but nothing entomological  then why a persevering reader may ask do i fish  well it is stronger than myself the love of fishing perhaps it is an inherited instinct without the inherited power  i may have had a fishing ancestor who bequeathed to me the passion without the art  my vocation is fixed and i have fished to little purpose all my days  not for salmon an almost fabulous and yet a stupid fish which must be moved with a rod like a weavers beam  the trout is more delicate and daintynot the seatrout which any man woman or child can capture but the yellow trout in clear water  a few rises are almost all i ask for to catch more than half a dozen fish does not fall to my lot twice a year  of course in a sutherland loch one man is as good as another the expert no better than the duffer the fish will take or they wont  if they wont nobody can catch them if they will nobody can miss them  it is as simple as trolling a minnow from a boat in loch leven probably the lowest possible form of angling my ambition is as great as my skill is feeble to capture big trout with the dry fly in the test that would content me and nothing under that but i cant see the natural fly on the water i cannot see my own fly     let it sink or let it swim  i often dont see the trout rise to me if he is such a fool as to rise and i cant strike in time when i do see him  besides i am unteachable to tie any of the orthodox knots in the gut it takes me half an hour to get the gut through one of these newfangled iron eyes and when it is through i knot it any way  the jam knot is a name to me and no more that perhaps is why the hooks crack off so merrily  then if i do spot a rising trout and if he does not spot me as i crawl like the serpent towards him my fly always fixes in a nettle a haycock a rosebush or whatnot behind me  i undo it or break it and put up another make a cast and plop all the line falls in with a splash that would frighten a crocodile  the fishs big black fin goes cutting the stream above and there is a sauve qui peut of trout in all directions  i once did manage to make a cast correctly the fly went over the fishs nose he rose i hooked him and he was a great silly brute of a grayling  the grayling is the deadesthearted and the foolishestheaded fish that swims  i would as lief catch a perch or an eel as a grayling this is the worst of itthis ambition of the duffers this desire for perfection as if the golfing imbecile should match himself against mr horace hutchinson or as the sow of the greek proverb challenged athene to sing  i know it all i deplore it i regret the evils of ambition but cest plus fort que moi  if there is a trout rising well under the pendant boughs that trail in the water if there is a brake of briars behind me a strong wind down stream for that trout in that impregnable situation i am impelled to fish  if i raise him i strike miss him catch up in his tree swish the cast off into the briars break my top break my heart butthat is the humour of it  the passion or instinct being in all senses blind must no doubt be hereditary  it is full of sorrow and bitterness and hope deferred and entails the mockery of friends especially of the fair  but i would as soon lay down a love of books as a love of fishing  success with pen or rod may be beyond one but there is the pleasure of the pursuit the rapture of endeavour the delight of an impossible chase the joys of naturesky trees brooks and birds  happiness in these things is the legacy to us of the barbarian  man in the future will enjoy bricks asphalte fog machinery society even picture galleries as many men and most women do already  we are fortunate who inherit the older not the new spiritwe who skilled or unskilled follow in the steps of our father izaak by streams less clear indeed and in meadows less fragrant than his  still they are meadows and streams not wholly dispeopled yet of birds and trout nor can any defect of art nor certainty of laborious disappointment keep us from the waterside when april comes  next to being an expert it is well to be a contented duffer a man who would fish if he could and who will pleasure himself by flicking off his flies and dreaming of impossible trout and smoking among the sedges hopes enchanted cigarettes  next time we shall be more skilled more fortunate  next time  tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow  grey hairs come and stiff limbs and shortened sight but the spring is green and hope is fresh for all the changes in the world and in ourselves  we can tell a hawk from a handsaw a march brown from a blue dun and if our success be as poor as ever our fancy can dream as well as ever of better things and more fortunate chances  for fishing is like life and in the art of living too there are duffers though they seldom give us their confessions  yet even they are kept alive like the incompetent angler by this undying hope they will be more careful more skilful more lucky next time  the gleaming untravelled future the bright untried waters allure us from day to day from pool to pool till like the veteran on coquet side we try a farewell throw or like stoddart look our last on tweed     a border boyhood   a fisher says our father izaak is like a poet he must be born so the majority of dwellers on the border are born to be fishers thanks to the endless number of rivers and burns in the region between the tweed and the coqueta realm where almost all troutfishing is open and where since population and love of the sport have increased there is now but little water that merits the trouble of putting up a rod  like the rest of us in that country i was born an angler though under an evil star for indeed my labours have not been blessed and are devoted to fishing rather than to the catching of fish  remembrance can scarcely recover nor time bring back to time the days when i was not busy at the waterside yet the feat is not quite beyond the power of mnemosyne  my first recollection of the sport must date from about the age of four  i recall in a dim brightness driving along a road that ran between banks of bracken and micaveined rocks and the sunlight on a shining bend of a highland stream and my father standing in the shallow water showing me a huge yellow fish that gave its last fling or two on the grassy bank  the fish seemed as terrible and dangerous to me as to tobit in the apocrypha did that ferocious halfpounder which he carries on a string in the early italian pictures  how oddly botticelli and his brethren misconceived the mandevouring fish which must have been a crocodile strayed from the nile into the waters of the euphrates  a half pounder  to have been terrified by a trout seems a bad beginning and thereafter the mist gathers over the past only to lift again when i see myself with a crowd of other little children sent to fish with crooked pins for minnows or baggies as we called them in the ettrick  if our parents hoped that we would bring home minnows for bait they were disappointed  the party was under the command of a nursery governess and probably she was no descendant of the mother of us all dame juliana berners  we did not catch any minnows and i remember sitting to watch a bigger boy who was angling in a shoal of them when a parr came into the shoal and we had bright visions of alluring that monarch of the deep  but the parr disdained our baits and for months i dreamed of what it would have been to capture him and often thought of him in church  in a moment of profane confidence my younger brother once asked me what do you do in sermon time  i said he in a whispermind you dont telli tell stories to myself about catching trout  to which i added similar confession for even so i drove the sermon by and i have not toldtill now  by this time we must have been introduced to trout  who forgets his first trout  mine thanks to that unlucky star was a double deception or rather there were two kinds of deception  a village carpenter very kindly made rods for us  they were of unpainted wood these first rods they were in two pieces with a real brass joint and there was a ring at the end of the top joint to which the line was knotted  we were still in the age of walton who clearly knew nothing except by hearsay of a reel he abandons the attempt to describe that machine as used by the salmonfishers  he thinks it must be seen to be understood  with these innocent weapons and with the gardener to bait our hooks we were taken to the yarrow far up the stream near ladhope  how well one remembers deserting the gardener and already appreciating the joys of having no gillie nor attendant of being alone with ourselves and the goddess of fishing  i cast away as well as i could and presently jerked a trout a tiny one high up in the air out of the water  but he fell off the hook again he dropped in with a little splash and i rushed up to consult my tutor on his unsportsmanlike behaviour and the disappointing nay heartbreaking occurrence  was the trout not morally caught was there no way of getting him to see this and behave accordingly  the gardener feared there was none  meanwhile he sat on the bank and angled in a pool  try my rod he said and as soon as i had taken hold of it pull up he cried pull up  i did pull up and hauled my first troutling on shore  but in my inmost heart i feared that he was not my trout at all that the gardener had hooked him before he handed the rod to me  then we met my younger brother coming to us with quite a great fish half a pound perhaps which he had caught in a burn  then for the first time my soul knew the fierce passion of jealousy the envy of the angler  almost for the last time too for i know not why it is and it proves me no true fisherman i am not discontented by the successes of others  if one cannot catch fish oneself surely the next best thing is to see other people catch them  my own progress was now checked for long by a constitutional and insuperable aversion to angling with worm  if the gardener or a pretty girlcousin of the mature age of fourteen would put the worm on i did not much mind fishing with it  dost thou remember fair lady of the ringlets  still i never liked baitfishing and these mine allies were not always at hand  we used indeed to have great days with perch at faldonside on the land which sir walter scott was always so anxious to buy from mr nichol milne  almost the last entry in his diary at naples breathes this unutterable hope  he had deluded himself into believing that his debts were paid and that he could soon speak a word to young nichol milne  the word of course was never spoken and the unsupplanted laird used to let us fish for his perch to our hearts desire  never was there such slaughter  the corks which we used as floats were perpetually tipping bobbing and disappearing and then the redfinned perch would fly out on to dry land  here i once saw two corks go down two anglers haul up and one perch attached to both hooks descend on the grassy bank  my brother and i filled two baskets once and strung dozens of other perch on a stick  but this was not legitimate business  not till we came to flyfishing were we really entered at the sport and this initiation took place as it chanced beside the very stream where i was first shown a trout  it is a charming piece of water ambercoloured and clear flowing from the morvern hills under the limes of an ancient avenuetrees that have long survived the house to which of old the road must have led  our gillie put on for us big bright seatrout fliesnobody fishes there for yellow trout but in our inexperience small brownies were all we caught probably we were only taken to streams and shallows where we could not interfere with mature sportsmen  at all events it was demonstrated to us that we could actually catch fish with fly and since then i have scarcely touched a worm except as a boy in burns  in these early days we had no notion of playing a trout  if there was a bite we put our strength into an answering tug and if nothing gave way the trout flew over our heads perhaps up into a tree perhaps over into a branch of the stream behind us  quite a large trout will yield to this artless method if the rod be sturdynone of your gluedup caneaffairs  i remember hooking a trout which not answering to the first haul ran right across the stream and made for a hole in the opposite bank  but the second lift proved successful and he landed on my side of the water  he had a great minnow in his throat and must have been a particularly greedy animal  of course on this system there were many breakages and the method was abandoned as we lived into our teens and began to wade and to understand something about flyfishing  it was worth while to be a boy then in the south of scotland and to fish the waters haunted by old legends musical with old songs and renowned in the sporting essays of christopher north and stoddart  even then thirty long years ago the old stagers used to tell us that the waiter was owr sair fished and they grumbled about the system of draining the land which makes a river a roaring torrent in floods and a bed of grey stones with a few clear pools and shallows during the rest of the year in times before the hills were drained before the manufacturing towns were so populous before pollution netting dynamiting poisoning sniggling and the enormous increase of fair and unfair fishing the border must have been the anglers paradise  still it was not bad when we were boys  we had ettrick within a mile of us and a finer natural troutstream there is not in scotland though now the water only holds a sadly persecuted remnant  there was one long pool behind lindean flowing beneath a high wooded bank where the trout literally seemed never to cease rising at the flies that dropped from the pendant boughs unluckily the water flowed out of the pool in a thin broad stream directly it right angles to the pool itself  thus the angler had so to speak the whole of lower ettrick at his back when he waded it was a long way up stream to the bank and as we never used landingnets then we naturally lost a great many trout in trying to unhook them in mid water  they only averaged as a rule from three to two to the pound but they were strong and lively  in this pool there was a large tawny table shaped stone over which the current broke  out of the eddy behind this stone one of my brothers one day caught three trout weighing over seven pounds a feat which nowadays sounds quite incredible  as soon as the desirable eddy was empty another trout a trifle smaller than the former seems to have occupied it  the next mile and a half from lindean to the junction with tweed was remarkable for excellent sport in the last pool of ettrick the water flowed by a steep bank and if you cast almost on to the further side you were perfectly safe to get fish even when the river was very low  the flies used three on a cast were small and dusky hares ear and woodcock wing black palmers or as stoddart sings     wee dour looking huiks are the thing    mouse body and laverock wing  next to ettrick came tweed the former river joins the latter at the bend of a long stretch of water half stream half pool in which angling was always good  in late september there were seatrout which for some reason rose to the fly much more freely than seatrout do now in the upper tweed  i particularly remember hooking one just under the railway bridge  he was a twopounder and practised the usual seatrout tactics of springing into the air like a rocket  there was a knot on my line of course and i was obliged to hold him hard  when he had been dragged up on the shingle the line parted broken in twain at the knot but it had lasted just long enough during three exciting minutes  this accident of a knot on the line has only once befallen me since with the strongest lochtrout i ever encountered  it was on branxholme loch where the trout run to a great size but usually refuse the fly  i was alone in a boat on a windy day the trout soon ran out the line to the knot and then there was nothing for it but to lower the top almost to the waters edge and hold on in hope  presently the boat drifted ashore and i landed himbetter luck than i deserved  people who only know the trout of the test and other chalk streams cannot imagine how much stronger are the fish of the swift scottish streams and dark scottish lochs  theyre worse fed but they are infinitely more powerful and active it is all the difference between an alderman and a clansman  tweed at this time was full of trout but even then they were not easy to catch  one difficulty lay in the nature of the wading  there is a pool near ashiesteil and gleddis weil which illustrated this  here scott and hogg were once upset from a boat while burning the waterspearing salmon by torchlight  herein too as scott mentions in his diary he once caught two trout at one cast  the pool is long is paved with small gravel and allures you to wade on and on  but the water gradually deepens as you go forward and the pool ends in a deep pot under each bank  then to recover your ground becomes by no means easy especially if the water is heavy  you get halfdrowned or drowned altogether before you discover your danger  many of the pools have this peculiarity and in many one step made rashly lets you into a very uncomfortable and perilous place  therefore expeditions to tweedside were apt to end in a ducking  it was often hard to reach the water where trout were rising and the rise was always capricious  there might not be a stir on the water for hours and suddenly it would be all boiling with heads and tails for twenty minutes after which nothing was to be done  to miss the take was to waste the day at least in flyfishing from a high wooded bank i have seen the trout feeding and they have almost ceased to feed before i reached the waterside  still worse was it to be allured into water over the tops of your waders early in the day and then to find that the rise was over and there was nothing for it but a weary walk home the basket laden only with damp boots  still the trout were undeniably there and that was a great encouragement  they are there still but infinitely more cunning than of old  then if they were feeding they took the artificial fly freely now it must be exactly of the right size and shade or they will have none of it  they come provokingly short too just plucking at the hook and running out a foot of line or so then taking their departure  for some reason the tweed is more difficult to fish with the dry fly thanthe test for example  the water is swifter and very dark it drowns the fly soon and on the surface the fly is less easily distinguished than at whitchurch in the pellucid streams  the leader a tributary may be fished with dry fly on the tweed one can hardly manage it  there is a plan by which rising trout may be takennamely by baiting with a small red worm and casting as in flyfishing  but that is so hard on the worm  probably he who can catch trout with fly on the tweed between melrose and holy lee can catch them anywhere  on a good day in april great baskets are still made in preserved parts of the tweed but if they are made in open water it must be i fancy with worm or with the screw the lava of the may fly  the screw is a hideous and venomouslooking animal which is fixed on a particular kind of tackle and cast up stream with a short line  the heaviest trout are fond of it but it can only be used at a season when either school or oxford keeps one far from what old franck waltons contemporary a cromwellian trooper calls the glittering and resolute streams of tweed  difficult as it is that river is so beautiful and alluring that it scarcely needs the attractions of sport  the step banks beautifully wooded and in spring one mass of primroses are crowned here and there with ruined border towerslike elibank the houses of muckle moued meg or with fair baronial houses like fernilea  meg made a bad exchange when she left elibank with the salmon pool at its foot for bleak harden frowning over the narrow den where harden kept the plundered cattle there is no fishing in the tiny harden burn that joins the brawling borthwick water  the burns of the lowlands are now almost barren of trout  the spawning fish flabby and useless are killed in winter  all through the rest of the year in the remotest places tourists are hard at them with worm  in a small burn a skilled wormer may almost depopulate the pools and on the border all is fish that comes to the hook men keep the very fingerlings on the pretext that they are so sweet in the fryingpan the crowd of anglers in glens which seem not easily accessible is provoking enough  into the meggat a stream which feeds st marys loch there flows the glengaber or glencaber burn the burn of the pinetree stump  the water runs in deep pools and streams over a blue slatey rock which contains gold under the sand in the worn holes and crevices  my friend mr mcallister the schoolmaster at st marys tells me that one day when fish were not rising he scooped out the gravel of one of these holes with his knife and found a tiny nugget after which the goldhunting fever came on him for a while  but little is got nowadays though in some earlier period the burn has been diverted from its bed and the people used solemnly to wash the sand as in california or australia  well whether in consequence of the gold as the alchemical philosophers would have held or not the trout of the glengaber burn were good  they were far shorter thicker and stronger than those of the many neighbouring brooks  i have fished up the burn with fly when it was very low hiding carefully behind the boulders and have been surprised at the size and gameness of the fish  as soon as the fly had touched the brown water it was sucked down and there was quite a fierce little fight before the fish came to hand  this all this was in the olden time long ago  the glengaber burn is about twenty miles from any railway station but on the last occasion when i visited it three louts were worming their way up it within twenty yards of each other each lout with his huge rod showing himself wholly to any trout that might be left in the water thirty years ago the burns that feed st marys loch were almost unfished and rare sport we had in them as boys staying at tibbie sheils famous cottage and sleeping in her boxbeds where so often the ettrick shepherd and christopher north have lain after copious toddy tis gone tis gone not in our time will any man like the ettrick shepherd need a cart to carry the trout he has slain in meggat water that stream flowing through a valley furnished with a grassgrown track for a road flows as i said into st marys loch  there are two or three large pools at the foot of the loch in which as a small boy hardly promoted to fly i have seen many monsters rising greedily  men got into the way of fishing these pools after a flood with minnow and thereby made huge baskets the big fish running up to feed out of the loch  but when last i rowed past meggat foot the delta of that historic stream was simply crowded with anglers stepping in in front of each other  i asked if this mob was a political demonstration but they stuck to business as if they had been on the regents canal  and this remember was twenty miles from any town  yet there is a burn on the border still undiscovered still full of greedy trout  i shall give the angler such a hint of its whereabouts as tiresias in hades gave to odysseus concerning the end of his second wanderings  when o stranger thou hast reached a burn where the shepherd asks thee for the newspaper wrapped round thy sandwiches that he may read the news then erect an altar to priapus god of fishermen and begin to angle boldly  probably the troops who fish our borderburns still manage to toss out some dozens of tiny fishes some six or eight to the pound  are not these triumphs chronicled in the scotsman  but they cannot imagine what angling was in the dead years nor what great trout dwelt below the linns of the crosscleugh burn beneath the red clusters of the rowan trees or in the waters of the little yarrow above the loch of the lowes  as to the lochs themselves now that anyone may put a boat on them now that there is perpetual trolling as well as flyfishing so that every fish knows the lures the fun is mainly over  in april no doubt something may still be done and in the silver twilights of june when as you drift on the still surface you hear the constant sweet plash of the rising trout a few and these good may be taken  but the water wants restocking and the burns in winter need watching in the interests of spawning fish  it is nobodys interest that i know of to take trouble and incur expense and free fishing by the constitution of the universe must end in bad fishing or in none at all  the best we can say for it is that vast numbers of persons may by the still waters of these meres enjoy the pleasures of hope  even solitude is no longer to be found in the scene which scott in marmion chooses as of all places the most solitary     here have i thought twere sweet to dwell    and rear again the chaplains cell  but no longer does     your horses hoof tread sound too rude    so stilly is the solitude  stilly with the horns and songs from omnibusses that carry tourists and with yells from nymphs and swains disporting themselves in the boats yarrow is only the old yarrow in winter  ages and revolutions must pass before the ancient peace returns and only if the golden age is born again and if we revive in it shall we find st marys what st marys was lang syne     ah buddha if thy tale be true       of still returning life    a monk may i be born anew       in valleys free from strife    a monk where meggat winds and laves    the lone st marys of the waves  yarrow which flows out of st marys loch was never a great favourite of mine as far as fishing goes  it had and probably deserved a great reputation and some good trout are still taken in the upper waters and there must be monsters in the deep black pools the dowie dens above bowhill  but i never had any luck there  the choicest stream of all was then probably the aill described by sir walter in william of deloraines midnight ride        where aill from mountains freed    down from the lakes did raving come    each wave was crested with tawny foam       like the mane of a chestnut steed  as not uncommonly happens scott uses rather large language here  the steepy grassy hillsides the great green tablelands in a recess of which the aill is born can hardly be called mountains  the lakes too through which it passes are much more like tarns or rather considering the flatness of their banks like wellmeaning ponds  but the aill near sinton and ashkirk was a delightful troutstream between its willow fringed banks a brook about the size of the lambourne  nowhere on the border were trout more numerous better fed and more easily beguiled  a week on test would i gladly give for one day of boyhood beside the aill where the casting was not scientific but where the fish rose gamely at almost any fly  nobody seemed to go there then and i fancy nobody need go there now  the nets and other dismal devices of the poachers from the towns have ruined that pleasant brook where one has passed so many a happy hour walking the long way home wet and weary but well content  into aill flows a burn the headshaw burn where there used to be good fish because it runs out of headshaw loch a weedfringed lonely tarn on the bleak level of the tableland  bleak as it may seem headshaw loch has the great charm of absolute solitude there are no tourists nor anglers here and the life of the birds is especially free and charming the trout too are large pink of flesh and game of character but the world of mankind need not rush thither  they are not to be captured by the wiles of men or so rarely that the most enthusiastic anglers have given them up  they are as safe in their tarn as those enchanted fish of the arabian nights  perhaps a silver sedge in a warm twilight may somewhat avail but the adventure is rarely achieved  these are the waters with which our boyhood was mainly engaged it is a pleasure to name and number them  memory that has lost so much and would gladly lose so much more brings vividly back the golden summer evenings by tweedside when the trout began to plash in the stillnessbrings back the long lounging solitary days beneath the woods of ashiesteildays so lonely that they sometimes in the end begat a superstitious eeriness  one seemed forsaken in an enchanted world one might see the two white fairy deer flit by bringing to us as to thomas rhymer the tidings that we must back to fairyland  other waters we knew well and loved the little salmonstream in the west that doubles through the loch and runs a mile or twain beneath its alders past its old celtic battlefield beneath the ruined shell of its feudal tower to the sea  many a happy day we had there on loch or stream with the big seatrout which have somehow changed their tastes and to day take quite different flies from the green body and the red body that led them to the landingnet long ago  dear are the twin alines but dearer is tweed and ettrick where our ancestor was drowned in a flood and his white horse was found next day feeding near his dead body on a little grassy island  there is a great pleasure in trying new methods in labouring after the delicate art of the dry flyfisher in the clear hampshire streams where the glassy tide flows over the waving tresses of crowsfoot below the poplar shade  but nothing can be so good as what is old and as far as angling goes is practically ruined the alternate pool and stream of the border waters where           the triple pride    of eildon looks over strathclyde  and the salmon cast murmurs hard by the wizards grave  they are all gone now the old allies and tutors in the anglers artthe kind gardener who baited our hooks the good scotch judge who gave us our first collection of flies the friend who took us with him on his salmon fishing expedition and made men of us with real rods and pirns of ancient make  the companions of those times are scattered and live under strange stars and in converse seasons by troutless waters  it is no longer the height of pleasure to be halfdrowned in tweed or lost on the hills with no luncheon in the basket  but except for scarcity of fish the scene is very little altered and one is a boy again in heart beneath the elms of yair or by the gullets at ashiesteil  however bad the sport it keeps you young or makes you young again and you need not follow ponce de leon to the western wilderness when in any river you knew of yore you can find the fountain of youth     loch awe   the boatmans yarns   good troutfishing in scotland south of the pentland firth is almost impossible to procure  there are better fish and more of them in the wandle within twenty minutes of victoria station than in any equal stretch of any scotch river with which i am acquainted  but the pleasure of angling luckily does not consist merely of the catching of fish  the wandle is rather too suburban for some tastes which prefer smaller trout better air and wilder scenery  to such spirits loch awe may with certain distinct cautions be recommended  there is more chance for anglers now in scotch lochs than in most scotch rivers  the lochs cannot so easily be netted lined polluted and otherwise made empty and ugly like the border streams  they are farther off from towns and tourists though distance is scarcely a complete protection  the best lochs for yellow trout are decidedly those of sutherland  there are no railways and there are two hundred lochs and more in the parish of assynt  there in june the angler who is a good pedestrian may actually enjoy solitude sometimes  there is a loch near strathnaver and far from human habitations where a friend of my own recently caught sixty five trout weighing about thirtyeight pounds  they are numerous and plucky but not large though a casual big lochtrout may be taken by trolling  but it is truly a far way to this anonymous lake and all round the regular fishing inns like inchnadampf and forsinard there is usually quite a little crowd of anglers  the sport is advertised in the newspapers more and more of our eager fellowcreatures are attracted more and more the shooting tenants are preserving waters that used to be open  the distance to sutherland makes that county almost beyond the range of a brief holiday  loch leven is nearer and at loch leven the scenery is better than its reputation while the trout are excellent though shy  but loch leven is too much cockneyfied by angling competitions moreover its pleasures are expensive  loch awe remains a loch at once large lovely not too distant and not destitute of sport  the reader of mr colquhouns delightful old book the moor and the loch must not expect loch awe to be what it once was  the railway which has made the north side of the lake so ugly has brought the district within easy reach of glasgow and of edinburgh  villas are built on many a beautiful height here couples come for their honeymoon here whole argosies of boats are anchored off the coasts here do steam launches ply  the hotels are extremely comfortable the boatmen are excellent boatmen good fishers and capital company  all this is pleasant but all this attracts multitudes of anglers and it is not in nature that sport should be what it once was  of the famous salmo ferox i cannot speak from experience  the huge courageous fish is still at home in loch awe but now he sees a hundred baits natural and artificial where he saw one in mr colquhouns time  the truly contemplative man may still sit in the stern of the boat with two rods out and possess his soul in patience as if he were fishing for tarpon in florida  i wish him luck but the diversion is little to my mind except in playing the fish if he comes all the skill is in the boatmen who know where to row at what pace and in what depth of water  as to the chances of salmon again they are perhaps less rare but they are not very frequent  the fish does not seem to take freely in the loch and on his way from the awe to the orchy  as to the troutfishing it is very bad in the months when most men take their holidays august and september  from the middle of april to the middle of june is apparently the best time  the loch is well provided with bays of different merit according to the feeding which they provide some come earlier some later into season  doubtless the most beautiful part of the lake is around the islands between the loch awe and the port sonachan hotels the green island with its strange celtic buryingground where the daffodils bloom among the sepulchres with their rude carvings of battles and of armed men has many trout around its shores  the favourite fishingplaces however are between port sonachan and ford  in the morning early the steamlaunch tows a fleet of boats down the loch and they drift back again fishing all the bays and arriving at home in time for dinner  too frequently the angler is vexed by finding a boat busy in his favourite bay  i am not sure that when the trout are really taking the water near port sonachan is not as good as any other  much depends on the weather  in the hard northeast winds of april we can scarcely expect trout to feed very freely anywhere  these of loch awe are very peculiar fish  i take it that there are two speciesone short thick golden and beautiful but these at least in april are decidedly scarce  the common sort is long lanky of a dark green hue and the reverse of lovely  most of them however are excellent at breakfast pink in the flesh and better flavoured i think than the famous trout of loch leven  they are also extremely game for their size a halfpound trout fights like a pounder  from thirty to forty fish in a days incessant angling is reckoned no bad basket  in genial may weather probably the trout average two to the pound and a pounder or two may be in the dish  but three to the pound is decidedly nearer the average at least in april  the flies commonly used are larger than what are employed in loch leven  a teal wing and red body a grouse hackle and the prismatic heckham peckham are among the favourites but it is said that flies no bigger than tweed flies are occasionally successful  in my own brief experience i have found the trout dour occasionally they would rise freely for an hour at noon or in the evening but often one passed hours with scarcely a rising fish  this may have been due to the bitterness of the weather or to my own lack of skill  not that lochs generally require much artifice in the angler  to sink the flies deep and move them with short jerks appears now and then to be efficacious there has been some controversy about loch awe trouting this is as favourable a view of the sport as i can honestly give  it is not excellent but thanks to the great beauty of the scenery the many points of view on so large and indented a lake the charm of the wood and wild flowers loch awe is well worth a visit from persons who do not pitch their hopes too high  loch awe would have contented me less had i been less fortunate in my boatman  it is often said that tradition has died out in the highlands it is living yet  after three days of north wind and failure it occurred to me that my boatman might know the local folklorethe fairy tales and traditions  as a rule tradition is a purely professional part of a guides stockin trade but the angler who had my barque in his charge proved to be a fresh fountain of legend  his own county is not argyleshire but inverness and we did not deal much in local myth  true he told me why loch awe ceasedlike the site of sodom and gomorrahto be a cultivated valley and became a lake where the trout are small and externally green  loch awe was once a fertile valley and it belonged to an old dame  she was called dame cruachan the same as the hill and she lived high up on the hillside  now there was a well on the hillside and she was always to cover up the well with a big stone before the sun set  but one day she had been working in the valley and she was weary and she sat down by the path on her way home and fell asleep  and the sun had gone down before she reached the well and in the night the water broke out and filled all the plain and what was land is now water  this then was the origin of loch awe  it is a little like the australian account of the deluge  that calamity was produced by a mans showing a woman the mystic turndun a native sacred toy  instantly water broke out of the earth and drowned everybody  this is merely a local legend such as boatmen are expected to know  as the green trout utterly declined to rise i tried the boatman with the irish story of why the gruagach gaire left off laughing and all about the hare that came and defiled his table as recited by mr curtin in his irish legends sampson low  co  the boatman did not know this fable but he did know of a red deer that came and spoke to a gentleman this was a story from the macpherson country  i give it first in the boatmans words and then we shall discuss the history of the legend as known to sir walter scott and james hogg the ettrick shepherd    the yarn of the black officer   it was about the last christmas of the hundredthe end of last century  they wanted men for the black watch 42nd highlanders and the black officer as they called him was sent to his own country to enlist them  some he got willingly and others by force  he promised he would only take them to london where the king wanted to review them and then let them go home  so they came though they little liked it and he was marching them south  now at night they reached a place where nobody would have halted them except the black officer for it was a great place for ghosts  and they would have run away if they had dared but they were afraid of him  so some tried to sleep in threes and fours and some were afraid to sleep and they sat up round the fire  but the black officer he went some way from the rest and lay down beneath a tree  now as the night wore on and whiles it would be dark and whiles the moon shone a man camethey did not know from wherea big red man and drew up to the fire and was talking with them  and he asked where the black officer was and they showed him  now there was one man shamus mackenzie they called him and he was very curious and he must be seeing what they did  so he followed the man and saw him stoop and speak to the officer but he did not waken then this individual took the black officer by the breast and shook him violently  then shamus knew who the stranger was for no man alive durst have done as much to the black officer  and there was the black officer kneeling to him  well what they said shamus could not hear and presently they walked away and the black officer came back alone  he took them to england but never to london and they never saw the king  he took them to portsmouth and they were embarked for india where we were fighting the french  there was a town we couldnt get into seringapatam and the black officer volunteered to make a tunnel under the walls  now they worked three days and whether it was the french heard them and let them dig on or not any way on the third day the french broke in on them  they kept sending men into the tunnel and more men and still they wondered who was fighting within and how we could have so large a party in the tunnel so at last they brought torches and there was no man alive on our side but the black officer and he had a wall of corpses built up in front of him and was fighting across it  he had more light to see by than the french had for it was dark behind him and there would be some light on their side  so at last they brought some combustibles and blew it all up  three days after that we took the town  some of our soldiers were sent to dig out the tunnel and with them was shamus mackenzie  and they never found the black officer i said thinking of young campbell in sekukoenis fighting koppie  oh yes said the boatman shamus found the body of the black officer all black with smoke and he laid him down on a green knoll and was standing over the dead man and was thinking of how many places they had been in together and of his own country and how he wished he was there again  then the dead mans face moved  shamus turned and ran for his life and he was running till he met some officers and he told them that the black officers body had stirred they thought he was lying but they went off to the place and one of them had the thought to take a flask of brandy in his pocket  when they came to the lifeless body it stirred again and with one thing and another they brought him round  the black officer was not himself again for long and they took him home to his own country and he lay in bed in his house  and every day a red deer would come to the house and go into his room and sit on a chair beside the bed speaking to him like a man  well the black officer got better again and went about among his friends and once he was driving home from a dinnerparty and shamus was with him  it was just the last night of the hundred  and on the road they met a man and shamus knew himfor it was him they had seen by the fire on the march as i told you at the beginning  the black officer got down from his carriage and joined the man and they walked a bit apart but shamushe was so curiouswhatever happened he must see them  and he came within hearing just as they were parting and he heard the stranger say this is the night  no said the black officer this night next year  so he came back and they drove home  a year went by and the black officer was seeking through the country for the twelve best men he could find to accompany him to some deerhunt or the like  and he asked shamus but he pretended he was illoh he was very unwelland he could not go but stayed in bed at home  so the black officer chose another man and he and the twelve set outthe thirteen of them  but they were never seen again  never seen again  were they lost in the snow  it did come on a heavy fall sir  but their bodies were found  no sirthough they searched high and low they are not found indeed till this day  it was thought the black officer had sold himself and twelve other men sir  to the devil  it would be that  for the narrator never mentions our ghostly foe which produces a solemn effect  this story was absolutely new to me and much i wished that mr louis stevenson could have heard it  the blending of the far east with the highlands reminds one of his master of ballantrae and what might he not make of that fairy red deer  my boatman too told me what mr stevenson says the highlanders will not tellthe name of the man who committed the murder of which alan breck was accused  but this secret i do not intend to divulge  the story of the black officer then seemed absolutely unpublished  but when sir walter scotts diary was given to the world in october 1890 it turned out that he was not wholly ignorant of the legend  in 1828 he complains that he has been annoyed by a lady because he had printed in the review a rawhead and bloodybones story of her father major macpherson who was lost in a snowstorm  this major macpherson was clearly the black officer  mr douglas the publisher of scotts diary discovered that the review mentioned vaguely by scott was the foreign quarterly no i july 1827  in an essay on hoffmanns novels sir walter introduced the tale as told to him in a letter from a nobleman some time deceased not more distinguished for his love of science than his attachment to literature in all its branches  the tale is too long to be given completely  briefly a captain m on st valentines day 1799 had been deershooting at an odd time of the year in the hills west of d  he did not return a terrible snowstorm set in and finally he and his friends were found dead in a bothy which the tempest had literally destroyed  large stones from the walls were found lying at distances of a hundred yards the wooden uprights were twisted like broken sticks  the captain was lying dead without his clothes on the bed one man was discovered at a distance another near the captain  then it was remembered that at the same bothy a month before a shepherd lad had inquired for the captain had walked with him for some time and that on the officers return a mysterious anxiety hung about him  a fire had also been seen blazing on an opposite height and when some of the gillies went to the spot there was no fire to be seen  on the day when the expedition had started the captain was warned of the ill weather but he said he must go  he was an unpopular man and was accused of getting money by procuring recruits from the highlands often by cruel means  our informer told us nothing more he neither told us his own opinion nor that of the country but left it to our own notions of the manner in which good and evil is rewarded in this life to suggest the author of the miserable event  he seemed impressed with superstitious awe on the subject and said there was na the like seen in a scotland  the man is far advanced in years and is a schoolmaster in the neighbourhood of rannoch  sir walter says that the feeling of superstitious awe annexed to the catastrophe could not have been improved by any circumstances of additional horror which a poet could have invented  but is there not something more moving still in the boatmans version they were never seen again    they were not found indeed till this day  the folklorist of course is eager to know whether the boatmans much more complete and connected narrative is a popular mythical development in the years between 1820 and 1890 or whether the schoolmaster of rannoch did not tell all he knew  it is unlikely i think that the siege of seringapatam would have been remembered so long in connection with the black officer if it had not formed part of his original legend meanwhile the earliest printed notice of the event with which i am acquainted a notice only ten years later than the date of the majors death in 1799 is given by hogg in the spy 181011 pp 1013  i offer an abridgment of the narrative  about the end of last century major macpherson and a party of friends went out to hunt on the grampians between athole and badenoch  they were highly successful and in the afternoon they went into a little bothy and having meat and drink they abandoned themselves to jollity  during their merrymaking a young man entered whose appearance particularly struck and somewhat shocked macpherson the stranger beckoned to the major and he followed him instantly out of the bothy  when they parted after apparently having had some earnest conversation the stranger was out of sight long before the major was halfway back though only twenty yards away  the major showed on his return such evident marks of trepidation that the mirth was marred and no one cared to ask him questions  this was early in the week and on friday the major persuaded his friends to make a second expedition to the mountains from which they never returned  on a search being made their dead bodies were found in the bothy some considerably mangled but some were not marked by any wound  it was visible that this had not been effected by human agency the bothy was torn from its foundations and scarcely a vestige left of it and one huge stone which twelve men could not have raised was tossed to a considerable distance  on this event scotts beautiful ballad of glenfinlas is said to have been founded  as will be seen presently hogg was wrong about glenfinlas the boatman was acquainted with a traditional version of that wild legend  i found another at rannoch  the highland fairies are very vampirish  the loch awe boatman lives at a spot haunted by a shadowy maiden  her last appearance was about thirty years ago  two young men were thrashing corn one morning when the joint of the flail broke  the owner went to larichban and entered an outhouse to look for a piece of sheepskin wherewith to mend the flail  he was long absent and his companion went after him  he found him struggling in the arms of a ghostly maid who had nearly murdered him but departed on the arrival of his friend  it is not easy to make out what these ghoulish women arenot fairies exactly nor witches nor vampires  for example three shepherds at a lonely sheiling were discoursing of their loves and it was oh how happy i should be if katie were here or maggie or bessie as the case might be  so they would say and so they would wish and lo one evening the three girls came to the door of the hut  so they made them welcome but one of the shepherds was playing the jewsharp and he did not like the turn matters were taking  the two others stole off into corners of the darkling hut with their lovers but this prudent lad never took his lips off the jewsharp  harping is good if no ill follows it said the semblance of his sweetheart but he never answered  he played and thrummed and out of one dark corner trickled red blood into the firelight and out of another corner came a current of blood to meet it  then he slowly rose still harping and backed his way to the door and fled into the hills from these cruel airy shapes of false desire  and do the people actually believe all that  ay do they  that is the boatmans version of scotts theme in glenfinlas  witches played a great part in his narratives  in the boatmans country there is a plain and on the plain is a knoll about twice the height of a onestoreyed cottage and pointed like a sugarloaf  the old people remember or have heard that this mound was not there when they were young  it swelled up suddenly out of the grave of a witch who was buried there  the witch was a great enemy of a shepherd  every morning she would put on the shape of a hare and run before his dogs and lead them away from the sheep  he knew it was right to shoot at her with a crooked sixpence and he hit her on the hind leg and the dogs were after her and chased the hare into the old womans cottage  the shepherd ran after them and there he found them tearing at the old woman but the hare was twisted round their necks and she was crying tighten hare tighten and it was choking them  so he tore the hare off the dogs and then the old woman begged him to save her from them and she promised never to plague him again  but if the old dogs teeth had been as sharp as the young ones she would have been a dead woman  when this witch died she knew she could never lie in safety in her grave but there was a very safe churchyard in aberdeenshire a hundred and fifty miles away and if she could get into that she would be at rest and she rose out of her grave and off she went and the devil after her on a black horse but praise to the swiftness of her feet she won the churchyard before him  her first grave swelled up oh as high as that green hillock  witches are still in active practice  there was an old woman very miserly  she would alway be taking one of her neighbours sheep from the hills and they stood it for long they did not like to meddle with her at last it grew so bad that they brought her before the sheriff and she got eighteen months in prison  when she came out she was very angry and set about making an image of the woman whose sheep she had taken  when the image was made she burned it and put the ashes in a burn  and it is a very curious thing but the woman she made it on fell into a decline and took to her bed  the witch and her family went to america  they kept a little inn in a country place and people who slept in it did not come out again  they were discovered and the eldest son was hanged he confessed that he had committed nineteen murders before he left scotland  they were not a nice family  the father was a very respectable old man  the boatman gave me the name of this wicked household but it is perhaps better forgotten  the extraordinary thing is that this appears to be the highland introduction to or part first of a gloomy and sanguinary story of a murder holean inn of assassins in a lonely district of the united states which mr louis stevenson heard in his travels there and told to me some years ago  the details have escaped my memory but as mr stevenson narrated them they rivalled de quinceys awful story of williamss murders in the ratcliffe highway  life must still be haunted in badenoch as it was on idas hill by forms of unearthly beauty the goddess or the ghost yet wooing the shepherd indeed the boatman told me many stories of living superstition and terrors of the night but why should i exhaust his wallet  to be sure it seemed very full of tales these offered here may be but the legends which came first to his hand  the boatman is not himself a believer in the fairy world or not more than all sensible men ought to be  the supernatural is too pleasant a thing for us to discard in an earnest scientific manner like mr kiplings aurelian mcgubben  perhaps i am more superstitious than the boatman and the yarns i swopped with him about ghosts i have met would seem even more mendacious to possessors of pocket microscopes and of the modern spirit  but i would rather have one banshee story than fifteen pages of proof that life which began as a cell with a c is to end as a sell with an s  it should be added that the boatman has given his consent to the printing of his yarns  on being offered a moiety of the profits he observed that he had no objection to these but that he entirely declined to be responsible for any share of the expenses  would that all authors were as sagacious for then the amateur novelist and the minor poet would vex us no more  perhaps i should note that i have not made the boatman say whateffer because he doesnt  the occasional use of the imperfect is almost his only gaelic idiom  it is a great comfort and pleasure when the trout do not rise to meet a skilled and unaffected narrator of the old beliefs old legends as ancient as the hills that girdle and guard the loch or as antique at least as mans dwelling among the mountainsthe yellow hill the calf hill the hill of the stack  the beauty of the scene the pleasant talk the daffodils on the green isle among the celtic graves compensate for a certain dourness among the fishes of loch awe  on the occasions when they are not dour they rise very pleasant and free but in these brief moments it is not of legends and folklore that you are thinking but of the landingnet  the boatman by the way was either not well acquainted with marchenceltic nurserytales such as campbell of islay collected or was not much interested in them or perhaps had the shyness about narrating this particular sort of old wives fables which is so common  people who do know them seldom tell them in sassenach     lochfishing   little loch beg   there is something mysterious in lochfishing in the tastes and habits of the fish which inhabit the innumerable lakes and tarns of scotland  it is not always easy to account either for their presence or their absence for their numbers or scarcity their eagerness to take or their dourness  for example there is loch borlan close to the wellknown little inn of altnagealgach in sutherland  unless that piece of water is greatly changed it is simply full of fish of about a quarter of a pound which will rise at almost any time to almost any fly  there is not much pleasure in catching such tiny and eager trout but in the season complacent anglers capture and boast of their many dozens  on the other hand a year or two ago a beginner took a fourpound trout there with the fly  if such trout exist in borlan it is hard to explain the presence of the innumerable fry  one would expect the giants of the deep to keep down their population  not far off is another small lake loch awe which has invisible advantages over loch borlan yet there the trout are or were fat and fair of flesh like tamlane in the ballad wherefore are the trout in loch tummell so big and strong from one to five pounds and so scarce while those in loch awe are numerous and small  one occasionally sees examples of how quickly trout will increase in weight and what curious habits they will adopt  in a county of south western scotland there is a large village populated by a keenly devoted set of anglers who miss no opportunity  within a quarter of a mile of the village is a small tarn very picturesquely situated among low hills and provided with the very tiniest feeder and outflow  there is a sluice at the outflow and for some reason the farmer used to let most of the water out in the summer of every year  in winter the tarn is used by the curling club  it is not deep has rather a marshy bottom and many ducks snipe and wildfowl generally dwell among the reeds and marish plants of its sides  nobody ever dreamed of fishing here but one day a rustic glowering idly over the wall of the adjacent road saw fish rising  he mentioned his discovery to an angler who is said to have caught some large trout but tradition varies about everything except that the fish are very dour  one evening in august a warm still evening i happened to visit the tarn  as soon as the sun fell below the hills it was literally alive with large trout rising  as far as one could estimate from the brief view of heads and shoulders they were sometimes two or three pounds in weight  i got my rod of course as did a rural friend  mine was a small cane rod his a salmonrod  i fished with one testfly he with three large lochflies  the fish were rising actually at our feet but they seemed to move about very much never or seldom rising twice exactly at the same place  the hypothesis was started that there were but few of them and that they ran round and round like a stage army to give an appearance of multitude  but this appears improbable  what is certain was our utter inability ever to get a rise from the provoking creatures  the dry fly is difficult to use on a loch as there is no stream to move it and however gently you draw it it makes a wakea trail behind it  wet or dry or twixt wet and dry like the convivial person in the song we could none of us raise them  i did catch a small but beautifully proportioned and pinkfleshed trout with the alder but everything else silver sedge and all everything from midge to mayfly in the late twilight was offered to them in vain  in windy or cloudy weather it was just as useless indeed i never saw them rise except in a warm summer stillness at and after sunset  probably they would have taken a small red worm pitched into the ripple of a rise but we did not try that  after a few evenings they seemed to give up rising altogether  i dont feel certain that they had not been netted yet no trout seemed to be on sale in the village their presence in the water may perhaps be accounted for thus they may have come into the loch from the river by way of the tiny feeder but the rivertrout are both scarce and small  a new farmer had given up letting the water off and probably there must have been very rich feeding watershrimps or snails which might partly account for the refusal to rise at the artificial fly  or they may have been ottered by the villagers though that would rather have made them rise short than not rise at all  there is another loch on an extremely remote hillside eight miles from the smallest town in a pastoral country  there are trout enough in the loch and of excellent size and flavour but you scarcely ever get them they rise freely but they always rise short  it is i think the most provoking loch i ever fished  you raise them they come up freely showing broad sides of a ruddy gold like the handsomest test trout but they almost invariably miss the hook  you do not land one out of twenty the reason is apparently that people from the nearest town use the otter in the summer evenings when these trout rise best  in a sutherland loch mr edward moss tells us in a season in sutherland that he once found an elegant otter a wellmade engine of some unscrupulous tourist lying in the bottom of the water on a sunny day  at loch skene on the top of a hill twenty miles from any town otters are occasionally found by the keeper or the shepherds concealed near the shore  the practice of ottering can give little pleasure to any but a depraved mind and nothing educates trout so rapidly into rising short why they are not to be had when they are rising most vehemently to themselves is another mystery  a few rises are encouraging but when the water is all splashing with rises as a rule the angler is only tantalised  a windy day a day with a large ripple but without white waves breaking is as a rule best for a loch  in some lochs the sea trout prefer such a hurricane that a boat can hardly be kept on the water  i have known a strong north wind in autumn put down the seatrout whereas the salmon rose with unusual eagerness just in the shallows where the waves broke in foam on the shore  the best day i ever had with seatrout was muggy and grey and the fish were most eager when the water was still except for a tremendously heavy shower of rain a singing shower as george chapman has it  on that day two rods caught thirtynine seatrout weighing forty pounds  but it is difficult to say beforehand what day will do well except that sunshine is bad a north wind worse and no wind at all usually means an empty basket  even to this rule there are exceptions and one of these is in the case of a tarn which i shall call pleonastically little loch beg  this is not the real name of the lochquite enough people know its real name already  nor does it seem necessary to mention the district where the loch lies hidden suffice it to say that a land of more streams and scarcer trout you will hardly find  we had tried all the rivers and burns to no purpose and the lochs are capricious and overfished  one loch we had not tried loch beg  you walk or drive a few miles from any village then you climb a few hundred yards of hill and from the ridge you see on one hand a great amphitheatre of green and purple mountainsides in the west on the east within a hundred yards under a slope is loch beg  it is not a mile in circumference and all but some eighty yards of shore is defended against the angler by wide beds of waterlilies with their pretty white floating lamps or by tall sedges and reeds  nor is the wading easy  four steps you make with safety at the fifth your foremost leg sinks in mud apparently bottomless  most people fish only the eastern side whereof a few score yards are open with a rocky and gravelly bottom  now all lochs have their humours  in some trout like a big fly in some a small one but almost all do best with a rough wind or rain  i knew enough of loch beg to approach it at noon on a blazing day of sunshine when the surface was like glass  it was like that when first i saw it and a shepherd warned us that we would dae naething we did little indeed but i rose nearly every rising fish i cast over losing them all too and in some cases being broken as i was using very fine gut and the fish were heavy  another trial seemed desirable and the number of rising trout was most tempting  all over it trout were rising to the natural fly with big circles like those you see in the test at twilight while in the centre where no artificial fly can be cast for want of a boat a big fish would throw himself out of the water in his eagerness one such i saw which could not have weighed under three pounds a short thick darkyellow fish  i was using a light twohanded rod and fancied that a single testfly on very fine tackle would be the best lure  it certainly rose the trout if one threw into the circle they made but they never were hooked  one fish of about a pound and a half threw himself out of the water at it hit it and broke the fine tackle  so i went on raising them but never getting them  as long as the sun blazed and no breeze ruffled the water they rose bravely but a cloud or even a ripple seemed to send them down  at last i tried a big alder and with that i actually touched a few and even landed several on the shelving bank  their average weight as we proved on several occasions was exactly threequarters of a pound but we never succeeded in landing any of the really big ones  a local angler told me he had caught one of two pounds and lost another like a young grilse after he had drawn it on to the bank  i can easily believe it for in no loch but one have i ever seen so many really big and handsome fish feeding  loch beg is within a mile of a larger and famous loch but it is infinitely better though the other looks much more favourable in all ways for sport  the only place where fishing is easy as i have said is a mere strip of coast under the hill where there is some gravel and the mouth of a very tiny feeder usually dry  off this place the trout rose freely but not near so freely as in a certain corner quite out of reach without a boat where the leviathans lived and sported  after the little expanse of open shore had been fished over a few times the trout there seemed to grow more shy and there was a certain monotony in walking this tiny quarterdeck of space  so i went round to the west side where the waterlilies are  fish were rising about three yards beyond the weedy beds and i foolishly thought i would try for them  now you cannot overestimate the difficulty of casting a fly across yards of waterlilies  you catch in the weeds as you lift your line for a fresh cast and then you have to extricate it laboriously shortening line and then to let it out again and probably come to grief once more  i saw a trout rise with a huge sullen circle dimpling round him cast over him raised him and missed him  the water was perfectly still and the plop made by these fish was very exciting and tantalising  the next that rose took the alder and of course ran right into the broad band of lilies  i tried all the dodges i could think of and all that mr halford suggests  i dragged at him hard  i gave him line  i sat down and endeavoured to disengage my thoughts but i never got a glimpse of him and finally had to wade as far in as i dared and save as much of the casting line as i could it was very little  there was one thing to be said for the trout on this side they meant business  they did not rise shyly like the others but went for the fly if it came at all near them and then down they rushed and bolted into the lilyroots  a new plan occurred to me  i put on about eighteen inches of the stoutest gut i had to the end i knotted the biggest seatrout fly i possessed and hooking the next fish that rose i turned my back on the loch and ran uphill with the rod  looking back i saw a trout well over a pound flying across the lilies but alas the hold was not strong enough and he fell back  again and again i tried this method invariably hooking the trout though the heavy short castingline and the big fly fell very awkwardly in the dead stillness of the water  i had some exciting runs with them for they came eagerly to the big fly and did not miss it as they had missed the red quill or whitchurch dun with which at first i tried to beguile them  one of only the average weight i did drag out over the lilies the others fell off in midjourney but they never broke the uncompromising stout tackle  with the first chill of evening they ceased rising and i left them not ungrateful for their very peculiar manners and customs  the chances are that the trout beyond the band of weeds never see an artificial fly and they are therefore the more guilelessat least late in the season  in spring i believe the lilies are less in the way and i fear some one has put a berthon boat on the loch in april  but it is not so much what one catches in loch beg as the monsters which one might catch that make the tarn so desirable  the loch seems to prove that any hilltarn might be made a good place for sport if trout were introduced where they do not exist already  but the size of these in loch beg puzzles me nor can one see how they breed as breed they do for twice or thrice i caught a fingerling and threw him in again  no burn runs out of the loch and even in a flood the feeder is so small and its course so extremely steep that one cannot imagine where the fish manage to spawn  the only loch known to me where the common trout are of equal size is on the border  it is extremely deep with very clear water and with scarce any spawning ground  on a summer evening the trout are occasionally caught three weighing seven pounds were taken one night a year or two ago  i have not tried the evening fishing but at all other times of day have found them the dourest of trout and they grow dourer  but one is always lured on by the spectacle of the monsters which throw themselves out of water with a splash that echoes through all the circuit of the low green hills  they probably reach at least four or five pounds but it is unlikely that the biggest take the fly and one may doubt whether they propagate their species as small trout are never seen there  there are two ways of enlarging the size of trout which should be carefully avoided  pike are supposed to keep down the population and leave more food for the survivors minnows are supposed to be nourishing food  both of these novelties are dangerous  pike have been introduced in that long lovely sheet of water loch ken and i have never once seen the rise of a trout break that surface so hideously serene  trout in lochs which have become accustomed to feeding on minnows are apt to disdain fly altogether  of course there are lochs in which good trout coexist with minnows and with pike but these inmates are too dangerous to be introduced  the introduction too of loch leven trout is often disappointing  sometimes they escape down the burn into the river in floods sometimes perhaps for lack of proper food and sufficient they dwindle terribly in size and become no better than brownies  in st marys loch in selkirkshire some canadian trout were introduced  little or nothing has been seen of them unless some small creatures of a quarter of a pound extraordinarily silvery and more often in the air than in the water when hooked are these children of the remote west  if they grew up and retained their beauty and sprightliness they would be excellent substitutes for seatrout  almost all experiments in stocking lochs have their perils except the simple experiment of putting trout where there were no trout before  this can do no harm and they may increase in weight let us hope not in wisdom like the curiously heavy and shy fish mentioned in the beginning of this paper    loch leven   i had a friend once an angler who in winter was fond of another sport he liked to cast his louis into the green baize pond at monte carlo and on the whole he was generally broken  he seldom landed the golden fish of the old mans dream in theocritus  when the croupier had gaffed all his money he would repent and say now that would have kept me at loch leven for a fortnight  one used to wonder whether a fortnight of loch leven was worth an afternoon of the pleasure of losing at monte carlo  the loch has a name for being cockneyfied beset by whole fleets of competitive anglers from various angling clubs in scotland  that men should competitively angle shows indeed a great want of true angling sentiment  to fish in a crowd is odious to work hard for prizes of flasks and creels and flybooks is to mistake the true meaning of the pastime  however in this crowded age men are so constituted that they like to turn a contemplative exercise into a kind of bank holiday  there is no use in arguing with such persons the worst of their pleasure is that it tends to change a scotch loch into something like the pond of the welsh harp at hendon  it is always good news to read in the papers how the dundee walton society had a bad day and how the first prize was won by mr macneesh with five trout weighing three pounds and three quarters  loch leven then is crowded and cockneyfied by competitions it has also no great name for beauty of landscape  every one to his own taste in natural beauty but in this respect i think loch leven is better than its reputation  it is certainly more pictorial so to speak than some remote moor lochs up near cape wrath forsinard in particular where the scenery looks like one gigantic series of brown baps flat scotch scones all of low elevation all precisely similar to each other  loch leven is not such a cockney place as the majority of men who have not visited it imagine  it really is larger than the welsh harp at hendon and the scenery though not like that of ben cruachan or ben mohr excels the landscape of middlesex  at the northern end is a small town grey with some red roofs and one or two characteristic fifeshire churchtowers squat and strong  there are also a few factory chimneys which are not fair to outward view nor appropriate by a lochside  on the west are ranges of distant hills low but not uncomely  on the east rises a beautiful moorland steep with broken and graceful outlines  when the sun shines on the red tilled land in spring when the smoke of burning gorse coils up all day long into the sky as if the great spirit were taking his pipe of peace on the mountains when the islands are mirrored on the glassy water then the artist rejoices though the angler knows that he will waste his day  as far as fishing goes he is bound to be clean as the boatmen sayto catch nothing but the solemn peace and the walls and ruined towers of queen marys prison may partially console the fisher  the accommodation is agreeable there is a pleasant innan old townhouse perhaps of some great family when the great families did not rush up to london but spent their winters in such country towns as dumfries and st andrews  the inn has a great green garden at its doors and if the talk is mainly of fishing and if every one tells of his monster trout that escaped the net there is much worse conversation than that  when you reach kinross and after excellent ham and eggs begin to make a start the cockney element is most visible at the first  everybodys name is registered in a book each pays a considerable but not exorbitant fee for the societyoften well worth the moneyand the assistance of boatmen  these gentlemen are also well provided with luncheon and beer and on the whole there is more pleasure in the life of a loch leven boatman than in most arts crafts or professions  he takes the rod when his patron is lazy it is said that he often catches the trout 1 he sees a good deal of good company and if his basket be heavy who so content as he  the first thing is to row out to a good bay and which will prove a good bay depends on the strength and direction of the wind  perhaps the best fishing is farthest off at the end of a long row but the best scenery is not so distant  a good deal hangs on an early start when there are many boats out  loch leven is a rather shallow loch seldom much over fifteen feet deep save where a long narrow rent or geological flaw runs through the bottom the water is of a queer glaucous green olivecoloured or rather like the tint made when you wash out a box of watercolour paints  this is not so pretty as the black wave of loch awe or loch shin but has a redeeming quality in the richness of the feeding for trout  these are fabled to average about a pound but are probably a trifle under that weight on the whole  they are famous and according to sir walter scott were famous as long ago as in queen marys time for the bright silver of their sides for their pink flesh and gameness when hooked theorists have explained all this by saying that they are the descendants of landlocked salmon  the flies used on the loch are smaller than those favoured in the highlands they are sold attached to casts and four flies are actually employed at once  probably two are quite enough at a time  if a veteran trout is attracted by seeing four flies all of different species and these like nothing in nature all conspiring to descend on him at once he must be less cautious than we generally find him  the hampshire angler of course will sneer at the whole proceeding the chucking and chancing it in the queercoloured wave and the use of so many fanciful entomological specimens  but the hampshire angler is very welcome to try his arts in a calm and his naturallooking cockedup flies  he will probably be defeated by a grocer from greenock sinking his four flies very deep as is by some experts recommended  the trout are capricious perhaps as capricious as any known to the angler but they are believed to prefer a strong east wind and a dark day  the east wind is nowhere perhaps so bad as people fancy it is certainly not so bad as the north wind and on loch leven it is the favourite  the man who is lucky enough to hit on the right day and to land a couple of dozen loch leven trout has very good reason to congratulate himself and need envy nobody  but such days and such takes are rare and the summer of 1890 was much more unfortunate than that of 1889  one great mistake is made by the company which farms the loch stocks it supplies the boats and regulates the fishing  they permit trolling with angels or phantoms or the natural minnow  now trolling may be comparatively legitimate when the boat is being pulled against the wind to its drift but there is no more skill in it than in sitting in an omnibus  but for trolling many a boat would come home clean in the evening on days of calm or when for other reasons of their own the trout refuse to take the artificial fly  yet there are men at loch leven who troll all day and poor sport it must be as a trout of a pound or so has no chance on a trollingrod  this method is inimical to flyfishing but is such a consolation to the inefficient angler that one can hardly expect to see it abolished  the unsuccessful clamour for trolling instead of consoling themselves as sportsmen should do with the conversation of the gillies their anecdotes of great trout and their reminiscences of great anglers especially of the late mr russell the famed editor of the scotsman  this humourist is gradually winning his way to the mythical  all fishing stories are attached to him his eloquence is said in the language of the historian of the buccaneers to have been florid he is reported to have thrown his flybook into loch leven on an unlucky day saying you brutes take your choice and a rock which he once hooked and held on to is named after him on the tweed  in addition to the humane and varied conversation of the boatmen there is always the pure pleasure of simply gazing at the hillsides and at the islands  they are as much associated with the memory of mary stuart as hermitage or even holyrood  on that island was her prison here the rude morton tried to bully her into signing away her rights hence she may often have watched the shore at night for the lighting of a beacon a sign that a rescue was at hand  the hills at least are much as she may have seen them and the square towers and crumbling walls on the island met her eyes when they were all too strong  the quay is no longer rude as when the abbot was written and is crowded with the green boats of the loch leven company but you still land on her island under the huge old tree which scott saw which the unhappy mary may herself have seen  the small garden and the statues are gone the garden whence roland graeme led mary to the boat and to brief liberty and hope unfulfilled  only a kind of ground plan remains of the halls where lindesay and ruthven browbeat her forlorn majesty  but you may climb the staircase where roland graeme stood sentinel and feel a touch of what pepys felt when he kissed a dead queenkatherine of valois  like roland graeme the queen may have been wearied to death of this castle of loch leven where in spring all seems so beautiful the trees budding freshly above the yellow celandine and among the grey prison walls  it was a kindlier prison house than fotheringay and minds peaceful and contented would gladly have taken this for a hermitage  the roman emperors used to banish too powerful subjects to the lovely isles that lie like lilies on the aegean  plutarch tried to console these exiles by showing them how fortunate they were far from the bustle of the forum the vices the tortures the noise and smoke of rome happy if they chose in their gardens with the blue waters breaking on the rocks and as he is careful to add with plenty of fishing  mr mahaffy calls this rhetorical consolation and the exiles may have been of his mind  but the exiles would have been wise to listen to plutarch and had i enjoyed the luck of mary stuart when loch leven was not overfished when the trout were uneducated never would i have plunged into politics again  she might have been very happy with ronsards latest poems with italian romances with a boat on the loch and some rizzio to sing to her on the still summer days  from her castle she would hear how the politicians were squabbling lying raising a man to divinity and stoning him next day cutting each others heads off swearing and forswearing themselves conspiring and caballing  suave mari and the peace of loch leven and the island hermitage would have been the sweeter for the din outside  a woman a queen a stuart could not attain and perhaps ought not to have attained this epicureanism mary stuart had her chance and missed it perhaps after all her shrewish female gaoler made the passionless life impossible  these at loch leven are natural reflections  the place has a charm of its own especially if you make up your mind not to be disappointed not to troll and not to envy the more fortunate anglers who shout to you the number of their victories across the wave  even at loch leven we may be contemplative may be quiet and go afishing 2     the bloody doctor  a bad day on clearburn   thou askest me my brother how first and where i met the bloody doctor the tale is weird so weird that to a soul less proved than thine i scarce dare speak of the adventure        this perhaps would be the right way of beginning a story not that it is a story exactly with the title forced on me by the name and nature of the hero  but i do not think i could keep up the style without a lady collaborator besides i have used the term weird twice already and thus played away the trumps of modern picturesque diction  to return to our doctor many a bad day have i had on clearburn loch and never a good one  but one thing draws me always to the loch when i have the luck to be within twenty miles of it  there are trout in clearburn  the border angler knows that the trout in his native waters is nearly as extinct as the dodo  many causes have combined to extirpate the shy and spirited fish  first there are too many anglers     twixt holy lee and clovenfords    a tentier bit ye canna hae  sang that good old angler now with god mr thomas tod stoddart  but between holy lee and clovenfords you may see half a dozen rods on every pool and stream  there goes that leviathan the angler from london who has been beguiled hither by the artless guide of mr watson lyall there fishes the farmers lad and the schoolmaster and the wandering weaver out of work or disinclined to work  in his rags with his thin face and red goatee beard with his hazel wand and his homemade reel there is withal something kindly about this poor fellow this true sportsman  he loves better to hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep he wanders from depopulated stream to depopulated burn and all is fish that comes to his fly  fingerlings he keeps and does not return to the water as pitying their youth  let us not grudge him his sport as long as he fishes fair and he is always good company  but he with all the other countless fishermen make fish so rare and so wary that except after a flood in meggat or the douglas burn trout are scarce to be taken by ordinary skill  as for     thae reiving cheils    frae galashiels  who use nets and salmon roe and poisons and dynamite they are miscreants indeed they spoil the sport not of the rich but of their own class and of every man who would be quiet and go angling in the sacred streams of christopher north and the shepherd  the mills with their dyes and dirt are also responsible for the dearth of trout     untainted yet thy stream fair teviot runs  leyden sang but now the stream is very much tainted indeed below hawick like tweed in too many places  thus for a dozen reasons trout are nigh as rare as red deer  clearburn alone remains full of unsophisticated fishes and i have the less hesitation in revealing this because i do not expect the wanderer who may read this page to be at all more successful than myself  no doubt they are sometimes to be had by the basketful but not often nor by him who thinks twice before risking his life by smothering in a peaty bottom  to reach clearburn loch if you start from the teviot you must pass through much of scotts country and most of leydens  i am credibly informed that persons of culture have forgotten john leyden  he was a linguist and a poet and the friend of walter scott and knew     the mind whose fearless frankness naught could move    the friendship like an elder brothers love  we remember what distant and what deadly shore has leydens cold remains and people who do not know may not care to be reminded  leaving teviot with leyden for a guide you walk or drive     where bortha hoarse that loads the meads with sand    rolls her red tide  not that it was red when we passed but electro purior     through slaty hills whose sides are shagged with thorn    where springs in scattered tufts the dark green corn    towers woodgirt harden far above the vale  and very dark green almost blue was the corn in september 1888 upwards always upwards goes the road till you reach the crest and watch far below the wide champaign like a sea broken by the shapes of hills windburg and eildon and priesthaughswire and the rough skirts of stormy ruberslaw and penchrise and the twin maidens shaped like the breasts of helen  it is an old land of war of otterburn and ancrum and the raid of the fair dodhead but the plough has passed over all but the upper pastoral solitudes  turning again to the downward slope you see the loch of alemoor small and sullen with alewater feeding it  nobody knows much about the trout in it  it is reckoned the residence of the watercow a monster like the australian bunyip there was a watercow in scotts loch of cauldshiels above abbotsford the watercow has not lately emerged from alemoor to attack the casual angler  you climb again by gentle slopes till you reach a most desolate tableland  far beyond it is the round top of whitecombe which again looks down on st marys loch and up the moffat and across the meggat water but none of these are within the view  round are pastorum loca vasta lands of buccleugh and bellenden deloraine sinton headshaw and glack  deloraine by the way is pronounced delorran and perhaps is named from orran the celtic saint  on the right lies not far from the road a grey sheet of water and this is clearburn where first i met the doctor  the loch to be plain is almost unfishable  it is nearly round and everywhere except in a small segment on the eastern side is begirt with reeds of great height  these reeds again grow in a peculiarly uncomfortable quaggy bottom which rises and falls or rather which jumps and sinks when you step on it like the seat of a very luxurious armchair  moreover the bottom is pierced with many springs wherein if you set foot you shall have thrown your last cast  by watching the loch when it is frozen a man might come to learn something of the springs but even so it is hard to keep clear of them in summer  now the wind almost always blows from the west dead against the little piece of gravelly shore at the eastern side so that casting against it is hard work and unprofitable  on this day by a rare chance the wind blew from the east though the sky at first was a brilliant blue and the sun hot and fierce  i walked round to the east side waded in and caught two or three small fellows  it was slow work when suddenly there began the greatest rise of trout i ever saw in my life from the edge of the loch as far as one could clearly see across it there was that endless plashing murmur of all sounds in this world the sweetest to the ear  within the view of the eye on each cast there were a dozen trout rising all about never leaping but seriously and solemnly feeding  now is my chance at last i fancied but it was not sofar from it  i might throw over the very noses of the beasts but they seldom even glanced at the artificial fly  i tried them with greenwells glory with a march brown with the woodcock wing and hare lug but it was almost to no purpose  if one did raise a fish he meant not businessall but a casual brute which broke the already weakened part of a small gluedup cane rod  i had to twist a piece of paper round the broken end wet it and push it into the joint where it hung on somehow but was not pleasant to cast with  from twelve to halfpast one the gorging went merrily forward and i saw what the fish were rising at  the whole surface of the loch at least on the east side was absolutely peppered with large hideous insects  they had big greywhite wings bodies black as night and brilliant crimson legs or feelers or whatever naturalists call them  the trout seemed as if they could not have too much of these abominable wretches and the flies were blown across the loch not singly but in populous groups  i had never seen anything like them in any hookbook nor could i deceive the trout by the primitive dodge of tying a red thread round the shank of a dark fly  so i waded out and fell to munching a frugal sandwich and watching nature not without a cigarette  now nature is all very well  i have nothing to say against her of a sunday or when trout are not rising  but she was no comfort to me now smiling she gazed on my discomfiture  the lovely lines of the hills curving about the loch and with their deepest dip just opposite where i sat were all of a golden autumn brown except in the violet distance the grass of parnassus grew thick and white around me with its moonlight tint of green in the veins  on a hillside by a brook the countryfolk were winning their hay and their voices reached me softly from far off on the loch the marshfowl flashed and dipped the wild ducks played and dived and rose first circling high and higher then marshalled in the shape of a v they made for alemoor  a solitary heron came quite near me and tried his chance with the fish but i think he had no luck  all this is pleasant to remember and i made rude sketches in the flyleaves of a copy of hoggs poems where i kept my flies  but what joy was there in this while the take grew fainter and ceased at least near the shore out in the middle where few flies managed to float the trout were at it till dark  but near shore there was just one trout who never stopped gorging all day  he lived exactly opposite the nick in the distant hills and exactly a yard farther out than i could throw a fly  he was a big one and i am inclined to think that he was the devil  for if i had stepped in deeper and the water had come over my wading boots the odds are that my frail days on earth would have been ended by a chill and i knew this and yet that fish went on tempting me to my ruin  i suppose i tried to reach him a dozen times and cast a hundred but it was to no avail  at length as the afternoon grew grey and chill i pitched a rock at him by way of showing that i saw through his fiendish guile and i walked away  there was no rise now and the lake was leaden and gloomy  when i reached the edge of the deep reeds i tried once or twice to wade through them within casting distance of the water but was always driven off by the traitorous quagginess of the soil  at last taking my courage in both hands i actually got so near that i could throw a fly over the top of the tall reeds and then came a heavy splash and the wretched little broken rod nearly doubled up  hooray here i am among the big ones i said and held on  it was now that i learned the nature of neros diversion when he was an angler in the lake of darkness  the loch really did deserve the term grim the water here was black the sky was ashen the long green reeds closed cold about me and beyond them there was trout that i could not deal with  for when he tired of running which was soon he was as far away as ever  draw him through the forest of reeds i could not  at last i did the fatal thing  i took hold of the line and then plop as the poet said  he was off  a young sportsman on the bank who had joined me expressed his artless disappointment  i cast over the confounded reeds once more  splashthe old story  i stuck to the fish and got him into the watery wood and then he went where the lost trout go  no more came on so i floundered a yard or two farther and climbed into a wildfowls nest a kind of platform of matted reeds all yellow and faded  the nest immediately sank down deep into the water but it stopped somewhere and i made a cast  the black water boiled and the trout went straight down and sulked  i merely held on till at last it seemed time for us to go and by cautious tugging i got him through the reedy jungle and gruppit him as the shepherd would have said  he was simply but decently wrapped round from snout to tail in very fine waterweeds as in a garment  moreover he was as black as your hat quite unlike the comely yellow trout who live on the gravel in clearburn  it hardly seemed sensible to get drowned in this gruesome kind of angling so leaving the lake of darkness we made for buccleugh passing the cleugh where the buck was taen  surely it is the deepest the steepest and the greenest cleugh that is shone on by the sun  thereby we met an angler an ancient man in hodden grey strolling home from the rankle burn  and we told him of our bad day and asked him concerning that hideous fly which had covered the loch and lured the trout from our decent greenwells and march browns  and the ancient man listened to our description of the monster and he said hoot ay yeve jest forgathered wi the bloody doctor  this it appears is the border anglers name for the horrible insect so much appreciated by trout  so we drove home when all the great tableland was touched with yellow light from a rift in the west and all the broken hills looked blue against the silvery grey  god bless them for man cannot spoil them nor any revolution shape them other than they are  we see them as the folk from flodden saw them as leyden knew them as they looked to william of deloraine as they showed in the eyes of wat of harden and of jamie telfer of the fair dodhead  they have always girdled a land of warriors and of people fond of song from the oldest balladmaker to that scotch probationer who wrote     lay me here where i may see    teviot round his meadows flowing    and about and over me    winds and clouds for ever going  it was dark before we splashed through the ford of borthwick water and dined and wrote to mr anderson of princes street edinburgh for a supply of bloody doctors  but we never had a chance to try them  i have since fished clearburn from a boat but it was not a day of rising fish and no big ones came to the landingnet  there are plenty in the loch but you need not make the weary journey they are not for you nor me     the lady or the salmon   the circumstances which attended and caused the death of the hon houghton grannom have not long been known to me and it is only now that by the decease of his father lord whitchurch and the extinction of his noble family i am permitted to divulge the facts  that the true tale of my unhappy friend will touch different chords in different breasts i am well aware  the sportsman i think will hesitate to approve him the fair i hope will absolve  who are we to scrutinise human motives and to award our blame to actions which perhaps might have been our own had opportunity beset and temptation beguiled us  there is a certain point at which the keenest sense of honour the most chivalrous affection and devotion cannot bear the strain but break like a salmon line under a masterful stress  that my friend succumbed i admit that he was his own judge the severest and passed and executed sentence on himself i have now to show  i shall never forget the shock with which i read in the scotsman under angling the following paragraph  tweedstrange death of an angleran unfortunate event has cast a gloom over fishers in this district  as mr k the keeper on the b water was busy angling yesterday his attention was caught by some object floating on the stream  he cast his flies over it and landed a soft felt hat the ribbon stuck full of salmonflies  mr k at once hurried upstream filled with the most lively apprehensions  these were soon justified  in a shallow below the narrow deep and dangerous rapids called the trows mr k saw a salmon leaping in a very curious manner  on a closer examination he found that the fish was attached to a line  about seventy yards higher he found in shallow water the body of a man the hand still grasping in death the butt of the rod to which the salmon was fast all the line being run out  mr k at once rushed into the stream and dragged out the body in which he recognised with horror the hon houghton grannom to whom the water was lately let  life had been for some minutes extinct and though mr k instantly hurried for dr  that gentleman could only attest the melancholy fact  the wading in the trows is extremely dangerous and difficult and mr grannom who was fond of fishing without an attendant must have lost his balance slipped and been dragged down by the weight of his waders  the recent breaking off of the hon gentlemans contemplated marriage on the very weddingday will be fresh in the memory of our readers  this was the story which i read in the newspaper during breakfast one morning in november  i was deeply grieved rather than astonished for i have often remonstrated with poor grannom on the recklessness of his wading  it was with some surprise that i received in the course of the day a letter from him in which he spoke only of indifferent matters of the fishing which he had taken and so forth  the letter was accompanied however by a parcel  tearing off the outer cover i found a sealed document addressed to me with the superscription not to be opened until after my fathers decease  this injunction of course i have scrupulously obeyed  the death of lord whitchurch the last of the grannoms now gives me liberty to publish my friends apologia pro morte et vita sua  dear smith the document begins before you read thislong before i hopei shall have solved the great mysteryif indeed we solve it  if the water runs down tomorrow and there is every prospect that it will do so i must have the opportunity of making such an end as even malignity cannot suspect of being voluntary  there are plenty of fish in the water if i hook one in the trows i shall let myself go whither the current takes me  life has for weeks been odious to me for what is life without honour without love and coupled with shame and remorse repentance i cannot call the emotion which gnaws me at the heart for in similar circumstances unlikely as these are to occur i feel that i would do the same thing again  are we but automata worked by springs moved by the stronger impulse and unable to choose for ourselves which impulse that shall be  even now in decreeing my own destruction do i exercise freewill or am i the sport of hereditary tendencies of mistaken views of honour of a seeming selfsacrifice which perhaps is but selfishness in disguise  i blight my unfortunate fathers old age i destroy the last of an ancient house but i remove from the path of olive dunne the shadow that must rest upon the sunshine of what will eventually i trust be a happy life unvexed by memories of one who loved her passionately  dear olive how pure how ardent was my devotion to her none knows better than you  but olive had i will not say a fault though i suffer from it but a quality or rather two qualities which have completed my misery  lightly as she floats on the stream of society the most casual observer and even the enamoured beholder can see that olive dunne has great pride and no sense of humour  her dignity is her idol  what makes her even for a moment the possible theme of ridicule is in her eyes an unpardonable sin  this sin i must with penitence confess i did indeed commit  another woman might have forgiven me  i know not how that may be i throw myself on the mercy of the court  but if another could pity and pardon to olive this was impossible  i have never seen her since that fatal moment when paler than her orange blossoms she swept through the porch of the church while i dishevelled mudstained halfdrownedah that memory will torture me if memory at all remains and yet fool maniac that i was i could not resist the wild mad impulse to laugh which shook the rustic spectators and which in my case was due i trust to hysterical but not unmanly emotion  if any woman any bride could forgive such an apparent but most unintentional insult olive dunne i knew was not that woman  my abject letters of explanation my appeals for mercy were returned unopened  her parents pitied me perhaps had reasons for being on my side but olive was of marble  it is not only myself that she cannot pardon she will never i know forgive herself while my existence reminds her of what she had to endure  when she receives the intelligence of my demise no suspicion will occur to her she will not say he is fitly punished but her peace of mind will gradually return  it is for this mainly that i sacrifice myself but also because i cannot endure the dishonour of a laggard in love and a recreant bridegroom  so much for my motives now to my tale  the day before our weddingday had been the happiest in my life  never had i felt so certain of olives affections never so fortunate in my own  we parted in the soft moonlight she no doubt to finish her nuptial preparations i to seek my couch in the little rural inn above the roaring waters of the budon 3     move eastward happy earth and leave       yon orange sunset fading slow    from fringes of the faded eve       oh happy planet eastward go  i murmured though the atmospheric conditions were not really those described by the poet     ah bear me with thee smoothly borne    dip forward under starry light    and move me to my marriage morn    and round again to  river in grand order sir said the voice of robins the keeper who recognised me in the moonlight  theres a regular monster in the ashweil he added naming a favourite cast never saw nor heard of such a fish in the water before  mr dick must catch him robins i answered no fishing for me to morrow  no sir said robins affably  wish you joy sir and miss olive too  its a pity though  master dick he throws a fine fly but he gets flurried with a big fish being young  and this one is a topper  with that he gave me goodnight and i went to bed but not to sleep  i was fevered with happiness the past and future reeled before my wakeful vision  i heard every clock strike the sounds of morning were astir and still i could not sleep  the ceremony for reasons connected with our long journey to my fathers place in hampshire was to be earlyhalf past ten was the hour  i looked at my watch it was seven of the clock and then i looked out of the window it was a fine soft grey morning with a south wind tossing the yellowing boughs  i got up dressed in a hasty way and thought i would just take a look at the river  it was indeed in glorious order lapping over the top of the sharp stone which we regarded as a measure of the due size of water  the morning was young sleep was out of the question i could not settle my mind to read  why should i not take a farewell cast alone of course  i always disliked the attendance of a gillie  i took my salmon rod out of its case rigged it up and started for the stream which flowed within a couple of hundred yards of my quarters  there it raced under the ash tree a pale delicate brown perhaps a little thing too coloured  i therefore put on a large silver doctor and began steadily fishing down the ashtree cast  what if i should wipe dicks eye i thought when just where the rough and smooth water meet there boiled up a head and shoulders such as i had never seen on any fish  my heart leaped and stood still but there came no sensation from the rod and i finished the cast my knees actually trembling beneath me  then i gently lifted the line and very elaborately tested every link of the powerful castingline  then i gave him ten minutes by my watch next with unspeakable emotion i stepped into the stream and repeated the cast just at the same spot he came up again the huge rod bent like a switch and the salmon rushed straight down the pool as if he meant to make for the sea  i staggered on to dry land to follow him the easier and dragged at my watch to time the fish a quarter to eight  but the slim chain had broken and the watch as i hastily thrust it back missed my pocket and fell into the water  there was no time to stoop for it the fish started afresh tore up the pool as fast as he had gone down it and rushing behind the torrent into the eddy at the top leaped clean out of the water  he was 70 lbs if he was an ounce  here he slackened a little dropping back and i got in some line  now he sulked so intensely that i thought he had got the line round a rock  it might be broken might be holding fast to a sunken stone for aught that i could tell and the time was passing i knew not how rapidly  i tried all known methods tugging at him tapping the butt and slackening line on him  at last the top of the rod was slightly agitated and then back flew the long line in my face  gone  i reeled up with a sigh but the line tightened again  he had made a sudden rush under my bank but there he lay again like a stone  how long  ah  i cannot tell how long  i heard the church clock strike but missed the number of the strokes  soon he started again downstream into the shallows leaping at the end of his rushthe monster  then he came slowly up and jiggered savagely at the line  it seemed impossible that any tackle could stand these short violent jerks  soon he showed signs of weakening  once his huge silver side appeared for a moment near the surface but he retreated to his old fastness  i was in a tremor of delight and despair  i should have thrown down my rod and flown on the wings of love to olive and the altar  but i hoped that there was time stillthat it was not so very late  at length he was failing  i heard ten oclock strike  he came up and lumbered on the surface of the pool  gradually i drew him plunging ponderously to the gravelled beach where i meant to tail him  he yielded to the strain he was in the shallows the line was shortened  i stooped to seize him  the frayed and overworn gut broke at a knot and with a loose roll he dropped back towards the deep  i sprang at him stumbled fell on him struggled with him but he slipped from my arms in that moment i knew more than the anguish of orpheus  orpheus  had i too lost my eurydice  i rushed from the stream up the steep bank along to my rooms  i passed the church door  olive pale as her orange blossoms was issuing from the porch  the clock pointed to 1045  i was ruined i knew it and i laughed  i laughed like a lost spirit  she swept past me and amidst the amazement of the gentle and simple i sped wildly away  ask me no more  the rest is silence        thus ends my hapless friends narrative  i leave it to the judgment of women and of men  ladies would you have acted as olive dunne acted would pride or pardon or mirth have ridden sparkling in your eyes  men my brethren would ye have deserted the salmon for the lady or the lady for the salmon  i know what i would have done had i been fair olive dunne  what i would have done had i been houghton grannom i may not venture to divulge  for this narrative then as for another let every man read it as he will and every woman as the gods have given her wit 4     a tweedside sketch   the story of the following adventurethis deplorable confession one may saywill not have been written in vain if it impresses on young minds the supreme necessity of carefulness about details  let the casual and regardless who read itthe gatless as they say in suffolkponder the lesson which it teaches a lesson which no amount of bitter experience has ever impressed on the unprincipled narrator  never do anything carelessly whether in fishing or in golf and carry this important maxim even into the most serious affairs of life  many a battle has been lost no doubt by lack of ammunition or by plenty of ammunition which did not happen to suit the guns and many a salmon has been lost ay and many a trout for want of carefulness and through a culpable inattention to the soundness of your gut and tackle generally  what fiend is it that prompts a man just to try a hopeless cast in a low water without testing his tackle  as sure as you do that up comes the fish and with his first dash breaks your casting line and leaves you lamenting  this doctrine i preach being my own awful example  bad and careless little boy my worthy master used to say at school and he would have provoked a smile in other circumstances  but mr trotter of the edinburgh academy had something about him he usually carried it in the tailpocket of his coat which inspired respect and discouraged ribaldry would that i had listened to mr trotter would that i had corrected in early life the happygolucky disposition to scatter my greek accents as it were with a peppercaster to fish with worn tackle and generally to make free with the responsibilities of life and literature it is too late to amend but others may learn wisdom from this spectacle of deserved misfortune and absolute discomfiture  i am not myself a salmonfisher though willing to try that art again and though this is a tale of salmon  to myself the difference between angling for trout and angling for salmon is like the difference between a drawing of lionardos in silver point and a loaded landscape by macgilp ra  troutfishing is all an idyll all delicacythat is troutfishing on the test or on the itchen  you wander by clear water beneath gracious poplartrees unencumbered with anything but a slim rod of messrs hardys make and a light toybox of delicate flies  you need seldom wade and the water is shallow the bottom is of silver gravel you need not search all day at random but you select a rising trout and endeavour to lay the floating fly delicately over him  if you part with him there is always another feeding merrily     invenies alium si te hic fastidit  it is like an excursion into corots country it is rich in memories of walton and cotton it is a dream of peace and they bring you your tea by the riverside  in salmonfishing on the tweed at least all is different  the rod at all events the rod which some one kindly lent me is like a weavers beam  the high heavy wading trousers and boots are even as the armour of the giant of gath  you have to plunge waist deep or deeper into roaring torrents and if the water be at all drumly you have not an idea where your next step may fall  it may be on a hidden rock or on a round slippery boulder or it may be into a deep pot or hole  the inexperienced angler staggers like a drunken man is occasionally drowned and more frequently is ducked  you have to cast painfully with steep precipitous banks behind you all overgrown with trees with bracken with bramble  it is a boys work to disentangle the fly from the branches of ash and elm and pine  there is no delicacy and there is a great deal of exertion in all this  you do not cast subtilely over a fish which you know is there but you swish swish all across the current with a strong reluctance to lift the line after each venture and try another  the small of the back aches and it is literally in the sweat of your brow that you take your diversion  after all there are many blank days when the salmon will look at no fly or when you encounter the salmo irritans who rises with every appearance of earnest goodwill but never touches the hook or if he does touch it runs out a couple of yards of line and vanishes for ever  what says the poet     theres an accommodating fish    in pool or stream by rock or pot    who rises frequent as you wish    at popham parson or jock scott    or almost any fly youve got    in all the furred and feathered clans    you strike but ah you strike him not    he is the salmo irritans  it may be different in norway or on the lower casts of the tweed as at floors or makerstoun but higher up the country in scotts own country at yair or ashiesteil there is often a terrible amount of fruitless work to be done  and i doubt if except in throwing a very long line and knowing the waters by old experience there is very much skill in salmon fishing  it is all an affair of muscle and patience  the choice of flies is almost a pure accident  every one believes in the fly with which he has been successful  these strange combinations of blues reds golds of tinsel and worsted of feathers and fur are purely fantastic articles  they are like nothing in nature and are multiplied for the fanciful amusement of anglers  nobody knows why salmon rise at them nobody knows why they will bite on one day and not on another or rather on many others  it is not even settled whether we should use a bright fly on a bright day and a dark fly on a dark day as dr hamilton advises or reverse the choice as others use  muscles and patience these i repeat are the only ingredients of ultimate success  however one does do at rome as the romans do and fishes for salmon in tweed when the nets are off in october when the yellowing leaves begin to fall and when that beautiful reach of wooded valley from elibank to the meeting of tweed and ettrick is in the height of its autumnal charm why has yarrow been so much more besung than tweed in spite of the greater streams far greater and more varied loveliness  the fatal duel in the dowie dens of yarrow and the lamented drowning of willie there have given the stream its pastoral melancholy and engaged wordsworth in the renown of the water  for the poetry of tweed we have chiefly after scott to thank mr stoddart its loyal minstrel  dearer than all these to me he says about our other valleys is sylvan tweed     let ither anglers choose their ain    and ither waters tak the lead    o hieland streams we covet nane    but gie to us the bonny tweed    and gie to us the cheerfu burn    that steals into its valley fair    the streamlets that at ilka turn    sae saftly meet and mingle there  he kept his promise given in the following verse     and i when to breathe is a labour and joy    forgets me and life is no longer the boy    on the labouring staff and the tremorous knee    will wander bright river to thee  life is always the boy when one is beside the tweed  times change and we change for the worse  but the river changes little  still he courses through the keen and narrow rocks beneath the bridge of yair     from yair which hills so closely bind    scarce can the tweed his passage find    though much he fret and chafe and toil    till all his eddying currents boil  still the water loiters by the long boatpool of yair as though loath to leave the drooping boughs of the elms  still it courses with a deep eddy through the elm wheel and ripples under fernilea where the author of the flowers of the forest lived in that now mouldering and roofless hall with the peaked turrets  still neidpath is fair neidpath of the unhappy maid and still we mark the tiny burn at ashiesteil how in november     murmuring hoarse and frequent seen    through bush and briar no longer green    an angry brook it sweeps the glade    brawls over rock and wild cascade    and foaming brown with doubled speed    hurries its waters to the tweed  still the old tower of elibank is black and strong in ruin elibank the home of that muckle moud meg who made harden after all a better bride than he would have found in the hanging ashtree of her father  these are unaltered mainly since scott saw them last and little altered is the homely house of ashiesteil where he had been so happy  and we too feel but little change among those scenes of long ago those bestbeloved haunts of boyhood where we have had so many good days and bad days of rising trout and success days of failure and even of halfdrowning  one cannot reproduce the charm of the strong river in pool and stream of the steep rich bank that it rushes or lingers by of the green and heathery hills beyond or the bare slopes where the blue slate breaks through among the dark old thorntrees remnants of the forest  it is all homely and all haunted and if a tweedside fisher might have his desire he would sleep the long sleep in the little churchyard that lies lonely above the pool of caddonfoot and hard by christopher norths favourite quarters at clovenfords  however while we are still on earth caddonfoot is more attractive for her long sweep of salmonpoolthe home of seatrout toothan precisely for her kirkyard  there will be time enough for that and time it is to recur to the sad story of the big fish and the careless angler  it was about the first day of october and we had enjoyed a spate salmonfishing is a mere child of the weather with rain almost anybody may raise fish without it all art is apt to be vain  we had been blessed with a spate  on wednesday the tweed had been roaring red from bank to bank  salmonfishing was wholly out of the question and it is to be feared that the innumerable troutfishers busy on every eddy were baiting with salmon roe an illegal lure  on thursday the red tinge had died out of the water but only a very strong wader would have ventured in others had a good chance if they tried it of being picked up at berwick  friday was the luckless day of my own failure and broken heart the water was still very heavy and turbid a frantic wind was lashing the woods heaps of dead leaves floated down and several sheaves of corn were drifted on the current  the long boatpool at yair however is sheltered by wooded banks and it was possible enough to cast in spite of the winds fury  we had driven from a place about five miles distant and we had not driven three hundred yards before i remembered that we had forgotten the landingnet  but as i expected nothing it did not seem worth while to go back for this indispensable implement  we reached the waterside and found that the trout were feeding below the pendent branches of the trees and in the quiet deep eddies of the long boatpool  one cannot see rising trout without casting over them in preference to labouring after salmon so i put up a small rod and diverted myself from the bank  it was to little purpose  tweed trout are now grown very shy and capricious even a dry fly failed to do any execution worth mentioning  conscience compelled me as i had been sent out by kind hosts to fish for salmon not to neglect my orders  the armourthe ponderous gear of the fisherwas put on with the enormous boots and the gigantic rod was equipped  then came the beginning of sorrows  we had left the books of salmon flies comfortably reposing at home  we had also forgotten the whiskey flask  everything in fact except cigarettes had been left behind  unluckily not quite everything i had a trout flybook and therein lay just one large salmon fly not a tweed fly but a lure that is used on the beautiful and hopeless waters of the distant ken in galloway  it had brown wings a dark body and a piece of junglecock feather and it was fastened to a seatrout castingline  now if i had possessed no salmon flies at all i must either have sent back for some or gone on innocently dallying with trout  but this one wretched fly lured me to my ruin  i saw that the castingline had a link which seemed rather twisted  i tried it but in the spirit of don quixote with his helmet i did not try it hard i waded into the easiestlooking part of the pool just above a huge tree that dropped its boughs to the water and began casting merely from a sense of duty  i had not cast a dozen times before there was a heavy slow plunge in the stream and a glimpse of purple and azure  thats him cried a man who was trouting on the opposite bank doubtless it was him but he had not touched the hook  i believe the correct thing would have been to wait for half an hour and then try the fish with a smaller fly  but i had no smaller fly no other fly at all i stepped back a few paces and fished down again  in major trahernes work i have read that the heart leaps or stands still or otherwise betrays an uncomfortable interest when one casts for the second time over a salmon which has risen  i cannot honestly say that i suffered from this tumultuous emotion  he will not come again i said when there was a long heavy drag at the line followed by a shrieking of the reel as in mr william blacks novels  let it be confessed that the first hooking of a salmon is an excitement unparalleled in troutfishing there have been anglers who when the salmon was once on handed him over to the gillie to play and land  one would like to act as gillie to those lordly amateurs  my own fish rushed down stream where the big tree stands  i had no hope of landing him if he took that course because one could neither pass the rod under the boughs nor wade out beyond them but he soon came back while one took in line and discussed his probable size with the troutfisher opposite  his size indeed  nobody knows what it was for when he had come up to the point whence he had started he began a policy of violent short tugsnot jiggering as it is called but plunging with all his weight on the line  i had clean forgotten the slimness of the tackle and as he was clearly well hooked held him perhaps too hard  only a very raw beginner likes to take hours over landing a fish  perhaps i held him too tight at all events after a furious plunge back came the line the casting line had snapped at the top link  there was no more to be said or done except to hunt for another fly in the trout flybook  here there was no such thing but a local spectator offered me a huge fly more like a gaff and equipped with a large iron eye for attaching the gut to  withal i suspect this weapon was meant not for fair fishing but for sniggling  now sniggling is a form of coldblooded poaching  in the open water on the ettrick you may see half a dozen snigglers busy  they all wear high wading trousers they are all armed with stiff salmonrods and huge flies  they push the line and the top joints of the rod deep into the water drag it along and then bring the hook out with a jerk  often it sticks in the side of a salmon and in this most unfair and unsportsmanlike way the free sport of honest people is ruined and fish are diminished in number  now the big fly may have been an honest character but he was sadly like a rake hook in disguise  he did not look as if an fish could fancy him  i therefore sent a messenger across the river to beg buy or borrow a fly at the nest  but this pretty cottage is no longer the home of the famous angling club which has gone a mile or two up the water and builded for itself a new dwelling  my messenger came back with one small fatiguedlooking fly a popham i think which had been lent by some one at a farmhouse  the water was so heavy that the small fly seemed useless however we fastened it on as a dropper using the sniggler as the trail fly so exhausted were our resources that i had to cut a piece of gut off a minnow tackle and attach the small fly to that  the tiny gut loop of the fly was dreadfully frayed and with a heavy heart i began fishing again  my friend on the opposite side called out that big fish were rising in the bend of the stream so thither i went stumbling over rocks and casting with much difficulty as the high overgrown banks permit no backward sweep of the line  you are obliged to cast by a kind of forward thrust of the arms a knack not to be acquired in a moment  i splashed away awkwardly but at last managed to make a straight clean cast  there was a slight pull such as a trout gives in midstream under water  i raised the point and again the reel sang aloud and gleefully as the salmon rushed down the stream farther and faster than the first it is a very pleasant thing to hook a salmon when you are all alone as i was thenalone with yourself and the goddess of fishing  this salmon just like the other now came back and instantly began the old tactics of heavy plunging tugs  but i knew the gut was sound this time and as i fancied he had risen to the sniggler i had no anxiety about the tackle holding  one more plunge and back came the line as before  he was off one could have sat down and gnawed the reel  what had gone wrong  why the brute had taken the old fly from the farmhouse and had snapped the loop that attaches the gut  the little loop was still on the fragment of minnow tackle which fastened it to the cast  there was no more chance for there were now no more flies except a small cobbery a seatrout fly from the sound of mull  it was time for us to go with a heavy heart and a basket empty except for two or three miserable trout  the loss of those two salmon whether big or little fish was not the whole misfortune  all the chances of the day were gone and seldom have salmon risen so freely  i had not been casting long enough to smoke half a cigarette when i hooked each of those fish they rose at flies which were the exact opposites of each other in size character and colour  they were ready to rise at anything but the sniggler  and i had nothing to offer them absolutely nothing bigger than a small redspinner from the test  on that day a fisher not far off hooked nine salmon and landed four of them in one pool i never had such a chance before the heavy flood and high wind had made the salmon as silly as perch  one might have caught half a dozen of the great sturdy fellows who make all trout even seatrout seem despicable minnows  next day i fished again in the same water with a friend  i rose a fish but did not hook it and he landed a small one five minutes after we started and we only had one other rise all the rest of the day probably it was not dark and windy enough but who can explain the caprices of salmon  the only certain thing is that carelessness always brings misfortune that if your tackle is weak fish will hook themselves on days and in parts of the water where you expected nothing and then will go away with your fly and your castinglines  fortune never forgives  he who is lazy and takes no trouble because he expects no fish will always be meeting heartbreaking adventures  one should never make a hopeless or careless cast bad luck lies in wait for that kind of performance  these are the experiences that embitter a man as they embittered dean swift who old and ill neglected and in irish exile still felt the pang of losing a great trout when he was a boy  what pleasure is there in landscape and tradition when such accidents befall you     the sun upon the weirdlaw hill    in ettricks vale is sinking sweet  there is a fire of autumn colour in the tufted woods that embosom fernilea  bother the setting sun we say and the maid of neidpath and the flowers of the forest and the memories of scott at ashiesteil and of muckle moud meg at elibank  these are filmy shadowy pleasures of the fancy these cannot minister to the mind of him who has been broken twice who cannot resume the contest for want of ammunition and who has not even brought the creaturecomfort of a flask  since that woful day i have lain on the bank and watched excellent anglers skilfully flogging the best of water and that water full of fish without hooking one  salmonfishing then is a matter of chance or of plodding patience  they will rise on one day at almost any fly but the sniggler however illpresented to them  on a dozen other days no fly and no skill will avail to tempt them  the salmon is a brainless brute and the grapes are sour  if only the gut had held this sketch would have ended with sentiment and a sunset and the music of ettrick the melody of tweed  in the gloaming wed be roaming homeward telling perhaps the story of the ghost seen by sir walter scott near ashiesteil or discussing the roman treasure still buried near oakwood tower under an inscribed stone which men saw fifty years ago  or was it a treasure of michael scotts who lived at oakwood says tradition  let harden dig for hardens gear it is not for me to give hints as to its whereabouts  after all that ill luck to be brief one is not in the vein for legendary lore nor memories of boyhood nor poetry nor sunsets  i do not believe that one ever thinks of the landscape or of anything else while there is a chance for a fish and no abundance of local romance can atone for an empty creel  poetical fishers try to make people believe these fallacies perhaps they impose on themselves but if one would really enjoy landscape one should leave not only the flybook and the landingnet but the rod and reel at home  and so farewell to the dearest and fairest of all rivers that go on earth fairer than eurotas or sicilian anapus with its seatrout farewellfor who knows how longto the redfringed gleddiswheel the rock of the righwheel the rushing foam of the gullets the woodland banks of caddonfoot     the valleys of england are wide    her rivers rejoice every one    in grace and in beauty they glide    and waterflowers float at their side    as they gleam in the rays of the sun     but where are the speed and the spray    the dark lakes that welter them forth    tree and heath nodding over their way    the rock and the precipice grey    that bind the wild streams of the north  well both are good the streams of north and south but he who has given his heart to the tweed as did tyro in homer to the enipeus will never change his love  psthat galloway flythe butcher and langhas been avenged  a copy of him on the line of a friend has proved deadly on the tweed killing among other victims a seatrout of thirteen pounds     the double alibi   glen aline is probably the loneliest place in the lone moorlands of western galloway  the country is entirely pastoral and i fancy that the very pasture is bad enough  stretches of deergrass and ling rolling endlessly to the feet of cairnsmure and the circle of the eastern hills cannot be good feeding for the least epicurean of sheep and sheep do not care for the lank and sour herbage by the sides of the lanes as the halfstagnant black deep and weedy burns are called in this part of the country  the scenery is not unattractive but tourists never wander to these wastes where no inns are and even the angler seldom visits them  indeed the fishing is not to be called good and the lanes which seep as the scotch say through marshes and beneath low hillsides are not such excellent company as the garrulous and brawling brooks of the border or of the highlands  as the lanes flow however from faraway lochs it happens that large trout make their way into themtrout which if hooked offer a gallant resistance before they can be hauled over the weeds that usually line the watercourses  partly for the sake of trying this kind of angling partly from a temporary distaste for the presence of men and women partly for the purpose of finishing a work styled a history of the unexplained i once spent a month in the solitudes of glen aline  i stayed at the house of a shepherd who though not an unintelligent man was by no means possessed of the modern spirit  he and his brother swains had sturdily and successfully resisted an attempt made by the schoolmaster at a village some seven miles off to get a postal service in the glen more frequently than once a week  a post once a week was often enough for lucky people who did not get letters twice a year  it was not my shepherd but another who once came with his wife to the village after a twelve miles walk across the hills to ask what the day of the week was  they had lost count and the man had attended to his work on a day which the dame averred to be the sabbath  he denied that it was the sabbath and i believe that it turned out to be a tuesday  this little incident gives some idea of the delightful absence of population in glen aline  but no words can paint the utter loneliness which could actually be feltthe empty moors the empty sky  the heaps of stones by a burnside here and there showed that a cottage had once existed where now was no habitation  one such spot was rather to be shunned by the superstitious for here about 1698 a cottar family had been evicted by endless unaccountable disturbances in the house  stones were thrown by invisible handsthough occasionally by the way a white hand with no apparent body attached to it was viewed by the curious who came to the spot heavy objects of all sorts floated in the air rappings and voices were heard the end wall was pulled down by an unknown agency  the story is extant in a pious old pamphlet called sadducees defeated and a great deal more to the same effecta masterpiece by the parish minister signed and attested by the other ministers of the glen kens  the edinburgh edition of the pamphlet is rare the london edition may be procured without much difficulty  the site of this ruined cottage however had no terrors for the neighbours or rather for the neighbour my shepherd  in fact he seemed to have forgotten the legend till i reminded him of it for i had come across the tale in my researches into the unexplained  the shepherd and his family indeed were quite devoid of superstition and in this respect very unlike the northern highlanders  however the fallen cottage had nothing to do with my own little adventure in glen aline and i mention it merely as the most notable of the tiny ruins which attest the presence in the past of a larger population  one cannot marvel that the people flitted from the moors and morasses of glen aline into less melancholy neighbourhoods  the very sheep seemed scarcer here than elsewhere grousedisease had devastated the moors sportsmen consequently did not visit them and only a few barren pairs with crow picked skeletons of dead birds in the heather now and then showed that the shootings had once perhaps been marketable  my shepherds cottage was four miles from the littletravelled road to dalmellington long bad miles they were across bog and heather  consequently i seldom saw any face of man except in or about the cottage  my work went on rapidly enough in such an undisturbed life  empires might fall parties might break like bursting shells and banks might break also i plodded on with my labour and went afishing when the day promised well  there was a hill loch loch nan about five miles away which i favoured a good deal the trout were large and fair of flesh and in proper weather they rose pretty freely and could be taken by an angler wading from the shore there was no boat  the wading however was difficult and dangerous owing to the boggy nature of the bottom which quaked like a quicksand in some places  the black water never stirred by duck or moorhen the dry rustling reeds the noisome smell of decaying vegetablematter when you stirred it up in wading the occasional presence of a dead sheep by the sullen margin of the tarn were all opposed to cheerfulness  still the fish were there and the lane which sulkily glided from the loch towards the distant river contained some monsters which took worm after a flood  one misty morning as i had just topped the low ridge from which the loch became visible i saw a man fishing from my favourite bench  never had i noticed a human being there before and i was not well pleased to think that some emissary of mr watson lyall was making experiments in loch nan and would describe it in the sportsmans guide  the mist blew white and thick for a minute or two over the loch side as it often does at loch skene so white and thick and sudden that the bewildered angler there is apt to lose his way and fall over the precipice of the grey mares tail  when the curtain of cloud rose again the loch was lonely the angler had disappeared  i went on rejoicing and made a pretty good basket as the weather improved and grew warmera change which gives an appetite to trout in some hill lochs  among the sands between the stones on the farther bank i found traces of the anglers footsteps he was not a phantom at all events for phantoms do not wear heavily nailed boots as he evidently did  the traces which were soon lost of course inclined me to think that he had retreated up a narrow green burnside with rather high banks through which in rainy weather a small feeder fell into the loch  i guessed that he had been frightened away by the descent of the mist which usually puts down the trout and prevents them from feeding  in that case his alarm was premature  i marched homewards happy with the unaccustomed weight of my basket the contents of which were a welcome change from the usual porridge and potatoes tea without milk jam and scones of the shepherds table  but as i reached the height above the loch on my westward path and looked back to see if rising fish were dimpling the still waters all flushed as they were with sunset behold there was the other man at work again  i should have thought no more about him had i not twice afterwards seen him at a distance fishing up a lane ahead of me in the loneliest regions and thereby of course spoiling my sport  i knew him by his peculiar stoop which seemed not unfamiliar to me and by his hat which was of the clerical pattern once known perhaps still known as a bible readersa low soft slouched black felt  the second time that i found him thus anticipating me i left off fishing and walked rather briskly towards him to satisfy my curiosity and ask the usual questions what sport and what flies  but as soon as he observed me coming he strode off across the heather  uncourteous as it seems i felt so inquisitive that i followed him  but he walked so rapidly and was so manifestly anxious to shake me off that i gave up the pursuit  even if he were a poacher whose conscience smote him for using salmonroe i was not my brothers keeper nor anybodys keeper  he might otter the loch but how could i prevent him  it was no affair of mine and yetwhere had i seen him before  his gait his stoop the carriage of his head all seemed familiarbut a shortsighted man is accustomed to this kind of puzzle he is always recognising the wrong person when he does not fail to recognise the right one  i am rather shortsighted but science has its resources  two or three days after my encounter with this very shy sportsman i went again to loch nan  but this time i took with me a strong fieldglass  as i neared the crest of the low heathery slope immediately above the loch whence the water first comes into view i lay down on the ground and crawled like a deerstalker to the skyline  then i got out the glass and reconnoitred  there was my friend sure enough moreover he was playing a very respectable trout  but he was fishing on the near side of the loch and though i had quite a distinct view of his back and indeed of all his attenuated form i was as far as ever from recognising him or guessing where if anywhere i had seen him before  i now determined to stalk him but this was not too easy as there is literally no cover on the hillside except a long march dyke of the usual loose stones which ran down to the lochside and indeed three or four feet into the loch reaching it at a short distance to the right of the angler  behind this i skulked in an eagerly undignified manner and was just about to climb the wall unobserved when two grouse got up with their wild cluck cluck of alarm and flew down past the angler and over the loch  he did not even look round but jerked his line out of the water reeled it up and set off walking along the lochside  he was making no doubt for the little glen up which i fancied that he must have retreated on the first occasion when saw him  i set off walking round the tarn on my own sidethe left sideexpecting to anticipate him and that he must pass me on his way up the little burnside  but i had miscalculated the distance or the pace  he was first at the burnside and now i cast courtesy and everything but curiosity to the winds and deliberately followed him  he was a few score of yards ahead of me walking rapidly when he suddenly climbed the burnside to the left and was lost to my eyes for a few moments  i reached the place ascended the steep green declivity and found myself on the open undulating moor with no human being in sight  the grass and heather were short  i saw no bush no hollow where he could by any possibility have hidden himself  had he met a boojum he could not have more softly and suddenly vanished away  i make no pretence of being more courageous than my neighbours and in this juncture perhaps i was less so  the long days of loneliness in waste glen aline and too many solitary cigarettes had probably injured my nerve  so when i suddenly heard a sigh and the halfsmothered sound of a convulsive coughhollow if ever a cough was hollowhard by me at my side as it were and yet could behold no man nor any place where a man might conceal himselfnothing but moor and sky and tufts of rushesthen i turned away and walked down the glen not slowly  i shall not deny that i often looked over my shoulder as i went and that when i reached the loch i did not angle without many a backward glance such an appearance and disappearance as this i remembered were in the experience of sir walter scott  lockhart does not tell the anecdote which is in a little anonymous volume recollections of sir walter scott published before lockharts book  sir walter reports that he was once riding across the moor to ashiesteil in the clear brown summer twilight after sunset  he saw a man a little way ahead of him but just before he reached the spot the man disappeared  scott rode about and about searching the low heather as i had done but to no purpose  he rode on and glancing back saw the same man at the same place  he turned his horse galloped to the spot and againnothing  then says sir walter neither the mare nor i cared to wait any longer  neither had i cared to wait and if there is any shame in the confession on my head be it  there came a week of blazing summer weather tramping over moors to lochs like sheets of burnished steel was out of the question and i worked at my book which now was all but finished  at length i wrote the end and o le bon ouff que je poussais as flaubert says about one of his own laborious conclusions  the weather broke we had a deluge and then came a soft cloudy day with a warm southern wind suggesting a final march on loch nan  i packed some scones and marmalade into my creel filled my flask with whiskey my cigarettecase with cigarettes and started on the familiar track with the happiest anticipations  the lone fisher was quite out of my mind the day was exhilaratingone of those true fishing days when you feel the presence of the sun without seeing him  still i looked rather cautiously over the edge of the slope above the loch and by jove there he was fishing the near side and wading deep among the reeds  i did not stalk him this time but set off running down the hillside behind him as quickly as my basket with its load of waders and boots would permit  i was within forty yards of him when he gave a wild stagger tried to recover himself failed and this time disappeared in a perfectly legitimate and accountable manner  the treacherous peaty bottom had given way and his floating hat with a splash on the surface and a few black bubbles were all that testified to his existence  there was a broken old paling hard by i tore off a long plank waded in as near as i dared and by help of the plank after a good deal of slipping which involved an exemplary drenching i succeeded in getting him on to dry land  he was a distressing spectaclehis body and face all blackened with the slimy peatmud and he fell halffainting on the grass convulsed by a terrible cough  my first care was to give him whiskey by perhaps a mistaken impulse of humanity my next as he lay exhausted was to bring water in my hat and remove the black mud from his face  then i saw percy allenallen of st judes  his face was wasted his thin long beard he had not worn a beard of old clogged as it was with peatstains showed flecks of grey  allenpercy i said what wind blew you here  but he did not answer and as he coughed it was too plain that the shock of his accident had broken some vessel in the lungs  i tended him as well as i knew how to do it  i sat beside him giving him what comfort i might and all the time my memory flew back to college days and to our strange and most unhappy last meeting and his subsequent inevitable disgrace  far away from hereloch nan and the vacant moorsmy memory wandered  it was at blocksbys auctionroom in a street near the strand on the eve of a great booksale three years before that we had met for almost the last time as i believed though it is true that we had not spoken on that occasion  it is necessary that i should explain what occurred or what i and three other credible witnesses believed to have occurred for upon my word the more i see and hear of human evidence of any event the less do i regard it as establishing anything better than an excessively probable hypothesis  to make a long story as short as may be i should say that allen and i had been acquainted when we were undergraduates that when fellows of our respective colleges our acquaintance had become intimate that we had once shared a little bit of fishing on the test and that we were both bookcollectors  i was a comparatively sane bibliomaniac but to allen the time came when he grudged every penny that he did not spend on rare books and when he actually gave up his share of the water we used to take together that his contribution to the rent might go for rare editions and bindings  after this deplorable change of character we naturally saw each other less but we were still friendly  i went up to town to scribble allen stayed on at oxford  one day i chanced to go into blocksbys rooms it was a friday i rememberthere was to be a great sale on the monday  there i met allen in ecstasies over one of the books displayed in the little side room on the right hand of the sale room  he had taken out of a glass case and was gloating over a book which it seems had long been the blue rose of his fancy as a collector he was crazed about longepierre the old french amateur whose volumes you may remember were always bound in blue morocco and tooled on the centre and at the corners with his badge the golden fleece  now the tome which so fascinated allen was a theocritus published at rome by caliergusa theocritus on blue paper if you please bound in longepierres morocco livery double with red morocco and oh ecstasy with a copy of longepierres version of one idyll on the flyleaf signed with the translators initials and headed a mon roy  it is known to the curious that louis xiv particularly admired and praised this little poem calling it a model of honourable gallantry  clearly the grateful author had presented his own copy to the king and here it was when king and crown had gone down into dust  allen showed me the book he could hardly let it leave his hands  here is a pearl he had said a gem beyond price  im afraid youll find it so i said that is for a paillet or rothschild not for you my boy  i fear so he had answered if i were to sell my whole library tomorrow i could hardly raise the money for he was poor and it was rumoured that his mania had already made him acquainted with the jews  we parted  i went home to chambers allen stayed adoring the unexampled longepierre  that night i dined out and happened to sit next a young lady who possessed a great deal of taste though that was the least of her charms  the fashion for bookcollecting was among her innocent pleasures she had seen allens books at oxford and i told her of his longings for the theocritus  miss breton at once was eager to see the book and the other books and i obtained leave to go with her and mrs breton to the auctionrooms next day  the little sideroom where the treasures were displayed was empty except for an attendant when we went in we looked at the things and made learned remarks but i admit that i was more concerned to look at miss breton than at any work in leather by derome or bauzonnet  we were thus a good deal occupied perhaps with each other people came and went while our heads were bent over a case of volumes under the window  when we did leave on the appeal of mrs breton we bothboth i and katemiss breton i meansaw allenat least i saw him and believed she didabsorbed in gazing at the longepierre theocritus  he held it rather near his face the gas which had been lit fell on the shining golden fleeces of the cover on his long thin hands and eager studious features  it would have been a pity to disturb him in his ecstasy  i looked at miss breton we both smiled and of course i presumed we smiled for the same reason  i happen to know and unluckily did it happen the very minute of the hour when we left blocksbys  it was a quarter to four oclocka church tower was chiming the threequarters in the strand and i looked half mechanically at my own watch which was five minutes fast  on sunday i went down to oxford and happened to walk into allens rooms  he was lying on a sofa reading the spectator  after chatting a little i said you took no notice of me nor of the bretons yesterday allen at blocksbys  i didnt see you he said and as he was speaking there came a knock at the door  come in cried allen and a man entered who was a stranger to me  you would not have called him a gentleman perhaps  however i admit that i am possibly no great judge of a gentleman  allen looked up  hullo mr thomas he said have you come up to see mr mortby mentioning a wellknown oxford bibliophile  wharton he went on addressing me this is mr thomas from blocksbys  i bowed  mr thomas seemed embarrassed  can i have a word alone with you sir he murmured to allen  certainly answered allen looking rather surprised  youll excuse me a moment wharton he said to me  stop and lunch wont you  theres the old spectator for you and he led mr thomas into a small den where he used to hear his pupils read their essays and so forth  in a few minutes he came out looking rather pale and took an embarrassed farewell of mr thomas  look here wharton he said to me here is a curious business  that fellow from blocksbys tells me that the longepierre theocritus disappeared yesterday afternoon that i was the last person in whose hand it was seen and that not only the man who always attends in the room but lord tarras and mr wentworth saw it in my hands just before it was missed  what a nuisance i answered  you were looking at it when miss breton and i saw you and you didnt notice us does thomas know wheni mean about what oclockthe book was first missed  thats the lucky part of the whole worry said allen  i left the rooms at three exactly and it was missed about ten minutes to four dozens of people must have handled it in that interval of time  so interesting a book  but i said and pausedare you sure your watch was right  quite certain besides i looked at a church clock  why on earth do you ask  becausei am awfully sorrythere is some unlucky muddle but it was exactly a quarter or perhaps seventeen minutes to four when both miss breton and i saw you absorbed in the longepierre  oh its quite impossible allen answered i was far enough away from blocksbys at a quarter to four  thats all right i said  of course you can prove that if it is necessary though i dare say the book has fallen behind a row of others and has been found by this time  where were you at a quarter to four  i really dont feel obliged to stand a crossexamination before my time answered allen flushing a little  then i remembered that i was engaged to lunch at all souls which was true enough convenient too for i do not quite see how the conversation could have been carried on pleasantly much further  for i had seen himnot a doubt about it  but there was one curious thing  next time i met miss breton i told her the story and said you remember how we saw allen at blocksbys just as we were going away  no she said i did not see him where was he  then why did you smiledont you remember  i looked at him and at you and i thought you smiled  becausewell i suppose because you smiled she said  and the subject of the conversation was changed  it was an excessively awkward affair  it did not come before the public except of course in the agreeably mythical gossip of an evening paper  there was no more public scandal than that  allen was merely ruined  the matter was introduced to the notice of the wardens and the other fellows of st judes  what lord tarras saw what mr wentworth saw what i saw clearly proved that allen was in the auction rooms and had the confounded book in his hand at an hour when as he asserted he had left the place for some time  it was admitted by one of the people employed at the salerooms that allen had been noticed he was well known there leaving the house at three  but he must have come back again of course as at least four people could have sworn to his presence in the showroom at a quarter to four oclock  when he was asked in a private interview by the head of his college to say where he went after leaving blocksbys allen refused to answer  he merely said that he could not prove the facts that his own word would not be taken against that of so many unprejudiced and even friendly witnesses  he simply threw up the game  he resigned his fellowship he took his name off the books he disappeared  there was a good deal of talk people spoke about the unscrupulousness of collectors and repeated old anecdotes on that subject  then the business was forgotten  next in a years time or so the bookthe confounded longepierres theocrituswas found in a pawnbrokers shop the history of its adventures was traced beyond a shadow of doubt  it had been very adroitly stolen and disposed of by a notorious bookthief a gentleman by birthnow dead but well remembered  ask mr quaritch  allens absolute innocence was thus demonstrated beyond cavil though nobody paid any particular attention to the demonstration  as for allen he had vanished he was heard of no more  he was here dying here beside the black wave of lone loch nan  all this so long in the telling i had time enough to think over as i sat and watched him and wiped his lips with water from the burn clearer and sweeter than the water of the loch  at last his fit of coughing ceased and a kind of peace came into his face  allen my dear old boy i saidi dont often use the language of affectiondid you never hear that all that stupid story was cleared up that everyone knows you are innocent  he only shook his head he did not dare to speak but he looked happier and he put his hand in mine  i sat holding his hand stroking it  i dont know how long i sat there i had put my coat and waterproof under him  he was wet through of course there was little use in what i did  what could i do with him how bring him to a warm and dry place  the idea seemed to strike him for he half rose and pointed to the little burnside across the loch  a plan occurred to me i tore a leaf from my sketchbook put the paper with pencil in his hand and said where do you live  dont speak  write  he wrote in a faint scrawl help me to that burnside  then i can guide you  i hardly know how i got him there for light as he was i am no hercules  however with many a rest we reached the little dell and then i carried him up its green side and laid him on the heather of the moor  he wrote again  go to that clump of rushesthe third from the little hillock  then look but be careful  then lift the big grass tussock  the spot which allen indicated was on the side of a rather steep grassy slope  i approached it dragged at the tussock of grass which came away easily enough and revealed the entrance to no more romantic hidingplace than an old secret whiskey still  private stills not uncommon in sutherland and some other northern shires are extinct in galloway  allen had probably found this one by accident in his wanderings and in his halfinsane bitterness against mankind had made it for some time at least his home  the smokeblackened walls the recesses where the worm tub and the still now stood all plainly enough betrayed the original user of the hidingplace  there was a low bedstead a shelf or two whereon lay a few booksa shakespeare a homer a walton plutarchs lives very little else out of a library once so rich  there was a tub of oatmeal a heap of dry peat two or three eggs in a plate some bottles a keg of whiskey some sardinetins a box with clothesthat was nearly all the plenishing of this hermitage  it was never likely to be discovered except by the smoke when the inmate lit a fire  the local shepherd knew it of course but allen had bought his silence not that there were many neighbours for the shepherd to tattle with  allen had recovered strength enough by this time to reach his den with little assistance  he made me beat up the white of one of the eggs with a little turpentine which was probably under the circumstances the best styptic for his malady within his reach  i lit his fire of peats undressed him put him to bed and made him as comfortable as might be in the den which he had chosen  then i went back to the shepherds sent a messenger to the nearest doctor and procured a kind of sledge generally used for dragging peat home wherein with abundance of blankets for covering i hoped to bring allen back to the shepherds cottage  not to delay over details this was managed at last and the unhappy fellow was under a substantial roof  but he was very ill he became delirious and raved of many thingstalked of old college adventures bid recklessly for imaginary books and practised other eccentricities of fever  when his fever left him he was able to converse in a wayi talking and he scrawling faintly with a pencil on paper  i told him how his character had been cleared how he had been hunted for advertised for vainly enough  to the shepherds cottages where he had lived till the beginning of that summer newspapers rarely came to his den in the old secret still of course they never came at all  his own story of what he had been doing at the fatal hour when so many people saw him at the auctionrooms was brief  he had left the rooms as he said at three oclock pondering how he might raise money for the book on which his heart was set  his feet had taken him half unconsciously to     a dismal court    place of israelite resort  where dwelt and dealt one isaacs from whom he had at various times borrowed money on usury  the name of isaacs was over a bell one of many at the door and when the bell was rung the street door opened of his own accord like that of the little tobaccoandtalk club which used to exist in an alley off pall mall  allen rang the bell the outer door opened and as he was standing at the door of isaacs chambers before he had knocked that portal also opened and the officeboy a young jew slunk cautiously out  on seeing allen he had seemed at once surprised and alarmed  allen asked if his master was in the lad answered no in a hesitating way but on second thoughts averred that isaacs would be back immediately and requested allen to go in and wait  he did so but isaacs never came and allen fell asleep  he had a very distinct and singular dream he said of being in messrs blocksys rooms of handling the longepierre and of seeing wentworth there and lord tarras  when he wakened he was very cold and of course it was pitch dark  he did not remember where he was he lit a match and a candle on the chimneypiece  then slowly his memory came back to him and not only his memory but his consciousness of what he had wholly forgottennamely that this was saturday the sabbath of the jews and that there was not the faintest chance of isaacs arrival at his place of business  in the same moment the embarrassment and confusion of the young israelite flashed vividly across his mind and he saw that he was in a very awkward position  if that fair hebrew boy had been robbing or trying to rob the till then allens position was serious indeed as here he was alone at an untimely hour in the office  so he blew the candle out and went down the dingy stairs as quietly as possible took the first cab he met drove to paddington and went up to oxford  it is probable that the young child of israel if he had been attempting any mischief did not succeed in it  had there been any trouble it is likely enough that he would have involved allen in the grief  then allen would have been in a perhaps unprecedented position  he could have established an alibi as far as the jews affairs went by proving that he had been at blocksbys at the hour when the boy would truthfully have sworn that he had let him into isaacs chambers  and as far as the charge against him at blocksbys went the evidence of the young jew would have gone to prove that he was at isaacs where he had no business to be when we saw him at blocksbys  but unhappily each alibi would have been almost equally compromising  the difficulty never arose but the reason why allen refused to give any account of what he had been doing and where he had been at four oclock on that saturday afternoona refusal that told so heavily against himis now sufficiently clear  his statement would we may believe never have been corroborated by the youthful hebrew who certainly had his own excellent reasons for silence and who probably had carefully established an alibi of his own elsewhere  the true account of allens appearance or apparition at blocksbys when i and tarras wentworth and the attendant recognised him and miss breton did not is thus part of the history of the unexplained  allen might have appealed to precedents in the annals of the psychical society where they exist in scores and are technically styled collective hallucinations  but neither a jury nor a judge perhaps would accept the testimony of experts in psychical research if offered in a criminal trial nor acquit a wraith  possibly this scepticism has never yet injured the cause of an innocent man  yet i know in my own personal experience and have heard from others from men of age sagacity and acquaintance with the greatest affairs instances in which people have been distinctly seen by sane healthy and honourable witnesses in places and circumstances where it was as we say physically impossible that they should have been and where they certainly were not themselves aware of having been  that is why human testimony seems to me to establish no more in certain circumstances than a highly probable working hypothesisa hypothesis on which of course we are bound to act  there is little more to tell  by dint of careful nursing poor allen was enabled to travel he reached mentone and there the mistral ended him he was a lonely man with no kinsfolk his character was cleared among the people who knew him best the others have forgotten him  nobody can be injured by this explanation of his silence when called on to prove his innocence and of his unusually successful vanishing from a society which had never tried very hard to discover him in his retreat  he has lived and suffered and died and left behind him little but an incident in the history of the unexplained     the complete bungler   scene
