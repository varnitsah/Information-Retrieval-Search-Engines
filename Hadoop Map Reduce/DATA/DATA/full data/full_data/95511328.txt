present issue  the first issue of this edition being exhausted the opportunity is taken of making a few corrections the most important of which are here stated  page 163 statement modified as to supposed glaciation of south africa  pages 174 and 338 many geologists now hold that there was no great submergence during the glacial epoch the passages referring to it have therefore been rewritten  page 182 colonel fieldens explanation of the occurrence of large trees on shores and in recent drift in high latitudes is now added        272 a species of carex peculiar to bermuda is now given        356 geomalacus maculosus as a peculiar british species is now omitted  verbal alterations have also been made at pages 41 105 356 and 360                                        vii  preface to the second edition  this edition has been carefully revised throughout and owing to the great increase to our knowledge of the natural history of some of the islands during the last twelve years considerable additions or alterations have been required the more important of these changes are the following  chapter vii the account of the migrations of animals and plants during and since the glacial epoch has been modified to accord with newer information  chapters viii and ix the discussion of the causes of glacial epochs and mild arctic climates has been somewhat modified in view of the late dr crolls remarks and the argument rendered clearer  chapter xiii several additions to the fauna of the galapagos have been noted  chapter xv considerable additions have been made to this chapter embodying the recent discoveries of birds and insects new to the sandwich islands while a much fuller account has been given of its highly peculiar and very interesting flora  chapter xvi important additions and corrections have been made in the lists of peculiar british animals and plants embodying the most recent information  chapter xvii very large additions have been made to the mammalia and birds of borneo and full lists of the peculiar species are given viii  chapter xviii a more accurate account is given of the birds of japan  chapter xix the recent additions to the mammals and birds of madagascar are embodied in this chapter and a fuller sketch is given of the rich and peculiar flora of the island  chapter xxi and xxii some important additions have been made to these chapters owing to more accurate information as to the depth of the sea around new zealand and to the discovery of abundant remains of fossil plants of the tertiary and cretaceous periods both in new zealand and australia  in the body of the work i have in each case acknowledged the valuable information given me by naturalists of eminence in their various departments and i return my best thanks to all who have so kindly assisted me i am however indebted in a special manner to one gentlemanmr theo d a cockerell now curator of the museum of the jamaica institutewho supplied me with a large amount of information by searching the most recent works in the scientific libraries by personal inquiries among naturalists and also by giving me the benefit of his own copious notes and observations without his assistance it would have been difficult for me to have made the present edition so full and complete as i hope it now is in a work of such wide range and dealing with so large a body of facts some errors will doubtless be detected though i trust few of importance    parkstone dorset december 1891                                        ix  preface to the first edition  the present volume is the result of four years additional thought and research on the lines laid down in my geographical distribution of animals and may be considered as a popular supplement to and completion of that work  it is however at the same time a complete work in itself and from the mode of treatment adopted it will i hope be well calculated to bring before the intelligent reader the wide scope and varied interest of this branch of natural history although some of the earlier chapters deal with the same questions as my former volumes they are here treated from a different point of view and as the discussion of them is more elementary and at the same time tolerably full it is hoped that they will prove both instructive and interesting the plan of my larger work required that genera only should be taken account of in the present volume i often discuss the distribution of species and this will help to render the work more intelligible to the unscientific reader  the full statement of the scope and object of the present essay given in the introductory chapter together with the summary of the whole work and the general view of the more important arguments given in the conclusion render it unnecessary for me to offer any further remarks on these points i may however state x generally that so far as i am able to judge a real advance has here been made in the mode of treating problems in geographical distribution owing to the firm establishment of a number of preliminary doctrines or principles which in many cases lead to a far simpler and yet more complete solution of such problems than have been hitherto possible the most important of these doctrines are those which establish and define1 the former wide extension of all groups now discontinuous as being a necessary result of evolution 2 the permanence of the great features of the distribution of land and water on the earths surface and 3 the nature and frequency of climatal changes throughout geological time    i have now only to thank the many friends and correspondents who have given me information or advice besides those whose assistance is acknowledged in the body of the work i am especially indebted to four gentlemen who have been kind enough to read over the proofs of chapters dealing with questions on which they have special knowledge giving me the benefit of valuable emendations and suggestions mr edward r alston has looked over those parts of the earlier chapters which relate to the mammals of europe and the north temperate zone mr s b j skertchley of the geological survey has read the chapters which discuss the glacial epoch and other geological questions professor a newton has looked over the passages referring to the birds of the madagascar group while sir joseph d hooker has given me the invaluable benefit of his remarks on my two chapters dealing with the new zealand flora    croydon august 1880                                        xi  contents  part i  the dispersal

distribution to be found in every countrycan be solved only by the     combination of many distinct lines of inquiry biological and     physicalislands offer the best subjects for the study of     distributionoutline of the subjects to be discussed in the present     volume  when an englishman travels by the nearest searoute from great britain to northern japan he passes by countries very unlike his own both in aspect and natural productions the sunny isles of the mediterranean the sands and datepalms of egypt the arid rocks of aden the cocoa groves of ceylon the tigerhaunted jungles of malacca and singapore the fertile plains and volcanic peaks of luzon the forestclad mountains of formosa and the bare hills of china pass successively in review till after a circuitous voyage of thirteen thousand miles he finds himself at hakodadi in japan he is now separated from his startingpoint by the whole width of europe and northern asia by an almost endless succession of plains and mountains arid deserts or icy plateaux yet when he visits the interior of the country he sees so many familiar natural objects that he can hardly help fancying he is close to his home he finds the woods and fields tenanted by tits hedgesparrows wrens wagtails larks redbreasts 4 thrushes buntings and housesparrows some absolutely identical with our own feathered friends others so closely resembling them that it requires a practised ornithologist to tell the difference if he is fond of insects he notices many butterflies and a host of beetles which though on close examination they are found to be distinct from ours are yet of the same general aspect and seem just what might be expected in any part of europe there are also of course many birds and insects which are quite new and peculiar but these are by no means so numerous or conspicuous as to remove the general impression of a wonderful resemblance between the productions of such remote islands as britain and yesso  now let an inhabitant of australia sail to new zealand a distance of less than thirteen hundred miles and he will find himself in a country whose productions are totally unlike those of his own kangaroos and wombats there are none the birds are almost all entirely new insects are very scarce and quite unlike the handsome or strange australian forms while even the vegetation is all changed and no gumtree or wattle or grasstree meets the travellers eye  but there are some more striking cases even than this of the diversity of the productions of countries not far apart in the malay archipelago there are two islands named bali and lombok each about as large as corsica and separated by a strait only fifteen miles wide at its narrowest part yet these islands differ far more from each other in their birds and quadrupeds than do england and japan the birds of the one are extremely unlike those of the other the difference being such as to strike even the most ordinary observer bali has red and green woodpeckers barbets weaverbirds and blackandwhite magpierobins none of which are found in lombok where however we find screaming cockatoos and friarbirds and the strange moundbuilding megapodes which are all equally unknown in bali many of the kingfishers crowshrikes and other birds though of the same general form are of very distinct species and though a considerable number of birds are the same in both islands the difference 5 is none the less remarkableas proving that mere distance is one of the least important of the causes which have determined the likeness or unlikeness in the animals of different countries  in the western hemisphere we find equally striking examples the eastern united states possess very peculiar and interesting plants and animals the vegetation becoming more luxuriant as we go south but not altering in essential character so that when we reach alabama or florida we still find ourselves in the midst of pines oaks sumachs magnolias vines and other characteristic forms of the temperate flora while the birds insects and landshells are of the same general character with those found further north1 but if we now cross over the narrow strait about fifty miles wide which separates florida from the bahama islands we find ourselves in a totally different country surrounded by a vegetation which is essentially tropical and generally identical with that of cuba the change is most striking because there is little difference of climate of soil or apparently of position to account for it and when we find that the birds the insects and especially the landshells of the bahamas are almost all west indian while the north american types of plants and animals have almost all completely disappeared we shall be convinced that such differences and resemblances cannot be due to existing conditions but must depend upon laws and causes to which mere proximity of position offers no clue  hardly less uncertain and irregular are the effects of climate hot countries usually differ widely from cold ones in all their organic forms but the difference is by no means constant nor does it bear any proportion to difference of temperature between frigid canada and subtropical florida there are less marked differences in the animal productions than between florida and cuba or yucatan so much more alike in climate and so much nearer together so the differences between the birds and quadrupeds of temperate tasmania and tropical north 6 australia are slight and unimportant as compared with the enormous differences we find when we pass from the latter country to equally tropical java if we compare corresponding portions of different continents we find no indication that the almost perfect similarity of climate and general conditions has any tendency to produce similarity in the animal world the equatorial parts of brazil and of the west coast of africa are almost identical in climate and in luxuriance of vegetation but their animal life is totally diverse in the former we have tapirs sloths and prehensiletailed monkeys in the latter elephants antelopes and manlike apes while among birds the toucans chatterers and hummingbirds of brazil are replaced by the plantaineaters beeeaters and sunbirds of africa parts of southtemperate america south africa and south australia correspond closely in climate yet the birds and quadrupeds of these three districts are as completely unlike each other as those of any parts of the world that can be named  if we visit the great islands of the globe we find that they present similar anomalies in their animal productions for while some exactly resemble the nearest continents others are widely different thus the quadrupeds birds and insects of borneo correspond very closely to those of the asiatic continent while those of madagascar are extremely unlike african forms although the distance from the continent is less in the latter case than in the former and if we compare the three great islands sumatra borneo and celebeslying as it were side by side in the same oceanwe find that the two former although furthest apart have almost identical productions while the two latter though closer together are more unlike than britain and japan situated in different oceans and separated by the largest of the great continents  these examples will illustrate the kind of questions it is the object of the present work to deal with every continent every country and every island on the globe offers similar problems of greater or less complexity and interest and the time has now arrived when their solution can be attempted with some prospect of success many 7 years study of this class of subjects has convinced me that there is no short and easy method of dealing with them because they are in their very nature the visible outcome and residual product of the whole past history of the earth if we take the organic productions of a small island or of any very limited tract of country such as a moderatesized country parish we have in their relations and affinitiesin the fact that they are there and others are not there a problem which involves all the migrations of these species and their ancestral formsall the vicissitudes of climate and all the changes of sea and land which have affected those migrationsthe whole series of actions and reactions which have determined the preservation of some forms and the extinction of othersin fact the whole history of the earth inorganic and organic throughout a large portion of geological time  we shall perhaps better exhibit the scope and complexity of the subject and show that any intelligent study of it was almost impossible till quite recently if we concisely enumerate the great mass of facts and the number of scientific theories or principles which are necessary for its elucidation  we require then in the first place an adequate knowledge of the fauna and flora of the whole world and even a detailed knowledge of many parts of it including the islands of more special interest and their adjacent continents this kind of knowledge is of very slow growth and is still very imperfect2 and in many cases it can 8 never now be obtained owing to the reckless destruction of forests and with them of countless species of plants and animals in the next place we require a true and natural classification of animals and plants so that we may know their real affinities and it is only now that this is being generally arrived at we further have to make use of the theory of descent with modification as the only possible key to the interpretation of the facts of distribution and this theory has only been generally accepted within the last twenty years it is evident that so long as the belief in special creations of each species prevailed no explanation of the complex facts of distribution could be arrived at or even conceived for if each species was created where it is now found no further inquiry can take us beyond that fact and there is an end of the whole matter another important factor in our interpretation of the phenomena of distribution is a knowledge of the extinct forms that have inhabited each country during the tertiary and secondary periods of geology new facts of this kind are daily coming to light but except as regards europe north america and parts of india they are extremely scanty and even in the bestknown countries the record itself is often very defective and fragmentary yet we have already obtained remarkable evidence of the migrations of many animals and plants in past ages throwing an often unexpected light on the actual distribution of many groups3 by this means alone can we obtain positive evidence of the past migrations of organisms and when as too frequently is the case this is altogether wanting we 9 have to trust to collateral evidence and more or less probable hypothetical explanations hardly less valuable is the evidence of stratigraphical geology for this often shows us what parts of a country have been submerged at certain epochs and thus enables us to prove that certain areas have been long isolated and the fauna and flora allowed time for special development here too our knowledge is exceedingly imperfect though the blanks upon the geological map of the world are yearly diminishing in extent lastly as a most valuable supplement to geology we require to know approximately the depth and contour of the oceanbed since this affords an important clue to the former existence of nowsubmerged lands uniting islands to continents or affording intermediate stations which have aided the migrations of many organisms this kind of information has only been partially obtained during the last few years and it will be seen in the latter part of this volume that some of the most recent deepsea soundings have afforded a basis for an explanation of one of the most difficult and interesting questions in geographical biologythe origin of the fauna and flora of new zealand  such are the various classes of evidence that bear directly on the question of the distribution of organisms but there are others of even a more fundamental character and the importance of which is only now beginning to be recognised by students of nature these are firstly the wonderful alterations of climate which have occurred in the temperate and polar zones as proved by the evidences of glaciation in the one and of luxuriant vegetation in the other and secondly the theory of the permanence of existing continents and oceans if glacial epochs in temperate lands and mild climates near the poles have as now believed by men of eminence occurred several times over in the past history of the earth the effects of such great and repeated changes both on the migration modification and extinction of species must have been of overwhelming importanceof more importance perhaps than even the geological changes of sea and land it is therefore necessary to consider the evidence for these climatal changes 10 and then by a critical examination of their possible causes to ascertain whether they were isolated phenomena were due to recurrent cosmical actions or were the result of a great system of terrestrial development the latter is the conclusion we arrive at and this conclusion brings with it the conviction that in the theory which accounts for both glacial epochs and warm polar climates we have the key to explain and harmonize many of the most anomalous biological and geological phenomena and one which is especially valuable for the light it throws on the dispersal and existing distribution of organisms the other important theory or rather corollary from the preceding theorythat of the permanence of oceans and the general stability of continents throughout all geological time is as yet very imperfectly understood and seems in fact to many persons in the nature of a paradox the evidence for it however appears to me to be conclusive and it is certainly the most fundamental question in regard to the subject we have to deal with since if we once admit that continents and oceans may have changed places over and over again as many writers maintain we lose all power of reasoning on the migrations of ancestral forms of life and are at the mercy of every wild theorist who chooses to imagine the former existence of a nowsubmerged continent to explain the existing distribution of a group of frogs or a genus of beetles  as already shown by the illustrative examples adduced in this chapter some of the most remarkable and interesting facts in the distribution and affinities of organic forms are presented by islands in relation to each other and to the surrounding continents the study of the productions of the galapagosso peculiar and yet so decidedly related to the american continentappears to have had a powerful influence in determining the direction of mr darwins researches into the origin of species and every naturalist who studies them has always been struck by the unexpected relations or singular anomalies which are so often found to characterize the fauna and flora of islands yet their full importance in connection with the history of the earth and its inhabitants has hardly yet 11 been recognised and it is in order to direct the attention of naturalists to this most promising field of research that i restrict myself in this volume to an elucidation of some of the problems they present to us by far the larger part of the islands of the globe are but portions of continents undergoing some of the various changes to which they are ever subject and the correlative proposition that every portion of our continents has again and again passed through insular conditions has not been sufficiently considered but is i believe the statement of a great and most suggestive truth and one which lies at the foundation of all accurate conception of the physical and organic changes which have resulted in the present state of the earth    the indications now given of the scope and purpose of the present volume renders it evident that before we can proceed to the discussion of the remarkable phenomena presented by insular faunas and floras and the complex causes which have produced them we must go through a series of preliminary studies adapted to give us a command of the more important facts and principles on which the solution of such problems depends the succeeding eight chapters will therefore be devoted to the explanation of the mode of distribution variation modification and dispersal of species and groups illustrated by facts and examples of the true nature of geological change as affecting continents and islands of changes of climate their nature causes and effects of the duration of geological time and the rate of organic development                                        12  chapter ii  the

family distributiongeneral features of overlapping and     discontinuous areasrestricted areas of familiesthe distribution of     orders  so long as it was believed that the several species of animals and plants were special creations and had been formed expressly to inhabit the countries in which they are now found their habitat was an ultimate fact which required no explanation it was assumed that every animal was exactly adapted to the climate and surroundings amid which it lived and that the only or at all events the chief reason why it did not inhabit another country was that the climate or general conditions of that country were not suitable to it but in what the unsuitability consisted we could rarely hope to discover hence the exact locality of any species was not thought of much importance from a scientific point of view and the idea that anything could be learnt by a comparative study of different floras and faunas never entered the minds of the older naturalists  but so soon as the theory of evolution came to be generally adopted and it was seen that each animal could only have come into existence in some area where ancestral 13 forms closely allied to it already lived a real and important relation was established between an animal and its native country and a new set of problems at once sprang into existence from the old point of view the diversities of animal life in the separate continents even where physical conditions were almost identical was the fact that excited astonishment but seen by the light of the evolution theory it is the resemblances rather than the diversities in these distant continents and islands that are most difficult to explain it thus comes to be admitted that a knowledge of the exact area occupied by a species or a group is a real portion of its natural history of as much importance as its habits its structure or its affinities and that we can never arrive at any trustworthy conclusions as to how the present state of the organic world was brought about until we have ascertained with some accuracy the general laws of the distribution of living things over the earths surface  areas of distributionevery species of animal has a certain area of distribution to which as a rule it is permanently confined although no doubt the limits of its range fluctuate somewhat from year to year and in some exceptional cases may be considerably altered in a few years or centuries each species is moreover usually limited to one continuous area over the whole of which it is more or less frequently to be met with but there are many apparent and some real exceptions to this rule some animals are so adapted to certain kinds of countryas to forests or marshes mountains or desertsthat they cannot permanently live elsewhere these may be found scattered over a wide area in suitable spots only but can hardly on that account be said to have several distinct areas of distribution as an example we may name the chamois which lives only on high mountains but is found in the pyrenees the alps the carpathians in some of the greek mountains and the caucasus the variable hare is another and more remarkable case being found all over northern europe and asia beyond lat 55° and also in scotland and ireland in central europe it is unknown till we come to the alps the pyrenees and the caucasus where it again appears this is one of the best cases known of the 14 discontinuous distribution of a species there being a gap of about a thousand miles between its southern limits in russia and its reappearance in the alps there are of course numerous instances in which species occur in two or more islands or in an island and continent and are thus rendered discontinuous by the sea but these involve questions of changes in sea and land which we shall have to consider further on other cases are believed to exist of still wider separation of a species as with the marsh titmice and the reed buntings of europe and japan where similar forms are found in the extreme localities while distinct varieties or subspecies inhabit the intervening districts  extent and limitations of specific areasleaving for the present these cases of want of continuity in a species we find the most wide difference between the extent of country occupied varying in fact from a few square miles to almost the entire land surface of the globe among the mammalia however the same species seldom inhabits both the old and new worlds unless they are strictly arctic animals as the reindeer the elk the arctic fox the glutton the ermine and some others the common wolf of europe and northern asia is thought by many naturalists to be identical with the variously coloured wolves of north america extending from the arctic ocean to mexico in which case this will have perhaps the widest range of any species of mammal little doubt exists as to the identity of the brown bears and the beavers of europe and north america but all these species range up to the arctic circle and there is no example of a mammal universally admitted to be identical yet confined to the temperate zones of the two hemispheres among the undisputed species of mammalia the leopard has an enormous range extending all over africa and south asia to borneo and the east of china and thus having probably the widest range of any known mammal the winged mammalia have not usually very wide ranges there being only one bat common to the old and new worlds this is a british species vesperugo serotinus which is found over the larger part of north america europe and asia as far 15 as pekin and even extends into tropical africa thus rivalling the leopard and the wolf in the extent of country it occupies  of very restricted ranges there are many examples but some of these are subject to doubts as to the distinctness of the species or as to its geographical limits being really known in europe we have a distinct species of ibex capra pyrenaica confined to the pyrenean mountains while the true marmot is restricted to the alpine range more remarkable is the pyrenean watermole mygale pyrenaica a curious small insectivorous animal found only in a few places in the northern valleys of the pyrenees in islands there are many cases of undoubted restriction of species to a small area but these involve a different question from the range of species on continents where there is no apparent obstacle to their wider extension  specific range of birdsamong birds we find instances of much wider range of species which is only what might be expected considering their powers of flight but what is very curious we also find more striking though perhaps not more frequent examples of extreme limitation of range among birds than among mammals of the former phenomenon perhaps the most remarkable case is that afforded by the osprey or fishinghawk which ranges over the greater portion of all the continents as far as brazil south africa the malay islands and tasmania the barn owl strix flammea has nearly as wide a range but in this case there is more diversity of opinion as to the specific difference of many of the forms inhabiting remote countries some of which seem undoubtedly to be distinct among passerine birds the raven has probably the widest range extending from the arctic regions to texas and new mexico in america and to north india and lake baikal in asia while the little northern willowwren phylloscopus borealis ranges from arctic norway across asia to alaska and southward to ceylon china borneo and timor  of very restricted continental ranges the best examples in europe are the little blue magpie cyanopica cooki confined to the central portions of the spanish peninsula and the italian sparrow found only in italy and corsica 16 in asia palestine affords some examples of birds of very restricted rangea beautiful sunbird nectarinea osea a peculiar starling amydrus tristramii and some others being almost or quite confined to the warmer portions of the valley of the jordan in the himalayas there are numbers of birds which have very restricted ranges but those of the neilgherries are perhaps better known several species of laughing thrushes and some other birds being found only on the summits of these mountains the most wonderfully restricted ranges are however to be found among the hummingbirds of tropical america the great volcanic peaks of chimborazo and pichincha have each a peculiar species of hummingbird confined to a belt just below the limits of perpetual snow while the extinct volcano of chiriqui in veragua has a species confined to its wooded crater one of the most strange and beautiful of the hummingbirds loddigesia mirabilis was obtained once only more than forty years ago near chachapoyas in the andes of northern peru and though mr gould sent many drawings of the bird to people visiting the district and for many years offered a high reward for a specimen no other has ever been seen4  the above details will sufficiently explain what is meant by the specific area or range of a species the very wide and very narrow ranges are exceptional the great majority of species both of mammals and birds ranging over moderately wide areas which present no striking contrasts in climate and physical conditions thus a large proportion of european birds range over the whole continent in an east and west direction but considerable numbers are restricted either to the northern or the southern half in africa some species range over all the continent south of the desert while large numbers are restricted to the equatorial forests or to the upland plains in north america if we exclude the tropical and the arctic portions a considerable number of species range over all the temperate parts of the continent while still 17 more are restricted to the east the centre or the west respectively  generic areashaving thus obtained a tolerably clear idea of the main facts as to the distribution of isolated species let us now consider those collections of closelyallied species termed genera what a genus is will be sufficiently understood by a few illustrations all the different kinds of dogs jackals and wolves belong to the dog genus canis the tiger lion leopard jaguar and the wild cats to the cat genus felis the blackbird songthrush misselthrush fieldfare and many others to the thrush genus turdus the crow rook raven and jackdaw to the crow genus corvus but the magpie belongs to another though closelyallied genus pica distinguished by the different form and proportions of its wings and tail from all the species of the crow genus the number of species in a genus varies greatly from one up to several hundreds the giraffe the glutton the walrus the bearded reedling the secretarybird and many others have no close allies and each forms a genus by itself the beaver genus castor and the camel genus camelus each consist of two species on the other hand the deer genus cervus has forty species the mouse and rat genus mus more than a hundred species and there is about the same number of the thrush genus while among the lower classes of animals genera are often very extensive the fine genus papilio or swallowtailed butterflies containing more than four hundred species and cicindela which includes our native tiger beetles has about the same number many genera of shells are very extensive and one of themthe genus helix including the commonest snails and ranging all over the worldis probably the most extensive in the animal kingdom numbering about two thousand described species5  separate and overlapping areasthe species of a genus are distributed in two ways either they occupy distinct areas which do not touch each other and are sometimes widely separated or they touch and occasionally overlap 18 each other each species occupying an area of its own which rarely coincides exactly with that of any other species of the same genus in some cases when a river a mountainchain or a change of conditions as from pasture to desert or forest determines the range of species the areas of two species of the same genus may just meet one beginning where the other ends but this is comparatively rare it occurs however in the amazon valley where several species of monkeys birds and insects come up to the south bank of the river but do not pass it while allied species come to the north bank which in like manner forms their boundary as examples we may mention that one of the saki monkeys pithecia monachus comes up to the south bank of the upper amazon while immediately we cross over to the north bank we find another species pithecia rufibarbata among birds we have the green jacamar galbula viridis abundant on the north bank of the lower amazon while on the south bank we have two allied species galbula rufoviridis and g cyaneicollis and among insects we have at santarem on the south bank of the amazon the beautiful blue butterfly callithea sapphira while almost opposite to it at montealegre an allied species callithea leprieuri is alone found perhaps the most interesting and best known case of a series of allied species whose ranges are separate but conterminous is that of the beautiful south american wading birds called trumpeters and forming the genus psophia there are five species all found in the amazon valley but each limited to a wellmarked district bounded by great rivers on the north bank of the amazon there are two species one in its lower valley extending up to the rio negro and the other in the central part of the valley beyond that river while to the south of the amazon there are three one above the madeira one below it and a third near para probably separated from the last by the tocantins river  overlapping areas among the species of a genus is a more common phenomenon and is almost universal where these species are numerous in the same continent it is however exceedingly irregular so that we often find one 19 species extending over a considerable portion of the area occupied by the genus and including the entire areas of some of the other species so little has been done to work out accurately the limits of species that it is very difficult to give examples one of the best is to be found in the genus dendroeca a group of american woodwarblers these little birds all migrate in the winter into the tropical regions but in the summer they come north each having its particular range thus d dominica comes as far as the middle eastern states d coerulea keeps west of the alleghanies d discolor comes to michigan and new england four other species go farther north in canada while several extend to the borders of the arctic zone  the species of tits as illustrating areas of distributionin our own hemisphere the overlapping of allied species may be well illustrated by the various kinds of titmice constituting the genus parus several of which are among our best known english birds the great titmouse parus major has the widest range of all extending from the arctic circle to algeria palestine and persia and from ireland right across siberia to the ochotsk sea probably following the great northern forest belt it does not extend into china and japan where distinct species are found next in extent of range is the coal tit parus ater which inhabits all europe from the mediterranean to about 64° n latitude in asia minor to the lebanon and caucasus and across siberia to amoorland and japan the marsh tit parus palustris inhabits temperate and south europe from 61° n latitude in norway to poland and southwest russia and in the south from spain to asia minor closely allied to thisof which it is probably only a variety or subspeciesis the northern marsh tit parus borealis which overlaps the last in norway and sweden and also in south russia and the alps but extends further north into lapland and north russia and thence probably in a southeasterly direction across central asia to north china yet another closelyallied species parus camtschatkensis ranges from northeastern russia across northern siberia to lake baikal and to hakodadi in japan thus overlapping parus borealis in the 20 western portion of its area our little favourite the blue tit parus coeruleus ranges over all europe from the arctic circle to the mediterranean and on to asia minor and persia but does not seem to pass beyond the ural mountains its lovely eastern ally the azure tit parus cyaneus overlaps the range of p coeruleus in western europe as far as st petersburg and austria rarely straggling to denmark while it stretches all across central asia between the latitudes 35° and 56° n as far as the amoor valley besides these wideranging species there are several others which are more restricted parus teneriffæ a beautiful dark blue form of our blue tit inhabits northwest africa and the canaries parus ledouci closely allied to our coal tit is found only in algeria parus lugubris allied to the marsh tit is confined to southeast europe and asia minor from hungary and south russia to palestine and parus cinctus another allied form is confined to the extreme north in lapland finland and perhaps northern russia and siberia another beautiful little bird the crested titmouse parus cristatus is sometimes placed in a separate genus it inhabits nearly all central and south europe wherever there are pine forests from 64° n latitude to austria and north italy and in the west to spain and gibraltar while in the east it does not pass the urals and the caucasus range its nearest allies are in the high himalayas  these are all the european tits but there are many others inhabiting asia africa and north america so that the genus parus has a very wide range in asia to ceylon and the malay islands in africa to the cape and in north america to the highlands of mexico  the distribution of the species of jaysowing to the very wide range of several of the tits the uncertainty of the specific distinction of others and the difficulty in many cases of ascertaining their actual distribution it has not been found practicable to illustrate this genus by means of a map for this purpose we have chosen the genus garrulus or the jays in which the species are less numerous the specific areas less extensive and the species generally better defined while being large and handsome 21 birds they are sure to have been collected or at least noticed wherever they occur there are so far as yet known twelve species of true jays occupying an area extending from western europe to eastern asia and japan and nowhere passing the arctic circle to the north or the tropic of cancer to the south so that they constitute one of the most typical of the palæarctic6 genera the following are the species beginning with the most westerly and proceeding towards the east the numbers prefixed to each species correspond to those on the coloured map which forms the frontispiece to this volume  1 garrulus glandariusthe common jay inhabits the british isles and all europe except the extreme north extending also into north africa where it has been observed in many parts of algeria it occurs near constantinople but apparently not in asia minor and in russia up to but not beyond the urals the jays being woodland birds are not found in open plains or barren uplands and their distribution is hence by no means uniform within the area they actually occupy  2 garrulus cervicalisthe algerian jay is a very distinct species inhabiting a limited area in north africa and found in some places along with the common species  3 garrulus krynickithe blackheaded jay is closely allied to the common species but quite distinct inhabiting a comparatively small area in southeastern europe and western asia  4 garrulus atricapillusthe syrian jay is very closely allied to the last and inhabits an adjoining area in syria palestine and southern persia  5 garrulus hyrcanusthe persian jay is a small species allied to our jay and only known from the elburz mountains in the north of persia  6 garrulus brandtibrandts jay is a very distinct species having an extensive range across asia from the ural mountains to north china mandchuria and the northern island of japan and also crossing the urals into 22 russia where it has been found as far west as kazan in districts where the common jay also occurs  7 garrulus lanceolatusthe blackthroated jay is a very distinct form known only from the northwestern himalayas and nepal common about simla and extending into cashmere beyond the range of the next species  8 garrulus bispecularisthe himalayan jay is also very distinct having the head coloured like the back and not striped as in all the western species it inhabits the himalayas east of cashmere but is more abundant in the western than the eastern division though according to the abbé david it reaches moupin in east thibet  9 garrulus sinensisthe chinese jay is very closely allied to the himalayan of which it is sometimes classed as a subspecies it seems to be found in all the southern mountains of china from foochow on the east to szechuen and east thibet on the west as it is recorded from moupin by the abbé david as well as the himalayan birda tolerable proof that it is a distinct form  10 garrulus taivanusthe formosan jay is a very close ally of the preceding confined to the island of formosa  11 garrulus japonicusthe japanese jay is nearly allied to our common british species being somewhat smaller and less brightly coloured and with black orbits yet these are the most widely separated species of the genus according to mr seebohm this species is equally allied to the chinese and siberian jays  in the accompanying map see frontispiece we have laid down the distribution of each species so far as it can be ascertained from the works of sharpe and dresser for europe jerdon for india swinhoe for china and mr seebohms recent work for japan there is however much uncertainty in many places and gaps have to be filled up conjecturally while such a large part of asia is still very imperfectly explored that considerable modifications may have to be made when the country becomes more accurately known but though details may be modified we can hardly suppose that the great features of the several specific areas or their relations to each other 23 will be much affected and these are what we have chiefly to consider as bearing on the questions here discussed  the first thing that strikes us on looking at the map is the small amount of overlapping of the several areas and the isolation of many of the species while the next most striking feature is the manner in which the asiatic species almost surround a vast area in which no jays are found the only species with large areas are the european g glandarius and the asiatic g brandti the former has three species overlapping itin algeria in southeastern and northeastern europe respectively the syrian jay no 4 is not known to occur anywhere with the blackheaded jay no 3 and perhaps the two areas do not meet the persian jay no 5 is quite isolated the himalayan and chinese jays nos 7 8 and 9 form a group which are isolated from the rest of the genus while the japanese jay no 11 is also completely isolated as regards the european jays to which it is nearly allied these peculiarities of distribution are no doubt in part dependent on the habits of the jays which live only in wellwooded districts among deciduous trees and are essentially nonmigratory in their habits though sometimes moving southwards in winter this will explain their absence from the vast desert area of central asia but it will not account for the gap between the north and south chinese species nor for the absence of jays from the wooded hills of turkestan where mr n a severtzoff collected assiduously obtaining 384 species of birds but no jay these peculiarities and the fact that jays are never very abundant anywhere seem to indicate that the genus is now a decaying one and that it has at no very distant epoch occupied a larger and more continuous area such as that of the genus parus at the present day  discontinuous generic areasit is not very easy to find good examples of genera whose species occupy two or more quite disconnected areas for though such cases may not be rare we are seldom in a position to mark out the limits of the several species with sufficient accuracy the best and most remarkable case among european birds is 24 that of the blue magpies forming the genus cyanopica one species c cooki is confined as already stated to the wooded and mountainous districts of spain and portugal while the only other species of the genus c cyanus is found far away in northeastern asia and japan so that the two species are separated by about 5000 miles of continuous land another case is that of the curious little watermoles forming the genus mygale one species m muscovitica being found only on the banks of the volga and don in southeastern russia while the other m pyrenaica is confined to streams on the northern side of the pyrenees in tropical america there are four different kinds of bellbirds belonging to the genus chasmorhynchus each of which appears to inhabit a restricted area completely separated from the others the most northerly is c tricarunculatus of costa rica and veragua a brown bird with a white head and three long caruncles growing upwards at the base of the beak next comes c variegatus in venezuela a white bird with a brown head and numerous caruncles on the throat perhaps conterminous with the last in guiana extending to near the mouth of the rio negro we have c niveus the bellbird described by waterton which is pure white with a single long fleshy caruncle at the base of the beak the last species c nudicollis inhabits southeast brazil and is also white but with black stripes over the eyes and with a naked throat these birds are about the size of thrushes and are all remarkable for their loud ringing notes like a bell or a blow on an anvil as well as for their peculiar colours they are therefore known to the native indians wherever they exist and we may be the more sure that they do not spread over the intervening areas where they have never been found and where the natives know nothing of them  a good example of isolated species of a group nearer home is afforded by the snowpartridges of the genus tetraogallus one species inhabits the caucasus range and nowhere else keeping to the higher slopes from 6000 to 11000 feet above the sea and accompanying the ibex in its wanderings as both feed on the same plants another 25 has a wider range in asia minor and persia from the taurus mountains to the southeast corner of the caspian sea a third species inhabits the western himalayas between the forests and perpetual snow extending eastwards to nepal while a fourth is found on the north side of the mountains in thibet and the ranges of these two perhaps overlap the last species inhabit the altai mountains and like the two first appears to be completely separated from all its allies  there are some few still more extraordinary cases in which the species of one genus are separated in remote continents or islands the most striking of these is that of the tapirs forming the genus tapirus of which there are two or three species in south america and one very distinct species in malacca and borneo separated by nearly half the circumference of the globe another example among quadrupeds is a peculiar genus of moles named urotrichus of which one species inhabits japan and the other british columbia the cuckoolike honeyguides forming the genus indicator are tolerably abundant in tropical africa but there are two outlying species one in the eastern himalaya mountains the other in borneo both very rare and recently an allied species has been found in the malay peninsula the beautiful blue and green thrushtits forming the genus cochoa have two species in the eastern himalayas and eastern china while the third is confined to java the curious genus eupetes supposed to be allied to the dippers has one species in sumatra and malacca while four other species are found two thousand miles distant in new guinea lastly the lovely groundthrushes of the genus pitta range from hindostan to australia while a single species far removed from all its near allies inhabits west africa  peculiarities of generic and family distributionthe examples now given sufficiently illustrate the mode in which the several species of a genus are distributed we have next to consider genera as the component parts of families and families of orders from the same point of view 26  all the phenomena presented by the species of a genus are reproduced by the genera of a family and often in a more marked degree owing however to the extreme restriction of genera by modern naturalists there are not many among the higher animals that have a worldwide distribution among the mammalia there is no such thing as a truly cosmopolitan genus this is owing to the absence of all the higher orders except the mice from australia while the genus mus which occurs there is represented by a distinct group hesperomys in america if however we consider the australian dingo as a native animal we might class the genus canis as cosmopolite but the wild dogs of south america are now formed into separate genera by some naturalists many genera however range over three or more continents as felis the cat genus absent only from australia ursus the bear genus absent from australia and tropical africa cervus the deer genus with nearly the same range and sciurus the squirrel genus found in all the continents but australia among birds turdus the thrush and hirundo the swallow genus are the only perching birds which are truly cosmopolites but there are many genera of hawks owls wading and swimming birds which have a worldwide range  as a great many genera consist of single species there is no lack of cases of great restriction such as the curious lemur called the potto which is found only at sierra leone and forms the genus perodicticus the true chinchillas found only in the andes of peru and chili south of 9° s lat and between 8000 and 12000 feet elevation several genera of finches each confined to limited portions of the higher himalayas the bloodpheasants ithaginis found only above 10000 feet from nepal to east thibet the baldheaded starling of the philippine islands the lyrebirds of east australia and a host of others  it is among the different genera of the same family that we meet with the most striking examples of discontinuity although these genera are often as unmistakably allied as are the species of a genus and it is these cases that furnish the most interesting problems to the student of distribution 27 we must therefore consider them somewhat more fully  among mammalia the most remarkable of these divided families is that of the camels of which one genus camelus the true camels comprising the camel and dromedary is confined to asia while the other auchenia comprising the llamas and alpacas is found only in the high andes and in the plains of temperate south america not only are these two genera separated by the atlantic and by the greater part of the land of two continents but one is confined to the northern and the other to the southern hemisphere the next case though not so well known is equally remarkable it is that of the centetidæ a family of small insectivorous animals which are wholly confined to madagascar and the large west indian islands cuba and hayti the former containing five genera and the latter a single genus with a species in each island here again we have the whole continent of africa as well as the atlantic ocean separating allied genera two families or subfamilies of ratlike animals octodontidæ and echimyidæ are also divided by the atlantic both are mainly south american but the former has two genera in north and east africa and the latter also two in south and west africa two other families of mammalia though confined to the eastern hemisphere are yet markedly discontinuous the tragulidæ are small deerlike animals known as chevrotains or mousedeer abundant in india and the larger malay islands and forming the genus tragulus while another genus hyomoschus is confined to west africa the other family is the simiidæ or anthropoid apes in which we have the gorilla and chimpanzee confined to west and central africa while the allied orangs are found only in the islands of sumatra and borneo the two groups being separated by a greater space than the echimyidæ and other rodents of africa and south america  among birds and reptiles we have several families which from being found only within the tropics of asia africa and america have been termed tropicopolitan groups the megalæmidæ or barbets are gaily coloured 28 fruiteating birds almost equally abundant in tropical asia and africa but less plentiful in america where they probably suffer from the competition of the larger sized toucans the genera of each country are distinct but all are closely allied the family being a very natural one the trogons form a family of very gorgeously coloured and remarkable insecteating birds very abundant in tropical america less so in asia and with a single genus of two species in africa  among reptiles we have two families of snakesthe dendrophidæ or treesnakes and the dryiophidæ or green whipsnakeswhich are also found in the three tropical regions of asia africa and america but in these cases even some of the genera are common to asia and africa or to africa and america the lizards forming the family amphisbænidæ are divided between tropical africa and america a few species only occurring in the southern portion of the adjacent temperate regions while even the peculiarly american family of the iguanas is represented by two genera in madagascar and one in the fiji and friendly islands passing on to the amphibians the wormlike cæciliadæ are tropicopolitan as are also the toads of the family engystomatidæ insects also furnish some analogous cases three genera of cicindelidæ pogonostoma ctenostoma and peridexia showing a decided connection between this family in south america and madagascar while the beautiful family of diurnal moths uraniidæ is confined to the same two countries a somewhat similar but better known illustration is afforded by the two genera of ostriches one confined to africa and arabia the other to the plains of temperate south america  general features of overlapping and discontinuous areasthese numerous examples of discontinuous genera and families form an important section of the facts of animal dispersal which any true theory must satisfactorily account for in greater or less prominence they are to be found all over the world and in every group of animals and they grade imperceptibly into those cases of conterminous and overlapping areas which we have seen to 29 prevail in most extensive groups of species and which are perhaps even more common in those large families which consist of many closely allied genera a sufficient proof of the overlapping of generic areas is the occurrence of a number of genera of the same family together thus in france or italy about twenty genera of warblers sylviadæ are found and as each of the thirtythree genera of this family inhabiting temperate europe and asia has a different area a great number must here overlap so in most parts of africa at least ten or twelve genera of antelopes may be found and in south america a large proportion of the genera of monkeys of the family cebidæ occur in many districts and still more is this the case with the larger bird families such as the tanagers the tyrant shrikes or the treecreepers so that there is in all these extensive families no genus whose area does not overlap that of many others then among the moderately extensive families we find a few instances of one or two genera isolated from the rest as the spectacled bear tremarctos found only in chili while the remainder of the family extends from europe and asia over north america to the mountains of mexico but no further south the bovidæ or hollowhorned ruminants which have a few isolated genera in the rocky mountains and the islands of sumatra and celebes and from these we pass on to the cases of wide separation already given  restricted areas of familiesas families sometimes consist of single genera and even single species they often present examples of very restricted range but what is perhaps more interesting are those cases in which a family contains numerous species and sometimes even several genera and yet is confined to a narrow area such are the golden moles chrysochloridæ consisting of two genera and three species confined to extratropical south africa the hilltits liotrichidæ a family of numerous genera and species mainly confined to the himalayas but with a few straggling species in the malay countries and the mountains of china the pteroptochidæ large wrenlike birds consisting of eight genera and nineteen species almost entirely confined to temperate south america and 30 the andes and the birdsofparadise consisting of nineteen or twenty genera and about thirtyfive species almost all inhabitants of new guinea and the immediately surrounding islands while a few doubtfully belonging to the family extend to east australia among reptiles the most striking case of restriction is that of the roughtailed burrowing snakes uropeltidæ the five genera and eighteen species being strictly confined to ceylon and the southern parts of the indian peninsula  the distribution of orderswhen we pass to the larger groups termed orders comprising several families we find comparatively few cases of restriction and many of worldwide distribution and the families of which they are composed are strictly comparable to the genera of which families are composed inasmuch as they present examples of overlapping or conterminous or isolated areas though the latter are comparatively rare among mammalia the insectivora offer the best example of an order several of whose families inhabit areas more or less isolated from the rest while the marsupialia have six families in australia and one the opossums far off in america  perhaps more important is the limitation of some entire orders to certain welldefined portions of the globe thus the proboscidea comprising the single family and genus of the elephants and the hyracoidea that of the hyrax or syrian coney are confined to parts of africa and asia the marsupials to australia and america and the monotremata the lowest of all mammalscomprising the duckbilled platypus and the spiny echidna to australia and new guinea among birds the struthiones or ostrich tribe are almost confined to the three southern continents south america africa and australia and among amphibia the tailed batrachiathe newts and salamandersare similarly restricted to the northern hemisphere  these various facts will receive their explanation in a future chapter

neotropical regioncomparison of zoological regions with the     geographical divisions of the globe  having now obtained some notion of how animals are dispersed over the earths surface whether as single species or as collected in those groups termed genera families and orders it will be well before proceeding further to understand something of the classification of the facts we have been considering and some of the simpler conclusions these facts lead to  we have hitherto described the distribution of species and groups of animals by means of the great geographical divisions of the globe in common use but it will have been observed that in hardly any case do these define the limits of anything beyond species and very seldom or perhaps never even those accurately thus the term europe will not give with any approach to accuracy the range of any one genus of mammals or birds and 32 perhaps not that of halfadozen species either they range into siberia or asia minor or palestine or north africa and this seems to be always the case when their area of distribution occupies a large portion of europe there are indeed a few species limited to central or western or southern europe and these are almost the only cases in which we can use the word for zoological purposes without having to add to it some portion of another continent still less useful is the term asia for this purpose since there is probably no single animal or group confined to asia which is not also more or less nearly confined to the tropical or the temperate portion of it the only exception is perhaps the tiger which may really be called an asiatic animal as it occupies nearly twothirds of the continent but this is an unique example while the cases in which asiatic animals and groups are strictly limited to a portion of asia or extend also into europe or into africa or to the malay islands are exceedingly numerous so in africa very few groups of animals range over the whole of it without going beyond either into europe or asia minor or arabia while those which are purely african are generally confined to the portion south of the tropic of cancer australia and america are terms which better serve the purpose of the zoologist the former defines the limit of many important groups of animals and the same may be said of the latter but the division into north and south america introduces difficulties for almost all the groups especially characteristic of south america are found also beyond the isthmus of panama in what is geographically part of the northern continent  it being thus clear that the old and popular divisions of the globe are very inconvenient when used to describe the range of animals we are naturally led to ask whether any other division can be made which will be more useful and will serve to group together a considerable number of the facts we have to deal with such a division was made by mr p l sclater more than twenty years ago and it has with some slight modifications come into pretty general use in this country and to some extent also 33 abroad we shall therefore proceed to explain its nature and the principles on which it is established as it will have to be often referred to in future chapters of this work and will take the place of the old geographical divisions whose inconvenience has already been pointed out the primary zoological divisions of the globe are called regions and we will begin by ascertaining the limits of the region of which our own country forms a part  the range of british mammals as indicating a zoological regionwe will first take our commonest wild mammalia and see how far they extend and especially whether they are confined to europe or range over parts of other continents     1 wild cat   europe  n africa  siberia afghanistan    2 fox        europe  n africa  central asia to amoor    3 weasel     europe  n africa  central asia to amoor    4 otter      europe  n africa  siberia    5 badger     europe  n africa  central asia to amoor    6 stag       europe  n africa  central asia to amoor    7 hedgehog   europe           central asia to amoor    8 mole       europe           central asia    9 squirrel   europe           central asia to amoor   10 dormouse   europe                   11 waterrat  europe           central asia to amoor   12 hare       europe           w siberia persia   13 rabbit     europe  n africa         we thus see that out of thirteen of our commonest quadrupeds only one is confined to europe while seven are found also in northern africa and eleven range into siberia most of them stretching quite across asia to the valley of the amoor on the extreme eastern side of that continent two of the abovenamed british species the fox and weasel are also inhabitants of the new world being as common in the northern parts of north america as they are with us but with these exceptions the entire range of our commoner species is given and they clearly show that all northern asia and northern africa must be added to europe in order to form the region which they collectively inhabit if now we go into central europe and take for example the quadrupeds of germany we shall find that these too although much more numerous are confined to the same limits except that some of the 34 more arctic kinds as already stated extend into the colder regions of north america  range of east asian and north african mammalslet us now pass to the other side of the great northern continent and examine the list of the quadrupeds of amoorland in the same latitude as germany we find that there are fortyfour terrestrial species omitting the bats the seals and other marine animals and of these no less than twentysix are identical with european species and twelve or thirteen more are closely allied representatives leaving only five or six which are peculiarly asiatic we can hardly have a more convincing proof of the essential oneness of the mammalia of europe and northern asia  in northern africa we do not find so many european species though even here they are very numerous because a considerable number of west asiatic and desert forms occur having however shown that europe and western asia have almost identical animals we may treat all these as really european and we shall then be able to compare the quadrupeds of north africa with those of europe and west asia taking those of algeria as the best known we find that there are thirtythree species identical with those of europe and west asia while twentyfour more though distinct are closely allied belonging to the same genera thus making a total of fiftyseven of european type on the other hand we have seven species which are either identical with species of tropical africa or allied to them and six more which are especially characteristic of the african and asiatic deserts which form a kind of neutral zone between the temperate and tropical regions if now we consider that algeria and the adjacent countries bordering the mediterranean form part of africa while they are separated from europe by a wide sea and are only connected with asia by a narrow isthmus we cannot but feel surprised at the wonderful preponderance of the european and west asiatic elements in the mammalia which inhabit the district  the range of british birdsas it is very important that no doubt should exist as to the limits of the zoological 35 region of which europe forms a part we will now examine the birds in order to see how far they agree in their distribution with the mammalia of late years great attention has been paid to the distribution of european and asiatic birds many ornithologists having travelled in north africa in palestine in asia minor in persia in siberia in mongolia and in china so that we are now able to determine the exact ranges of many species in a manner that would have been impossible a few years ago these ranges are given for all british species in the new edition of yarrells history of british birds edited by professor newton while those of all european birds are given in still more detail in mr dressers beautiful work on the birds of europe in order to confine our examination within reasonable limits and at the same time give it the interest attaching to familiar objects we will take the whole series of british passeres or perching birds given in professor newtons work 118 in number and arrange them in series according to the extent of their range these include not only the permanent residents and regular migrants to our country but also those which occasionally straggle here so that it really comprises a large proportion of all european birds  i british birds which extend to north africa and central or northeast asia     1 lanius collurio

africa but not at all into asia      7 species which range to west asia but not to north africa      5 species which do not range out of europe  these figures agree essentially with those furnished by the mammalia and complete the demonstration that all the temperate portions of asia and north africa must be added to europe to form a natural zoological division of the earth we must also note how comparatively few of these overpass the limits thus indicated only seven species extending their range occasionally into tropical or south africa eight into some parts of tropical asia and six into arctic or temperate north america  range of east asian birdsto complete the evidence we only require to know that the east asiatic birds are as much like those of europe as we have already shown to be the case when we take the point of departure from our end of the continent this does not follow necessarily because it is possible that a totally distinct north asiatic fauna might there prevail and although our birds go eastward to the remotest parts of asia their birds might not come westward to europe the birds of eastern siberia have been carefully studied by russian naturalists and afford us the means of making the required comparison there are 151 species belonging to the orders passeres and picariæ the perching and climbing birds and of these no less than 77 or more than half are absolutely identical 39 with european species 63 are peculiar to north asia but all except five or six of these are allied to european forms the remaining 11 species are migrants from southeastern asia the resemblance is therefore equally close whichever extremity of the euroasiatic continent we take as our starting point and is equally remarkable in birds as in mammalia we have now only to determine the limits of this our first zoological region which has been termed the palæarctic by mr sclater meaning the northern oldworld regiona name now well known to naturalists  the limits of the palæarctic regionthe boundaries of this region as nearly as they can be ascertained are shown on our general map at the beginning of this chapter but it will be evident on consideration that except in a few places its limits can only be approximately defined on the north east and west it extends to the ocean and includes a number of islands whose peculiarities will be pointed out in a subsequent chapter so that the southern boundary alone remains but as this runs across the entire continent from the atlantic to the pacific ocean often traversing littleknown regions we may perhaps never be able to determine it accurately even if it admits of such determination in drawing the boundary line across africa we meet with our first difficulty the euroasiatic animals undoubtedly extend to the northern borders of the sahara while those of tropical africa come up to its southern margin the desert itself forming a kind of sandy ocean between them some of the species on either side penetrate and even cross the desert but it is impossible to balance these with any accuracy and it has therefore been thought best as a mere matter of convenience to consider the geographical line of the tropic of cancer to form the boundary we are thus enabled to define the palæarctic region as including all north temperate africa and a similar intermingling of animal types occurring in arabia the same boundary line is continued to the southern shore of the persian gulf persia and afghanistan undoubtedly belong to the palæarctic region and baluchistan should probably go with these the boundary in the northwestern part of india is again difficult to determine but it 40 cannot be far one way or the other from the river indus as far up as attock opposite the mouth of the cabool river here it will bend to the southeast passing a little south of cashmeer and along the southern slopes of the himalayas into east thibet and china at heights varying from 9000 to 11000 feet according to soil aspect and shelter it may perhaps be defined as extending to the upper belt of forests as far as coniferous trees prevail but the temperate and tropical faunas are here so intermingled that to draw any exact parting line is impossible the two faunas are however very distinct in and above the pine woods there are abundance of warblers of northern genera with wrens numerous titmice and a great variety of buntings grosbeaks bullfinches and rosefinches all more or less nearly allied to the birds of europe and northern asia while a little lower down we meet with a host of peculiar birds allied to those of tropical asia and the malay islands but often of distinct genera there can be no doubt therefore of the existence here of a pretty sharp line of demarkation between the temperate and tropical faunas though this line will be so irregular owing to the complex system of valleys and ridges that in our present ignorance of much of the country it cannot be marked in detail on any map  further east in china it is still more difficult to determine the limits of the region owing to the great intermixture of migrating birds tropical forms passing northwards in summer as far as the amoor river while the northern forms visit every part of china in winter from what we know however of the distribution of some of the more typical northern and southern species we are able to fix the limits of the palæarctic region a little south of shanghai on the east coast several tropical genera come as far north as ningpo or even shanghai but rarely beyond while in formosa and amoy tropical forms predominate such decidedly northern forms as bullfinches and hawfinches are found at shanghai hence we may commence the boundary line on the coast between shanghai and ningpo but inland it probably bends a little southward and then northward to the mountains and valleys of west 41 china and east thibet in about 32° n latitude where at moupin a french missionary père david made extensive collections showing this district to be at the junction of the tropical and temperate faunas japan as a whole is decidedly palæarctic although its extreme southern portion owing to its mild insular climate and evergreen vegetation gives shelter to a number of tropical forms  characteristic features of the palæarctic regionhaving thus demonstrated the unity of the palæarctic region by tracing out the distribution of a large proportion of its mammalia and birds it only remains to show how far it is characterised by peculiar groups such as genera and families and to say a few words on the lower forms of life which prevail in it  taking first the mammalia we find this region distinguished by possessing two peculiar genera of talpidæ or moles the family being confined to the palæarctic and nearctic regions the true hedgehogs erinaceus are also characteristic being only found elsewhere in south africa and in the northern part of the oriental region among carnivora the racoondog nyctereutes of northeastern asia and the true badgers of the genus meles are peculiar most other parts of the world possessing distinct genera of badgers it has six peculiar genera or subgenera of deer seven peculiar genera of bovidæ chiefly antelopes while the entire group of goats and sheep comprising twentytwo species is almost confined to it one species only occurring in the rocky mountains of north america and another in the nilgiris of southern india among the rodents there are nine genera with twentyseven species wholly confined to it while several others as the hamsters the dormice and the pikas have only a few species elsewhere  in birds there are a large number of peculiar genera of which we need mention only a few of the more important as the grasshopper warblers locustella with seven species the accentors with twelve species and about a dozen other genera of warblers including the robins the bearded titmouse and several allied genera the longtailed titmice forming the genus acredula the magpies choughs and nutcrackers a host of finches among which the bullfinches pyrrhula and the buntings emberiza are the 42 most important the true pheasants phasianus are wholly palæarctic except one species in formosa as are several genera of wading birds though the reptiles of cold countries are few as compared with those of the tropics the palæarctic region in its warmer portions has a considerable number and among these are many which are peculiar to it such are four genera of snakes seven of lizards five of frogs and toads and twelve of newts and salamanders while of freshwater fishes there are about twenty peculiar genera7 among insects we may mention the elegant apollo butterflies of the alps as forming a peculiar genus parnassius only found elsewhere in the rocky mountains of north america while the beautiful genus thais of the south of europe and sericinus of north china are equally remarkable among other insects we can only now refer to the great family of carabidæ or predaceous groundbeetles which are immensely numerous in this region there being about fifty peculiar genera while the large and handsome genus carabus with its allies procerus and procrustes containing nearly 300 species is almost wholly confined to this region and would alone serve to distinguish it zoologically from all other parts of the globe  43  having given so full an exposition of the facts which determine the extent and boundaries of the palæarctic region there is less need of entering into much detail as regards the other regions of the eastern hemisphere their boundaries being easily defined while their forms of animal life are well marked and strongly contrasted  definition and characteristic groups of the ethiopian regionthe ethiopian region consists of all tropical and south africa to which are appended the large island of madagascar and the mascarene islands to the east and north of it though these differ materially from the continent and will have to be discussed in a separate chapter for the present then we will take africa south of the tropic of cancer and consider how far its animals are distinct from those of the palæarctic region  taking first the mammalia we find the following remarkable animals at once separating it from the palæarctic and every other region the gorilla and chimpanzee the baboons numerous lemurs the spotted hyæna the aardwolf and hyænadog zebras the hippopotamus giraffe and more than seventy peculiar antelopes here we have a wonderful collection of large and peculiar quadrupeds but the ethiopian region is also characterised by the absence of others which are not only abundant in the palæarctic region but in many tropical regions as well the most remarkable of these deficiencies are the bears the deer and the wild oxen all of which abound in the tropical parts of asia while bears and deer extend into both north and south america besides the large and conspicuous animals mentioned above africa possesses a number of completely isolated groups such are the potamogale a curious otterlike watershrew discovered by du chaillu in west africa so distinct as to constitute a new family potamogalidæ the goldenmoles also forming a peculiar family chrysochloridæ as do the elephantshrews macroscelididæ the singular aardvarks or earthpigs forming a peculiar family of edentata called orycteropodidæ while there are numerous peculiar genera of monkeys swine civets and rodents  among birds the most conspicuous and remarkable are the greatbilled vulturecrows corvultur the longtailed 44 whydah finches vidua the curious oxpeckers buphaga the splendid metallic starlings lamprocolius the handsome plantaineaters musophaga the groundhornbills bucorvus the numerous guineafowls belonging to four distinct genera the serpenteating secretarybird serpentarius the huge boatbilled heron balæniceps and the true ostriches there are also three quite peculiar african families the musophagidæ or plantaineaters including the elegant crested touracos the curious little finchlike colies coliidæ and the irrisoridæ insecteating birds allied to the hoopoes but with glossy metallic plumage and arboreal habits  in reptiles fishes insects and landshells africa is very rich and possesses an immense number of peculiar forms these are not sufficiently familiar to require notice in a work of this character but we may mention a few as mere illustrations the puffadders the most hideous of poisonous snakes the chameleons the most remarkable of lizards the goliathbeetles the largest and handsomest of the cetoniidæ and some of the achatinæ which are the largest of all known landshells  definition and characteristic groups of the oriental regionthe oriental region comprises all asia south of the palæarctic limits and along with this the malay islands as far as the philippines borneo and java it was called the indian region by mr sclater but this term has been objected to because the indochinese and malayan districts are the richest and most characteristic while the peninsula of india is the poorest portion of it the name oriental has therefore been adopted in my work on the geographical distribution of animals as preferable to either malayan or indoaustralian both of which have been proposed but are objectionable as being already in use in a different sense  the great features of the mammals of the oriental region are the longarmed apes the orangutans the tiger the sunbears and honeybears the tapir the chevrotains or mousedeer and the indian elephant its most conspicuous birds are the immense number and variety of babblingthrushes timaliidæ its beautiful little hilltits liotrichidæ its green bulbuls phyllornithidæ its many varieties 45 of the crowfamily its beautiful gapers and pittas adorned with the most delicate colours its great variety of hornbills and its magnificent phasianidæ comprising the peacocks arguspheasants firebacked pheasants and junglefowl many of these are it is true absent from the peninsula of hindostan but sufficient remain there to ally it with the other parts of the region  among the remarkable but less conspicuous forms of mammalia which are peculiar to this region are monkeys of the genus presbyter extending to every part of it lemurs of three peculiar generanycticebus and loris slow lemurs and tarsius spectre lemurs the flying lemur galeopithecus now classed as a peculiar family of insectivora and found only in the malay islands the family of the tupaias or squirrelshrews curious little arboreal insectivora somewhat resembling squirrels no less than twelve peculiar genera of the civet family three peculiar antelopes five species of rhinoceros and the roundtailed flying squirrels forming the genus pteromys  of the peculiar groups of birds we can only mention a few the curious little tailorbirds of the genus orthotomus are found over the whole region and almost alone serve to characterise it as do the fine laughingthrushes forming the genus garrulax while the beautiful grassgreen fruitthrushes phyllornis and the brilliant little minivets pericrocotus are almost equally universal woodpeckers are abundant belonging to a dozen peculiar genera while gaudy barbets and strange forms of cuckoos and hornbills are also to be met with everywhere among game birds the only genus that is universally distributed and which may be said to characterise the region is gallus comprising the true junglefowl one of which gallus bankiva is found from the himalayas and central india to malacca java and even eastward to timor and is the undoubted origin of almost all our domestic poultry southern india and ceylon each possesses distinct species of junglefowl and a third very handsome green bird gallus æneus inhabits java  reptiles are as abundant as in africa but they present no wellknown groups which can be considered as specially characteristic among insects we may notice the 46 magnificent golden and green papilionidæ of various genera as being unequalled in the world while the great atlas moth is probably the most gigantic of lepidoptera being sometimes ten inches across the wings which are also very broad among the beetles the strange flatbodied malayan mormolyce is the largest of all the carabidæ while the catoxantha is equally a giant among the buprestidæ on the whole the insects of this region probably surpass those of any other part of the world except south america in size variety and beauty  definition and characteristic groups of the australian regionthe australian region is so well marked off from the oriental as well as from all other parts of the world by zoological peculiarities that we need not take up much time in describing it especially as some of its component islands will come under review at a subsequent stage of our work its most important portions are australia and new guinea but it also includes all the malayan and pacific islands to the east of borneo java and bali the oriental region terminating with the submarine bank on which those islands are situated the island of celebes is included in this region from a balance of considerations but it almost equally well belongs to the oriental and must be left out of the account in our general sketch of the zoological features of the australian region  the great feature of the australian region is the almost total absence of all the forms of terrestrial mammalia which abound in the rest of the world their place being supplied by a great variety of marsupials in australia and new guinea there are no insectivora carnivora nor ungulata while even the rodents are only represented by a few small rats and mice in the remoter pacific islands mammals are altogether absent except perhaps in new zealand but in the moluccas and other islands bordering on the oriental region the higher mammals are represented by a few deer civets and pigs though it is doubtful whether the two former may not have been introduced by man as was almost certainly the case with the semidomesticated dingo of australia8 these peculiarities in the mammalia 47 are so great that every naturalist agrees that australia must be made a separate region the only difference of opinion being as to its extent some thinking that new zealand should form another separate region but this question need not now delay us  in birds australia is by no means so isolated from the rest of the world as it contains great numbers of warblers thrushes flycatchers shrikes crows and other familiar types of the eastern hemisphere yet a considerable number of the most characteristic oriental families are absent thus there are no vultures woodpeckers pheasants bulbuls or barbets in the australian region and the absence of these is almost as marked a feature as that of cats deer or monkeys among mammalia the most conspicuous and characteristic birds of the australian region are the piping crows the honeysuckers meliphagidæ a family quite peculiar to the region the lyrebirds the great terrestrial kingfishers dacelo the great goatsuckers called moreporks in australia and forming the genus podargus the wonderful abundance of parrots including such remarkable forms as the white and black cockatoos and the gorgeously coloured brushtongued lories the almost equal abundance of fine pigeons more gaily coloured than any others on the globe the strange brushturkeys and moundbuilders the only birds that 48 never sit upon their eggs but allow them to be hatched reptilelike by the heat of the sand or of fermenting vegetable matter and lastly the emus and cassowaries in which the wings are far more rudimentary than in the ostriches of africa and south america new guinea and the surrounding islands are remarkable for their treekangaroos their birdsofparadise their raquettailed kingfishers their great crownpigeons their crimson lories and many other remarkable birds this brief outline being sufficient to show the distinctness and isolation of the australian region we will now pass to the consideration of the western hemisphere  definition and characteristic groups of the nearctic regionthe nearctic region comprises all temperate and arctic north america including greenland the only doubt being as to its southern boundary many northern types penetrating into the tropical zone by means of the highlands and volcanic peaks of mexico and guatemala while a few which are characteristic of the tropics extend northward into texas and california there is however considerable evidence showing that on the east coast the rio grande del norte and on the west a point nearly opposite cape st lucas form the most natural boundary but instead of being drawn straight across the line bends to the southeast as soon as it rises on the flanks of the tableland forming a deep loop which extends some distance beyond the city of mexico and perhaps ought to be continued along the higher ridges of guatemala  the nearctic region is so similar to the palæarctic in position and climate and the two so closely approach each other at behring straits that we cannot wonder at there being a certain amount of similarity between thema similarity which some naturalists have so far overestimated as to think that the two regions ought to be united let us therefore carefully examine the special zoological features of this region and see how far it resembles and how far differs from the palæarctic  at first sight the mammalia of north america do not seem to differ much from those of europe or northern asia there are cats lynxes wolves and foxes weasels bears elk and deer voles beavers squirrels marmots and 49 hares all very similar to those of the eastern hemisphere and several hardly distinguishable even the bison or buffalo of the prairies once so abundant and characteristic is a close ally of the now almost extinct aurochs of lithuania here then we undoubtedly find a very close resemblance between the two regions and if this were all we should have great difficulty in separating them but along with these we find another set of mammals not quite so conspicuous but nevertheless very important we have first three peculiar genera of moles one of which the starnosed mole is a most extraordinary creature quite unlike anything else then there are three genera of the weasel family including the wellknown skunk mephitis all quite different from eastern forms then we come to a peculiar family of carnivora the racoons very distinct from anything in europe or asia and in the rocky mountains we find the pronghorn antelope antilocapra and the mountain goat of the trappers aplocerus both peculiar genera coming to the rodents we find that the mice of america differ in some dental peculiarities from those of the rest of the world and thus form several distinct genera the jumping mouse xapus is a peculiar form of the jerboa family and then we come to the pouched rats geomyidæ a very curious family consisting of four genera and nineteen species peculiar to north america though not confined to the nearctic region the prairie dogs cynomys the tree porcupine erethizon the curious sewellel haploodon and the opossum didelphys complete the list of peculiar mammalia which distinguish the northern region of the new world from that of the old we must add to these peculiarities some remarkable deficiencies the nearctic region has no hedgehogs nor wild pigs nor dormice and only one wild sheep in the rocky mountains as against twenty species of sheep and goats in the palæarctic region  in birds also the similarities to our own familiar songsters first strike us though the differences are perhaps really greater than in the quadrupeds we see thrushes and wrens tits and finches and what seem to be warblers and flycatchers and starlings in abundance but a closer examination shows the ornithologist that what he took for the 50 latter are really quite distinct and that there is not a single true flycatcher of the family muscicapidæ or a single starling of the family sturnidæ in the whole continent while there are very few true warblers sylviidæ their place being taken by the quite distinct families mniotiltidæ or woodwarblers and vireonidæ or greenlets in like manner the flycatchers of america belong to the totally distinct family of tyrantbirds tyrannidæ and those that look like starlings to the hangnests icteridæ and these four peculiar families comprise about a hundred and twenty species and give a special character to the ornithology of the country add to these such peculiar birds as the mocking thrushes mimus the blue jays cyanocitta the tanagers the peculiar genera of cuckoos coccygus and crotophaga the hummingbirds the wild turkeys meleagris and the turkeybuzzards cathartes and we see that if there is any doubt as to the mammals of north america being sufficiently distinct to justify the creation of a separate region the evidence of the birds would alone settle the question  the reptiles and some others of the lower animals add still more to this weight of evidence the true rattlesnakes are highly characteristic and among the lizards are several genera of the peculiar american family the iguanidæ nowhere in the world are the tailed batrachians so largely developed as in this region the sirens and the amphiumidæ forming two peculiar families while there are nine peculiar genera of salamanders and two others allied respectively to the proteus of europe and the sieboldia or giant salamander of japan there are seven peculiar families and about thirty peculiar genera of freshwater fishes while the freshwater molluscs are more numerous than in any other region more than thirteen hundred species and varieties having been described  combining the evidence derived from all these classes of animals we find the nearctic region to be exceedingly well characterised and to be amply distinct from the palæarctic the few species that are common to the two are almost all arctic or at least northern types and may be compared with those desert forms which occupy the debatable ground between the palæarctic ethiopian and oriental regions 51 if however we compare the number of species which are common to the nearctic and palæarctic regions with the number common to the western and eastern extremities of the latter region we shall find a wonderful difference between the two cases and if we further call to mind the number of important groups characteristic of the one region but absent from the other we shall be obliged to admit that the relation that undoubtedly exists between the faunas of north america and europe is of a very distinct nature from that which connects together western europe and northeastern asia in the bonds of zoological unity  definition and characteristic groups of the neotropical regionthe neotropical region requires very little definition since it comprises the whole of america south of the nearctic region with the addition of the antilles or west indian islands its zoological peculiarities are almost as marked as those of australia which however it far exceeds in the extreme richness and variety of all its forms of life to show how distinct it is from all the other regions of the globe we need only enumerate some of the best known and more conspicuous of the animal forms which are peculiar to it such are among mammaliathe prehensiletailed monkeys and the marmosets the bloodsucking bats the coatimundis the peccaries the llamas and alpacas the chinchillas the agoutis the sloths the armadillos and the anteaters a series of types more varied and more distinct from those of the rest of the world than any other continent can boast of among birds we have the charming sugarbirds forming the family coerebidæ the immense and wonderfully varied group of tanagers the exquisite little manakins and the gorgeouslycoloured chatterers the host of treecreepers of the family dendrocolaptidæ the wonderful toucans the puffbirds jacamars todies and motmots the marvellous assemblage of four hundred distinct kinds of hummingbirds the gorgeous macaws the curassows the trumpeters and the sunbitterns here again there is no other continent or region that can produce such an assemblage of remarkable and perfectly distinct groups of birds and no less wonderful is its richness in species since these fully equal if they do not surpass those of the 52 two great tropical regions of the eastern hemisphere the ethiopian and the oriental combined  as an additional indication of the distinctness and isolation of the neotropical region from all others and especially from the whole eastern hemisphere we must say something of the otherwise widely distributed groups which are absent among mammalia we have first the order insectivora entirely absent from south america though a few species are found in central america and the west indies the viverridæ or civet family is wholly wanting as are every form of sheep oxen or antelopes while the swine the elephants and the rhinoceroses of the old world are represented by the diminutive peccaries and tapirs  among birds we have to notice the absence of tits true flycatchers shrikes sunbirds starlings larks except a solitary species in the andes rollers beeeaters and pheasants while warblers are very scarce and the almost cosmopolitan wagtails are represented by a single species of pipit  we must also notice the preponderance of low or archaic types among the animals of south america edentates marsupials and rodents form the majority of the terrestrial mammalia while such higher groups as the carnivora and hoofed animals are exceedingly deficient among birds a low type of passeres characterised by the absence of the singing muscles is excessively prevalent the enormous groups of the antthrushes tyrants treecreepers manakins and chatterers belonging to it the picariæ a lower group also prevail to a far greater extent than in any other regions both in variety of forms and number of species and the chief representatives of the gallinaceous birdsthe curassows and tinamous are believed to be allied the former to the brushturkeys of australia the latter very remotely to the ostriches two of the least developed types of birds  whether therefore we consider its richness in peculiar forms of animal life its enormous variety of species its numerous deficiencies as compared with other parts of the world or the prevalence of a low type of organisation among its higher animals the neotropical region stands out as undoubtedly the most remarkable of the great zoological divisions of the earth  in reptiles amphibia freshwater fishes and insects 53 this region is equally peculiar but we need not refer to these here our only object now being to establish by a sufficient number of wellknown and easily remembered examples the distinctness of each region from all others and its unity as a whole the former has now been sufficiently demonstrated but it may be well to say a few words as to the latter point  the only outlying portions of the region about which there can be any doubt arecentral america or that part of the region north of the isthmus of panama the antilles or west indian islands and the temperate portion of south america including chili and patagonia  in central america and especially in mexico we have an intermixture of south american and north american animals but the former undoubtedly predominate and a large proportion of the peculiar neotropical groups extend as far as costa rica even in guatemala and mexico we have howling and spidermonkeys coatimundis tapirs and armadillos while chatterers manakins antthrushes and other peculiarly neotropical groups of birds are abundant there is therefore no doubt as to mexico forming part of this region although it is comparatively poor and exhibits the intermingling of temperate and tropical forms  the west indies are less clearly neotropical their poverty in mammals as well as in most other groups being extreme while great numbers of north american birds migrate there in winter the resident birds however comprise trogons sugarbirds chatterers with many hummingbirds and parrots representing eighteen peculiar neotropical genera a fact which decides the region to which the islands belong  south temperate america is also very poor as compared with the tropical parts of the region and its insects contain a considerable proportion of north temperate forms but it contains armadillos cavies and opossums and its birds all belong to american groups though owing to the inferior climate and deficiency of forests a number of the families of birds peculiar to tropical america are wanting thus there are no manakins chatterers toucans trogons or motmots but there are abundance of hangnests tyrantbirds antthrushes treecreepers and a fair 54 proportion of hummingbirds tanagers and parrots the zoology is therefore thoroughly neotropical although somewhat poor and it has a number of peculiar forms of strictly neotropical typesas the chinchillas alpacas c which are not found in the tropical regions except in the high andes  comparison of zoological regions with the geographical divisions of the globehaving now completed our survey of the great zoological regions of the globe we find that they do not differ so much from the old geographical divisions as our first example might have led us to suppose europe asia africa australia north america and south america really correspond each to a zoological region but their boundaries require to be modified more or less considerably and if we remember this and keep their extensions or limitations always in our mind we may use the terms south american or north american as being equivalent to neotropical and nearctic without much inconvenience while african and australian equally well serve to express the zoological type of the ethiopian and australian regions europe and asia require more important modifications the european fauna does indeed well represent the palæarctic in all its main features and if instead of asia we say tropical asia we have the oriental region very fairly defined so that the relation of the geographical with the zoological primary divisions of the earth is sufficiently clear in order to make these relations visible to the eye and more easily remembered we will put them into a tabular form      regions                   geographical equivalent

of nearly equal size in winter but diminishing very unequally 55 in summer when the southern cap is reduced to nearly one third the size of the northern and this fact is held by mr carpenter as it was by the late mr belt to be opposed to the view of the hemisphere which has winter in aphelion as the southern now has both in the earth and mars having been alone glaciated during periods of high excentricity9  before however we can draw any conclusion from the case of mars we must carefully scrutinise the facts and the conditions they imply in the first place there is evidently this radical difference between the state of mars now and of the earth during a glacial periodthat mars has no great icesheets spreading over its temperate zone as the earth undoubtedly had this we know from the fact of the rapid disappearance of the white patches over a belt three degrees wide in a fortnight equal to a width of about 100 miles of our measure and in the northern hemisphere of eight degrees wide about 280 miles between may 4th and july 12th even with our much more powerful sun which gives us more than twice as much heat as mars receives no such diminution of an icesheet or of glaciers of even moderate thickness could possibly occur but the phenomenon is on the contrary exactly analogous to what actually takes place on the plains of siberia in summer these as i am informed by mr seebohm are covered with snow during winter and spring to a depth of six or eight feet which diminishes very little even under the hot suns of may till warm winds combine with the sun in june when in about a fortnight the whole of it disappears and a little later the whole of northern asia is free from its winter covering as however the sun of mars is so much less powerful than ours we may be 56 sure that the snow if it is real snow is much less thicka mere surfacecoating in fact such as occurs in parts of russia where the precipitation is less and the snow accordingly does not exceed two or three feet in thickness  we now see the reason why the southern pole of mars parts with its white covering so much more quickly and to so much greater an extent than the northern for the south pole during summer is nearest the sun and owing to the great excentricity of mars would have about onethird more heat than during the summer of the northern hemisphere and this greater heat would cause the winds from the equator to be both warmer and more powerful and able to produce the same effects on the scanty martian snows as they produce on our northern snowplains the reason why both poles of mars are almost equally snowcovered in winter is not difficult to understand owing to the greater obliquity of the ecliptic and the much greater length of the year the polar regions will be subject to winter darkness fully twice as long as with us and the fact that one pole is nearer the sun during this period than the other at a corresponding period will therefore make no perceptible difference it is also probable that the two poles of mars are approximately alike as regards their geographical features and that neither of them is surrounded by very high land on which ice may accumulate with us at the present time on the other hand geographical conditions completely mask and even reverse the influence of excentricity and that of winter in perihelion in the northern and summer in perihelion in the southern hemisphere in the north we have a preponderance of sea within the arctic circle and of lowlands in the temperate zone in the south exactly opposite conditions prevail for there we have a preponderance of land and much of it high land within the antarctic circle and of sea in the temperate zone ice therefore accumulates in the south while a thin coating of snow easily melted in summer is the prevalent feature in the north and these contrasts react upon climate to such an extent that in the southern ocean islands in the latitude of ireland have glaciers descending to the level of the sea and constant snowstorms 57 in the height of summer although the sun is then actually nearer the earth than it is during our northern summer  it is evident therefore that the phenomena presented by the varying polar snows of mars are in no way opposed to that modification of dr crolls theory of the conditions which brought about the glacial epochs of our northern hemisphere which is here advocated but are perfectly explicable on the same general principles if we keep in mind the distinction between an icesheetwhich a summers sun cannot materially diminish but may even increase by bringing vapour to be condensed into snowand a thin snowy covering which may be annually melted and annually renewed with great rapidity and over large areas except within the small circles of perpetual polar snow there can at the present time be no icesheets in mars and the reason why this permanent snowy area is more extensive around the northern than around the southern pole may be partly due to higher land at the north but is perhaps sufficiently explained by the diminished power of the summer sun owing to its greatly increased distance at that season in the northern hemisphere so that it is not able to melt so much of the snow which has accumulated during the long night of winter                                        58  chapter ix  ancient glacial epochs and mild climates

to the     climates of secondary and tertiary periodsgeneral view of geological     climates as dependent on the physical features of the earths     surfaceestimate of the comparative effects of geographical and     physical causes in producing changes of climate  if we adopt the view set forth in the preceding chapter as to the character of the glacial epoch and of the accompanying alternations of climate it must have been a very important agent in producing changes in the distribution of animal and vegetable life the intervening mild periods which almost certainly occurred during its earlier and later phases may have been sometimes more equable than even our present insular climate and severe frosts were probably then unknown during the four or five 59 thousand years that each specially mild period may have lasted some portions of the north temperate zone which had been buried in snow or ice would become again clothed with vegetation and stocked with animal life both of which as the cold again came on would be driven southward or perhaps partially exterminated forms usually separated would thus be crowded together and a struggle for existence would follow which must have led to the modification or the extinction of many species when the survivors in the struggle had reached a state of equilibrium a fresh field would be opened to them by the later ameliorations of climate the more successful of the survivors would spread and multiply and after this had gone on for thousands of generations another change of climate another southward migration another struggle of northern and southern forms would take place  but if the last glacial epoch has coincided with and has been to a considerable extent caused by a high excentricity of the earths orbit we are naturally led to expect that earlier glacial epochs would have occurred whenever the excentricity was unusually large dr croll has published tables showing the varying amounts of excentricity for three million years back and from these it appears that there have been many periods of high excentricity which has often been far greater than at the time of the last glacial epoch10 the accompanying diagram has been drawn from these tables and it will be seen that the highest excentricity occurred 850000 years ago at which time the difference between the suns distance at aphelion and perihelion was thirteen and a half millions of miles whereas during the last glacial period the maximum difference was ten and a half million miles  illustration diagram showing the changes of excentricity during the last three million years  now judging by the amount of organic and physical change that occurred during and since the glacial epoch and that which has occurred since the miocene period it is considered probable that this maximum of excentricity coincided with some part of the latter period and dr croll maintains that a glacial epoch must then have 60 occurred surpassing in severity that of which we have such convincing proofs and consisting like it of alternations of cold and warm phases every 10500 years the diagram also shows us another longcontinued period of high excentricity from 1750000 to 1950000 years ago and yet another almost equal to the maximum 2500000 years back these may perhaps have occurred during the eocene and cretaceous epochs respectively or all may have been included within the limits of the tertiary period as two of these high excentricities greatly exceed that which caused our glacial epoch while the third is almost equal to it and of longer duration they seem to afford us the means of testing rival theories of the causes of glaciation if as dr croll argues high excentricity is the great and dominating agency in bringing on glacial epochs geographical changes being subordinate then there must have been glacial epochs of great severity at all these three periods while if he is also correct in supposing that the alternate phases of precession would inevitably produce glaciation in one hemisphere and a proportionately mild and equable climate in the opposite hemisphere then we should have to look for evidence of exceptionally warm and exceptionally cold periods occurring 61 alternately and with several repetitions within a space of time which geologically speaking is very short indeed  let us then inquire first into the character of the evidence we should expect to find of such changes of climate if they have occurred we shall then be in a better position to estimate at its proper value the evidence that actually exists and after giving it due weight to arrive at some conclusion as to the theory that best explains and harmonises it    effects of denudation in destroying the evidence of remote glacial epochsit may be supposed that if earlier glacial epochs than the last did really occur we ought to meet with some evidence of the fact corresponding to that which has satisfied us of the extensive recent glaciation of the northern hemisphere but dr croll and other writers have ably argued that no such evidence is likely to be found it is now generally admitted that subaërial denudation is a much more powerful agent in lowering and modifying the surface of a country than was formerly supposed it has in fact been proved to be so powerful that the difficulty now felt is not to account for the denudation which can be proved to have occurred but to explain the apparent persistence of superficial features which ought long ago to have been destroyed  a proof of the lowering and eating away of the landsurface which every one can understand is to be found in the quantity of solid matter carried down to the sea and to low grounds by rivers this is capable of pretty accurate measurement and it has been carefully measured for several rivers large and small in different parts of the world the details of these measurements will be given in a future chapter and it is only necessary here to state that the average of them all gives us this resultthat one foot must on an average be taken off the entire surface of the land each 3000 years in order to produce the amount of sediment and matter in solution which is actually carried into the sea to give an idea of the limits of variation in different rivers it may be mentioned that the mississippi is one which denudes its valley at a slow rate taking 6000 62 years to remove one foot while the po is the most rapid taking only 729 years to do the same work in its valley the cause of this difference is very easy to understand a large part of the area of the mississippi basin consists of the almost rainless prairie and desert regions of the west while its sources are in comparatively arid mountains with scanty snowfields or in a low forestclad plateau the po on the other hand is wholly in a district of abundant rainfall while its sources are spread over a great amphitheatre of snowy alps nearly 400 miles in extent where the denuding forces are at a maximum as scotland is a mountain region of rather abundant rainfall the denuding power of its rains and rivers is probably rather above than under the average but to avoid any possible exaggeration we will take it at a foot in 4000 years  now if the end of the glacial epoch be taken to coincide with the termination of the last period of high excentricity which occurred about 80000 years ago and no geologist will consider this too long for the changes which have since taken place it follows that the entire surface of scotland must have been since lowered an average amount of twenty feet but over large areas of alluvial plains and wherever the rivers have spread during floods the ground will have been raised instead of lowered and on all nearly level ground and gentle slopes there will have been comparatively little denudation so that proportionally much more must have been taken away from mountain sides and from the bottoms of valleys having a considerable downward slope one of the very highest authorities on the subject of denudation mr archibald geikie estimates the area of these more rapidly denuded portions as only onetenth of the comparatively level grounds and he further estimates that the former will be denuded about ten times as fast as the latter it follows that the valleys will be deepened and widened on the average about five feet in the 4000 years instead of one foot and thus many valleys must have been deepened and widened 100 feet and some even more since the glacial epoch while the more level portions of the country will have been lowered on the average only about two feet 63  now dr croll gives us the following account of the present aspect of the surface of a large part of the country  go where one will in the lowlands of scotland and he shall hardly find a single acre whose upper surface bears the marks of being formed by the denuding agents now in operation he will observe everywhere mounds and hollows which cannot be accounted for by the present agencies at work in regard to the general surface of the country the present agencies may be said to be just beginning to carve a new line of features out of the old glaciallyformed surface but so little progress has yet been made that the kames gravelmounds knolls of boulder clay c still retain in most cases their original form11  the facts here seem a little inconsistent and we must suppose that dr croll has somewhat exaggerated the universality and complete preservation of the glaciated surface the amount of average denudation however is not a matter of opinion but of measurement and its consequences can in no way be evaded they are moreover strictly proportionate to the time elapsed and if so much of the old surface of the country has certainly been remodelled or carried into the sea since the last glacial epoch it becomes evident that any surfacephenomena produced by still earlier glacial epochs must have long since entirely disappeared  rise of the sealevel connected with glacial epochs a cause of further denudationthere is also another powerful agent that must have assisted in the destruction of any such surface deposits or markings during the last glacial epoch itself there were several minor oscillations of the land without counting the great submergence of over 1300 feet supposed to be indicated by patches of shelly clays and gravels in wales and ireland and also in a few localities in england and scotland since these are otherwise explained by many geologists other subsidences have no doubt occurred in the same areas during the tertiary epoch and some writers connect these subsidences with the glacial 64 period itself the unequal amount of ice at the two poles causing the centre of gravity of the earth to be displaced when of course the surface of the ocean will conform to it and appear to rise in the one hemisphere and sink in the other if this is the case subsidences of the land are natural concomitants of a glacial period and will powerfully aid in removing all evidence of its occurrence we have seen reason to believe however that during the height of the glacial epoch the extreme cold persisted through the successive phases of precession and if so both polar areas would probably be glaciated at once this would cause the abstraction of a large quantity of water from the ocean and a proportionate elevation of the land which would react on the accumulation of snow and ice and thus add another to that wonderful series of physical agents which act and react on each other so as to intensify glacial epochs  but whether or not these causes would produce any important fluctuations of the sealevel is of comparatively little importance to our present inquiry because the wide extent of marine tertiary deposits in the northern hemisphere and their occurrence at considerable elevations above the present sealevel afford the most conclusive proofs that great changes of sea and land have occurred throughout the entire tertiary period and these repeated submergences and emergences of the land combined with subaërial and marine denudation would undoubtedly destroy all those superficial evidences of iceaction on which we mainly depend for proofs of the occurrence of the last glacial epoch  what evidence of early glacial epochs may be expectedalthough we may admit the force of the preceding argument as to the extreme improbability of our finding any clear evidence of the superficial action of ice during remote glacial epochs there is nevertheless one kind of evidence that we ought to find because it is both widespread and practically indestructible  one of the most constant of all the phenomena of a glaciated country is the abundance of icebergs produced by the breaking off of the ends of glaciers which terminate 65 in arms of the sea or of the terminal face of the icesheet which passes beyond the land into the ocean in both these cases abundance of rocks and débris such as form the terminal moraines of glaciers on land are carried out to sea and deposited over the seabottom of the area occupied by icebergs in the case of an icesheet it is almost certain that much of the groundmoraine consisting of mud and imbedded stones similar to that which forms the till when deposited on land will be carried out to sea with the ice and form a deposit of marine till near the shore  it has indeed been objected that when an icesheet covered an entire country there would be no moraines and that rocks or débris are very rarely seen on icebergs but during every glacial epoch there will be a southern limit to the glaciated area and everywhere near this limit the mountaintops will rise far above the ice and deposit on it great masses of débris and as the icesheet spreads and again as it passes away this moraineforming area will successively occupy the whole country but even such an iceclad country as greenland is now known to have protruding peaks and rocky masses which give rise to moraines on its surface12 and as rocks from cumberland and ireland were carried by the icesheet to the isle of man there must have been a very long period during which the icesheets of britain and ireland terminated in the ocean and sent off abundance of rockladen bergs into the surrounding seas and the same thing must have occurred along all the coasts of northern europe and eastern america  we cannot therefore doubt that throughout the greater part of the duration of a glacial epoch the seas adjacent to the glaciated countries would receive continual deposits of large rocks rockfragments and gravel similar to the material of modern and ancient moraines and analogous to the drift and the numerous travelled blocks which the ice has undoubtedly scattered broadcast over every glaciated country and these rocks and boulders would be imbedded in whatever deposits were then forming either from the matter carried down by rivers or from the mud ground off 66 the rocks and carried out to sea by the glaciers themselves moreover as icebergs float far beyond the limits of the countries which gave them birth these iceborne materials would be largely imbedded in deposits forming from the denudation of countries which had never been glaciated or from which the ice had already disappeared  but if every period of high excentricity produced a glacial epoch of greater or less extent and severity then on account of the frequent occurrence of a high phase of excentricity during the three million years for which we have the tables these boulder and rockstrewn deposits would be both numerous and extensive four hundred thousand years ago the excentricity was almost exactly the same as it is now and it continually increased from that time up to the glacial epoch now if we take double the present excentricity as being sufficient to produce some glaciation in the temperate zone we find by drawing out the diagram at p 171 on a larger scale that during 1150000 years out of the 2400000 years immediately preceding the last glacial epoch the excentricity reached or exceeded this amount consisting of sixteen separate epochs divided from each other by periods varying from 30000 to 200000 years but if the last glacial epoch was at its maximum 200000 years ago a space of three million years will certainly include much if not all of the tertiary period and even if it does not we have no reason to suppose that the character of the excentricity would suddenly change beyond the three million years  it follows therefore that if periods of high excentricity like that which appears to have been synchronous with our last glacial epoch and is generally admitted to have been one of its efficient causes always produced glacial epochs with or without alternating warm periods then the whole of the tertiary deposits in the north temperate and arctic zones should exhibit frequent alternations of boulder and rockbearing beds or coarse rockstrewn gravels analogous to our existing glacial drift and with some corresponding change of organic remains let us then see what evidence can be adduced of the existence of such deposits and whether it is adequate to support the 67 theory of repeated glacial epochs during the tertiary period  evidences of iceaction during the tertiary periodthe tertiary fossils both of europe and north america indicate throughout warm or temperate climates except those of the more recent pliocene deposits which merge into the earlier glacial beds the miocene deposits of central and southern europe for example contain marine shells of some genera now only found farther south while the fossil plants often resemble those of madeira and the southern states of north america large reptiles too abounded and manlike apes lived in the south of france and in germany yet in northern italy near turin there are beds of sandstone and conglomerate full of characteristic miocene shells but containing in an intercalated deposit angular blocks of serpentine and greenstone often of enormous size one being fourteen feet long and another twentysix feet some of the blocks were observed by sir charles lyell to be faintly striated and partly polished on one side and they are scattered through the beds for a thickness of nearly 150 feet it is interesting that the particular bed in which the blocks occur yields no organic remains though these are plentiful both in the underlying and overlying beds as if the cold of the icebergs combined with the turbidity produced by the glacial mud had driven away the organisms adapted to live only in a comparatively warm sea rock similar in kind to these erratics occurs about twenty miles distant in the alps  the eocene period is even more characteristically tropical in its flora and fauna since palms and cycadaceæ turtles snakes and crocodiles then inhabited england yet on the north side of the alps extending from switzerland to vienna and also south of the alps near genoa there is a deposit of finelystratified sandstone several thousand feet in thickness quite destitute of organic remains but containing in several places in switzerland enormous blocks either angular or partly rounded and composed of oolitic limestone or of granite near the lake of thun some of the granite blocks found in this deposit are of enormous size one of them being 105 feet long ninety feet wide 68 and fortyfive feet thick the granite is red and of a peculiar kind which cannot be matched anywhere in the alps or indeed elsewhere similar erratics have also been found in beds of the same age in the carpathians and in the apennines indicating probably an extensive inland european sea into which glaciers descended from the surrounding mountains depositing these erratics and cooling the water so as to destroy the mollusca and other organisms which had previously inhabited it it is to be observed that wherever these erratics occur they are always in the vicinity of great mountain ranges and although these can be proved to have been in great part elevated during the tertiary period we must also remember that they must have been since very much lowered by denudation of the amount of which the enormously thick eocene and miocene beds now forming portions of them is in some degree a measure as well as a proof it is not therefore at all improbable that during some part of the tertiary period these mountains may have been far higher than they are now and this we know might be sufficient for the production of glaciers descending to the sealevel even were the climate of the lowlands somewhat warmer than at present13  the weight of the negative evidencebut when we proceed to examine the tertiary deposits of other parts of 69 europe and especially of our own country for evidence of this kind not only is such evidence completely wanting but the facts are of so definite a character as to satisfy most geologists that it can never have existed and the same maybe said of temperate north america and of the arctic regions generally  in his carefully written paper on the climate controversy the late mr searles v wood jun remarks on this point as follows now the eocene formation is complete in england and is exposed in continuous section along the north coast of the isle of wight from its base to its junction with the oligocene or lower miocene according to some and along the northern coast of kent from its base to the lower bagshot sand it has been intersected by railway and other cuttings in all directions and at all horizons and pierced by wells innumerable while from its strata in england france and belgium the most extensive collections of organic remains have been made of any formation yet explored and from nearly all its horizons for at one place or another in these three countries nearly every horizon may be said to have yielded fossils of some kind these fossils however whether they be the remains of a flora such as that of sheppey or of a vertebrate fauna containing the crocodile and alligator such as is yielded by beds indicative of terrestrial conditions or of a molluscan assemblage such as is present in marine or fluviomarine beds of the formation are of unmistakably tropical or subtropical character throughout and no trace whatever has appeared of the intercalation of a glacial period much less of successive intercalations indicative of more than one period of 10500 years glaciation nor can it be urged that the glacial epochs of the eocene in england were intervals of dry land and so have left no evidence of their existence behind them because a large part of the continuous sequence of eocene deposits in this country consists of alternations of fluviatile fluviomarine and purely marine strata so that it seems impossible that during the accumulation of the eocene formation in england a glacial period could have occurred without its evidences being 70 abundantly apparent the oligocene of northern germany and belgium and the miocene of those countries and of france have also afforded a rich molluscan fauna which like that of the eocene has as yet presented no indication of the intrusion of anything to interfere with its uniformly subtropical character14  this is sufficiently striking but when we consider that this enormous series of deposits many thousand feet in thickness consists wholly of alternations of clays sands marls shales or limestones with a few beds of pebbles or conglomerate not one of the whole series containing irregular blocks of foreign material boulders or gravel such as we have seen to be the essential characteristic of a glacial epoch and when we find that this same general character pervades all the extensive tertiary deposits of temperate north america we shall i think be forced to the conclusion that no general glacial epochs could have occurred during their formation it must be remembered that the imperfection of the geological record will not help us here because the series of tertiary deposits is unusually complete and we must suppose some destructive agency to have selected all the intercalated glacial beds and to have so completely made away with them that not a fragment remains while preserving all or almost all the interglacial beds and to have acted thus capriciously not in one limited area only but over the whole northern hemisphere with the local exceptions on the flanks of great mountain ranges already referred to  temperate climates in the arctic regionsas we have just seen the geological evidence of the persistence of subtropical or warm climates in the north temperate zone during the greater part of the tertiary period is almost irresistible and we have now to consider the still more extraordinary series of observations which demonstrate that this amelioration of climate extended into the arctic zone and into countries now almost wholly buried in snow and ice these warm arctic climates have been explained by dr croll as due to periods of high excentricity with winter in perihelion a theory which implies alternating 71 epochs of glaciation far exceeding what now prevails and it is therefore necessary to examine the evidence pretty closely in order to see if this view is more tenable in the case of the north polar regions than we have found it to be in that of the north temperate zone  the most recent of these milder climates is perhaps indicated by the abundant remains of large mammaliasuch as the mammoth woolly rhinoceros bison and horse in the icy alluvial plains of northern siberia and especially in the liakhov islands in the same latitude as the north cape of asia these remains occur not in one or two spots only as if collected by eddies at the mouth of a river but along the whole borders of the arctic ocean and it is generally admitted that the animals must have lived upon the adjacent plains and that a considerably milder climate than now prevails could alone have enabled them to do so how long ago this occurred we do not know but one of the last intercalated mild periods of the glacial epoch itself seems to offer all the necessary conditions again sir edward belcher discovered on the dreary shores of wellington channel in 75½° n lat the trunk and root of a fir tree which had evidently grown where it was found it appeared to belong to the species abies alba or white fir which now reaches 68° n lat and is the most northerly conifer known similar trees one four feet in circumference and thirty feet long were found by lieut mecham in prince patricks island in lat 76° 12 n and other arctic explorers have found remains of trees in high latitudes15  similar indications of a recent milder climate are found in spitzbergen professor nordenskjöld says at various places on spitzbergen at the bottom of lomme bay at cape thordsen in blomstrands strata in advent bay there are found large and welldeveloped shells of a bivalve mytilus edulis which is not now found living on the coast of spitzbergen though on the west coast of scandinavia it everywhere covers the rocks near the seashore these shells occur most plentifully in the bed of a river which runs through reindeer valley at cape thordsen they 72 are probably washed out of a thin bed of sand at a height of about twenty or thirty feet above the present sealevel which is intersected by the river the geological age of this bed cannot be very great and it has clearly been formed since the present basin of the ice sound or at least the greater part of it has been hollowed out by glacial action16  the miocene arctic floraone of the most startling and important of the scientific discoveries of the last forty years has been that of the relics of a luxuriant miocene flora in various parts of the arctic regions it is a discovery that was totally unexpected and is even now considered by many men of science to be completely unintelligible but it is so thoroughly established and it has such a direct and important bearing on the subjects we are discussing in the present volume that it is necessary to lay a tolerably complete outline of the facts before our readers  the miocene flora of temperate europe was very like that of eastern asia japan and the warmer part of eastern north america of the present day it is very richly represented in switzerland by well preserved fossil remains and after a close comparison with the flora of other countries professor heer concludes that the swiss lower miocene flora indicates a climate corresponding to that of louisiana north africa and south china while the upper miocene climate of the same country would correspond to that of the south of spain southern japan and georgia us of america of this latter flora found chiefly at oeninghen in the northern extremity of switzerland 465 species are known of which 166 species are trees or shrubs half of them being evergreens they comprise sequoias like the californian giant trees camphortrees cinnamons sassafras bignonias cassias gleditschias tuliptrees and many other american genera together with maples ashes planes oaks poplars and other familiar european trees represented by a variety of extinct species if we now go to the west coast of greenland in 70° n lat we find abundant remains of a flora of the same general 73 type as that of oeninghen but of a more northern character we have a sequoia identical with one of the species found at oeninghen a chestnut salisburia liquidambar sassafras and even a magnolia we have also seven species of oaks two planes two vines three beeches four poplars two willows a walnut a plum and several shrubs supposed to be evergreens altogether 137 species mostly well and abundantly preserved  but even further north in spitzbergen in 78° and 79° n lat and one of the most barren and inhospitable regions on the globe an almost equally rich fossil flora has been discovered including several of the greenland species and others peculiar but mostly of the same genera there seem to be no evergreens here except coniferæ one of which is identical with the swampcypress taxodium distichum now found living in the southern united states there are also eleven pines two libocedrus two sequoias with oaks poplars birches planes limes a hazel an ash and a walnut also waterlilies pondweeds and an irisaltogether about a hundred species of flowering plants even in grinnell land within 8¼ degrees of the pole a similar flora existed twentyfive species of fossil plants having been collected by the last arctic expedition of which eighteen were identical with the species from other arctic localities this flora comprised poplars birches hazels elms viburnums and eight species of conifers including the swamp cypress and the norway spruce pinus abies which last does not now extend beyond 69½° n  fossil plants closely resembling those just mentioned have been found at many other arctic localities especially in iceland on the mackenzie river in 65° n lat and in alaska as an intermediate station we have in the neighbourhood of dantzic in lat 55° n a similar flora with the swampcypress sequoias oaks poplars and some cinnamons laurels and figs a little further south near breslau north of the carpathians a rich flora has been found allied to that of oeninghen but wanting in some of the more tropical forms again in the isle of mull in scotland in about 56½° n lat a plantbed has been discovered 74 containing a hazel a plane and a sequoia apparently identical with a swiss miocene species  we thus find one wellmarked type of vegetation spread from switzerland and vienna to north germany scotland iceland greenland alaska and spitzbergen some few of the species even ranging over the extremes of latitude between oeninghen and spitzbergen but the great majority being distinct and exhibiting decided indications of a decrease of temperature according to latitude though much less in amount than now exists some writers have thought that the great similarity of the floras of greenland and oeninghen is a proof that they were not contemporaneous but successive and that of greenland has been supposed to be as old as the eocene but the arguments yet adduced do not seem to prove such a difference of age because there is only that amount of specific and generic diversity between the two which might be produced by distance and difference of temperature under the exceptionally equable climate of the period we have even now examples of an equally wide range of wellmarked types as in temperate south america where many of the genera and some of the species range from the straits of magellan to valparaisoplaces differing as much in latitude as switzerland and west greenland and the same may be said of north australia and tasmania where at a greater latitudinal distance apart closely allied forms of eucalyptus acacia casuarina stylidium goodenia and many other genera would certainly form a prominent feature in any fossil flora now being preserved  mild arctic climates of the cretaceous periodin the upper cretaceous deposits of greenland in a locality not far from those of the miocene age last described another remarkable flora has been discovered agreeing generally with that of europe and north america of the same geological age sixtyfive species of plants have been identified of which there are fifteen ferns two cycads eleven coniferæ three monocotyledons and thirtyfour dicotyledons one of the ferns is a treefern with thick stems which has also been found in the upper greensand of england among the conifers the giant sequoias are found and among 75 the dicotyledons the genera populus myrica ficus sassafras andromeda diospyros myrsine panax as well as magnolias myrtles and leguminosæ several of these groups occur also in the much richer deposits of the same age in north america and central europe but all of them evidently afford such fragmentary records of the actual flora of the period that it is impossible to say that any genus found in one locality was absent from the other merely because it has not yet been found there on the whole there seems to be less difference between the floras of arctic and temperate latitudes in upper cretaceous than in miocene times  in the same locality in greenland 70° 33 n lat and 52° w long and also in spitzbergen a more ancient flora of lower cretaceous age has been found but it differs widely from the other in the great abundance of cycads and conifers and the scarcity of exogens which latter are represented by a single poplar of the thirtyeight ferns fifteen belong to the genus gleichenia now almost entirely tropical there are four genera of cycads and three extinct genera of conifers besides glyptostrobus and torreya now found only in china and california six species of true pines and five of the genus sequoia one of which occurs also in spitzbergen the european deposits of the same age closely agree with these in their general character conifers cycads and ferns forming the mass of the vegetation while exogens are entirely absent the abovenamed greenland poplar being the oldest known dicotyledonous plant17  if we take these facts as really representing the flora of the period we shall be forced to conclude that measured by the change effected in its plants the lapse of time between the lower and upper cretaceous deposits was far greater than between the upper cretaceous and the miocenea conclusion quite opposed to the indications afforded by the mollusca and the higher animals of the two periods it seems probable therefore that these lower cretaceous plants represent local peculiarities of 76 vegetation such as now sometimes occur in tropical countries on sandy or coralline islands in the malay archipelago there will often be found a vegetation consisting almost wholly of cycads pandani and palms while a few miles off on moderately elevated land not a single specimen of either of these families may be seen but a dense forest of dicotyledonous trees covering the whole country a lowland vegetation such as that above described might be destroyed and its remains preserved by a slight depression allowing it to be covered up by the detritus of some adjacent river while not only would the subsidence of high land be a less frequent occurrence but when it did occur the steep banks would be undermined by the waves and the trees falling down would be floated away and would either be cast on some distant shore or slowly decay on the surface or in the depths of the ocean  from the remarkable series of facts now briefly summarized we learn that whenever plantremains have been discovered within the arctic regions either in tertiary or cretaceous deposits they show that the climate was one capable of supporting a rich vegetation of trees shrubs and herbaceous plants similar in general character to that which prevailed in the temperate zone at the same periods but showing the influence of a less congenial climate these deposits belong to at least four distinct geological horizons and have been found widely scattered within the arctic circle yet nowhere has any proof been obtained of intercalated cold periods such as would be indicated by the remains of a stunted vegetation or a molluscan fauna similar to that which now prevails there  stratigraphical evidence of longcontinued mild arctic conditionslet us now turn to the stratigraphical evidence which as we have already shown offers a crucial test of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of glaciation during any extensive geological period and here we have the testimony of perhaps the greatest living authority on arctic geologyprofessor nordenskjöld in his lecture on the former climate of the polar regions he says the character of the coasts in the arctic regions is especially favourable to geological investigations while the valleys are for the 77 most part filled with ice the sides of the mountains in summer even in the 80th degree of latitude and to a height of 1000 or 1500 feet above the level of the sea are almost wholly free from snow nor are the rocks covered with any amount of vegetation worth mentioning and moreover the sides of the mountains on the shore itself frequently present perpendicular sections which everywhere expose their bare surfaces to the investigator the knowledge of a mountains geognostic character at which one in the more southerly countries can only arrive after long and laborious researches removal of soil and the like is here gained almost at the first glance and as we have never seen in spitzbergen nor in greenland in these sections often many miles in length and including one may say all formations from the silurian to the tertiary any boulders even as large as a childs head there is not the smallest probability that strata of any considerable extent containing boulders are to be found in the polar tracts previous to the middle of the tertiary period since then both an examination of the geognostic condition and an investigation of the fossil flora and fauna of the polar lands show no signs of a glacial era having existed in those parts before the termination of the miocene period we are fully justified in rejecting on the evidence of actual observation the hypotheses founded on purely theoretical speculations which assume the many times repeated alternation of warm and glacial climates between the present time and the earliest geological ages18 and again in his sketch of the geology of spitzbergen after describing the various formations down to the miocene he says all the fossils found in the foregoing strata show that spitzbergen during former geological ages enjoyed a magnificent climate which indeed was somewhat colder during the miocene period but was still favourable for an extraordinarily abundant vegetation much more luxuriant than that which now occurs even in the southern part of scandinavia and i have in those strata sought in vain for any sign that as some geologists have of late endeavoured to render probable these favourable climatic conditions have been broken off 78 by intervals of ancient glacial periods the profiles i have had the opportunity to examine during my various spitzbergen expeditions would certainly if laid down on a line occupy an extent of a thousand english miles and if any former glacial period had existed in this region there ought to have been some trace to be observed of erratic blocks or other formations which distinguish glacial action but this has not been the case in the strata whose length i have reckoned alone i have not found a single fragment of a foreign rock so large as a childs head19  now it is quite impossible to ignore or evade the force of this testimony as to the continuous warm climates of the north temperate and polar zones throughout tertiary times the evidence extends over a vast area both in space and time it is derived from the work of the most competent living geologists and it is absolutely consistent in its general tendency we have in the lower cretaceous period an almost tropical climate in france and england a somewhat lower temperature in the united states and a mild insular climate in the arctic regions in each successive period the climate becomes somewhat less tropical but down to the upper miocene it remains warm temperate in central europe and cold temperate within the polar area with not a trace of any intervening periods of arctic cold it then gradually cools down and merges through the pliocene into the glacial epoch in europe while in the arctic zone there is a break in the record between the miocene and the recent glacial deposits20  79  accepting this as a substantially correct account of the general climatic aspect of the tertiary period in the northern hemisphere let us see whether the principles we have already laid down will enable us to give a satisfactory explanation of its causes  the causes of mild arctic climatesin his remarkable series of papers on ocean currents the late dr james croll has proved with a wealth of argument and illustration whose cogency is irresistible that the very habitability of our globe is due to the equalizing climatic effects of the waters of the ocean and that it is to the same cause that we owe either directly or indirectly almost all the chief diversities of climate between places situated in the same latitude owing to the peculiar distribution of land and sea upon the globe more than its fair proportion of the warm equatorial waters is directed towards the western shores of europe the result being that the british isles norway and spitzbergen have all a milder climate than any other parts of the globe in corresponding latitudes a very small portion of the arctic regions however obtains this benefit and it thus remains generally speaking a land of snow and ice with too short a summer to nourish more than a very scanty and fugitive vegetation the only other opening than that between iceland and britain by which warm water penetrates within the arctic circle is through behrings straits but this is both shallow and limited in width and the consequence is that the larger part of the warm currents of the pacific turns back along the shores of the aleutian islands and northwest america while a very small quantity enters the icy ocean  but if there were other and wider openings into the arctic ocean a vast quantity of the heated water which is now turned backward would enter it and would produce an amelioration of the climate of which we can hardly form a conception a great amelioration of climate would also be caused by the breaking up or the lowering of such 80 arctic highlands as now favour the accumulation of ice while the interpenetration of the sea into any part of the great continents in the tropical or temperate zones would again tend to raise the winter temperature and render any long continuance of snow in their vicinity almost impossible  now geologists have proved quite independently of any such questions as we are here discussing that changes of the very kinds above referred to have occurred during the tertiary period and that there has been speaking broadly a steady change from a comparatively fragmentary and insular condition of the great north temperate lands in early tertiary times to that more compact and continental condition which now prevails it is no doubt difficult and often impossible to determine how long any particular geographical condition lasted or whether the changes in one country were exactly coincident with those in another but it will be sufficient for our purpose briefly to indicate those more important changes of land and sea during the tertiary period which must have produced a decided effect on the climate of the northern hemisphere  geographical changes favouring mild northern climates in tertiary timesthe distribution of the eocene and miocene formations shows that during a considerable portion of the tertiary period an inland sea more or less occupied by an archipelago of islands extended across central europe between the baltic and the black and caspian seas and thence by narrower channels southeastward to the valley of the euphrates and the persian gulf thus opening a communication between the north atlantic and the indian oceans from the caspian also a wide arm of the sea extended during some part of the tertiary epoch northwards to the arctic ocean and there is nothing to show that this sea may not have been in existence during the whole tertiary period another channel probably existed over egypt21 into the eastern 81 basin of the mediterranean and the black sea while it is probable that there was a communication between the baltic and the white sea leaving scandinavia as an extensive island turning to india we find that an arm of the sea of great width and depth extended from the bay of bengal to the mouths of the indus while the enormous depression indicated by the presence of marine fossils of eocene age at a height of 10500 feet in western tibet renders it not improbable that a more direct channel across afghanistan may have opened a communication between the west asiatic and polar seas  it may be said that the changes here indicated are not warranted by an actual knowledge of continuous tertiary deposits over the situations of the alleged marine channels but it is no less certain that the seas in which any particular strata were deposited were always more extensive than the fragments of those strata now existing and often immensely more extensive the eocene deposits of europe for example have certainly undergone enormous denudation both marine and subaërial and may have once covered areas where we now find older deposits as the chalk once covered the weald while a portion of them may lie concealed under miocene pliocene or recent beds we find them widely scattered over europe and asia and often elevated into lofty mountain ranges and we should certainly err far more seriously in confining the eocene seas to the exact areas where we now find eocene rocks than in liberally extending them so as to connect the several detached portions of the formation whenever there is no valid argument against our doing so considering then that some one or more of the seacommunications here indicated almost certainly existed during eocene and miocene times let us endeavour to estimate the probable effect such communications would have upon the climate of the northern hemisphere  the indian ocean as a source of heat in tertiary timesif we compare the indian ocean with the south atlantic we shall see that the position and outline of the former are very favourable for the accumulation of a large body of warm water moving northwards its southern 82 opening between south africa and australia is very wide and the tendency of the tradewinds would be to concentrate the currents towards its northwestern extremity just where the two great channels above described formed an outlet to the northern seas as will be shown in our nineteenth chapter there was probably during the earlier portion of the tertiary period at least several large islands in the space between madagascar and south india but these had wide and deep channels between them and their existence may have been favourable to the conveyance of heated water northward by concentrating the currents and thus producing massive bodies of moving water analogous to the gulf stream of the atlantic22 less heat would thus be lost by evaporation and radiation in the tropical zone and an impulse would be acquired which would carry the warm water into the north polar area about the same period australia was probably divided into two islands separated by a wide channel in a north and south direction see chapter xxii and through this another current would almost certainly set northwards and be directed to the northwest by the southern extension of malayan asia the more insular condition at this period of australia india and north africa with the depression and probable fertility of the central asiatic plateau would lead to the indian ocean being traversed by regular tradewinds instead of by variable monsoons and thus the constant vis a tergo which is so efficient in the atlantic would keep up a steady and powerful current towards the northern parts of the indian ocean and thence through the midst of the european archipelago to the northern seas  now it is quite certain that such a condition as we have here sketched out would produce a wonderful effect on the climate of central europe and western and northern asia owing to the warm currents being concentrated in inland seas instead of being dispersed over a wide ocean like the 83 north atlantic much more heat would be conveyed into the arctic ocean and this would altogether prevent the formation of ice on the northern shores of asia which continent did not then extend nearly so far north and was probably deeply interpenetrated by the sea this open ocean to the north and the warm currents along all the northern lands would so equalise temperature that even the northern parts of europe might then have enjoyed a climate fully equal to that of the warmer parts of new zealand at the present day and might have well supported the luxuriant vegetation of the miocene period even without any help from similar changes in the western hemisphere23  condition of north america during the tertiary periodbut changes of a somewhat similar character have also taken place in america and the pacific an enormous area west of the mississippi extending over much of the rocky mountains consists of marine cretaceous beds 10000 feet thick indicating great and longcontinued subsidence and an insular condition of western america with a sea probably extending northwards to the arctic ocean as marine tertiary deposits are found conformably overlying these cretaceous strata professor dana is of opinion that the great elevation of this part of america did not begin till early tertiary times other tertiary beds in california alaska kamschatka the mackenzie river the parry islands and greenland indicate partial submergence 84 of all these lands with the possible influx of warm water from the pacific and the considerable elevation of some of the miocene beds in greenland and spitzbergen renders it probable that these countries were then much less elevated in which case only their higher summits would be covered with perpetual snow and no glaciers would descend to the sea  in the pacific there was probably an elevation of land counterbalancing to some extent the great depression of so much of the northern continents our map in chapter xv shows the islands that would be produced by an elevation of the great shoals under a thousand fathoms deep and it is seen that these all trend in a southeast and northwest direction and would thus facilitate the production of definite currents impelled by the southeast trades towards the northwest pacific where they would gain access to the polar seas through behrings straits which were perhaps sometimes both wider and deeper than at present  effect of these changes on the climate of the arctic regionsthese various changes of sea and land all tending towards a transference of heat from the equator to the north temperate zone were not improbably still further augmented by the existence of a great inland south american sea occupying what are now the extensive valleys of the amazon and orinoco and forming an additional reservoir of superheated water to add to the supply poured into the north atlantic  it is not of course supposed that all the modifications here indicated coexisted at the same time we have good reason to believe from the known distribution of animals in the tertiary period that landcommunications have at times existed between europe or asia and north america either by way of behrings straits or by iceland greenland and labrador but the same evidence shows that these landcommunications were the exception rather than the rule and that they occurred only at long intervals and for short periods so as at no time to bring about anything like a complete interchange of the productions of the two continents24 we may therefore admit that the 85 communication between the tropical and arctic oceans was occasionally interrupted in one or other direction but if we look at a globe instead of a mercators chart of the world we shall see that the disproportion between the extent of the polar and tropical seas is so enormous that a single wide opening with an adequate impulse to carry in a considerable stream of warm water would be amply sufficient for the complete abolition of polar snow and ice when aided by the absence of any great areas of high land within the polar circle such high land being as we have seen essential to the production of perpetual snow even at the present time  those who wish to understand the effect of oceanic currents in conveying heat to the north temperate and polar regions should study the papers of dr croll already referred to but the same thing is equally well shown by the facts of the actual distribution of heat due to the gulf stream the difference between the mean annual temperatures of the opposite coasts of europe and america is well known and has been already quoted but the difference of their mean winter temperature is still more striking and it is this which concerns us as more especially affecting the distribution of vegetable and animal life our mean winter temperature in the west of england is the same as that of the southern united states as well as that of shanghai in china both about twenty degrees of latitude further south and as we go northward the difference increases so that the winter climate of nova scotia in lat 45° is found within the arctic circle on the coast of norway and if the latter country did not consist almost wholly of precipitous snowclad mountains it would be capable of supporting most of the vegetable products of the american coast in the latitude of bordeaux25  86  with these astounding facts before us due wholly to the transference of a portion of the warm currents of the atlantic to the shores of europe even with all the disadvantages of an icy sea to the northeast and icecovered greenland to the northwest how can we doubt the enormously greater effect of such a condition of things as has been shown to have existed during the tertiary epoch instead of one great stream of warm water spreading widely over the north atlantic and thus losing the greater part of its store of heat before it reaches the arctic seas we should have several streams conveying the heat of far more extensive tropical oceans by comparatively narrow inland channels thus being able to transfer a large proportion of their heat into the northern and arctic seas the heat that they gave out during the passage instead of being widely dispersed by winds and much of it lost in the higher atmosphere would directly ameliorate the climate of the continents they passed through and prevent all accumulation of snow except on the loftiest mountains the formation of ice in the arctic seas would then be impossible and the mild winter climate of the latitude of north 87 carolina which by the gulf stream is transferred 20° northwards to our islands might certainly under the favourable conditions which prevailed during the cretaceous eocene and miocene periods have been carried another 20° north to greenland and spitzbergen and this would bring about exactly the climate indicated by the fossil arctic vegetation for it must be remembered that the arctic summers are even now really hotter than ours and if the winters cold were abolished and all iceaccumulation prevented the high northern lands would be able to support a far more luxuriant summer vegetation than is possible in our unequal and cloudy climate26  effect of high excentricity on the warm polar climatesif the explanation of the cause of the glacial epoch given in the last chapter is a correct one it will i believe follow that changes in the amount of excentricity will produce no important alteration of the climates of the temperate and arctic zones so long as favourable geographical conditions such as have been now sketched out render the accumulation of ice impossible the effect of a high excentricity in producing a glacial epoch was shown to be due to the capacity of snow and ice for storing up cold and its singular power when in large masses of preserving itself unmelted under a hot sun by itself causing the interposition of a protective covering of cloud and vapour but mobile currents of water have no such power of 88 accumulating and storing up heat or cold from one year to another though they do in a preeminent degree possess the power of equalising the temperature of winter and summer and of conveying the superabundant heat of the tropics to ameliorate the rigour of the arctic winters however great was the difference between the amount of heat received from the sun in winter and summer in the arctic zone during a period of high excentricity and winter in aphelion the inequality would be greatly diminished by the free ingress of warm currents to the polar area and if this was sufficient to prevent any accumulation of ice the summers would be warmed to the full extent of the powers of the sun during the long polar day which is such as to give the pole at midsummer actually more heat during the twentyfour hours than the equator receives during its day of twelve hours the only difference then that would be directly produced by the changes of excentricity and precession would be that the summers would be at one period almost tropical at the other of a more mild and uniform temperate character while the winters would be at one time somewhat longer and colder but never probably more severe than they are now in the west of scotland  but though high excentricity would not directly modify the mild climates produced by the state of the northern hemisphere which prevailed during cretaceous eocene and miocene times it might indirectly affect it by increasing the mass of antarctic ice and thus increasing the force of the tradewinds and the resulting northwardflowing warm currents now there are many peculiarities in the distribution of plants and of some groups of animals in the southern hemisphere which render it almost certain that there has sometimes been a greater extension of the antarctic lands during tertiary times and it is therefore not improbable that a more or less glaciated condition may have been a long persistent feature of the southern hemisphere due to the peculiar distribution of land and sea which favours the production of icefields and glaciers and as we have seen that during the last three million years the excentricity has been almost always much higher than 89 it is now we should expect that the quantity of ice in the southern hemisphere will usually have been greater and will thus have tended to increase the force of those oceanic currents which produce the mild climates of the northern hemisphere  evidences of climate in the secondary and palæozoic epochswe have already seen that so far back as the cretaceous period there is the most conclusive evidence of the prevalence of a very mild climate not only in temperate but also in arctic lands while there is no proof whatever or even any clear indication of early glacial epochs at all comparable in extent and severity with that which has so recently occurred and we have seen reason to connect this state of things with a distribution of land and sea highly favourable to the transference of warm water from equatorial to polar latitudes so far as we can judge by the plantremains of our own country the climate appears to have been almost tropical in the lower eocene period and as we go further back we find no clear indications of a higher but often of a lower temperature though always warmer or more equable than our present climate the abundant corals and reptiles of the oolite and lias indicate equally tropical conditions but further back in the trias the flora and fauna in the british area become poorer and there is nothing incompatible with a climate no warmer than that of the upper miocene this poverty is still more marked in the permian formation and it is here that some indications of iceaction are found in the lower permian conglomerates of the west of england these beds contain abundant fragments of various rocks often angular and sometimes weighing half a ton while others are partially rounded and have polished and striated surfaces just like the stones of the till they lie confusedly bedded in a red unstratified marl and some of them can be traced to the welsh hills from twenty to fifty miles distant this remarkable formation was first pointed out as proving a remote glacial period by professor ramsay and sir charles lyell agreed that this is the only possible explanation that with our present knowledge we can give of them  permian breccias are also found in ireland containing 90 blocks of silurian and old red sandstone rocks which professor hull believes could only have been carried by floating ice similar breccias occur in the south of scotland and these are stated to be overlain by a deposit of glacial age so similar to the breccia below as to be with difficulty distinguished from it27  these numerous physical indications of iceaction over a considerable area during the same geological period coinciding with just such a poverty of organic remains as might be produced by a very cold climate are very important and seem clearly to indicate that at this remote period geographical conditions were such as to bring about a glacial epoch or perhaps only local glaciation in our part of the world  boulderbeds also occur in the carboniferous formation both in scotland on the continent of europe and in north america and professor dawson considers that he has detected true glacial deposits of the same age in nova scotia boulderbeds also occur in the silurian rocks of scotland and north america and according to professor dawson even in the huronian older than our cambrian none of these indications are however so satisfactory as those of permian age where we have the very kind of evidence we looked for in vain throughout the whole of the tertiary and secondary periods its presence in several localities in such ancient rocks as the permian is not only most important as indicating a glacial epoch of some kind in palæozoic times but confirms us in the validity of our conclusion that the total absence of any such evidence throughout the tertiary and secondary epochs demonstrates the absence of recurring glacial epochs in the northern hemisphere notwithstanding the frequent recurrence of periods of high excentricity  warm arctic climates in early secondary and palæozoic timesthe evidence we have already adduced of the mild climates prevailing in the arctic regions throughout the miocene eocene and cretaceous periods is supplemented by a considerable body of facts relating to still earlier epochs  91  in the jurassic period for example we have proofs of a mild arctic climate in the abundant plantremains of east siberia and amurland with less productive deposits in spitzbergen and at ando in norway just within the arctic circle but even more remarkable are the marine remains found in many places in high northern latitudes among which we may especially mention the numerous ammonites and the vertebræ of huge reptiles of the genera ichthyosaurus and teleosaurus found in the jurassic deposits of the parry islands in 77° n lat  in the still earlier triassic age nautili and ammonites inhabited the seas of spitzbergen where their fossil remains are now found  in the carboniferous formation we again meet with plantremains and beds of true coal in the arctic regions lepidodendrons and calamites together with large spreading ferns are found at spitzbergen and at bear island in the extreme north of eastern siberia while marine deposits of the same age contain abundance of large stony corals  lastly the ancient silurian limestones which are widely spread in the high arctic regions contain abundance of corals and cephalopodous mollusca resembling those from the same deposits in more temperate lands  conclusions as to the climates of tertiary and secondary periodsif now we look at the whole series of geological facts as to the animal and vegetable productions of the arctic regions in past ages it is certainly difficult to avoid the conclusion that they indicate a climate of a uniformly temperate or warm character whether in miocene upper or lower cretaceous jurassic triassic carboniferous or silurian times and in all the numerous localities extending over more than half the polar regions we find one uniform climatic aspect in the fossils this is quite inconsistent with the theory of alternate cold and mild epochs during phases of high excentricity and persistent cold epochs when the excentricity was as low as it is now or lower for that would imply that the duration of cold conditions was greater than that of warm why then should the fauna and flora of the cold epochs never be 92 preserved mollusca and many other forms of life are abundant in the arctic seas and there is often a luxuriant dwarf woody vegetation on the land yet in no one case has a single example of such a fauna or flora been discovered of a date anterior to the last glacial epoch and this argument is very much strengthened when we remember that an exactly analogous series of facts is found over all the temperate zones everywhere we have abundant floras and faunas indicating warmer conditions than such as now prevail but never in a single instance one which as clearly indicates colder conditions the fact that drift with arctic shells was deposited during the last glacial epoch as well as gravels and crag with the remains of arctic animals and plants shows us that there is nothing to prevent such deposits being formed in cold as well as in warm periods and it is quite impossible to believe that in every place and at all epochs all records of the former have been destroyed while in a considerable number of instances those of the latter have been preserved when to this uniform testimony of the palæontological evidence we add the equally uniform absence of any indication of those iceborne rocks boulders and drift which are the constant and necessary accompaniment of every period of glaciation and which must inevitably pervade all the marine deposits formed over a wide area so long as the state of glaciation continues we are driven to the conclusion that the last glacial epoch of the northern hemisphere was exceptional and was not preceded by numerous similar glacial epochs throughout tertiary and secondary time  but although glacial epochs with the one or two exceptions already referred to were certainly absent considerable changes of climate may have frequently occurred and these would lead to important changes in the organic world we can hardly doubt that some such change occurred between the lower and upper cretaceous periods the floras of which exhibit such an extraordinary contrast in general character we have also the testimony of mr j s gardner who has long worked at the fossil floras of the tertiary deposits and who states that 93 there is strong negative and some positive evidence of alternating warmer and colder conditions not glacial contained not only in english eocene but all tertiary beds throughout the world28 in the case of marine faunas it is more difficult to judge but the numerous changes in the fossil remains from bed to bed only a few feet and sometimes a few inches apart may be sometimes due to change of climate and when it is recognised that such changes have probably occurred at all geological epochs and their effects are systematically searched for many peculiarities in the distribution of organisms through the different members of one deposit may be traced to this cause  general view of geological climates as dependent on the physical features of the earths surfacein the preceding chapters i have earnestly endeavoured to arrive at an explanation of geological climates in the temperate and arctic zones which should be in harmony with the great body of geological facts now available for their elucidation if my conclusions as here set forth diverge considerably from those of dr croll it is not from any want of appreciation of his facts and arguments since for many years i have upheld and enforced his views to the best of my ability but a careful reexamination of the whole question has now convinced me that an error has been made in estimating the comparative effect of geographical and astronomical causes on changes of climate and that while the latter have undoubtedly played an important part in bringing about the glacial epoch it is to the former that the mild climates of the arctic regions are almost entirely due if i have now succeeded in approaching to a true solution of this difficult problem i owe it mainly to the study of dr crolls writings since my theory is entirely based on the facts and principles so clearly set forth in his admirable papers on ocean currents in relation to the distribution of heat over the globe the main features of this theory as distinct from that of dr croll i will now endeavour to summarise  looking at the subject broadly we see that the climatic 94 condition of the northern hemisphere is the result of the peculiar distribution of land and water upon the globe and the general permanence of the position of the continental and oceanic areaswhich we have shown to be proved by so many distinct lines of evidenceis also implied by the general stability of climate throughout long geological periods the land surface of our earth appears to have always consisted of three great masses in the north temperate zone narrowing southward and terminating in three comparatively narrow extremities represented by southern america south africa and australia towards the north these masses have approached each other and have sometimes become united leaving beyond them a considerable area of open polar sea towards the south they have never been much further prolonged than at present but far beyond their extremities an extensive mass of land has occupied the south polar area  this arrangement is such as would cause the northern hemisphere to be always as it is now warmer than the southern and this would lead to the preponderance of northward winds and ocean currents and would bring about the concentration of the latter in three great streams carrying warmth to the northpolar regions these streams would as dr croll has so well shown be greatly increased in power by the glaciation of the south polar land and whenever any considerable portion of this land was elevated such a condition of glaciation would certainly be brought about and would be heightened whenever a high degree of excentricity prevailed  it is now the general opinion of geologists that the great continents have undergone a process of development from earlier to later times professor dana appears to have been the first who taught it explicitly in the case of the north american continent and he has continued the development of his views from 1856 when he discussed the subject in the american journal to the later editions of his manual of geology in which the same views are extended to all the great continents he says  the north american continent which since early 95 time had been gradually expanding in each direction from the northern azoic eastward westward and southward and which after the palæozoic was finished in its rocky foundation excepting on the borders of the atlantic and pacific and the area of the rocky mountains had reached its full expansion at the close of the tertiary period the progress from the first was uniform and systematic the land was at all times simple in outline and its enlargement took place with almost the regularity of an exogenous plant29  a similar development undoubtedly took place in the european area which was apparently never so compact and so little interpenetrated by the sea as it is now while europe and asia have only become united into one unbroken mass since late tertiary times  if however the greater continents have become more compact and massive from age to age and have received their chief extensions northward at a comparatively recent period while the antarctic lands had a corresponding but somewhat earlier development we have all the conditions requisite to explain the persistence with slight fluctuations of warm climates far into the northpolar area throughout palæozoic mesozoic and tertiary times at length during the latter part of the tertiary epoch a considerable elevation took place closing up several of the water passages to the north and raising up extensive areas in the arctic regions to become the receptacle of snow and icefields this elevation is indicated by the abundance of miocene and the absence of pliocene deposits in the arctic zone and the considerable altitude of many miocene rocks in europe and north america and the occurrence at this time of a longcontinued period of high excentricity necessarily brought on the glacial epoch in the manner already described in our last chapter a depression seems to have occurred during the glacial period itself in north america as in britain but this may have been due partly to the weight of the ice and partly to a rise of the ocean 96 level caused by the earths centre of gravity being shifted towards the north  we thus see that the last glacial epoch was the climax of a great process of continental development which had been going on throughout long geological ages and that it was the direct consequence of the north temperate and polar land having attained a great extension and a considerable altitude just at the time when a phase of very high excentricity was coming on throughout earlier tertiary and secondary times an equally high excentricity often occurred but it never produced a glacial epoch because the north temperate and polar areas had less high land and were more freely open to the influx of warm oceanic currents but wherever great plateaux with lofty mountains occurred in the temperate zone a considerable local glaciation might be produced which would be specially intense during periods of high excentricity and it is to such causes we must impute the indications of iceaction in the vicinity of the alps during the tertiary period the permian glaciation appears to have been more extensive and it is quite possible that at this remote epoch a sufficient mass of high land existed in our area and northwards towards the pole to have brought on a true glacial period comparable with that which has so recently passed away  estimate of the comparative effects of geographical and astronomical causes in producing changes of climateit appears then that while geographical and physical causes alone by their influence on ocean currents have been the main agents in producing the mild climates which for such long periods prevailed in the arctic regions the concurrence of astronomical causeshigh excentricity with winter in aphelionwas necessary to the production of the great glacial epoch if we reject this latter agency we shall be obliged to imagine a concurrence of geographical changes at a very recent period of which we have no evidence we must suppose for example that a large part of the british islesscotland ireland and wales at all eventswere simultaneously elevated so as to bring extensive areas above the line of perpetual snow that 97 about the same time scandinavia the alps and the pyrenees received a similar increase of altitude and that almost simultaneously eastern north america the sierra nevada of california the caucasus lebanon the southern mountains of spain the atlas range and the himalayas were each some thousands of feet higher than they are now for all these mountains present us with indications of a recent extension of their glaciers in superficial phenomena so similar to those which occur in our own country and in western europe that we cannot suppose them to belong to a different epoch such a supposition is rendered more difficult by the general concurrence of scientific testimony to a partial submergence during the glacial epoch not only in all parts of britain but in north america scandinavia and as shown by the wide extension of the drift in northern europe and when to this we add the difficulty of understanding how any probable addition to the altitude of our islands could have brought about the extreme amount of glaciation which they certainly underwent and when further we know that a phase of very high excentricity did occur at a period which is generally admitted to agree well with physical evidence of the time elapsed since the cold passed away there seems no sufficient reason why such an agency should be ignored  no doubt a prejudice has been excited against it in the minds of many geologists by its being thought to lead necessarily to frequently recurring glacial epochs throughout all geological time but i have here endeavoured to show that this is not a necessary consequence of the theory because a concurrence of favourable geographical conditions is essential to the initiation of a glaciation which when once initiated has a tendency to maintain itself throughout the varying phases of precession occurring during a period of high excentricity when however geographical conditions favour warm arctic climatesas it has been shown they have done throughout the larger portion of geological timethen changes of excentricity to however great an extent have no tendency to bring about a state of glaciation because warm oceanic currents have a 98 preponderating influence and without very large areas of high northern land to act as condensers no perpetual snow is possible and hence the initial process of glaciation does not occur  the theory as now set forth should commend itself to geologists since it shows the direct dependence of climate on physical processes which are guided and modified by those changes in the earths surface which geology alone can trace out it is in perfect accord with the most recent teachings of the science as to the gradual and progressive development of the earths crust from the rudimentary formations of the azoic age and it lends support to the view that no inportantimportant departure from the great lines of elevation and depression originally marked out on the earths surface has ever taken place  it also shows us how important an agent in the production of a habitable globe with comparatively small extremes of climates over its whole area is the great disproportion between the extent of the land and the water surfaces for if these proportions had been reversed large areas of land would necessarily have been removed from the beneficial influence of aqueous currents or moistureladen winds and slight geological changes might easily have led to half the land surface becoming covered with perpetual snow and ice or being exposed to extremes of summer heat and winter cold of which our waterpermeated globe at present affords no example we thus see that what are usually regarded as geographical anomaliesthe disproportion of land and water the gathering of the land mainly into one hemisphere and the singular arrangement of the land in three great southwardpointing massesare really facts of the greatest significance and importance since it is to these very anomalies that the universal spread of vegetation and the adaptability of so large a portion of the earths surface for human habitation is directly due                                        99  chapter x  the earths age and the rate of development of animals and plants      various

introduce us to a difficulty which has hitherto been considered a very formidable onethat the maximum age of the habitable earth as deduced from physical considerations does not afford sufficient time either for the geological or the organic changes of which we have evidence geologists continually dwell on the slowness of the processes of upheaval and subsidence of denudation of the earths surface and of the formation of new strata while on the theory of development as expounded by mr darwin the variation and modification of organic forms is also a very slow process and has usually been considered to require an 100 even longer series of ages than might satisfy the requirements of physical geology alone  as an indication of the periods usually contemplated by geologists we may refer to sir charles lyells calculation in the tenth edition of his principles of geology omitted in later editions by which he arrived at 240 millions of years as having probably elapsed since the cambrian perioda very moderate estimate in the opinion of most geologists this calculation was founded on the rate of modification of the species of mollusca but much more recently professor haughton has arrived at nearly similar figures from a consideration of the rate of formation of rocks and their known maximum thickness whence he deduces a maximum of 200 millions of years for the whole duration of geological time as indicated by the series of stratified formations30 but in the opinion of all our first naturalists and geologists the period occupied in the formation of the known stratified rocks only represents a portion and perhaps a small portion of geological time in the sixth edition of the origin of species p 286 mr darwin says consequently if the theory be true it is indisputable that before the lowest cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed as long as or probably far longer than the whole interval from the cambrian age to the present day and that during these vast periods the world swarmed with living creatures professor huxley in his anniversary address to the geological society in 1870 adduced a number of special cases showing that on the theory of development almost all the higher forms of life must have existed during the palæozoic period thus from the fact that almost the whole of the tertiary period has been required to convert the ancestral orohippus into the true horse he believes that in order to have time for the much greater change of the ancestral ungulata into the two great oddtoed and eventoed divisions of which change there is no trace even among the earliest eocene mammals we should require a large portion if not the whole of the mesozoic or secondary period another case is furnished by the bats and whales both of which strange modifications of the 101 mammalian type occur perfectly developed in the eocene formation what countless ages back must we then go for the origin of these groups the whales from some ancestral carnivorous animal and the bats from the insectivora and even then we have to seek for the common origin of carnivora insectivora ungulata and marsupials at a far earlier period so that on the lowest estimate we must place the origin of the mammalia very far back in palæozoic times similar evidence is afforded by reptiles of which professor huxley says if the very small differences which are observable between the crocodiles of the older secondary formations and those of the present day furnish any sort of an approximation towards an estimate of the average rate of change among reptiles it is almost appalling to reflect how far back in palæozoic times we must go before we can hope to arrive at that common stock from which the crocodiles lizards ornithoscelida and plesiosauria which had attained so great a development in the triassic epoch must have been derived professor ramsay has expressed similar views derived from a general study of the whole series of geological formations and their contained fossils he says speaking of the abundant varied and welldeveloped fauna of the cambrian period in this earliest known varied life we find no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of the zoological series in a broad sense compared with what must have gone before both biologically and physically all the phenomena connected with this old period seem to my mind to be of quite a recent description and the climates of seas and lands were of the very same kind as those the world enjoys at the present day31  these opinions and the facts on which they are founded are so weighty that we can hardly doubt that if the time since the cambrian epoch is correctly estimated at 200 millions of years the date of the commencement of life on the earth cannot be much less than 500 millions while it may not improbably have been longer because the reaction of 102 the organism under changes of the environment is believed to have been less active in low and simple than in high and complex forms of life and thus the processes of organic development may for countless ages have been excessively slow  but according to the physicists no such periods as are here contemplated can be granted from a consideration of the possible sources of the heat of the sun as well as from calculations of the period during which the earth can have been cooling to bring about the present rate of increase of temperature as we descend beneath the surface sir william thomson concludes that the crust of the earth cannot have been solidified much longer than 100 million years the maximum possible being 400 millions and this conclusion is held by dr croll and other men of eminence to be almost indisputable32 it will therefore be well to consider on what data the calculations of geologists have been founded and how far the views here set forth as to frequent changes of climate throughout all geological time may affect the rate of biological change  denudation and deposition of strata as a measure of timethe materials of all the stratified rocks of the globe have been obtained from the dry land every point of the surface is exposed to the destructive influences of sun and wind frost snow and rain which break up and wear away the hardest rocks as well as the softer deposits and by means of rivers convey the worn material to the sea the existence of a considerable depth of soil over the greater part of the earths surface of vast heaps of rocky débris at the foot of every inland cliff of enormous deposits of gravel sand and loam as well as the shingle pebbles sand or mud of every seashore alike attest the universality of this destructive agency it is no less clearly shown by the way in which almost every drop of running waterwhether in gutter brooklet stream or large riverbecomes discoloured after each heavy rainfall since the matter which causes this discolouration must be derived from the surface 103 of the country must always pass from a higher to a lower level and must ultimately reach the sea unless it is first deposited in some lake or by the overflowing of a river goes to form an alluvial plain the universality of this subaërial denudation both as regards space and time renders it certain that its cumulative effects must be very great but no attempt seems to have been made to determine the magnitude of these effects till mr alfred tylor in 185333 pointed out that by measuring the quantity of solid matter brought down by rivers which can be done with considerable accuracy we may obtain the amount of lowering of the landarea and also the rise of the ocean level owing to the quantity of matter deposited on its floor a few years later dr croll applied the same method in more detail to an estimate of the amount by which the land is lowered in a given period and the validity of this method has been upheld by sir a geikie sir charles lyell and all our best geologists as affording a means of actually determining with some approach to accuracy the time occupied by one important phase of geological change  the quantity of matter carried away from the land by a river is greater than at first sight appears and is more likely to be under than overestimated by taking samples of water near the mouth of a river but above the influence of the tide at a sufficient number of points in its channel and at different depths and repeating this daily or at other short intervals throughout the year it is easy to determine the quantity of solid matter held in suspension and solution and if corresponding observations determine the quantity of water that is discharged the total amount of solid matter brought down annually may be calculated but besides this a considerable quantity of sand or even gravel is carried along the bottom or bed of the river and this has rarely been estimated so that the figures hitherto obtained are usually under the real quantities there is also another source of error caused by the quantity of matter the river may deposit in lakes or in flooded lands during its course for this adds to the amount of denudation performed by the river although 104 the matter so deposited does not come down to the sea after a careful examination of all the best records sir a geikie arrives at the following results as to the quantity of matter removed by seven rivers from their basins estimated by the number of years required to lower the whole surface an average of one foot    the mississippi removes one foot in 6000 years      ganges                     2358         hoang ho                   1464         rhone                      1528         danube                     6846         po                           729         nith                       4723     here we see an intelligible relation between the character of the river basin and the amount of denudation the mississippi has a large portion of its basin in an arid country and its sources are either in forestclad plateaux or in mountains free from glaciers and with a scanty rainfall the danube flows through eastern europe where the rainfall is considerably less than in the west while comparatively few of its tributaries rise among the loftiest alps the proportionate amounts of denudation being then what we might expect and as all are probably under rather than over the truth we may safely take the average of them all as representing an amount of denudation which if not true for the whole land surface of the globe will certainly be so for a very considerable proportion of it this average is almost exactly one foot in three thousand years34 the mean altitude of the several 105 continents has been recently estimated by mr john murray35 to be as follows europe 939 feet asia 3189 feet africa 2020 feet north america 1888 feet and south america 2078 feet at the rate of denudation above given it results that were no other forces at work europe would be planed down to the sealevel in about two million eight hundred thousand years while if we take a somewhat slower rate for north america that continent might last about four or five million years36 this also implies that the mean height of these continents would have been about double what it is now three million and five million years ago respectively and as we have no reason to suppose this to have been the case we are led to infer the constant action of that upheaving force which the presence of sedimentary formations even on the highest mountains also demonstrates  we have already discussed the unequal rate of denudation on hills valleys and lowlands in connection with the evidence of remote glacial epochs p 173 what we have now to consider is what becomes of all this denuded matter and how far the known rate of denudation affords us a measure of the rate of deposition and thus gives us some indication of the lapse of geological time from a comparison of this rate with the observed thickness of stratified rocks on the earths surface  106  how to estimate the thickness of the sedimentary rocksthe sedimentary rocks of which the earths crust is mainly composed consist according to sir charles lyells classification of fourteen great formations of which the most ancient is the laurentian and the most recent the posttertiary or pleistocene with thirty important subdivisions each of which again consists of a more or less considerable number of distinct beds or strata thus the silurian formation is divided into upper and lower silurian each characterized by a distinct set of fossil remains and the upper silurian again consists of a large number of separate beds such as the wenlock limestone the upper llandovery sandstone the lower llandovery slates c each usually characterised by a difference of mineral composition or mechanical structure as well as by some peculiar fossils these beds and formations vary greatly in extent both above and beneath the surface and are also of very various thicknesses in different localities a thick bed or series of beds often thins out in a given direction and sometimes disappears altogether so that two beds which were respectively above and beneath it may come into contact as an example of this thinning out american geologists adduce the palæozoic formations of the appalachian mountains which have a total thickness of 42000 feet but as they are traced westward thin out till they become only 4000 feet in total thickness in like manner the carboniferous grits and shales are 18000 feet thick in yorkshire and lancashire but they thin out southwards so that in leicestershire they are only 3000 feet thick and similar phenomena occur in all strata and in every part of the world it must be observed that this thinning out has nothing to do with denudation which acts upon the surface of a country so as to produce great irregularities of contour but is a regular attenuation of the layers of rock due to a deficiency of sediment in certain directions at the original formation of the deposit owing to this thinning out of stratified rocks they are on the whole of far less extent than is usually supposed when we see a geological map showing successive formations following each other in long irregular belts across the country as is well 107 seen in the case of the secondary rocks of england and a corresponding section showing each bed dipping beneath its predecessor we are apt to imagine that beneath the uppermost bed we should find all the others following in succession like the coats of an onion but this is far from being the case and a remarkable proof of the narrow limitation of these formations has been recently obtained by a boring at ware through the chalk and gault clay which latter immediately rests on the upper silurian wenlock limestone full of characteristic fossils at a depth of only 800 feet here we have an enormous gap showing that none of earlier secondary or late palæozoic formations extend to this part of england unless indeed they had been all once elevated and entirely swept away by denudation37  but if we consider how such deposits are now forming we shall find that the thinning out of the beds of each formation and their restriction to irregular bands and patches is exactly what we should expect the enormous quantity of sediment continually poured into the sea by rivers gradually subsides to the bottom as soon as the motion of the water is checked all the heavier material must be deposited near the shore or in those areas over which it is first spread by the tides or currents of the ocean while only the very fine mud and clay is carried out to considerable distances thus all stratified deposits 108 will form most quickly near the shores and will thin out rapidly at greater distances little or none being formed in the depths of the great oceans this important fact was demonstrated by the specimens of seabottom examined during the voyage of the challenger all the shore deposits being usually confined within a distance of 100 or 150 miles from the coast while the deepsea deposits are either purely organic being formed of the calcareous or siliceous skeletons of globigerinæ radiolarians and diatomaceæ or are clays formed of undissolved portions of these together with the disintegrated or dissolved materials of pumice and volcanic dust which being very light are carried by wind or by water over the widest oceans  from the preceding considerations we shall be better able to appreciate the calculations as to the thickness of stratified deposits made by geologists professor ramsay has calculated that the sedimentary rocks of britain alone have a total maximum thickness of 72600 feet while professor haughton from a survey of the whole world estimates the maximum thickness of the known stratified rocks at 177200 feet now these maximum thicknesses of each deposit will have been produced only where the conditions were exceptionally favourable either in deep water near the mouths of great rivers or in inland seas or in places to which the drainage of extensive countries was conveyed by ocean currents and this great thickness will necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding thinness or complete absence of deposit elsewhere how far the series of rocks found in any extensive area as europe or north america represents the whole series of deposits which have been made there we cannot tell but there is no reason to think that it is a very inadequate representation of their maximum thickness though it undoubtedly is of their extent and bulk when we see in how many distinct localities patches of the same formation occur it seems improbable that the whole of the deposits formed during any one period should have been destroyed even in such an area as europe while it is still more improbable that they should be so destroyed over the whole world and 109 if any considerable portion of them is left that portion may give a fair idea of their average or even of their maximum thickness in his admirable paper on the mean thickness of the sedimentary rocks38 dr james croll has dwelt on the extent of denudation in diminishing the mean thickness of the rocks that have been formed remarking whatever the present mean thickness of all the sedimentary rocks of our globe may be it must be small in comparison to the mean thickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed this is obvious from the fact that the sedimentary rocks of one age are partly formed from the destruction of the sedimentary rocks of former ages from the laurentian age down to the present day the stratified rocks have been undergoing constant denudation this is perfectly true and yet the mean thickness of that portion of the sedimentary rocks which remains may not be very different from that of the entire mass because denudation acts only on those rocks which are exposed on the surface of a country and most largely on those that are upheaved while except in the rare case of an extensive formation being quite horizontal and wholly exposed to the sea or to the atmosphere denudation can have no tendency to diminish the thickness of any entire deposit39 unless therefore a formation is completely destroyed by denudation in every part of the world a thing very improbable we may have in existing rocks a not very inadequate representation of the mean thickness of all that have been formed and even of the maximum thickness of the larger portion this will be the more likely because it is almost certain that many rocks contemporaneously formed are counted by geologists as distinct formations whenever they differ in lithological character or in organic remains but we know that limestones sandstones and shales are always forming at the same time 110 while a great difference in organic remains may arise from comparatively slight changes of geographical features or from difference in the depth or purity of the water in which the animals lived40  how to estimate the average rate of deposition of the sedimentary rocksbut if we take the estimate of professor haughton 177200 feet which as we have seen is probably excessive for the maximum thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the globe of all known geological ages can we arrive at any estimate of the rate at which they were formed dr croll has attempted to make such an estimate but he has taken for his basis the mean thickness of the rocks which we have no means whatever of arriving at and which he guesses allowing for denudation to be equal to the maximum thickness as measured by geologists the landarea of the globe is according to dr croll 5700000041 square miles and he gives the coastline as 116000 miles this however is for our purpose rather too much as it allows for bays inlets and the smaller islands an approximate measurement on a globe shows that 100000 miles will be nearer the mark and this has the advantage of being an easily remembered even number the distance from the coast to which shoredeposits usually extend may be reckoned at about 100 or 150 miles but by far the larger portion of the matter brought down from the land will be deposited comparatively close to the shore that is within twenty or thirty miles if we suppose the portion deposited beyond thirty miles to be added to the deposits within that distance and the whole reduced to a uniform thickness in a direction at right angles to the coast we should probably include all areas where deposits of the maximum thickness 111 are forming at the present time along with a large but unknown proportion of surface where the deposits were far below the maximum thickness this follows if we consider that deposit must go on very unequally along different parts of a coast owing to the distance from each other of the mouths of great rivers and the limitations of ocean currents and because compared with the areas over which a thick deposit is forming annually those where there is little or none are probably at least twice as extensive if therefore we take a width of thirty miles along the whole coastline of the globe as representing the area over which deposits are forming corresponding to the maximum thickness as measured by geologists we shall certainly over rather than underestimate the possible rate of deposit42  now a coast line of 100000 miles with a width of 30 gives an area of 3000000 square miles on which the denuded matter of the whole landarea of 57000000 square 112 miles is deposited as these two areas are as 1 to 19 it follows that deposition as measured by maximum thickness goes on at least nineteen times as fast as denudationprobably very much faster but the mean rate of denudation over the whole earth is about one foot in three thousand years therefore the rate of maximum deposition will be at least 19 feet in the same time and as the total maximum thickness of all the stratified rocks of the globe is according to professor haughton 177200 feet the time required to produce this thickness of rock at the present rate of denudation and deposition is only 28000000 years43  the rate of geological change probably greater in very remote timesthe opinion that denudation and deposition went on more rapidly in earlier times owing to the frequent occurrence of vast convulsions and cataclysms was strenuously opposed by sir charles lyell who so well showed that causes of the very same nature as those now in action were sufficient to account for all the phenomena presented by the rocks throughout the whole series of geological formations but while upholding the soundness of the views of the uniformitarians as opposed to the convulsionists we must yet admit that there is reason for believing in a gradually increasing intensity of all telluric action as we go back into past time this subject has been well treated by mr w j sollas44 who shows that if as all physicists maintain the sun gave out perceptibly more heat in past ages than now this alone would cause an increase in almost all the forces that have brought about geological phenomena with greater heat there would be a more extensive aqueous atmosphere and perhaps a greater difference between equatorial and polar temperatures hence more violent winds heavier rains and snows 113 and more powerful oceanic currents all producing more rapid denudation at the same time the internal heat of the earth being greater it would be cooling more rapidly and thus the forces of contractionwhich cause the upheaving of mountains the eruption of volcanoes and the subsidence of extensive areaswould be more powerful and would still further aid the process of denudation yet again the earths rotation was certainly more rapid in very remote times and this would cause more impetuous tides and still further add to the denuding power of the ocean it thus appears that as we go back into the past all the forces tending to the continued destruction and renewal of the earths surface would be in more powerful action and must therefore tend to reduce the time required for the deposition and upheaval of the various geological formations it may be true as many geologists assert that the changes here indicated are so slow that they would produce comparatively little effect within the time occupied by the known sedimentary rocks yet whatever effect they did produce would certainly be in the direction here indicated and as several causes are acting together their combined effects may have been by no means unimportant it must also be remembered that such an increase of the primary forces on which all geologic change depends would act with great effect in still further intensifying those alternations of cold and warm periods in each hemisphere or more frequently of excessive and equable seasons which have been shown to be the result of astronomical combined with geographical revolutions and this would again increase the rapidity of denudation and deposition and thus still further reduce the time required for the production of the known sedimentary rocks it is evident therefore that these various considerations all combine to prove that in supposing that the rate of denudation has been on the average only what it is now we are almost certainly overestimating the time required to have produced the whole series of formations from the cambrian upwards  value of the preceding estimate of geological timeit is not of course supposed that the calculation here given 114 makes any approach to accuracy but it is believed that it does indicate the order of magnitude of the time required we have a certain number of data which are not guessed but the result of actual measurement such are the amount of solid matter carried down by rivers the width of the belt within which this matter is mainly deposited and the maximum thickness of the known stratified rocks45 a considerable but unknown amount of denudation is effected by the waves of the ocean eating away coast lines this was once thought to be of more importance than subaërial denudation but it is now believed to be comparatively slow in its action46 whatever it may be however it adds to the rate of formation of new strata and its omission from the calculation is again on the side of making the lapse of time greater rather than less than the true amount even if a considerable modification should be needed in some of the assumptions it has been necessary to make the result must still show that so far as the time required for the formation of the known stratified rocks the hundred million years allowed by physicists is not only ample but will permit of even more than an equal period anterior to the lowest cambrian rocks as demanded by mr darwina demand supported and enforced by the arguments taken from independent standpoints of professor huxley and professor ramsay  organic modification dependent on change of conditionshaving 115 thus shown that the physical changes of the earths surface may have gone on much more rapidly and occupied much less time than has generally been supposed we have now to inquire whether there are any considerations which lead to the conclusion that organic changes may have gone on with corresponding rapidity  there is no part of the theory of natural selection which is more clear and satisfactory than that which connects changes of specific forms with changes of external conditions or environment if the external world remains for a moderate period unchanged the organic world soon reaches a state of equilibrium through the struggle for existence each species occupies its place in nature and there is then no inherent tendency to change but almost any change whatever in the external world disturbs this equilibrium and may set in motion a whole series of organic revolutions before it is restored a change of climate in any direction will be sure to injure some and benefit other species the one will consequently diminish the other increase in number and the former may even become extinct but the extinction of a species will certainly affect other species which it either preyed upon or competed with or served for food while the increase of any one animal may soon lead to the extinction of some other to which it was inimical these changes will in their turn bring other changes and before an equilibrium is again established the proportions ranges and numbers of the species inhabiting the country may be materially altered the complex manner in which animals are related to each other is well exhibited by the importance of insects which in many parts of the world limit the numbers or determine the very existence of some of the higher animals mr darwin saysperhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild though they swarm southward and northward in a wild state and azara and rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in paraguay of a certain fly which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born the increase of these flies numerous as they are must be 116 habitually checked by some means probably by other parasitic insects hence if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in paraguay the parasitic insects would probably increase and this would lessen the number of navelfrequenting fliesthen cattle and horses would run wild and this would certainly alter as indeed i have observed in parts of south america the vegetation this again would largely affect the insects and this as we have seen in staffordshire the insectivorous birds and so onwards in ever increasing circles of complexity  geographical changes would be still more important and it is almost impossible to exaggerate the modifications of the organic world that might result from them a subsidence of land separating a large island from a continent would affect the animals and plants in a variety of ways it would at once modify the climate and so produce a series of changes from this cause alone but more important would be its effect by isolating small groups of individuals of many species and thus altering their relations to the rest of the organic world many of these would at once be exterminated while others being relieved from competition might flourish and become modified into new species even more striking would be the effects when two continents or any two land areas which had been long separated were united by an upheaval of the strait which divided them numbers of animals would now be brought into competition for the first time new enemies and new competitors would appear in every part of the country and a struggle would commence which after many fluctuations would certainly result in the extinction of some species the modification of others and a considerable alteration in the proportionate numbers and the geographical distribution of almost all  any other changes which led to the intermingling of species whose ranges were usually separate would produce corresponding results thus increased severity of winter or summer temperature causing southward migrations and the crowding together of the productions of distinct regions must inevitably produce a struggle for existence which would lead to many changes both in the characters and 117 the distribution of animals slow elevations of the land would produce another set of changes by affording an extended area in which the more dominant species might increase their numbers and by a greater range and variety of alpine climates and mountain stations affording room for the development of new forms of life  geographical mutations as a motive power in bringing about organic changesnow if we consider the various geographical changes which as we have seen there is good reason to believe have ever been going on in the world we shall find that the motive power to initiate and urge on organic changes has never been wanting in the first place every continent though permanent in a general sense has been ever subject to innumerable physical and geographical modifications at one time the total area has increased and at another has diminished great plateaus have gradually risen up and have been eaten out by denudation into mountain and valley volcanoes have burst forth and after accumulating vast masses of eruptive matter have sunk down beneath the ocean to be covered up with sedimentary rocks and at a subsequent period again raised above the surface and the loci of all these grand revolutions of the earths surface have changed their position age after age so that each portion of every continent has again and again been sunk under the ocean waves formed the bed of some inland sea or risen high into plateaus and mountain ranges how great must have been the effects of such changes on every form of organic life and it is to such as these we may perhaps trace those great changes of the animal world which have seemed to revolutionise it and have led us to class one geological period as the age of reptiles another as the age of fishes and a third as the age of mammals  but such changes as these must necessarily have led to repeated unions and separations of the land masses of the globe joining together continents which were before divided and breaking up others into great islands or extensive archipelagoes such alterations of the means of transit would probably affect the organic world even more profoundly than the changes of area of altitude or 118 of climate since they afforded the means at long intervals of bringing the most diverse forms into competition and of spreading all the great animal and vegetable types widely over the globe but the isolation of considerable masses of land for long periods also afforded the means of preservation to many of the lower types which thus had time to become modified into a variety of distinct forms some of which became so well adapted to special modes of life that they have continued to exist to the present day thus affording us examples of the life of early ages which would probably long since have become extinct had they been always subject to the competition of the more highly organised animals as examples of such excessively archaic forms we may mention the mudfishes and the ganoids confined to limited freshwater areas the frogs and toads which still maintain themselves vigorously in competition with higher forms and among mammals the ornithorhynchus and echidna of australia the whole order of marsupialswhich out of australia where they are quite free from competition only exist abundantly in south america which was certainly long isolated from the northern continents the insectivora which though widely scattered are generally nocturnal or subterranean in their habits and the lemurs which are most abundant in madagascar where they have long been isolated and almost removed from the competition of higher forms  climatal revolutions as an agent in producing organic changesthe geographical and geological changes we have been considering are probably those which have been most effective in bringing about the great features of the distribution of animals as well as the larger movements in the development of organised beings but it is to the alternations of warm and cold or of uniform and excessive climatesof almost perpetual spring in arctic as well as in temperate lands with occasional phases of cold culminating at remote intervals in glacial epochsthat we must impute some of the more remarkable changes both in the specific characters and in the distribution of organisms47 119 although the geological evidence is opposed to the belief in early glacial epochs except at very remote and distant intervals there is nothing which contradicts the occurrence of repeated changes of climate which though too small in amount to produce any wellmarked physical or organic change would yet be amply sufficient to keep the organic world in a constant state of movement and which by subjecting the whole flora and fauna of a country at comparatively short intervals to decided changes of physical conditions would supply that stimulus and motive power which as we have seen is all that is necessary to keep the processes of natural selection in constant operation  the frequent recurrence of periods of high and of low excentricity must certainly have produced changes of climate of considerable importance to the life of animals and plants during periods of high excentricity with summer in perihelion that season would be certainly very much hotter while the winters would be longer and colder than at present and although geographical conditions might prevent any permanent increase of snow and ice even in the extreme north yet we cannot doubt that the whole northern hemisphere would then have a very different climate than when the changing phase of precession brought a very cool summer and a very mild wintera perpetual spring in fact now such a change of climate would certainly be calculated to bring about a considerable change of species both by modification and migration without any such decided change of type either in the vegetation or the animals that we could say from their fossil remains that any change of climate had taken place let us suppose for instance that the climate of england and that of canada were to be mutually exchanged and that the change took five or six thousand years to bring about it cannot be doubted that considerable modifications in the fauna and flora of both countries would be the result although it is impossible to predict 120 what the precise changes would be we can safely say however that some species would stand the change better than others while it is highly probable that some would be actually benefited by it and that others would be injured but the benefited would certainly increase and the injured decrease in consequence and thus a series of changes would be initiated that might lead to most important results again we are sure that some species would become modified in adaptation to the change of climate more readily than others and these modified species would therefore increase at the expense of others not so readily modified and hence would arise on the one hand extinction of species and on the other the production of new forms  but this is the very least amount of change of climate that would certainly occur every 10500 years when there was a high excentricity for it is impossible to doubt that a varying distance of the sun in summer from 86 to 99 millions of miles which is what occurred duringas supposedthe miocene period 850000 years ago would produce an important difference in the summer temperature and in the actinic influence of sunshine on vegetation for the intensity of the suns rays would vary as the square of the distance or nearly as 74 to 98 so that the earth would be actually receiving onefourth less sunheat during summer at one time than at the other an equally high excentricity occurred 2500000 years back and no doubt was often reached during still earlier epochs while a lower but still very high excentricity has frequently prevailed and is probably near its average value changes of climate therefore every 10500 years of the character above indicated and of varying intensity have been the rule rather than the exception in past time and these changes must have been variously modified by changing geographical conditions so as to produce climatic alterations in different directions giving to the ancient lands either dry or wet seasons storms or calms equable or excessive temperatures in a variety of combinations of which the earth perhaps affords no example under the present low phase of 121 excentricity and consequent slight inequality of sunheat  present condition of the earth one of exceptional stability as regards climateit will be seen by a reference to the diagram at page 171 that during the last three million years the excentricity has been less than it is now on eight occasions for short periods only making up a total of about 280000 years while it has been more than it is now for many long periods of from 300000 to 700000 years each making a total of 2720000 years or nearly as 10 to 1 for nearly half the entire period or 1400000 years the excentricity has been nearly double what it is now and this is not far from its mean condition we have no reason for supposing that this long period of three million years for which we have tables was in any way exceptional as regards the degree or variation of excentricity but on the contrary we may pretty safely assume that its variations during this time fairly represent its average state of increase and decrease during all known geological time but when the glacial epoch ended 72000 years ago the excentricity was about double its present amount it then rapidly decreased till at 60000 years back it was very little greater than it is now and since then it has been uniformly small it follows that for about 60000 years before our time the mutations of climate every 10500 years have been comparatively unimportant and that the temperate zones have enjoyed an exceptional stability of climate during this time those powerful causes of organic change which depend on considerable changes of climate and the consequent modifications migrations and extinctions of species will not have been at work the slight changes that did occur would probably be so slow and so little marked that the various species would be able to adapt themselves to them without much disturbance and the result would be an epoch of exceptional stability of species  but it is from this very period of exceptional stability that we obtain our only scale for measuring the rate of organic change it includes not only the historical period 122 but that of the swiss lake dwellings the danish shellmounds our peatbogs our sunken forests and many of our superficial alluvial depositsthe whole in fact of the iron bronze and neolithic ages even some portion of the palæolithic age and of the more recent gravels and caveearths may come into the same general period if they were formed when the glacial epoch was passing away now throughout all these ages we find no indication of change of species and but little comparatively of migration we thus get an erroneous idea of the permanence and stability of specific forms due to the period immediately antecedent to our own being a period of exceptional permanence and stability as regards climatic and geographical conditions48  date of last glacial epoch and its bearing on the measurement of geological timedirectly we go back from this stable period we come upon changes both in the forms and in the distribution of species and when we pass beyond the last glacial epoch into the pliocene period we find ourselves in a comparatively new world surrounded by a considerable number of species altogether different from any which now exist together with many others which though still living now inhabit distant regions it seems not improbable that what is termed the pliocene period was really the coming on of the glacial epoch and this is the opinion of professor jules marcou49 according to our views a considerable amount of geographical change must have occurred at the change from the miocene to the pliocene favouring the refrigeration of the northern hemisphere and leading in the way already pointed out to the glacial epoch whenever a high degree of excentricity 123 prevailed as many reasons combine to make us fix the height of the glacial epoch at the period of high excentricity which occurred 200000 years back and as the pliocene period was probably not of long duration we must suppose the next great phase of very high excentricity 850000 years ago to fall within the miocene epoch dr croll believes that this must have produced a glacial period but we have shown strong reasons for believing that in concurrence with favourable geographical conditions it led to uninterrupted warm climates in the temperate and northern zones this however did not prevent the occurrence of local glaciation wherever other conditions led to its initiation and the most powerful of such conditions is a great extent of high land now we know that the alps acquired a considerable part of their elevation during the latter part of the miocene period since miocene rocks occur at an elevation of over 6000 feet while eocene beds occur at nearly 10000 feet but since that time there has been a vast amount of denudation so that these rocks may have been at first raised much higher than we now find them and thus a considerable portion of the alps may have been more elevated than they are now this would certainly lead to an enormous accumulation of snow which would be increased when the excentricity reached a maximum as already fully explained and may then have caused glaciers to descend into the adjacent sea carrying those enormous masses of rock which are buried in the upper miocene of the superga in northern italy an earlier epoch of great altitude in the alps coinciding with the very high excentricity 2500000 years ago may have caused the local glaciation of the middle eocene period when the enormous erratics of the flysch conglomerate were deposited in the inland seas of northern switzerland the carpathians and the apennines this is quite in harmony with the indications of an uninterrupted warm climate and rich vegetation during the very same period in the adjacent low countries just as we find at the present day in new zealand a delightful climate and a rich vegetation of metrosideros 124 fuchsias and treeferns on the very borders of huge glaciers descending to within 700 feet of the sealevel it is not pretended that these estimates of geological time have any more value than probable guesses but it is certainly a curious coincidence that two remarkable periods of high excentricity should have occurred at such periods and at such intervals apart as very well accord with the comparative remoteness of the two deposits in which undoubted signs of iceaction have been found and that both these are localised in the vicinity of mountains which are known to have acquired a considerable elevation at about the same period of time  in the tenth edition of the principles of geology sir charles lyell taking the amount of change in the species of mollusca as a guide estimated the time elapsed since the commencement of the miocene as onethird that of the whole tertiary epoch and the latter at onefourth that of geological time since the cambrian period professor dana on the other hand estimates the tertiary as only onefifteenth of the mesozoic and palæozoic combined on the estimate above given founded on the dates of phases of high excentricity we shall arrive at about four million years for the tertiary epoch and sixteen million years for the time elapsed since the cambrian according to lyell or sixty millions according to dana the estimate arrived at from the rate of denudation and deposition twentyeight million years is nearly midway between these and it is at all events satisfactory that the various measures result in figures of the same order of magnitude which is all one can expect when discussing so difficult and exceedingly speculative a subject  the only value of such estimates is to define our notions of geological time and to show that the enormous periods of hundreds of millions of years which have sometimes been indicated by geologists are neither necessary nor warranted by the facts at our command while the present result places us more in harmony with the calculations of physicists by leaving a very wide margin between geological time as defined by the fossiliferous rocks and that 125 far more extensive period which includes all possibility of life upon the earth  concluding remarksin the present chapter i have endeavoured to show that combining the measured rate of denudation with the estimated thickness and probable extent of the known series of sedimentary rocks we may arrive at a rude estimate of the time occupied in the formation of those rocks from another point of departurethat of the probable date of the miocene period as determined by the epoch of high excentricity supposed to have aided in the production of the alpine glaciation during that period and taking the estimate of geologists as to the proportionate amount of change in the animal world since that epochwe obtain another estimate of the duration of geological time which though founded on far less secure data agrees pretty nearly with the former estimate the time thus arrived at is immensely less than the usual estimates of geologists and is so far within the limits of the duration of the earth as calculated by sir william thomson as to allow for the development of the lower organisms an amount of time anterior to the cambrian period several times greater than has elapsed between that period and the present day i have further shown that in the continued mutations of climate produced by high excentricity and opposite phases of precession even though these did not lead to glacial epochs we have a motive power well calculated to produce far more rapid organic changes than have hitherto been thought possible while in the enormous amount of specific variation as demonstrated in an earlier chapter we have ample material for that power to act upon so as to keep the organic world in a state of rapid change and development proportioned to the comparatively rapid changes in the earths surface    we have now finished the series of preliminary studies of the biological conditions and physical changes which have affected the modification and dispersal of organisms and have thus brought about their actual distribution on 126 the surface of the earth these studies will it is believed place us in a condition to solve most of the problems presented by the distribution of animals and plants whenever the necessary facts both as to their distribution and their affinities are sufficiently well known and we now proceed to apply the principles we have established to the interpretation of the phenomena presented by some of the more important and best known of the islands of our globe limiting ourselves to these for reasons which have been already sufficiently explained in our preface                                        part ii  insular faunas and floras  241  chapter xi  the classification of islands      importance of islands in the study of the distribution of     organismsclassification of islands with reference to     distributioncontinental islandsoceanic islands  in the preceding chapters forming the first part of our work we have discussed more or less fully the general features presented by animal distribution as well as the various physical and biological changes which have been the most important agents in bringing about the present condition of the organic world  we now proceed to apply these principles to the solution of the numerous problems presented by the distribution of animals and in order to limit the field of our inquiry and at the same time to deal only with such facts as may be rendered intelligible and interesting to those readers who have not much acquaintance with the details of natural history we propose to consider only such phenomena as are presented by the islands of the globe  importance of islands in the study of the distribution of organismsislands possess many advantages for the study of the laws and phenomena of distribution as compared with continents they have a restricted area and definite boundaries and in most cases their geographical and biological limits coincide the number of species and of genera they contain is always much smaller than in the 242 case of continents and their peculiar species and groups are usually well defined and strictly limited in range again their relations with other lands are often direct and simple and even when more complex are far easier to comprehend than those of continents and they exhibit besides certain influences on the forms of life and certain peculiarities in their distribution which continents do not present and whose study offers many points of interest  in islands we have the facts of distribution presented to us sometimes in their simplest forms in other cases becoming gradually more and more complex and we are therefore able to proceed step by step in the solution of the problems they present but as in studying these problems we have necessarily to take into account the relations of the insular and continental faunas we also get some knowledge of the latter and acquire besides so much command over the general principles which underlie all problems of distribution that it is not too much to say that when we have mastered the difficulties presented by the peculiarities of island life we shall find it comparatively easy to deal with the more complex and less clearly defined problems of continental distribution  classification of islands with reference to distributionislands have had two distinct modes of originthey have either been separated from continents of which they are but detached fragments or they have originated in the ocean and have never formed part of a continent or any large mass of land this difference of origin is fundamental and leads to a most important difference in their animal inhabitants and we may therefore first distinguish the two classesoceanic and continental islands  mr darwin appears to have been the first writer who called attention to the number and importance both from a geological and biological point of view of oceanic islands he showed that with very few exceptions all the remoter islands of the great oceans were of volcanic or coralline formation and that none of them contained indigenous mammalia or amphibia he also showed the connection of these two phenomena and maintained that none of the islands so characterised had ever formed 243 part of a continent this was quite opposed to the opinions of the scientific men of the day who almost all held the idea of continental extensions and of oceanic islands being their fragments and it was long before mr darwins views obtained general acceptance even now the belief still lingers and we continually hear of old atlantic or pacific continents of atlantis or lemuria of which hypothetical lands many existing islands although wholly volcanic are thought to be the remnants we have already seen that darwin connected the peculiar geological structure of oceanic islands with the permanence of the great oceans which contain them and we have shown that several distinct lines of evidence all point to the same conclusion we may therefore define oceanic islands as followsislands of volcanic or coralline formation usually far from continents and always separated from them by very deep sea entirely without indigenous land mammalia or amphibia but with a fair number of birds and insects and usually with some reptiles this definition will exclude only two islands which have been sometimes classed as oceanicnew zealand and the seychelles rodriguez which was once thought to be another exception has been shown by the explorations during the transit of venus expedition to be essentially volcanic with some upraised coralline limestone  continental islandscontinental islands are always more varied in their geological formation containing both ancient and recent stratified rocks they are rarely very remote from a continent and they always contain some land mammals and amphibia as well as representatives of the other classes and orders in considerable variety they may however be divided into two wellmarked groupsancient and recent continental islandsthe characters of which may be easily defined  recent continental islands are always situated on submerged banks connecting them with a continent and the depth of the intervening sea rarely exceeds 100 fathoms they resemble the continent in their geological structure while their animal and vegetable productions are either almost identical with those of the continent or if 244 otherwise the difference consists in the presence of closely allied species of the same types with occasionally a very few peculiar genera they possess in fact all the characteristics of a portion of the continent separated from it at a recent geological period  ancient continental islands differ greatly from the preceding in many respects they are not united to the adjacent continent by a shallow bank but are usually separated from it by a depth of sea of several hundreds to more than a thousand fathoms in geological structure they agree generally with the more recent islands like them they possess mammalia and amphibia usually in considerable abundance as well as all other classes of animals but these are highly peculiar almost all being distinct species and many forming distinct and peculiar genera or families they are also well characterised by the fragmentary nature of their fauna many of the most characteristic continental orders or families being quite unrepresented while some of their animals are allied not to such forms as inhabit the adjacent continent but to others found only in remote parts of the world this very remarkable set of characters marks off the islands which exhibit them as a distinct class which often present the greatest anomalies and most difficult problems to the student of distribution  oceanic islandsthe total absence of warmblooded terrestrial animals in an island otherwise well suited to maintain them is held to prove that such island is no mere fragment of any existing or submerged continent but one that has been actually produced in midocean it is true that if a continental island were to be completely submerged for a single day and then again elevated its higher terrestrial animals would be all destroyed and if it were situated at a considerable distance from land it would be reduced to the same zoological condition as an oceanic island but such a complete submergence and reelevation appears never to have taken place for there is no single island on the globe which has the physical and geological features of a continental combined with the zoological features of an oceanic island it is true that some of the coralislands may be formed upon submerged lands 245 of a continental character but we have no proof of this and even if it were so the existing islands are to all intents and purposes oceanic  we will now pass on to a consideration of some of the more interesting examples of these three classes beginning with oceanic islands  all the animals which now inhabit such oceanic islands must either themselves have reached them by crossing the ocean or be the descendants of ancestors who did so let us then see what are in fact the animal and vegetable inhabitants of these islands and how far their presence can be accounted for we will begin with the azores or western islands because they have been thoroughly well explored by naturalists and in their peculiarities afford us an important clue to some of the most efficient means of distribution among several classes of animals                                        246  chapter xii  oceanic islandsthe azores and bermuda  the azores or western islands      position and physical featureschief

we will commence our investigation into the phenomena presented by oceanic islands with two groups of the north atlantic in which the facts are of a comparatively simple nature and such as to afford us a valuable clue to a solution of the more difficult problems we shall have to deal with further on the azores and bermuda offer great contrasts in physical features but striking similarities in geographical position the one is volcanic the other coralline but both are surrounded by a wide expanse of ocean of enormous depth the one being about as far from europe as the other is from america both are situated in the 247 temperate zone and they differ less than six degrees in latitude yet the vegetation of the one is wholly temperate while that of the other is almost tropical the productions of the one are related to europe as those of the other are to america but they present instructive differences and both afford evidence of the highest value as to the means of dispersal of various groups of organisms across a wide expanse of ocean  the azores or western islands  these islands nine in number form a widely scattered group situated between 37° and 39° 40 n lat and stretching in a southeast and northwest direction over a distance of nearly 400 miles the largest of the islands san miguel is about forty miles long and is one of the nearest to europe being rather under 900 miles from the coast of portugal from which it is separated by an ocean 2500 fathoms deep the depth between the islands does not seem to be known but the 1000 fathom line encloses the whole group pretty closely while a depth of about 1800 fathoms is reached within 300 miles in all directions these great depths render it in the highest degree improbable that the azores have ever been united with the european continent while their being wholly volcanic is equally opposed to the view of their having formed part of an extensive atlantis including madeira and the canaries the only exception to their volcanic structure is the occurrence in one small island only santa maria of some marine deposits of upper miocene agea fact which proves some alterations of level and perhaps a greater extension of this island at some former period but in no way indicates a former union of the islands or any greater extension of the whole group it proves however that the group is of considerable antiquity since it must date back to miocene times and this fact may be of importance in considering the origin and peculiar features of the fauna and flora it thus appears that in all physical features the azores correspond strictly with our physical definition of oceanic islands while their great distance 248 from any other land and the depth of the ocean around them make them typical examples of the class we should therefore expect them to be equally typical in their fauna and flora and this is the case as regards the most important characteristics although in some points of detail they present exceptional phenomena  illustration outline map of the azores    note   the light tint shows where the sea is less than 1000 fathoms deep   the dark tint                      more than 1000 fathoms deep   the figures show depths in fathoms  chief zoological features of the azores50the great feature of oceanic islandsthe absence of all indigenous landmammalia and amphibiais well shown in this 249 group and it is even carried further so as to include all terrestrial vertebrata there being no snake lizard frog or freshwater fish although the islands are sufficiently extensive possess a mild and equable climate and are in every way adapted to support all these groups on the other hand flying creatures as birds and insects are abundant and there is also one flying mammala small european bat it is true that rabbits weasels rats and mice and a small lizard peculiar to madeira and teneriffe are now found wild in the azores but there is good reason to believe that these have all been introduced by human agency the same may be said of the goldfish and eels now found in some of the lakes there being not a single freshwater fish which is truly indigenous to the islands when we consider that the nearest part of the group is about 900 miles from portugal and more than 550 miles from madeira it is not surprising that none of these terrestrial animals can have passed over such a wide expanse of ocean unassisted by man  let us now see what animals are believed to have reached the group by natural means and thus constitute its indigenous fauna these consist of birds insects and landshells each of which must be considered separately  birdsfiftythree species of birds have been observed at the azores but the larger proportion thirtyone are either aquatic or wadersbirds of great powers of flight whose presence in the remotest islands is by no means remarkable of these two groups twenty are residents breeding in the islands while eleven are stragglers only visiting the islands occasionally and all are common european species the landbirds twentytwo in number are more interesting four only being stragglers while eighteen are permanent residents the following is a list of these resident landbirds     1 common buzzard            buteo vulgaris    2 longeared owl            asio otus    3 barn owl                  strix flammea    4 blackbird

        saxicola oenanthe    9 grey wagtail              motacilla sulphurea   10 atlantic chaffinch        fringilla tintillon   11 azorean bullfinch         pyrrhula murina   12 canary                    serinus canarius   13 common starling           sturnus vulgaris   14 lesser spotted woodpecker dryobates minor   15 woodpigeon               columba palumbus   16 rock dove                 columba livia   17 redlegged partridge      caccabis rufa   18 common quail              coturnix communis  all the abovenamed birds are common in europe and north africa except threethe atlantic chaffinch and the canary which inhabit madeira and the canary islands and the azorean bullfinch which is peculiar to the islands we are considering  origin of the azorean birdfaunathe questions we have now before us arehow did these eighteen species of birds first reach the azores and how are we to explain the presence of a single peculiar species while all the rest are identical with european birds in order to answer them let us first see what stragglers now actually visit the azores from the nearest continents the four species given in mr godmans list are the kestrel the oriole the snowbunting and the hoopoe but he also tells us that there are certainly others and adds scarcely a storm occurs in spring or autumn without bringing one or more species foreign to the islands and i have frequently been told that swallows larks grebes and other species not referred to here are not uncommonly seen at those seasons of the year  we have therefore every reason to believe that the birds which are now residents originated as stragglers which occasionally found a haven in these remote islands when driven out to sea by storms some of them no doubt still often arrive from the continent but these cannot easily be distinguished as new arrivals among those which are permanent inhabitants many facts mentioned by mr godman show that this is the case a barnowl much exhausted flew on board a whalingship when 500 miles sw of the azores and even if it had come from 251 madeira it must have travelled quite as far as from portugal to the islands mr godman also shot a single specimen of the wheatear in flores after a strong gale of wind and as no one on the island knew the bird it was almost certainly a recent arrival subsequently a few were found breeding in the old crater of corvo a small adjacent island and as the species is not found in any other island of the group we may infer that this bird is a recent immigrant in process of establishing itself  another fact which is almost conclusive in favour of the birdpopulation having arrived as stragglers is that they are most abundant in the islands nearest to europe and africa the azores consist of three divisionsan eastern consisting of two islands st michaels and st marys a central of five terceira graciosa st georges pico and fayal and a western of two flores and corvo now had the whole group once been united to the continent or even formed parts of one extensive atlantic island we should certainly expect the central group which is more compact and has a much larger area than all the rest to have the greatest number and variety of birds but the fact that birds are most numerous in the eastern group and diminish as we go westward is entirely opposed to this theory while it is strictly in accordance with the view that they are all stragglers from europe africa or the other atlantic islands omitting oceanic wanderers and including all birds which have probably arrived involuntarily the numbers are found to be forty species in the eastern group thirtysix in the central and twentynine in the western  to account for the presence of one peculiar speciesthe bullfinch which however does not differ from the common european bullfinch more than do some of the varieties of north american birds from their typespecies is not difficult the wonder rather being that there are not more peculiar forms in our third chapter we have seen how great is the amount of individual variation in birds and how readily local varieties become established wherever the physical conditions are sufficiently distinct now we can hardly have a greater difference of conditions 252 than between the continent of europe or north africa and a group of rocky islands in midatlantic situated in the full course of the gulf stream and with an excessively mild though stormy climate we have every reason to believe that special modifications would soon become established in any animals completely isolated under such conditions but they are not as a rule thus completely isolated because as we have seen stragglers arrive at short intervals and these mixing with the residents keep up the purity of the breed it follows that only those species which reach the azores at very remote intervals will be likely to acquire wellmarked distinctive characters and this appears to have happened with the bullfinch alone a bird which does not migrate and is therefore less likely to be blown out to sea more especially as it inhabits woody districts a few other azorean birds however exhibit slight differences from their european allies  there is another reason for the very slight amount of peculiarity presented by the fauna of the azores as compared with many other oceanic islands dependent on its comparatively recent origin the islands themselves may be of considerable antiquity since a few small deposits believed to be of miocene age have been found on them but there can be little doubt that their present fauna at all events as concerns the birds had its origin since the date of the last glacial epoch even now icebergs reach the latitude of the azores but a little to the west of them and when we consider the proofs of extensive iceaction in north america and europe we can hardly doubt that these islands were at that time surrounded with packice while their own mountains reaching 7600 feet high in pico would almost certainly have been covered with perpetual snow and have sent down glaciers to the sea they might then have had a climate almost as bad as that now endured by the prince edward islands in the southern hemisphere nearly ten degrees farther from the equator where there are no landbirds whatever although the distance from africa is not much greater than that of the azores from europe while the vegetation is limited to a few alpine plants and mosses this recent origin of the 253 birds accounts in a great measure for their identity with those of europe because whatever change has occurred must have been effected in the islands themselves and in a time limited to that which has elapsed since the glacial epoch passed away  insects of the azoreshaving thus found no difficulty in accounting for the peculiarities presented by the birds of these islands we have only to see how far the same general principles will apply to the insects and landshells the butterflies moths and hymenoptera are few in number and almost all seem to be common european species whose presence is explained by the same causes as those which have introduced the birds beetles however are more numerous and have been better studied and these present some features of interest the total number of species yet known is 212 of which 175 are european but out of these 101 are believed to have been introduced by human agency leaving seventyfour really indigenous twentythree of these indigenous species are not found in any of the other atlantic islands showing that they have been introduced directly from europe by causes which have acted more powerfully here than farther south besides these there are thirtysix species not found in europe of which nineteen are natives of madeira or the canaries three are american and fourteen are altogether peculiar to the azores these latter are mostly allied to species found in europe or in the other atlantic islands while one is allied to an american species and two are so distinct as to constitute new genera the following list of these peculiar species will be interesting    carabidÆ    anchomenus aptinoides     allied to a species from the canaries   bembidium hesperus        allied to the european b lætum    dytiscidÆ    agabus godmanni           allied to the european a dispar    colydiidÆ    tarphius wollastoni       a genus almost peculiar to the atlantic                               islands   254    elateridÆ    heteroderes azoricus      allied to a brazilian species   elastrus dolosus          belongs to a peculiar madagascar genus    melyridÆ    attalus miniaticollis     allied to a canarian species    rhyncophora    phlæophagus variabilis    allied to european and atlantic species   acalles droueti           a mediterranean and atlantic genus   laparocerus azoricus      allied to madeiran species   asynonychun godmansi      a peculiar genus allied to brachyderes of                               the south of europe   neocnemis occidentalis    a peculiar genus allied to the european                               genus strophosomus    heteromera    helops azoricus           allied to h vulcanus of madeira    staphylinidÆ    xenomma melanocephala     allied to x filiforme from the canaries  this greater amount of speciality in the beetles than in the birds may be due to two causes in the first place many of these small insects have no doubt survived the glacial epoch and may in that case represent very ancient forms which have become extinct in their native country and in the second place insects have many more chances of reaching remote islands than birds for not only may they be carried by gales of wind but sometimes in the egg or larva state or even as perfect insects they may be drifted safely for weeks over the ocean buried in the light stems of plants or in the solid wood of trees in which many of them undergo their transformations thus we may explain the presence of three common south american species two elaters and a longicorn all woodeaters and therefore liable to be occasionally brought in floating timber by the gulf stream but insects are also immensely more numerous in species than are landbirds and their transmission would be in most cases quite involuntary and not dependent on their own powers of flight as with birds and thus the chances against the same species being frequently carried to the same island would be considerable if we add to this the dependence of so 255 many insects on local conditions of climate and vegetation and their liability to be destroyed by insectivorous birds we shall see that although there may be a greater probability of insects as a whole reaching the islands the chance against any particular species arriving there or against the same species arriving frequently is much greater than in the case of birds the result is that as compared with britain for example the birds are proportionately much more numerous than the beetles while the peculiar species of beetles are much more numerous than among birds both facts being quite in accordance with what we know of the habits of the two groups we may also remark that the small size and obscure characters of many of the beetles renders it probable that species now supposed to be peculiar really inhabit some parts of europe or north africa  it is interesting to note that the two families which are preeminently wood root or seed eaters are those which present the greatest amount of speciality the two elateridæ alone exhibit remote affinities the one with a brazilian the other with a madagascar group while the only peculiar genera belong to the rhyncophora but are allied to european forms these last almost certainly form a portion of the more ancient fauna of the islands which migrated to them in preglacial times while the brazilian elater appears to be the solitary example of a living insect brought by the gulf stream to these remote shores the elater having its nearest living ally in madagascar elastrus dolosus cannot be held to indicate any independent communication between these distant islands but is more probably a relic of a once more widespread type which has only been able to maintain itself in these localities mr crotch states that there are some species of beetles common to madagascar and the canary islands while there are several genera common to madagascar and south america and some to madagascar and australia the clue to these apparent anomalies is found in other genera being common to madagascar africa and south america while others are asiatic or australian madagascar in fact has insect relations with every part of 256 the globe and the only rational explanation of such facts is that they are indications of very ancient and once widespread groups maintaining themselves only in a few widely separated portions of what was at one time or another the area of their distribution  landshells of the azoreslike the insects and birds the landshells of these islands have a generally european aspect but with a larger proportion of peculiar species this was to be expected because the means by which molluscs are carried over the sea are far less numerous and varied than in the case of insects51 and we may therefore conclude that their introduction is a very rare event and that a species once arrived remains for long periods undisturbed by new arrivals and is therefore more likely to become modified by the new conditions and then fixed as a distinct type out of the sixtynine known species thirtyseven are common to europe or the other atlantic islands while thirtytwo are peculiar though almost all are distinctly allied to european types the majority of these shells especially the peculiar forms are very small and many of them may date back to beyond the glacial epoch the eggs of these would be exceedingly minute and might occasionally be carried on leaves or other materials during gales of exceptional violence and duration while others might be conveyed with the earth that often sticks to the feet of birds there are also probably other unknown means of conveyance but however this may be the general character of the landmolluscs is such as to confirm the conclusions we have arrived at from a study of the birds and insectsthat these islands have never been connected with a continent and have been peopled with living things by such forms only as in some way or other have been able to reach them across many hundred miles of ocean  the flora of the azoresthe floweringplants of the azores have been studied by one of our first botanists mr h c watson who has himself visited the islands and made extensive collections and he has given a complete catalogue of the species in mr godmans volume as our 257 object in the present work is to trace the past history of the more important islands by means of the forms of life that inhabit them and as for this purpose plants are sometimes of more value than any class of animals it will be well to take advantage of the valuable materials here available in order to ascertain how far the evidence derived from the two organic kingdoms agrees in character and also to obtain some general results which may be of service in our discussion of more difficult and more complex problems  there are in the azores 480 known species of floweringplants and ferns of which no less than 440 are found also in europe madeira or the canary islands while forty are peculiar to the azores but are more or less closely allied to european species as botanists are no less prone than zoologists to invoke former landconnections and continental extensions to account for the wide dispersal of objects of their study it will be well to examine somewhat closely what these facts really imply  the dispersal of seedsthe seeds of plants are liable to be dispersed by a greater variety of agents than any other organisms while their tenacity of life under varying conditions of heat and cold drought and moisture is also exceptionally great they have also an advantage in that the great majority of flowering plants have the sexes united in the same individual so that a single seed in a state fit to germinate may easily stock a whole island the dispersal of seeds has been studied by sir joseph hooker mr darwin and many other writers who have made it sufficiently clear that they are in many cases liable to be carried enormous distances an immense number are specially adapted to be carried by the wind through the possession of down or hairs or membranous wings or processes while others are so minute and produced in such profusion that it is difficult to place a limit to the distance they might be carried by gales of wind or hurricanes another class of somewhat heavier seeds or dry fruits are capable of being exposed for a long time to seawater without injury mr darwin made many experiments on this point and he found that many seeds especially of atriplex 258 beta oats capsicum and the potato grew after 100 days immersion while a large number survived fifty days but he also found that most of them sink after a few days immersion and this would certainly prevent them being floated to very great distances it is very possible however that dried branches or flowerheads containing seeds would float longer while it is quite certain that many tropical seeds do float for enormous distances as witness the double cocoanuts which cross the indian ocean from the seychelle islands to the coast of sumatra and the west indian beans which frequently reach the west coast of scotland there is therefore ample evidence of the possibility of seeds being conveyed across the sea for great distances by winds and surface currents52  birds as seedcarriersthe great variety of fruits that are eaten by birds afford a means of plantdispersal in the fact that seeds often pass through the bodies of birds in a state wellfitted for germination and such seeds may occasionally be carried long distances by this means of the twentytwo landbirds found in the azores half are more or less fruiteaters and these may have been the means of introducing many plants into the islands  birds also frequently have small portions of earth on their feet and mr darwin has shown by actual experiment that almost all such earth contains seeds thus in 259 nine grains of earth on the leg of a woodcock a seed of the toadrush was found which germinated while a wounded redlegged partridge had a ball of earth weighing six and a half ounces adhering to its leg and from this earth mr darwin raised no less than eightytwo separate plants of about five distinct species still more remarkable was the experiment with six and threequarter ounces of mud from the edge of a little pond which carefully treated under glass produced 537 distinct plants this is equal to a seed for every six grains of mud and when we consider how many birds frequent the edges of ponds in search of food or come there to drink it is evident that great numbers of seeds may be dispersed by this means  many seeds have hispid awns hooks or prickles which readily attach them to the feathers of birds and a great number of aquatic birds nest inland on the ground and as these are preeminently wanderers they must often aid in the dispersal of such plants53  260  facilities for dispersal of azorean plantsnow in the course of very long periods of time the various causes here enumerated would be sufficient to stock the remotest islands with vegetation and a considerable part of the azorean flora appears well adapted to be so conveyed of the 439 floweringplants in mr watsons list i find that about fortyfive belong to genera that have either pappus or winged seeds sixtyfive to such as have very minute seeds thirty have fleshy fruits such as are greedily eaten by birds several have hispid seeds and eightyfour are glumaceous plants which are all probably welladapted for being carried partly by winds and partly by currents as well as by some of the other causes mentioned on the other hand we have a very suggestive fact in the absence from the azores of most of the trees and shrubs with large and heavy fruits however common they may be in europe such are oaks chestnuts hazels apples beeches alders and firs while the only trees or large shrubs are the portugal laurel myrtle laurestinus elder laurus canariensis myrica faya and a doubtfully peculiar juniperall small berrybearers and therefore likely to have been conveyed by one or other of the modes suggested above  there can be little doubt that the truly indigenous flora of the islands is far more scanty than the number of plants recorded would imply because a large but unknown proportion of the species are certainly importations voluntary or involuntary by man as however the general character of the whole flora is that of the southwestern peninsula of europe and as most of the introduced plants have come from the same country it is almost impossible now to separate them and mr watson has not attempted to do so the whole flora contains representatives of eighty natural orders and 250 genera and even if we suppose that onehalf the species only are truly indigenous 261 there will still remain a wonderfully rich and varied flora to have been carried by the various natural means above indicated over 900 miles of ocean more especially as the large proportion of species identical with those of europe shows that their introduction has been comparatively recent and that it is probably as in the case of the birds still going on we may therefore feel sure that we have here by no means reached the limit of distance to which plants can be conveyed by natural means across the ocean and this conclusion will be of great value to us in investigating other cases where the evidence at our command is less complete and the indications of origin more obscure or conflicting  of the forty species which are considered to be peculiar to the islands all are allied to european plants except six whose nearest affinities are in the canaries or madeira two of the compositæ are considered to be distinct genera but in this order generic divisions rest on slight technical distinctions and the campanula vidalii is very distinct from any other known species with these exceptions most of the peculiar azorean species are closely allied to european plants and are in several cases little more than varieties of them while therefore we may believe that the larger part of the existing flora reached the islands since the glacial epoch a portion of it may be more ancient as there is no doubt that a majority of the species could withstand some lowering of temperature while in such a warm latitude and surrounded with sea there would always be many sunny and sheltered spots in which even tender plants might flourish  important deduction from the peculiarities of the azorean fauna and florathere is one conclusion to be drawn from the almost wholly european character of the azorean fauna and flora which deserves special attention namely that the peopling of remote islands is not due so much to ordinary or normal as to extraordinary and exceptional causes these islands lie in the course of the southwesterly return trades and also of the gulf stream and we should therefore naturally expect that american birds insects and plants would preponderate if they were 262 conveyed by the regular winds and currents which are both such as to prevent european species from reaching the islands but the violent storms to which the azores are liable blow from all points of the compass and it is evidently to these combined with the greater proximity and more favourable situation of the coasts of europe and north africa that the presence of a fauna and flora so decidedly european is to be traced    the other north atlantic islandsmadeira the canaries and the cape de verdespresent analogous phenomena to those of the azores but with some peculiarities dependent on their more southern position their richer vegetation and perhaps their greater antiquity these have been sufficiently discussed in my geographical distribution of animals vol i pp 208215 and as we are now dealing with what may be termed typical examples of oceanic islands for the purpose of illustrating the laws and solving the problems presented by the dispersal of animals we will pass on to other cases which have been less fully discussed in that work  bermuda  the bermudas are a small group of low islands formed of coral and blown coralsand consolidated into rock they are situated in 32° n lat about 700 miles from north carolina and somewhat farther from the bahama islands and are thus rather more favourably placed for receiving immigrants from america and its islands than the azores are with respect to europe there are about 100 islands and islets in all but their total area does not exceed fifty square miles they are surrounded by reefs some at a distance of thirty miles from the main group and the discovery of a layer of earth with remains of cedartrees fortyeight feet below the present highwater mark shows that the islands have once been more extensive and probably included the whole area now occupied by shoals and reefs54 immediately beyond these reefs 263 however extends a very deep ocean while about 450 miles distant in a southeast direction the deepest part of the north atlantic is reached where soundings of 3825 and 3875 fathoms have been obtained it is clear therefore that these islands are typically oceanic  illustration map of bermuda and the american coast    notethe light tint indicates sea less than 1000 fathoms deep          the dark tint            more than 1000 fathoms deep          the figures show the depth in fathoms  soundings were taken by the challenger in four 264 different directions around bermuda and always showed a rapid deepening of the sea to about 2500 fathoms this was so remarkable that in his reports to the admiralty captain nares spoke of bermuda as a solitary peak rising abruptly from a base only 120 miles in diameter and in another place as an isolated peak rising abruptly from a very small base these expressions show that bermuda is looked upon as a typical example of an oceanic peak and on examining the series of official reports of the challenger soundings i can find no similar case although some coasts both of continents and islands descend more abruptly in order to show therefore what is the real character of this peak i have drawn a section of it on a true scale from the soundings taken in a north and south direction where the descent is steepest it will be seen that the slope is on both sides very easy being 1 in 16 on the south and 1 in 19 on the north the portion nearest the islands will slope more rapidly perhaps reaching in places 1 in 10 but even this is not steeper than many country roads in hilly countries while the remainder would be a hardly perceptible slope although generally very low some parts of these islands rise to 250 feet above the sealevel consisting of various kinds of limestone rock sometimes soft and friable but often very hard and even crystalline it consists of beds which sometimes dip as much as 30° and which also show great contortions so that at first sight the islands appear to exhibit on a small scale the phenomena of a disturbed palæozoic district it has however long been known that these rocks are all due to the wind 265 which blows up the fine calcareous sand the product of the disintegration of coral shells serpulæ and other organisms forming sandhills forty and fifty feet high which move gradually along overwhelming the lower tracts of land behind them these are consolidated by the percolation of rainwater which dissolves some of the lime from the more porous tracts and deposits it lower down filling every fissure with stalagmite  illustration section of bermuda and adjacent sea bottom  the figures show the depth in fathoms at fiftyfive miles north and fortysix miles south of the islands respectively  the red clay of bermudabesides the calcareous rocks there is found in many parts of the islands a layer of red earth or clay containing about thirty per cent of oxide of iron this very closely resembles both in colour and chemical composition the red clay of the ocean floor found widely spread in the atlantic at depths of from 2300 to 3150 fathoms and occurring abundantly all round bermuda it appears therefore at first sight as if the ocean bed itself has been here raised to the surface and a portion of its covering of red clay preserved and this is the view adopted by mr jones in his paper on the botany of bermuda he says after giving the analysis this analysis tends to convince us that the deep chocolatecoloured red clay of the islands found in the lower levels and from highwater mark some distance into the sea originally came from the ocean floor and that when by volcanic agency the bermuda column was raised from the depths of the sea its summit most probably broken in outline appeared above the surface covered with this red mud which in the course of ages has but slightly changed its composition and yet possesses sufficient evidence to prove its identity with that now lying contiguous to the base of the bermuda column but in his guide to bermuda mr jones tells us that this same red earth has been found two feet thick under coral rock at a depth of fortytwo feet below lowwater mark and that it rested on a bed of compact calcareous sandstone now it is quite certain that this calcareous sandstone was never formed at the bottom of the deep ocean 700 miles from land and the occurrence of the red earth at different levels upon coralline sand rock is therefore more probably due to some process of decomposition of the rock itself 266 or of the minute organisms which abound in the blown sand55  zoology of bermudaas might be expected from their extreme isolation these islands possess no indigenous terrestrial mammalia frogs or snakes56 there is however one lizard which professor cope considers to be distinct from any american species and which he has named plestiodon eumeces longirostris it is said to be most nearly allied to eumeces quinquelineatus of the southeastern states from which it differs in having nearly ten more rows of scales the tail thicker and the muzzle longer in colour it is ashy brown above greenish blue beneath with a white line blackmargined on the sides and it seems to be tolerably abundant in the islands this lizard is especially interesting as being the only vertebrate animal which exhibits any peculiarity  birdsnotwithstanding its small size low altitude and 267 remote position a great number of birds visit bermuda annually some in large numbers others only as accidental stragglers altogether over 180 species have been recorded rather more than half being wading and swimming birds whose presence is not so much to be wondered at as they are great wanderers while about eightyfive are land birds many of which would hardly be supposed capable of flying so great a distance of the 180 species however about thirty have only been seen once and a great many more are very rare but about twenty species of land birds are recorded as tolerably frequent visitors and nearly half these appear to come every year  there are only eleven species which are permanent residents on the islandeight land and three water birds and of these one has been almost certainly introduced these resident birds are as follows      1 galeoscoptes carolinensis the cat bird migrates along the east     coast of the united states      2 sialia sialis the blue bird migrates along the east coast      3 vireo novæboracensis the whiteeyed green tit migrates along     the east coast      4 passer domesticus the english sparrow  introduced      5 corvus americanus the american crow common over all north     america      6 cardinalis virginianus the cardinal bird migrates from     carolina southward      7 chamoepelia passerina the ground dove louisiana w indies     and mexico      8 ortyx virginianus the american quail new england to florida      9 ardea herodias the great blue heron all north america      10 gailinula galeata the florida gallinule temperate and     tropical north america      11 phäeton flavirostris the tropic bird  it will be seen that these are all very common north american birds and most of them are constant visitors from the mainland so that however long they may have inhabited the islands there has been no chance for them to have acquired any distinctive characters owing to the want of isolation  among the most regular visitants which are not resident are the common n american kingfisher ceryle alcyon 268 the nighthawk chordeiles virginianus the wood wagtail siurus novæboracensis the snowbunting plectrophanes nivalis and the wideranging ricebird dolichonyx oryzivora all very common and widespread in north america  comparison of the birdfaunas of bermuda and the azoresthe birdfauna of bermuda thus differs from that of the azores in the much smaller number of resident species and the presence of several regular migrants this is due first to the small area and little varied surface of these islands as well as to their limited flora and small supply of insects not affording conditions suitable for the residence of many species all the year round and secondly to the peculiarity of the climate of north america which causes a much larger number of its birds to be migratory than in europe the northern united states and canada with a sunny climate luxuriant vegetation and abundant insectlife during the summer supply food and shelter to an immense number of insectivorous and frugivorous birds so that during the breeding season canada is actually richer in birdlife than florida but as the severe winter comes on all these are obliged to migrate southward some to carolina georgia and florida others as far as the west indies mexico or even to guatemala and south america  every spring and autumn therefore a vast multitude of birds belonging to more than a hundred distinct species migrate northward or southward in eastern america a large proportion of these pass along the atlantic coast and it has been observed that many of them fly some distance out to sea passing straight across bays from headland to headland by the shortest route  now as the time of these migrations is the season of storms especially the autumnal one which nearly coincides with the hurricanes of the west indies and the northerly gales of the coast of america the migrating birds are very liable to be carried out to sea sometimes they may as mr jones suggests be carried up by local whirlwinds to a great height where meeting with a westerly or northwesterly gale they are rapidly driven seaward the great majority no doubt perish but some reach the bermudas 269 and form one of its most striking autumnal features in october mr jones tells us the sportsman enjoys more shooting than at any other time the violent revolving gales which occur almost weekly bring numbers of birds of many species from the american continent the different members of the duck tribe forming no inconsiderable portion of the whole while the canada goose and even the ponderous american swan have been seen amidst the migratory host with these come also such delicate birds as the american robin turdus migratorius the yellowrumped warbler dendroeca coronata the pine warbler dendroeca pinus the wood wagtail siurus novæboracensis the summer red bird pyranga æstiva the snowbunting plectrophanes nivalis the redpoll Ægiothus linarius the king bird tyrannus carolinensis and many others it is no doubt in consequence of this repeated immigration that none of the bermuda birds have acquired any special peculiarity constituting even a distinct variety for the few species that are resident and breed in the islands are continually crossed by individual immigrants of the same species from the mainland  four european birds also have occurred in bermudathe wheatear saxicola oenanthe which visits iceland and lapland and sometimes the northern united states the skylark alauda arvensis but this was probably an imported bird or an escape from some ship the landrail crex pratensis which also wanders to greenland and the united states and the common snipe scolopax gallinago which occurs not unfrequently in greenland but has not yet been noticed in north america it is however so like the american snipe s wilsoni that a straggler might easily be overlooked  two small bats of n american species also occasionally reach the island while two others from the west indies have more rarely occurred and these are the only wild mammalia except rats and mice  insects of bermudainsects appear to be very scarce but it is evident from the lists given by mr jones and more recently by professor heilprin that only the more conspicuous species have been yet collected these 270 comprise nineteen beetles eleven bees and wasps twentysix butterflies and moths nine flies and the same number of hemiptera orthoptera and neuroptera respectively all appear to be common north american or west indian species but until some competent entomological collector visits the islands it is impossible to say whether there are or are not any peculiar species57  land molluscathe landshells of the bermudas are somewhat more interesting as they appear to be the only group of animals except reptiles in which there are any peculiar species the following list was kindly furnished me by mr thomas bland of new york who has made a special study of the terrestrial molluscs of the west indian islands from which those of the bermudas have undoubtedly been derived the nomenclature has been corrected in accordance with the list given in professor heilprins work on the islands the species which are peculiar to the islands are

doubtfully identical with those of other countries we have thus about onefifth of the landshells peculiar while almost all the other productions of the islands are identical with those of the adjacent continent and islands this corresponds however with what occurs generally in islands at some distance from continents in the azores only one landbird is peculiar out of eighteen resident species the beetles show about oneeighth of the probably nonintroduced species as peculiar the plants about onetwentieth while the landshells have about half the species peculiar this difference is well explained by the much greater difficulty of transmission over wide seas in the case of landshells than of any other terrestrial organisms it thus happens that when a species has once been conveyed it may remain isolated for unknown ages and has time to become modified by local conditions unchecked by the introduction of other individuals of the original type  flora of bermudaunfortunately no good account of the plants of these islands has yet been published mr 272 jones in his paper on the vegetation of the bermudas gives a list of no less than 480 species of flowering plants but this number includes all the culinary plants fruittrees and garden flowers as well as all the ornamental trees and shrubs from various parts of the world which have been introduced mixed up with the european and american weeds that have come with agricultural or garden seeds and the really indigenous plants in one undistinguished series it appears too that the late governor majorgeneral lefroy has sown and distributed throughout the islands packets of seeds from kew representing no less than 600 species principally of trees and shrubs suited to sandy coast soilsso that it will be more than ever difficult in future years to distinguish the indigenous from the introduced vegetation  from the researches of dr rein and mr moseley there appear to be about 250 flowering plants in a wild state and of these mr moseley thinks less than half are indigenous the majority are tropical and west indian while others are common to the southern states of north america the former class having been largely brought by means of the gulf stream the latter by the agency of birds or by winds mr jones tells us that the currents bring numberless objects animate and inanimate from the carribean sea including the seeds of trees shrubs and other plants which are continually cast ashore and sometimes vegetate the soapberry tree sapindus saponaria has been actually observed to originate in this way  the only species of flowering plant peculiar to bermuda is carex bermudiana hemsley which is said to be allied to a species found only in st helena but there are some local forms of continental species among which are sisyrinchium bermudianum and a variety of rhus toxicodendron there are however two fernsan adiantum and a nephrodium which are unknown from any other locality the juniper which is so conspicuous a feature of the islands is said to be a west indian species juniperus barbadensis found in jamaica and the bahamas not the north american red 273 cedar but there seems to be still some doubt about this common plant  mr moseley who visited bermuda in the challenger has well explained the probable origin of the vegetation the large number of west indian plants is no doubt due to the gulf stream and constant surface drift of warm water in this direction while others have been brought by the annual cyclones which sweep over the intervening ocean the great number of american migratory birds including large flocks of the american golden plover with ducks and other aquatic species no doubt occasionally bring seeds either in the mud attached to their feet or in their stomachs59 as these causes are either constantly in action or recur annually it is not surprising that almost all the species should be unchanged owing to the frequent intercrossing of freshlyarrived specimens if a competent botanist were thoroughly to explore bermuda eliminate the species introduced by human agency and investigate the source from whence the others were derived and the mode by which they had reached so remote an island we should obtain important information as to the dispersal of plants which might afford us a clue to the solution of many difficult problems in their geographical distribution  concluding remarksthe two groups of islands we have now been considering furnish us with some most instructive facts as to the power of many groups of organisms to pass over from 700 to 900 miles of open sea there is no doubt whatever that all the indigenous species have thus reached these islands and in many cases the process may be seen going on from year to year we find that as regards birds migratory habits and the liability to be caught by violent storms are the conditions which determine the islandpopulation in both islands the landbirds are almost exclusively migrants and in both the nonmigratory groupswrens tits creepers and nuthatchesare absent while the number of annual visitors is greater in proportion as the migratory habits and prevalence of storms afford more efficient means for their introduction 274  we find also that these great distances do not prevent the immigration of some insects of most of the orders and especially of a considerable number and variety of beetles while even landshells are fairly represented in both islands the large proportion of peculiar species clearly indicating that as we might expect individuals of this group of organisms arrive only at long and irregular intervals  plants are represented by a considerable variety of orders and genera most of which show some special adaptation for dispersal by wind or water or through the medium of birds and there is no reason to doubt that besides the species that have actually established themselves many others must have reached the islands but were either not suited to the climate and other physical conditions or did not find the insects necessary to their fertilisation and were therefore unable to maintain themselves  if now we consider the extreme remoteness and isolation of these islands their small area and comparatively recent origin and that notwithstanding all these disadvantages they have acquired a very considerable and varied flora and fauna we shall i think be convinced that with a larger area and greater antiquity mere separation from a continent by many hundred miles of sea would not prevent a country from acquiring a very luxuriant and varied flora and a fauna also rich and peculiar as regards all classes except terrestrial mammals amphibia and some groups of reptiles this conclusion will be of great importance in those cases where the evidence as to the exact origin of the fauna and flora of an island is less clear and satisfactory than in the case of the azores and bermuda                                        275  chapter

which oceanic islands are peopledflora     of the galapagosorigin of the flora of the galapagosconcluding     remarks  the galapagos differ in many important respects from the islands we have examined in our last chapter and the differences are such as to have affected the whole character of their animal inhabitants like the azores they are volcanic but they are much more extensive the islands being both larger and more numerous while volcanic action has been so recent that a large portion of their surface consists of barren lavafields they are considerably less distant from a continent than either the azores or bermuda being about 600 miles from the west coast of south america and a little more than 700 from veragua with the small cocos islands intervening and they are situated on the equator instead of being in the north temperate zone they stand upon a deeply submerged bank the 1000 fathom line encircling all the more important islands at a few miles distance whence there appears to be a comparatively steep descent all round to the average depth of that portion of the pacific between 2000 and 3000 fathoms 276  illustration map of the galapagos and adjacent coasts of south america    the light tint shows where the sea is less than 1000 fathoms deep   the figures show the depth in fathoms  the whole group occupies a space of about 300 by 200 miles it consists of five large and twelve small islands the largest albemarle island being about eighty miles long and of very irregular shape while the four next in importancechatham indefatigable james and narborough islands are each about twentyfive or thirty miles 277 long and of a rounded or elongate form the whole are entirely volcanic and in the western islands there are numerous active volcanoes unlike the other groups of islands we have been considering these are situated in a comparatively calm sea where storms are of rare occurrence and even strong winds almost unknown they are traversed by ocean currents which are strong and constant flowing towards the northwest from the coast of peru 278 and these physical conditions have had a powerful influence on the animal and vegetable forms by which the islands are now inhabited the galapagos have also during three centuries been frequently visited by europeans and were long a favourite resort of buccaneers and traders who found an ample supply of food in the large tortoises which abound there and to these visits we may perhaps trace the introduction of some animals whose presence it is otherwise difficult to account for the vegetation is generally scanty but still amply sufficient for the support of a considerable amount of animal life as shown by the cattle horses asses goats pigs dogs and cats which now run wild in some of the islands  illustration map of the galapagos    the light tint shows a depth of less than 1000 fathoms   the figures show the depth in fathoms  absence of indigenous mammalia and amphibiaas in all other oceanic islands we find here no truly indigenous mammalia for though there is a mouse of the american genus hesperomys which differs somewhat from any known species we can hardly consider this to be indigenous first because these creatures have been little studied in south america and there may yet be many undescribed species and in the second place because even had it been introduced by some european or native vessel there is ample time in two or three hundred years for the very different conditions to have established a marked diversity in the characters of the species this is the more probable because there is also a true rat of the old world genus mus which is said to differ slightly from any known species and as this genus is not a native of the american continents we are sure that it must have been recently introduced into the galapagos there can be little doubt therefore that the islands are completely destitute of truly indigenous mammalia and frogs and toads the only tropical representatives of the amphibia are equally unknown  reptilesreptiles however which at first sight appear as unsuited as mammals to pass over a wide expanse of ocean abound in the galapagos though the species are not very numerous they consist of landtortoises lizards and snakes the tortoises consist of two peculiar species testudo microphyes found in most of the islands and t 279 abingdonii recently discovered on abingdon island as well as one extinct species t ephippium found on indefatigable island these are all of very large size like the gigantic tortoises of the mascarene islands from which however they differ in structural characters and dr günther believes that they have been originally derived from the american continent60 considering the well known tenacity of life of these animals and the large number of allied forms which have aquatic or subaquatic habits it is not a very extravagant supposition that some ancestral form carried out to sea by a flood was once or twice safely drifted as far as the galapagos and thus originated the races which now inhabit them  the lizards are five in number a peculiar species of gecko phyllodactylus galapagensis and four species of the american family iguanidæ two of these are distinct species of the genus tropidurus the other two being large and so very distinct as to be classed in peculiar genera one of these is aquatic and found in all the islands swimming in the sea at some distance from the shore and feeding on seaweed the other is terrestrial and is confined to the four central islands these last were originally described as amblyrhynchus cristatus by mr bell and a subcristatus by gray they were afterwards placed in two other genera trachycephalus and oreocephalus see brit mus catalogue of lizards while in a recent paper by dr steindachner the marine species is again classed as amblyrhynchus while the terrestrial form is placed in another genus conolophus both genera being peculiar to the galapagos  how these lizards reached the islands we cannot tell the fact that they all belong to american genera or families indicates their derivation from that continent while their being all distinct species is a proof that their arrival took place at a remote epoch under conditions perhaps somewhat different from any which now prevail it is certain that animals of this order have some means of crossing the sea not possessed by any other land vertebrates 280 since they are found in a considerable number of islands which possess no mammals nor any other land reptiles but what those means are has not yet been positively ascertained  it is unusual for oceanic islands to possess snakes and it is therefore somewhat of an anomaly that two species are found in the galapagos both are closely allied to south american forms and one is hardly different from a chilian snake so that they indicate a more recent origin than in the case of the lizards snakes it is known can survive a long time at sea since a living boaconstrictor once reached the island of st vincent from the coast of south america a distance of two hundred miles by the shortest route snakes often frequent trees and might thus be conveyed long distances if carried out to sea on a tree uprooted by a flood such as often occurs in tropical climates and especially during earthquakes to some such accident we may perhaps attribute the presence of these creatures in the galapagos and that it is a very rare one is indicated by the fact that only two species have as yet succeeded in obtaining a footing there  birdswe now come to the birds whose presence here may not seem so remarkable but which yet present features of interest not exceeded by any other group about seventy species of birds have now been obtained on these islands and of these fortyone are peculiar to them but all the species found elsewhere except one belong to the aquatic tribes or the waders which are preeminently wanderers yet even of these eight are peculiar the true landbirds are fortytwo in number and all but one are entirely confined to the galapagos while threefourths of them present such peculiarities that they are classed in distinct genera all are allied to birds inhabiting tropical america some very closely while onethe common american ricebird which ranges over the whole northern and part of the southern continentsis the only landbird identical with those of the mainland the following is a list of these landbirds taken from mr salvins memoir in the transactions of the zoological society for the year

                                 distinct  we have here every gradation of difference from perfect identity with the continental species to genera so distinct that it is difficult to determine with what forms they are most nearly allied and it is interesting to note that this diversity bears a distinct relation to the probabilities of and facilities for migration to the islands the excessively abundant ricebird which breeds in canada and swarms over the whole united states migrating to the west indies and south america visiting the distant bermudas almost every year and extending its range as far as paraguay is the only species of landbird which remains completely unchanged in the galapagos and we may therefore conclude that some stragglers of the migrating host reach the islands sufficiently often to keep up the purity of the breed next we have the almost cosmopolite shorteared owl asio brachyotus which ranges from china to ireland and from greenland to the straits of magellan and of this the galapagos bird is probably only one of the numerous varieties the little wood warbler dendroeca aureola is closely allied to a species which 283 ranges over the whole of north america and as far south as new grenada it has also been occasionally met with in bermuda an indication that it has considerable powers of flight and endurance the more distinct speciesas the tyrant flycatchers pyrocephalus and myiarchus the grounddove zenaida and the buzzard buteo are all allied to nonmigratory species peculiar to tropical america and of a more restricted range while the distinct genera are allied to south american groups of thrushes finches and sugarbirds which have usually restricted ranges and whose habits are such as not to render them likely to be carried out to sea the remote ancestral forms of these birds which owing to some exceptional causes reached the galapagos have thus remained uninfluenced by later migrations and have in consequence been developed into a variety of distinct types adapted to the peculiar conditions of existence under which they have been placed sometimes the different species thus formed are confined to one or two of the islands only as the three species of certhidea which are divided between the islands but do not appear ever to occur together nesomimus parvulus is confined to albemarle island and n trifasciatus to charles island cactornis pallida to indefatigable island c brevirostris to chatham island and c abingdoni to abingdon island  now all these phenomena are strictly consistent with the theory of the peopling of the islands by accidental migrations if we only allow them to have existed for a sufficiently long period and the fact that volcanic action has ceased on many of the islands as well as their great extent would certainly indicate a considerable antiquity  the great difference presented by the birds of these islands as compared with those of the equally remote azores and bermudas is sufficiently explained by the difference of climatal conditions at the galapagos there are none of those periodic storms gales and hurricanes which prevail in the north atlantic and which every year carry some straggling birds of europe or north america to the former islands while at the same time the majority of the tropical american birds are 284 nonmigratory and thus afford none of the opportunities presented by the countless hosts of migrants which pass annually northward and southward along the european and especially along the north american coasts it is strictly in accordance with these different conditions that we find in one case an almost perfect identity with and in the other an almost equally complete diversity from the continental species of birds  insects and landshellsthe other groups of landanimals add little of importance to the facts already referred to the insects are very scanty the most plentiful group the beetles only furnishing about forty species belonging to thirtytwo genera and nineteen families the species are almost all peculiar as are some of the genera they are mostly small and obscure insects allied either to american or to worldwide groups the carabidæ and the heteromera are the most abundant groups the former furnishing six and the latter nine species61  285  the landshells are not abundantabout twenty in all most of them peculiar species but not otherwise remarkable the observation of captain collnet quoted by mr darwin in his journal that driftwood bamboos canes and the nuts of a palm are often washed on the southeastern shores of the islands furnishes an excellent clue to the manner in which many of the insects and landshells may have reached the galapagos whirlwinds also have been known to carry quantities of leaves and other vegetable débris to great heights in the air and these might be then carried away by strong upper currents and dropped at great distances and with them small insects and mollusca or their eggs we must also remember that volcanic islands are subject to subsidence as well as elevation and it is quite possible that during the long period the galapagos have existed some islands may have intervened between them and the coast and have served as steppingstones by which the passage to them of various organisms would be greatly facilitated sunken banks the relics of such islands are known to exist in many parts of the ocean and countless others no doubt remain undiscovered  the keeling islands as illustrating the manner in which oceanic islands are peopledthat such causes as have been here adduced are those by which oceanic islands have been peopled is further shown by the condition of equally remote islands which we know are of comparatively recent origin such are the keeling or cocos islands in the indian ocean situated about the same distance from sumatra as the galapagos from south america but mere coral reefs supporting abundance of cocoanut palms as their chief vegetation these islands were visited by mr 286 darwin and their natural history carefully examined the only mammals are rats brought by a wrecked vessel and said by mr waterhouse to be common english rats but smaller and more brightly coloured so that we have here an illustration of how soon a difference of race is established under a constant and uniform difference of conditions there are no true landbirds but there are snipes and rails both apparently common malayan species reptiles are represented by one small lizard but no account of this is given in the zoology of the voyage of the beagle and we may therefore conclude that it was an introduced species of insects careful collecting only produced thirteen species belonging to eight distinct orders the only beetle was a small elater the orthoptera were a gryllus and a blatta and there were two flies two ants and two small moths one a diopæa which swarms everywhere in the eastern tropics in grassy places all these insects were no doubt brought either by winds by floating timber which reaches the islands abundantly or by clinging to the feathers of aquatic or wading birds and we only require more time to introduce a greater variety of species and a better soil and more varied vegetation to enable them to live and multiply in order to give these islands a fauna and flora equal to that of the bermudas of wild plants there were only twenty species belonging to nineteen genera and to no less than sixteen natural families while all were common tropical shore plants62 these islands are thus evidently stocked by waifs and strays brought by the winds and waves but their scanty vegetation is mainly due to unfavourable conditionsthe barren coral rock and sand of which they are wholly composed together with exposure to seaair being suitable to a very limited number of species which soon monopolise the surface with more variety of soil and aspect a greater variety of plants would establish themselves and these would favour the preservation and increase of more insects birds and 287 other animals as we find to be the case in many small and remote islands63  flora of the galapagosthe plants of these islands are so much more numerous than the known animals even including the insects they have been so carefully studied by eminent botanists and their relations throw so much light on the past history of the group that no apology is needed for giving a brief outline of the peculiarities and affinities of the flora the statements we shall make on this subject will be taken from the memoir of sir joseph hooker in the linnæan transactions for 1851 founded on mr darwins collections and a later paper by n j andersson in the linnæa of 1861 embodying more recent discoveries 288  the total number of flowering plants known at the latter date was 332 of which 174 were peculiar to the islands while 158 were common to other countries64 of these latter about twenty have been introduced by man while the remainder are all natives of some part of america though about a third part are species of wide range extending into both hemispheres of those confined to america fortytwo are found in both the northern and southern continents twentyone are confined to south america while twenty are found only in north america the west indies or mexico this equality of north american and south american species in the galapagos is a fact of great significance in connection with the observation of sir joseph hooker that the peculiar species are allied to the plants of temperate america or to those of the high andes while the nonpeculiar species are mostly such as inhabit the hotter regions of the tropics near the level of the sea he also observes that the seeds of this latter class of galapagos plants often have special means of transport or belong to groups whose seeds are known to stand long voyages and to possess great vitality mr bentham also in his elaborate account of the compositæ65 remarks on the decided central american or mexican affinities of the galapagos species so that we may consider this to be a thoroughly wellestablished fact  the most prevalent families of plants in the galapagos are the compositæ 40 sp gramineæ 32 sp leguminosæ 30 sp and euphorbiaceæ 29 sp of the compositæ most of the species except such as are common weeds or shore plants are peculiar but there are only two peculiar genera allied to mexican forms and not very distinct while the genus lipochæta represented here by a single species is only found elsewhere in the sandwich islands though it has american affinities  origin of the galapagos florathese facts are explained by the past history of the american continent its 289 separation at various epochs by arms of the sea uniting the two oceans across what is now central america the last separation being of recent date as shown by the considerable number of identical species of fishes on both sides of the isthmus and the influence of the glacial epoch in driving the temperate american flora southward along the mountain plateaus66 at the time when the two oceans were united a portion of the gulf stream may have been diverted into the pacific giving rise to a current some part of which would almost certainly have reached the galapagos and this may have helped to bring about that singular assemblage of west indian and mexican plants now found there and as we now believe that the duration of the last glacial epoch in its successive phases was much longer than the time which has elapsed since it finally passed away while throughout the miocene epoch the snowline would often be lowered during periods of high excentricity we are enabled to comprehend the nature of the causes which may have led to the islands being stocked with those north tropical or mountain types which are so characteristic a feature of that portion of the galapagos flora which consists of peculiar species  on the whole the flora agrees with the fauna in indicating a moderately remote origin great isolation and changes of conditions affording facilities for the introduction of organisms from various parts of the american coast and even from the west indian islands and gulf of mexico as in the case of the birds the several islands differ considerably in their native plants many species being limited to one or two islands only while others extend to several this is of course what might be expected on any theory of their origin because even if the whole of the islands had once been united and afterwards separated long continued isolation would often lead to the differentiation of species while the varied conditions to be found upon islands differing in size and altitude as well as in luxuriance of vegetation would often lead to the extinction of a species on one island and its preservation on another if the several islands had been equally well 290 explored it might be interesting to see whether as in the case of the azores the number of species diminished in those more remote from the coast but unfortunately our knowledge of the productions of the various islands of the group is exceedingly unequal and except in those cases in which representative species inhabit distinct islands we have no certainty on the subject all the more interesting problems in geographical distribution however arise from the relation of the fauna and flora of the group as a whole to those of the surrounding continents and we shall therefore for the most part confine ourselves to this aspect of the question in our discussion of the phenomena presented by oceanic or continental islands  concluding remarksthe galapagos offer an instructive contrast with the azores showing how a difference of conditions that might be thought unimportant may yet produce very striking results in the forms of life although the galapagos are much nearer a continent than the azores the number of species of plants common to the continent is much less in the former case than in the latter and this is still more prominent a characteristic of the insect and the bird faunas this difference has been shown to depend almost entirely on the one archipelago being situated in a stormy the other in a calm portion of the ocean and it demonstrates the preponderating importance of the atmosphere as an agent in the dispersal of birds insects and plants yet oceancurrents and surfacedrifts are undoubtedly efficient carriers of plants and with plants of insects and shells especially in the tropics and it is probably to this agency that we may impute the recent introduction of a number of common peruvian and chilian littoral species and also of several west indian types at a more remote period when the isthmus of panama was submerged  in the case of these islands we see the importance of taking account of past conditions of sea and land and past changes of climate in order to explain the relations of the peculiar or endemic species of their fauna and flora and we may even see an indication of the effects of climatal changes in the northern hemisphere in the north 291 temperate or alpine affinities of many of the plants and even of some of the birds the relation between the migratory habits of the birds and the amount of difference from continental types is strikingly accordant with the fact that it is almost exclusively migratory birds that annually reach the azores and bermuda while the corresponding fact that the seeds of those plants which are common to the galapagos and the adjacent continent have allas sir joseph hooker statessome special means of dispersal is equally intelligible the reason why the galapagos possess four times as many peculiar species of plants as the azores is clearly a result of the less constant introduction of seeds owing to the absence of storms the greater antiquity of the group allowing more time for specific change and the influence of cold epochs and of alterations of sea and land in bringing somewhat different sets of plants at different times within the influence of such modified winds and currents as might convey them to the islands  on the whole then we have no difficulty in explaining the probable origin of the flora and fauna of the galapagos by means of the illustrative facts and general principles already adduced                                        292  chapter xiv

other spots upon the globe extreme isolation from all more extensive lands with a tolerably rich fauna and flora whose peculiarities are of surpassing interest both too have received considerable attention from naturalists and though much still remains to be done in the latter group our knowledge is sufficient to enable us to arrive at many interesting results  293 illustration map of the south atlantic ocean showing the position of st helena    the light tint shows depths of less than 1000 fathoms   the figures show depths of the sea in fathoms  position and physical features of st helenathis island is situated nearly in the middle of the south atlantic ocean being more than 1100 miles from the coast of africa and 1800 from south america it is about ten miles long by eight wide and is wholly volcanic consisting of ancient basalts lavas and other volcanic products it is very mountainous and rugged bounded for 294 the most part by enormous precipices and rising to a height of 2700 feet above the sealevel an ancient crater about four miles across is open on the south side and its northern rim forms the highest and central ridge of the island many other hills and peaks however are more than two thousand feet high and a considerable portion of the surface consists of a rugged plateau having an elevation of about fifteen hundred to two thousand feet everything indicates that st helena is an isolated volcanic mass built up from the depths of the ocean mr wollaston remarks there are the strongest reasons for believing that the area of st helena was never very much larger than it is at presentthe comparatively shallow seasoundings within about a mile and a half from the shore revealing an abruptly defined ledge beyond which no bottom is reached at a depth of 250 fathoms so that the original basaltic mass which was gradually piled up by means of successive eruptions from beneath the ocean would appear to have its limit definitely marked out by this suddenlyterminating submarine cliffthe space between it and the existing coastline being reasonably referred to that slow process of disintegration by which the island has been reduced through the eroding action of the elements to its present dimensions if we add to this that between the island and the coast of africa in a southeasterly direction is a profound oceanic gulf known to reach a depth of 2860 fathoms or 17160 feet while an equally deep or perhaps deeper ocean extends to the west and southwest we shall be satisfied that st helena is a true oceanic island and that it owes none of its peculiarities to a former union with any continent or other distant land  change effected by european occupationwhen first discovered in the year 1501 st helena was densely covered with a luxuriant forest vegetation the trees overhanging the seaward precipices and covering every part of the surface with an evergreen mantle this indigenous vegetation has been almost wholly destroyed and although an immense number of foreign plants have been introduced and have more or less completely established themselves 295 yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile the cause of the change is however very easily explained the rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin when this was destroyed the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay this irreparable destruction was caused in the first place by goats which were introduced by the portuguese in 1513 and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in thousands these animals are the greatest of all foes to trees because they eat off the young seedlings and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest they were however aided by the reckless waste of man the east india company took possession of the island in 1651 and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing and required some protection two of the native trees redwood and ebony were good for tanning and to save trouble the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only the remainder being left to rot while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications by the mss records quoted in mr melliss interesting volume on st helena67 it is evident that the evil consequences of allowing the trees to be destroyed were clearly foreseen as the following passages show we find the place called the great wood in a flourishing condition full of young trees where the hoggs of which there is a great abundance do not come to root them up but the great wood is miserably lessened and destroyed within our memories and is not near the circuit and length it was but we believe it does not contain now less than fifteen hundred acres of fine woodland and good ground but no springs of water but what is salt or brackish which we take to be the reason that that part was not inhabited when the people first 296 chose out their settlements and made plantations but if wells could be sunk which the governor says he will attempt when we have more hands we should then think it the most pleasant and healthiest part of the island but as to healthiness we dont think it will hold so if the wood that keeps the land warm were destroyed for then the rains which are violent here would carry away the upper soil and it being a clay marl underneath would produce but little as it is we think in case it were enclosed it might be greatly improved  when once this wood is gone the island will soon be ruined  we viewed the woods end which joins the honourable companys plantation called the hutts but the wood is so destroyed that the beginning of the great wood is now a whole mile beyond that place and all the soil between being washed away that distance is now entirely barren mss records 1716 in 1709 the governor reported to the court of directors of the east india company that the timber was rapidly disappearing and that the goats should be destroyed for the preservation of the ebony wood and because the island was suffering from droughts the reply was the goats are not to be destroyed being more valuable than ebony thus through the gross ignorance of those in power the last opportunity of preserving the peculiar vegetation of st helena and preventing the island from becoming the comparatively rocky desert it now is was allowed to pass away68 even in a mere 297 pecuniary point of view the error was a fatal one for in the next century in 1810 another governor reports the total destruction of the great forests by the goats and that in consequence the cost of importing fuel for government use was 2729l 7s 8d for a single year about this time large numbers of european american australian and south african plants were imported and many of these ran wild and increased so rapidly as to drive out and exterminate much of the relics of the native flora so that now english broom gorse and brambles willows and poplars and some common american cape and australian weeds alone meet the eye of the ordinary visitor these in sir joseph hookers opinion render it absolutely impossible to restore the native flora which only lingers in a few of the loftiest ridges and most inaccessible precipices and is rarely seen except by some exploring naturalist  this almost total extirpation of a luxuriant and highly peculiar vegetation must inevitably have caused the destruction of a considerable portion of the lower animals which once existed on the island and it is rather singular that so much as has actually been discovered should be left to show us the nature of the aboriginal fauna many naturalists have made small collections during short visits but we owe our present complete knowledge of the two most interesting groups of animals the insects and the landshells mainly to the late mr t vernon wollaston who after having thoroughly explored madeira and the canaries undertook a voyage to st helena for the express purpose of studying its terrestrial fauna and resided for six months 187576 in a high central position whence the loftiest peaks could be explored the results of his labours are contained in two volumes69 which like all that he wrote are models of accuracy and research and it is to these volumes that we are indebted for the interesting and suggestive facts which we here lay before our readers  298  insectscoleopterathe total number of species of beetles hitherto observed at st helena is 203 but of these no less than seventyfour are common and widespread insects which have certainly in mr wollastons opinion been introduced by human agency there remain 129 which are believed to be truly aborigines and of these all but one are found nowhere else on the globe but in addition to this large amount of specific peculiarity perhaps unequalled anywhere else in the world the beetles of this island are equally remarkable for their generic isolation and for the altogether exceptional proportion in which the great divisions of the order are represented the species belong to thirtynine genera of which no less than twentyfive are peculiar to the island and many of these are such isolated forms that it is impossible to find their allies in any particular country still more remarkable is the fact that more than twothirds of the whole number of indigenous species are rhyncophora or weevils while more than twofifths fiftyfour species belong to one family the cossonidæ now although the rhyncophora are an immensely numerous group and always form a large portion of the insect population they nowhere else approach such a proportion as this for example in madeira they form onesixth of the whole of the indigenous coleoptera in the azores less than onetenth and in britain oneseventh even more interesting is the fact that the twenty genera to which these insects belong are every one of them peculiar to the island and in many cases have no near allies elsewhere so that we cannot but look on this group of beetles as forming the most characteristic portion of the ancient insect fauna now as the great majority of these are wood borers and all are closely attached to vegetation and often to particular species of plants we might as mr wollaston well observes deduce the former luxuriant vegetation of the island from the great preponderance of this group even had we not positive evidence that it was at no distant epoch densely forestclad we will now proceed briefly to indicate the numbers and peculiarities of each of the families of beetles which enter into the st helena fauna taking them not in 299 systematic order but according to their importance in the island  1 rhyncophorathis great division includes the weevils and allied groups and as above stated exceeds in number of species all the other beetles of the island four families are represented the cossonidæ with fifteen peculiar genera comprising fiftyfour species and one minute insect stenoscelis hylastoides forming a peculiar genus but which has been found also at the cape of good hope it is therefore impossible to say of which country it is really a native or whether it is indigenous to both and dates back to the remote period when st helena received its early emigrants all the cossonidæ are found in the highest and wildest parts of the island where the native vegetation still lingers and many of them are only found in the decaying stems of treeferns boxwood arborescent compositæ and other indigenous plants they are all preeminently peculiar and isolated having no direct affinity to species found in any other country the next family the tanyrhynchidæ has one peculiar genus in st helena with ten species this genus nesiotes is remotely allied to european australian and madeiran insects of the same family the habits of the species are similar to those of the cossonidæ the trachyphloeidæ are represented by a single species belonging to a peculiar genus not very remote from a european form the anthribidæ again are highly peculiar there are twentysix species belonging to three genera all endemic and so extremely peculiar that they form two new subfamilies one of the genera acarodes is said to be allied to a madeiran genus  2 geodephagathese are the terrestrial carnivorous beetles very abundant in all parts of the world especially in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere in st helena there are fourteen species belonging to three genera one of which is peculiar this is the haplothorax burchellii the largest beetle on the island and now very rare it resembles a large black carabus there is also a peculiar calosoma very distinct though resembling in some respects certain african species the rest of the 300 geodephaga twelve in number belong to the widespread genus bembidium but they are altogether peculiar and isolated except one which is of european type and alone has wings all the rest being wingless  3 heteromerathis group is represented by three peculiar genera containing four species with two species belonging to european genera they belong to the families opatridæ mordellidæ and anthicidæ  4 brachyelytraof this group there are six peculiar species belonging to four european generahomalota philonthus xantholinus and oxytelus  5 prioceratathe families elateridæ and anobiidæ are each represented by a peculiar species of a european genus  6 phytophagathere are only three species of this tribe belonging to the european genus longitarsus  7 lamellicornishere are three species belonging to two genera one is a peculiar species of trox allied to south african forms the other two belong to the peculiar genus melissius which mr wollaston considers to be remotely allied to australian insects  8 pseudotrimerahere we have the fine ladybird chilomenus lunata also found in africa but apparently indigenous in st helena and a peculiar species of euxestes a genus only found elsewhere in madeira  9 trichopterygidÆthese the minutest of beetles are represented by one species of the european and madeiran genus ptinella  10 necrophagaone indigenous species of cryptophaga inhabits st helena and this is said to be very closely allied to a cape species  peculiarities and origin of the coleoptera of st helenawe see that the great mass of the indigenous species are not only peculiar to the island but so isolated in their characters as to show no close affinity with any existing insects while a small number about onethird of the whole have some relations though often very remote with species now inhabiting europe madeira or south africa these facts clearly point to the very great antiquity of the insect fauna of st helena which has allowed 301 time for the modification of the originally introduced species and their special adaptation to the conditions prevailing in this remote island this antiquity is also shown by the remarkable specific modification of a few types thus the whole of the cossonidæ may be referred to three types one species only hexacoptus ferrugineus being allied to the european cossonidæ though forming a distinct genus a group of three genera and seven species remotely allied to the stenoscelis hylastoides which occurs also at the cape while a group of twelve genera with fortysix species have their only remote allies in a few insects widely scattered in south africa new zealand europe and the atlantic islands in like manner eleven species of bembidium form a group by themselves and the heteromera form two groups one consisting of three genera and species of opatridæ allied to a type found in madeira the other anthicodes altogether peculiar  now each of these types may well be descended from a single species which originally reached the island from some other land and the great variety of generic and specific forms into which some of them have diverged is an indication and to some extent a measure of the remoteness of their origin the rich insect fauna of miocene age found in switzerland consists mostly of genera which still inhabit europe with others which now inhabit the cape of good hope or the tropics of africa and south america and it is not at all improbable that the origin of the st helena fauna dates back to at least as remote and not improbably to a still earlier epoch but if so many difficulties in accounting for its origin will disappear we know that at that time many of the animals and plants of the tropics of north america and even of australia inhabited europe while during the changes of climate which as we have seen there is good reason to believe periodically occurred there would be much migration from the temperate zones towards the equator and the reverse if therefore the nearest ally of any insular group now inhabits a particular country we are not obliged to suppose that it reached the island from that country since we know that most groups have ranged in past times over 302 wider areas than they now inhabit neither are we limited to the means of transmission across the ocean that now exist because we know that those means have varied greatly during such extreme changes of conditions as are implied by glacial periods and by warm polar climates great alterations of winds and of oceancurrents are inevitable and these are as we have already proved the two great agencies by which the transmission of living things to oceanic islands has been brought about at the present time the southeast tradewinds blow almost constantly at st helena and the oceancurrents flow in the same direction so that any transmission of insects by their means must almost certainly be from south africa now there is undoubtedly a south african element in the insectfauna but there is no less clearly a european or at least a northtemperate element and this is very difficult to account for by causes now in action but when we consider that this northern element is chiefly represented by remote generic affinity and has therefore all the signs of great antiquity we find a possible means of accounting for it we have seen that during early tertiary times an almost tropical climate extended far into the northern hemisphere and a temperate climate to the arctic regions but if at this time as is not improbable the antarctic regions were as much iceclad as they are now it is certain that an enormous change must have been produced in the winds instead of a great difference of temperature between each pole and the equator the difference would be mainly between one hemisphere and the other and this might so disturb the trade winds as to bring st helena within the south temperate region of stormsa position corresponding to that of the azores and madeira in the north atlantic and thus subject it to violent gales from all points of the compass at this remote epoch the mountains of equatorial africa may have been more extensive than they are now and may have served as intermediate stations by which some northern insects may have migrated to the southern hemisphere  we must remember also that these peculiar forms are said to be northern only because their nearest allies are 303 now found in the north atlantic islands and southern europe but it is not at all improbable that they are really widespread miocene types which have been preserved mainly in favourable insular stations they may therefore have originally reached st helena from southern africa or from some of the atlantic islands and may have been conveyed by oceanic currents as well as by winds70 this is the more probable as a large proportion of the st helena beetles live even in the perfect state within the stems of plants or trunks of trees while the eggs and larvæ of a still larger number are likely to inhabit similar stations driftwood might therefore be one of the most important agencies by which these insects reached the island  let us now see how far the distribution of other groups support the conclusions derived from a consideration of the beetles the hemiptera have been studied by dr f buchanan white and though far less known than the beetles indicate somewhat similar relations eight out of twentyone genera are peculiar and the thirteen other genera are for the most part widely distributed while one of the peculiar genera is of african type the other orders of insects have not been collected or studied with 304 sufficient care to make it worth while to refer to them in detail but the landshells have been carefully collected and minutely described by mr wollaston himself and it is interesting to see how far they agree with the insects in their peculiarities and affinities  landshells of st helenathe total number of species is only twentynine of which seven are common in europe or the other atlantic islands and are no doubt recent introductions two others though described as distinct are so closely allied to european forms that mr wollaston thinks they have probably been introduced and have become slightly modified by new conditions of life so that there remain exactly twenty species which may be considered truly indigenous no less than thirteen of these however appear to be extinct being now only found on the surface of the ground or in the surface soil in places where the native forests have been destroyed and the land not cultivated these twenty peculiar species belong to the following genera hyalina 3 sp patula 4 sp bulimus 7 sp subulina 3 sp succinea 3 sp of which one species of hyalina three of patula all the bulimi and two of subulina are extinct the three hyalinas are allied to european species but all the rest appear to be highly peculiar and to have no near allies with the species of any other country two of the bulimi b auris vulpinæ and b darwinianus are said to somewhat resemble brazilian new zealand and solomon island forms while neither bulimus nor succinea occur at all in the madeira group  omitting the species that have probably been introduced by human agency we have here indications of a somewhat recent immigration of european types which may perhaps be referred to the glacial period and a much more ancient immigration from unknown lands which must certainly date back to miocene if not to eocene times  absence of freshwater organismsa singular phenomenon is the total absence of indigenous aquatic forms of life in st helena not a single waterbeetle or freshwater shell has been discovered neither do there seem to be any waterplants in the streams except the common 305 watercress one or two species of cyperus and the australian isapis prolifera the same absence of freshwater shells characterises the azores where however there is one indigenous waterbeetle in the sandwich islands also recent observations refer to the absence of waterbeetles though here there are a few freshwater shells it would appear therefore that the wide distribution of the same generic and specific forms which so generally characterises freshwater organisms and which has been so well illustrated by mr darwin has its limits in the very remote oceanic islands owing to causes of which we are at present ignorant  the other classes of animals in st helena need occupy us little there are no indigenous mammals reptiles freshwater fishes or true landbirds but there is one species of wadera small plover Ægialitis sanctæhelenævery closely allied to a species found in south africa but presenting certain differences which entitle it to the rank of a peculiar species the plants however are of especial interest from a geographical point of view and we must devote a few pages to their consideration as supplementing the scanty materials afforded by the animal life thus enabling us better to understand the biological relations and probable history of the island  native vegetation of st helenaplants have certainly more varied and more effectual means of passing over wide tracts of ocean than any kinds of animals their seeds are often so minute of such small specific gravity or so furnished with downy or winged appendages as to be carried by the wind for enormous distances the bristles or hooked spines of many small fruits cause them to become easily attached to the feathers of aquatic birds and they may thus be conveyed for thousands of miles by these preeminent wanderers while many seeds are so protected by hard outer coats and dense inner albumen that months of exposure to salt water does not prevent them from germinating as proved by the west indian seeds that reach the azores or even the west coast of scotland and what is more to the point by the fact stated by mr melliss that large seeds which have floated from 306 madagascar or mauritius round the cape of good hope have been thrown on the shores of st helena and have then sometimes germinated  we have therefore little difficulty in understanding how the island was first stocked with vegetable forms when it was so stocked generally speaking is equally clear for as the peculiar coleopterous fauna of which an important fragment remains is mainly composed of species which are specially attached to certain groups of plants we may be sure that the plants were there long before the insects could establish themselves however ancient then is the insect fauna the flora must be more ancient still it must also be remembered that plants when once established in a suitable climate and soil soon take possession of a country and occupy it almost to the complete exclusion of later immigrants the fact of so many european weeds having overrun new zealand and temperate north america may seem opposed to this statement but it really is not so for in both these cases the native vegetation has first been artificially removed by man and the ground cultivated and there is no reason to believe that any similar effect would be produced by the scattering of any amount of foreign seed on ground already completely clothed with an indigenous vegetation we might therefore conclude à priori that the flora of such an island as st helena would be of an excessively ancient type preserving for us in a slightly modified form examples of the vegetation of the globe at the time when the island first rose above the ocean let us see then what botanists tell us of its character and affinities  the truly indigenous flowering plants are about fifty in number besides twentysix ferns forty of the former and ten of the latter are absolutely peculiar to the island and as sir joseph hooker tells us with scarcely an exception cannot be regarded as very close specific allies of any other plants at all seventeen of them belong to peculiar genera and of the others all differ so markedly as species from their congeners that not one comes under the category of being an insular form of a continental species the affinities of this flora are sir joseph hooker thinks 307 mainly african and especially south african as indicated by the presence of the genera phylica pelargonium mesembryanthemum oteospermum and wahlenbergia which are eminently characteristic of southern extratropical africa the sixteen ferns which are not peculiar are common either to africa india or america a wide range sufficiently explained by the dustlike spores of ferns capable of being carried to unknown distances by the wind and the great stability of their generic and specific forms many of those found in the miocene deposits of switzerland being hardly distinguishable from living species this shows that identity of species of ferns between st helena and distant countries does not necessarily imply a recent origin  the relation of the st helena compositæin an elaborate paper on the compositæ71 mr bentham gives us some valuable remarks on the affinities of the seven endemic species belonging to the genera commidendron melanodendron petrobium and pisiadia which forms so important a portion of the existing flora of st helena he says although nearer to africa than to any other continent those composite denizens which bear evidence of the greatest antiquity have their affinities for the most part in south america while the colonists of a more recent character are south african  commidendron and melanodendron are among the woody asteroid forms exemplified in the andine diplostephium and in the australian olearia petrobium is one of three genera remains of a group probably of great antiquity of which the two others are podanthus in chile and astemma in the andes the pisiadia is an endemic species of a genus otherwise mascarene or of eastern africa presenting a geographical connection analogous to that of the st helena melhaniæ72 with the mascarene trochetia  whenever such remote and singular cases of geographical affinity as the above are pointed out the first 308 impression is to imagine some mode by which a communication between the distant countries implicated might be effected and this way of viewing the problem is almost universally adopted even by naturalists but if the principles laid down in this work and in my geographical distribution of animals are sound such a course is very unphilosophical for on the theory of evolution nothing can be more certain than that groups now broken up and detached were once continuous and that fragmentary groups and isolated forms are but the relics of once widespread types which have been preserved in a few localities where the physical conditions were especially favourable or where organic competition was less severe the true explanation of all such remote geographical affinities is that they date back to a time when the ancestral group of which they are the common descendants had a wider or a different distribution and they no more imply any closer connection between the distant countries the allied forms now inhabit than does the existence of living equidæ in south africa and extinct equidæ in the pliocene deposits of the pampas imply a continent bridging the south atlantic to allow of their easy communication  concluding remarks on st helenathe sketch we have now given of the chief members of the indigenous fauna and flora of st helena shows that by means of the knowledge we have obtained of past changes in the physical history of the earth and of the various modes by which organisms are conveyed across the ocean all the more important facts become readily intelligible we have here an island of small size and great antiquity very distant from every other land and probably at no time very much less distant from surrounding continents which became stocked by chance immigrants from other countries at some remote epoch and which has preserved many of their more or less modified descendants to the present time when first visited by civilised man it was in all probability far more richly stocked with plants and animals forming a kind of natural museum or vivarium in which ancient types perhaps dating back to the miocene 309 period or even earlier had been saved from the destruction which has overtaken their allies on the great continents unfortunately many we do not know how many of these forms have been exterminated by the carelessness and improvidence of its civilised but ignorant rulers and it is only by the extreme ruggedness and inaccessibility of its peaks and craterridges that the scanty fragments have escaped by which alone we are able to obtain a glimpse of this interesting chapter in the lifehistory of our earth                                        310  chapter xv  the sandwich islands      position and physical featureszoology of the

the fauna and     flora of the sandwich islandsgeneral remarks on oceanic islands  the sandwich islands are an extensive group of large islands situated in the centre of the north pacific being 2350 miles from the nearest part of the american coastthe bay of san francisco and about the same distance from the marquesas and the samoa islands to the south and the aleutian islands a little west of north they are therefore wonderfully isolated in midocean and are only connected with the other pacific islands by widely scattered coral reefs and atolls the nearest of which however are six or seven hundred miles distant and are all nearly destitute of animal or vegetable life the group consists of seven large inhabited islands besides four rocky islets the largest hawaii being seventy miles across and having an area 3800 square milesbeing somewhat larger than all the other islands together a better conception of this large island will be formed by comparing it with devonshire with which it closely agrees both in size and shape though its enormous volcanic mountains rise to nearly 14000 feet high 311 three of the smaller islands are each about the size of hertfordshire or bedfordshire and the whole group stretches from northwest to southeast for a distance of about 350 miles though so extensive the entire archipelago is volcanic and the largest island is rendered sterile and comparatively uninhabitable by its three active volcanoes and their widespread deposits of lava  illustration map of the sandwich islands    the light tint shows where the sea is less than 1000 fathoms deep   the figures show the depth in fathoms  the ocean depths by which these islands are separated from the nearest continents are enormous north east and south soundings have been obtained a little over or under three thousand fathoms and these profound deeps extend over a large part of the north pacific we may 312 be quite sure therefore that the sandwich islands have during their whole existence been as completely severed from the great continents as they are now but on the west and south there is a possibility of more extensive islands having existed serving as steppingstones to the island groups of the midpacific this is indicated by a few widelyscattered coral islets around which extend 313 considerable areas of less depth varying from two hundred to a thousand fathoms and which may therefore indicate the sites of submerged islands of considerable extent when we consider that east of new zealand and new caledonia all the larger and loftier islands are of volcanic origin with no trace of any ancient stratified rocks except perhaps in the marquesas where according to jules marcou granite and gneiss are said to occur it seems probable that the innumerable coralreefs and atolls which occur in groups on deeply submerged banks mark the sites of bygone volcanic islands similar to those which now exist but which after becoming extinct have been lowered or destroyed by denudation and finally have altogether disappeared except where their sites are indicated by the upwardgrowing coralreefs if this view is correct we should give up all idea of there ever having been a pacific continent but should look upon that vast ocean as having from the remotest geological epochs been the seat of volcanic forces which from its profound depths have gradually built up the islands which now dot its surface as well as many others which have sunk beneath its waves the number of islands as well as the total quantity of landsurface may sometimes have been greater than it is now and may thus have facilitated the transfer of organisms from one group to another and more rarely even from the american asiatic or australian continents keeping these various facts and considerations in view we may now proceed to examine the fauna and flora of the sandwich islands and discuss the special phenomena they present  illustration map of the north pacific with its submerged banks    the

birdsit need hardly be said that indigenous mammalia are quite unknown in the sandwich islands the most interesting of the higher animals being the birds which are tolerably numerous and highly peculiar many aquatic and wading birds which range over the whole pacific visit these islands twentyfive species having been observed but even of these six are peculiara coot fulica alai a moorhen gallinula galeata var sandvichensis a rail with rudimentary wings pennula millei a stiltplover himantopus knudseni and 314 two ducks anas wyvilliana and bernicla sandvichensis the birds of prey are also great wanderers four have been found in the islandsthe shorteared owl otus brachyotus which ranges over the greater part of the globe but is here said to resemble the variety found in chile and the galapagos the barn owl strix flammea of a variety common in the pacific a peculiar sparrowhawk accipiter hawaii and buteo solitarius a buzzard of a peculiar species and coloured so as to resemble a hawk of the american subfamily polyborinæ it is to be noted that the genus buteo abounds in america but is not found in the pacific and this fact combined with the remarkable colouration renders it almost certain that this peculiar species is of american origin  the passeres or true perching birds are especially interesting being all of peculiar species and all but one belonging to peculiar genera their numbers have been greatly increased since the first edition of this work appeared partly by the exertions of american naturalists and very largely by the researches of mr scott b wilson who visited the sandwich islands for the purpose of investigating their ornithology and collected assiduously in the various islands of the group for a year and a half this gentleman is now publishing

representative forms found in the several islands of the group  taking the above in the order here given we have first two peculiar genera of true flycatchers a family confined to the old world but extending over the pacific as far as the marquesas islands next we have two peculiar genera with four species of honeysuckers a family confined to the australian region and also ranging over all the pacific islands to the marquesas we now come to the most important group of birds in the sandwich islands comprising seven or eight peculiar genera and twentytwo species which are believed to form a peculiar family allied to the oriental flowerpeckers diceidæ and perhaps remotely to the american greenlets vireonidæ or 316 tanagers tanagridæ they possess singularly varied beaks some having this organ much thickened like those of finches to which family some of them have been supposed to belong in any case they form a most peculiar group and cannot be associated with any other known birds the last species and the only one not belonging to a peculiar genus is the hawaiian crow belonging to the almost universally distributed genus corvus  on the whole the affinities of these birds are as might be expected chiefly with australia and the pacific islands but they exhibit in the buzzard one of the owls and perhaps in some of the drepanididæ slight indications of very rare or very remote communication with america the amount of speciality is however wonderful far exceeding that of any other islands the only approach to it being made by new zealand and madagascar which have a much more varied bird fauna and a smaller proportionate number of peculiar genera the galapagos among the true oceanic islands while presenting many peculiarities have only four out of the ten genera of passeres peculiar these facts undoubtedly indicate an immense antiquity for this group of islands or the vicinity of some very ancient land now submerged from which some portion of their peculiar fauna might be derived for further details as to the affinities and geographical distribution of the genera and species the reader must consult mr scott wilsons work the birds of the sandwich islands already alluded to  reptilesthe only other vertebrate animals are two lizards one of these is a very widespread species ablepharus poecilopleurus ranging from the pacific islands to west africa the other is said to form a peculiar genus of geckoes but both its locality and affinities appear to be somewhat doubtful  landshellsthe only other group of animals which has been carefully studied and which presents features of especial interest are the landshells these are very numerous about thirty genera and between three and four hundred species having been described and it is remarkable that this single group contains as many species of 317 landshells as all the other polynesian islands from the pelew islands and samoa to the marquesas all the species are peculiar and about threefourths of the whole belong to peculiar genera fourteen of which constitute the subfamily achatinellinæ entirely confined to this group of islands and constituting its most distinguishing feature thirteen genera comprising sixtyfour species are found also in the other polynesian islands but three genera of auriculidæ plecotrema pedipes and blauneria are not found in the pacific but inhabitthe former genus australia china bourbon and cuba the two latter the west indian islands another remarkable peculiarity of these islands is the small number of operculata which are represented by only one genus and five species while the other pacific islands have twenty genera and 115 species or more than half the number of the inoperculata this difference is so remarkable that it is worth stating in a comparative form                            inoperculata  operculata  auriculidæ   sandwich islands           332              5           9   rest of pacific islands    200            115          16  when we remember that in the west indian islands the operculata abound in a greater proportion than even in the pacific islands generally we are led to the conclusion that limestone which is plentiful in both these areas is especially favourable to them while the purely volcanic rocks are especially unfavourable the other peculiarities of the sandwich islands however such as the enormous preponderance of the strictly endemic achatinellinæ and the presence of genera which occur elsewhere only beyond the pacific area in various parts of the great continents undoubtedly point to a very remote origin at a time when the distribution of many of the groups of mollusca was very different from that which now prevails  a very interesting feature of the sandwich group is the extent to which the species and even the genera are confined to separate islands thus the genera carelia and catinella with eight species are peculiar to the island of kaui bulimella apex frickella and blauneria to oahu perdicella to maui and eburnella to lanai 318 the rev john t gulick who has made a special study of the achatinellinæ informs us that the average range of the species in this subfamily is five or six miles while some are restricted to but one or two square miles and only very few have the range of a whole island each valley and often each side of a valley and sometimes even every ridge and peak possesses its peculiar species73 the island of oahu in which the capital is situated has furnished about half the species already known this is partly due to its being more forestclad but also no doubt in part to its being better explored so that notwithstanding the exceptional riches of the group we have no reason to suppose that there are not many more species to be found in the less explored islands mr gulick tells us that the forest region that covers one of the mountain ranges of oahu is about forty miles in length and five or six miles in width yet this small territory furnishes about 175 species of achatinellidæ represented by 700 or 800 varieties the most important peculiar genus not belonging to the achatinella group is carelia with six species and several named varieties all peculiar to kaui the most westerly of the large islands this would seem to show that the small islets stretching westward and situated on an extensive bank with less than a thousand fathoms of water over it may indicate the position of a large submerged island whence some portion of the sandwich island fauna was derived  insectsowing to the researches of the rev t blackburn we have now a fair knowledge of the coleopterous fauna of these islands unfortunately some of the most productive islands in plantskaui and mauiwere very little explored but during a residence of six years the equally rich oahu was well worked and the general character of the beetle fauna must therefore be considered to be pretty accurately determined out of 428 species collected many being obviously recent introductions no 319 less than 352 species and 99 of the genera appear to be quite peculiar to the archipelago sixty of these species are carabidæ fortytwo are staphylinidæ forty are nitidulidæ twenty are ptinidæ twenty are ciodidæ thirty are aglycyderidæ fortyfive are curculionidæ and fourteen are cerambycidæ the remainder being distributed among twentytwo other families many important families such as cicindelidæ scaraboeidæ buprestidæ and the whole of the enormous series of the phytophaga are either entirely absent or are only represented by a few introduced species in the eight families enumerated above most of the species belong to peculiar genera which usually contain numerous distinct species and we may therefore consider these to represent the descendants of the most ancient immigrants into the islands  two important characteristics of the coleopterous fauna are the small size of the species and the great scarcity of individuals dr sharp who has described many of them74 says they are mostly small or very minute insects and that there are fewprobably it would be correct to say absolutely nonethat would strike an ordinary observer as being beautiful mr blackburn says that it was not an uncommon thing for him to pass a morning on the mountains and to return home with perhaps two or three specimens having seen literally nothing else except the few species that are generally abundant he states that he has frequently spent an hour sweeping flowercovered herbage or beating branches of trees over an inverted white umbrella without seeing the sign of a beetle of any kind to those who have collected in any tropical or even temperate country on or near a continent this poverty of insect life must seem almost incredible and it affords us a striking proof of how erroneous are those now almost obsolete views which imputed the abundance variety size and colour of insects to the warmth and sunlight and luxuriant vegetation of the tropics the facts become quite intelligible however if we consider that only 320 minute insects of certain groups could ever reach the islands by natural means and that these already highly specialised for certain defined modes of life could only develop slowly into slightly modified forms of the original types some of the groups however are considered by dr sharp to be very ancient generalised forms especially the peculiar family aglycyderidæ which he looks upon as being absolutely the most primitive of all the known forms of coleoptera it being a synthetic form linking the isolated rhynchophagous series of families with the clavicorn series about thirty species are known in the hawaiian islands and they exhibit much difference inter se a few remarks on each of the more important of the families will serve to indicate their probable mode and period of introduction into the islands  the carabidæ consist chiefly of seven peculiar genera of anchomenini comprising fiftyone species and several endemic species of bembidiinæ they are highly peculiar and are all of small size and may have originally reached the islands in the crevices of the drift wood from nw america which is still thrown on their shores or more rarely by means of a similar drift from the nwestern islands of the pacific75 it is interesting to note that peculiar species of the same groups of carabidæ are found in the azores canaries and st helena indicating that they possess some special facilities for transmission across wide oceans and for establishing themselves upon oceanic islands the staphylinidæ present many peculiar species of known genera being still more minute and usually more ubiquitous than the carabidæ there is no difficulty in accounting for their presence in the islands by the same means of dispersal the nitidulidæ ptinidæ and ciodidæ being very small and of varied habits either the perfect insects their eggs or larvæ may have been introduced either by water or wind carriage or through the agency of birds the curculionidæ being wood bark or nut borers would have considerable facilities for transmission by floating timber fruits or nuts and the eggs or larvæ of the 321 peculiar cerambycidæ must have been introduced by the same means the absence of so many important and cosmopolitan groups whose size or constitution render them incapable of being thus transmitted over the sea as well as of many which seem equally well adapted as those which are found in the islands indicate how rare have been the conditions for successful immigration and this is still further emphasized by the extreme specialisation of the fauna indicating that there has been no repeated immigration of the same species which would tend as in the case of bermuda to preserve the originally introduced forms unchanged by the effects of repeated intercrossing  vegetation of the sandwich islandsthe flora of these islands is in many respects so peculiar and remarkable and so well supplements the information derived from its interesting but scanty fauna that a brief account of its more striking features will not be out of place and we fortunately have a pretty full knowledge of it owing to the researches of the german botanist dr w hildebrand76  considering their extreme isolation their uniform volcanic soil and the large proportion of the chief island which consists of barren lavafields the flora of the sandwich islands is extremely rich consisting so far as at present known of 844 species of flowering plants and 155 ferns this is considerably richer than the azores 439 phanerogams and 39 ferns which though less extensive are perhaps better known or than the galapagos 332 phanerogams which are more strictly comparable being equally volcanic while their somewhat smaller area may perhaps be compensated by their proximity to the american continent even new zealand with more than twenty times the area of the sandwich group whose soil and climate are much more varied and whose botany has been thoroughly explored has not a very much larger number of flowering plants 935 species while in ferns it is barely equal  322  the following list gives

features of the florathis rich insular flora is wonderfully peculiar for if we deduct 115 species which are believed to have been introduced by man there remain 705 species of flowering plants of which 574 or more than fourfifths are quite peculiar to the islands there are no less than 38 peculiar genera out of a total of 265 and these 38 genera comprise 254 species so that the most isolated forms are those which most abound and thus give a special character to the flora besides these peculiar types several genera of wide range are here represented by highly peculiar species such are the hawaiian species of lobelia which are woody shrubs either creeping or six feet high while a species of one of the peculiar genera of lobeliaceæ is a tree reaching a height of forty feet shrubby geraniums grow twelve or fifteen feet high and some vacciniums grow as epiphytes on the trunks of trees violets and plantains also form tall shrubby plants and there are many strange arborescent compositæ as in other oceanic islands  the affinities of the flora generally are very wide although there are many polynesian groups yet australian new zealand and american forms are equally represented dr pickering notes the total absence of a large number of families found in southern polynesia such as dilleniceæa anonaceæ olacaceæ aurantiaceæ guttiferæ malpighiaceæ meliaceæ combretaceæ rhizophoraceæ melastomaceæ passifloraceæ cunoniaceæ jasminaceæ acanthaceæ myristicaceæ and casuaraceæ as well as the genera clerodendron ficus and epidendric orchids australian affinities are shown by the genera exocarpus cyathodes melicope pittosporum and by a phyllodinous acacia new zealand is represented by ascarina coprosma acæna and several cyperaceæ while america is represented by the genera nama gunnera phyllostegia sisyrinchium and by a redflowered rubus and a yellowflowered sanicula allied to oregon species  there is no true alpine flora on the higher summits but several of the temperate forms extend to a great elevation thus mr pickering records vaccinium ranunculus silene gnaphalium and geranium as occurring above ten 324 thousand feet elevation while viola drosera acæna lobelia edwardsia dodonæa lycopodium and many compositæ range above six thousand feet vaccinium and silene are very interesting as they are almost peculiar to the north temperate zone while many plants allied to antarctic species are found in the bogs of the high plateaux  the proportionate abundance of the different families in this interesting flora is as follows     1 compositæ        70

   20     nine other orders geraniaceæ rhamnaceæ rosaceæ myrtaceæ primulaceæ loganiaceæ liliaceæ thymelaceæ and cucurbitaceæ have six or seven species each and among the more important orders which have less than five species each are ranunculaceæ cruciferæ vaccinacæ apocynaceæ boraginaceæ scrophulariaceæ polygonaceæ orchidaceæ and juncaceæ the most remarkable feature here is the great abundance of lobeliaceæ a character of the flora which is probably unique while the superiority of labiatæ to leguminosæ and the scarcity of rosaceæ and orchidaceæ are also very unusual composites as in most temperate floras stand at the head of the list and it will be interesting to note the affinities which they indicate omitting eleven species which are cosmopolitan and have no doubt entered with civilised man there remain nineteen genera and seventy species of compositæ in the islands sixtyone of the species are peculiar as are eight of the genera while the genus lipochæta with eleven species is only known elsewhere in the galapagos where a single species occurs we may therefore consider that nine out of the nineteen genera of hawaiian 325 compositæ are really confined to the archipelago

since the compositæ of tahiti and the other pacific islands are allied to malaysian types it is here that we meet with some of the most isolated and remarkable forms implying great antiquity and when we consider the enormous extent and worldwide distribution of this order comprising about ten thousand species its distinctness from all others the great specialisation of its flowers to attract insects and of its seeds for dispersal by wind and other means we can hardly doubt that its origin dates back to a very remote epoch we may therefore look upon the compositæ as representing the most ancient portion of the existing flora of the sandwich islands carrying us back to a very remote period when the facilities for communication with america were greater than they are now this may be indicated by the two deep submarine banks in the north pacific between the sandwich islands and san francisco which from an ocean floor 326 nearly 3000 fathoms deep rise up to within a few hundred fathoms of the surface and seem to indicate the subsidence of two islands each about as large as hawaii the plants of north temperate affinity may be nearly as old but these may have been derived from northern asia by way of japan and the extensive line of shoals which run northwestward from the sandwich islands as shown on our map those which exhibit polynesian or australian affinities consisting for the most part of less highly modified species usually of the same genera may have had their origin at a later though still somewhat remote period when large islands indicated by the extensive shoals to the south and southwest offered facilities for the transmission of plants from the tropical portions of the pacific ocean  it is in the smaller and most woody islands in the westerly portion of the group especially in kauai and oahu that the greatest number and variety of plants are found and the largest proportion of peculiar species and genera these are believed to form the oldest portion of the group the volcanic activity having ceased and allowed a luxuriant vegetation more completely to cover the islands while in the larger and much newer islands of hawaii and maui the surface is more barren and the vegetation comparatively monotonous thus while twelve of the arborescent lobeliaceæ have been found on hawaii no less than seventeen occur on the much smaller oahu which has even a genus of these plants confined to it  it is interesting to note that while the nonpeculiar genera of flowering plants have little more than two species to a genus the endemic genera average six and threequarter species to a genus these may be considered to represent the earliest immigrants which became firmly established in the comparatively unoccupied islands and have gradually become modified into such complete harmony with their new conditions that they have developed into many diverging forms adapting them to different habitats the following is a list of the peculiar genera with

in this list in the former case the facilities for winddispersal afforded by the structure of so many of the seeds render it comparatively easy to account for their having reached the islands at an early period the lobelias judging from hildebrands descriptions may have been transported in several 328 different ways most of the endemic genera are berrybearers and thus offer the means of dispersal by fruiteating birds the endemic species of the genus lobelia have sometimes very minute seeds which might be carried long distances by wind while other species especially lobelia gaudichaudii have a hard almost woody capsule which opens late apparently well adapted for floating long distances afterwards the calycine covering withers away leaving a fenestrate woody network enclosing the capsule and the seeds themselves are compressed reniform or orbicular and margined and thus of a form well adapted to be carried to great heights and distances by gales or hurricanes  in the other orders which present several endemic genera indications of the mode of transit to the islands are afforded us the araliaceæ are said to have fleshy fruits or drupes more or less succulent the rubiaceæ have usually berries or drupes while one genus kadua has small flat winged seeds the two largest genera of the labiatæ are said to have fleshy nucules which would no doubt be swallowed by birds78  antiquity of the hawaiian fauna and florathe great antiquity implied by the peculiarities of the fauna and flora no less than by the geographical conditions and surroundings of this group will enable us to account for another peculiarity of its florathe absence of so many families found in other pacific islands for the earliest immigrants would soon occupy much of the surface and become specially modified in accordance with the conditions of the locality and these would serve as a barrier against the intrusion of many forms which at a later 329 period spread over polynesia the extreme remoteness of the islands and the probability that they have always been more isolated than those of the central pacific would also necessarily result in an imperfect and fragmentary representation of the flora of surrounding lands  concluding observations on the fauna and flora of the sandwich islandsthe indications thus afforded by a study of the flora seem to accord well with what we know of the fauna of the islands plants having so much greater facilities for dispersal than animals and also having greater specific longevity and greater powers of endurance under adverse conditions exhibit in a considerable degree the influence of the primitive state of the islands and their surroundings while members of the animal world passing across the sea with greater difficulty and subject to extermination by a variety of adverse conditions retain much more of the impress of a recent state of things with perhaps here and there an indication of that ancient approach to america so clearly shown in the compositæ and some other portions of the flora  general remarks on oceanic islands  we have now reviewed the main features presented by the assemblages of organic forms which characterise the more important and best known of the oceanic islands they all agree in the total absence of indigenous mammalia and amphibia while their reptiles when they possess any do not exhibit indications of extreme isolation and antiquity their birds and insects present just that amount of specialisation and diversity from continental forms which may be well explained by the known means of dispersal acting through long periods their land shells indicate greater isolation owing to their admittedly less effective means of conveyance across the ocean while their plants show most clearly the effects of those changes of conditions which we have reason to believe have occurred during the tertiary epoch and preserve to us in highly specialised and archaic forms some record of the primeval immigration by which the islands were originally 330 clothed with vegetation but in every case the series of forms of life in these islands is scanty and imperfect as compared with far less favourable continental areas and no one of them presents such an assemblage of animals or plants as we always find in an island which we know has once formed part of a continent  it is still more important to note that none of these oceanic archipelagoes present us with a single type which we may suppose to have been preserved from mesozoic times and this fact taken in connection with the volcanic or coralline origin of all of them powerfully enforces the conclusion at which we have arrived in the earlier portion of this volume that during the whole period of geologic time as indicated by the fossiliferous rocks our continents and oceans have speaking broadly been permanent features of our earths surface for had it been otherwisehad sea and land changed place repeatedly as was once supposedhad our deepest oceans been the seat of great continents while the site of our present continents was occupied by an oceanic abyssis it possible to imagine that no fragments of such continents would remain in the present oceans bringing down to us some of their ancient forms of life preserved with but little change the correlative facts that the islands of our great oceans are all volcanic or coralline built probably upon degraded volcanic islands or extinct submarine volcanoes and that their productions are all more or less clearly related to the existing inhabitants of the nearest continents are hardly consistent with any other theory than the permanence of our oceanic and continental areas  we may here refer to the one apparent exception which however lends additional force to the argument new zealand is sometimes classed as an oceanic island but it is not so really and we shall discuss its peculiarities and probable origin further on

british fauna     and flora  we now proceed to examine those islands which are the very reverse of the oceanic class being fragments of continents or of larger islands from which they have been separated by subsidence of the intervening land at a period which geologically must be considered recent such islands are always still connected with their parent land by a shallow sea usually indeed not exceeding a hundred fathoms deep they always possess mammalia and reptiles either wholly or in large proportion identical with those of the mainland while their entire flora and fauna is characterised either by the total absence or comparative scarcity of those endemic or peculiar species and genera which are so striking a feature of almost all oceanic islands such islands will of course differ from each 332 other in size in antiquity and in the richness of their respective faunas as well as in their distance from the parent land and the facilities for intercommunication with it and these diversities of conditions will manifest themselves in the greater or less amount of speciality of their animal productions  this speciality when it exists may have been brought about in two ways a species or even a genus may on a continent have had a very limited area of distribution and this area may be wholly or almost wholly contained in the separated portion or island to which it will henceforth be peculiar even when the area occupied by a species is pretty equally divided at the time of separation between the island and the continent it may happen that it will become extinct on the latter while it may survive on the former because the limited number of individuals after division may be unable to maintain themselves against the severer competition or more contrasted climate of the continent while they may flourish under the more favourable insular conditions on the other hand when a species continues to exist in both areas it may on the island be subjected to some modifications by the altered conditions and may thus come to present characters which differentiate it from its continental allies and constitute it a new species we shall in the course of our survey meet with cases illustrative of both these processes  the best examples of recent continental islands are great britain and ireland japan formosa and the larger malay islands especially borneo java and celebes and as each of these presents special features of interest we will give a short outline of their zoology and past history in relation to that of the continents from which they have recently been separated commencing with our own islands to which the present chapter will be devoted  recent physical changes in the british islesgreat britain is perhaps the most typical example of a large and recent continental island now to be found upon the globe it is joined to the continent by a shallow bank which extends from denmark to the bay of biscay the 100 fathom line from these extreme points receding from the 333 coasts so as to include the whole of the british isles and about fifty miles beyond them to the westward see map  illustration map showing the shallow bank connecting the british isles with the continent    the light tint indicates a depth of less than 100 fathoms   the figures show the depth in fathoms   the narrow channel between norway and denmark is 2580 feet deep  beyond this line the sea deepens rapidly to the 500 and 1000 fathom lines the distance between 100 and 1000 334 fathoms being from twenty to fifty miles except where there is a great outward curve to include the porcupine bank 170 miles west of galway and to the northwest of caithness where a narrow ridge less than 500 fathoms below the surface joins the extensive bank under 300 fathoms on which are situated the faroe islands and iceland and which stretches across to greenland in the north channel between ireland and scotland and in the minch between the outer hebrides and skye are a series of hollows in the seabottom from 100 to 150 fathoms deep these correspond exactly to the points between the opposing highlands where the greatest accumulations of ice would necessarily occur during the glacial epoch and they may well be termed submarine lakes of exactly the same nature as those which occur in similar positions on land  proofs of former elevationsubmerged forestswhat renders britain particularly instructive as an example of a recent continental island is the amount of direct evidence that exists of several distinct kinds showing that the land has been sufficiently elevated or the sea depressed to unite it with the continentand this at a very recent period the first class of evidence is the existence all round our coasts of the remains of submarine forests often extending far below the present lowwater mark such are the submerged forests near torquay in devonshire and near falmouth in cornwall both containing stumps of trees in their natural position rooted in the soil with deposits of peat branches and nuts and often with remains of insects and other land animals these occur in very different conditions and situations and some have been explained by changes in the height of the tide or by pebble banks shutting out the tidal waters from estuaries but there are numerous examples to which such hypotheses cannot apply and which can only be explained by an actual subsidence of the land or rise of the sealevel since the trees grew  we cannot give a better idea of these forests than by quoting the following account by mr pengelly of a visit to one which had been exposed by a violent storm on the coast of devonshire at blackpool near dartmouth 335  we were so fortunate as to reach the beach at springtide lowwater and to find admirably exposed by far the finest example of a submerged forest which i have ever seen it occupied a rectangular area extending from the small river or stream at the western end of the inlet about one furlong eastward and from the lowwater line thirty yards up the strand the lower or seaward portion of the forest area occupying about twothirds of its entire breadth consisted of a brownish drabcoloured clay which was crowded with vegetable débris such as small twigs leaves and nuts there were also numerous prostrate trunks and branches of trees lying partly imbedded in the clay without anything like a prevalent direction the trunks varied from six inches to upwards of two feet in diameter much of the wood was found to have a reddish or bright pink hue when fresh surfaces were exposed some of it as well as many of the twigs had almost become a sort of ligneous pulp while other examples were firm and gave a sharp crackling sound on being broken several large stumps projected above the clay in a vertical direction and sent roots and rootlets into the soil in all directions and to considerable distances it was obvious that the movement by which the submergence was effected had been so uniform as not to destroy the approximate horizontality of the old forest ground one fine example was noted of a large prostrate trunk having its roots still attached some of them sticking up above the clay while others were buried in it hazelnuts were extremely abundantsome entire others broken and some obviously gnawed it has been stated that the forest area reached the springtide lowwater line hence as the greatest tidal range on this coast amounts to eighteen feet we are warranted in inferring that the subsidence amounted to eighteen feet as a minimum even if we suppose that some of the trees grew in a soil the surface of which was not above the level of high water there is satisfactory evidence that in torbay it was not less than forty feet and that in falmouth harbour it amounted to at least sixtyseven feet79  336  on the coast of the bristol channel similar deposits occur as well as along much of the coast of wales and in holyhead harbour it is believed by geologists that the whole bristol channel was at a comparatively recent period an extensive plain through which flowed the river severn for in addition to the evidence of submerged forests there are on the coast of glamorganshire numerous caves and fissures in the face of high sea cliffs in one of which no less than a thousand antlers of the reindeer were found the remains of animals which had been devoured there by bears and hyænas facts which can only be explained by the existence of some extent of dry land stretching seaward from the present cliffs but since submerged and washed away this plain may have continued down to very recent times since the whole of the bristol channel to beyond lundy island is under twentyfive fathoms deep in the east of england we have a similar forestbed at cromer in norfolk and in the north of holland an old land surface has been found fiftysix feet below highwater mark  buried river channelsstill more remarkable are the buried river channels which have been traced on many parts of our coasts in order to facilitate the study of the glacial deposits of scotland dr james croll obtained the details of about 250 bores put down in all parts of the mining districts of scotland for the purpose of discovering minerals80 these revealed the interesting fact that there are ancient valleys and river channels at depths of from 100 to 260 feet below the present sealevel these old rivers sometimes run in quite different directions from the present lines of drainage connecting what are now distinct valleys and they are so completely filled up and hidden by boulder clay drift and sands that there is no indication of their presence on the surface which often consists of mounds or low hills more than 100 feet high one of these old valleys connects the clyde near dumbarton with the forth at grangemouth and appears to have contained two streams flowing in opposite directions from a watershed about midway at kilsith at 337 grangemouth the old channel is 260 feet below the sealevel the watershed at kilsith is now 160 feet above the sea the old valley bottom being 120 feet deep or forty feet above the sea in some places the old valley was a ravine with precipitous rocky walls which have been found in mining excavations sir a geikie who has himself discovered many similar buried valleys is of opinion that they unquestionably belong to the period of the boulder clay  we have here a clear proof that when these rivers were formed the land must have stood in relation to the sea at least 260 feet higher than it does now and probably much more and this is sufficient to join england to the continent supporting this evidence we have freshwater or littoral shells found at great depths off our coasts mr godwin austen records the dredging up of a freshwater shell unio pictorum off the mouth of the english channel between the fifty fathom and 100 fathom lines while in the same locality gravel banks with littoral shells now lie under sixty or seventy fathoms water81 more recently mr gwyn jeffreys has recorded the discovery of eight species of fossil arctic shells off the shetland isles in about ninety fathoms water all being characteristic shallow water species so that their association at this great depth is a distinct indication of considerable subsidence82  time of last union with the continentthe period when this last union with the continent took place was comparatively recent as shown by the identity of the shells with living species and the fact that the buried river channels are all covered with clays and gravels of the glacial period of such a character as to indicate that most of them were deposited above the sealevel from these and various other indications geologists are all agreed that the last continental period as it is called was subsequent to the greatest development of the ice but probably before the cold epoch had wholly passed away but if so recent we should naturally expect our land still 338 to show an almost perfect community with the adjacent parts of the continent in its natural productions and such is found to be the case all the higher and more perfectly organised animals are with but few exceptions identical with those of france and germany while the few species still considered to be peculiar may be accounted for either by an original local distribution by preservation here owing to favourable insular conditions or by slight modifications having been caused by these conditions resulting in a local race subspecies or species  why britain is poor in speciesthe former union of our islands with the continent is not however the only recent change they have undergone there have been partial submergences to the depth of from one hundred to perhaps three hundred feet over a large part of our country while during the period of maximum glaciation the whole area north of the thames was buried in snow and ice even the south of england must have suffered the rigour of an almost arctic climate since mr clement reid has shown that floating ice brought granite blocks from the channel islands to the coast of sussex such conditions must have almost exterminated our preexisting fauna and flora and it was only during the subsequent union of britain with the continent that the bulk of existing animals and plants could have entered our islands we know that just before and during the glacial period we possessed a fauna almost or quite identical with that of adjacent parts of the continent and equally rich in species the glaciation and submergence destroyed much of this fauna and the permanent change of climate on the passing away of the glacial conditions appears to have led to the extinction or migration of many species in the adjacent continental areas where they were succeeded by the assemblage of animals now occupying central europe when england became continental these entered our country but sufficient time does not seem to have elapsed for the migration to have been completed before subsidence again occurred cutting off the further influx of purely terrestrial animals and leaving us without the number of species which our favourable climate and varied surface entitle us to 339  to this cause we must impute our comparative poverty in mammalia and reptilesmore marked in the latter than the former owing to their lower vital activity and smaller powers of dispersal germany for example possesses nearly ninety species of land mammalia and even scandinavia about sixty while britain has only forty and ireland only twentytwo the depth of the irish sea being somewhat greater than that of the german ocean the connecting land would there probably be of small extent and of less duration thus offering an additional barrier to migration whence has arisen the comparative zoological poverty of ireland this poverty attains its maximum in the reptiles as shown by the following figures    belgium has 22 species of reptiles and amphibia   britain   13                           ireland    4                          where the power of flight existed and thus the period of migration was prolonged the difference is less marked so that ireland has seven bats to twelve in britain and about 110 as against 130 landbirds  plants which have considerable facilities for passing over the sea are somewhat intermediate in proportionate numbers there being about 970 flowering plants and ferns in ireland to 1425 in great britainor almost exactly twothirds a proportion intermediate between that presented by the birds and the mammalia  peculiar british birdsamong our native mammalia reptiles and amphibia it is the opinion of the best authorities that we possess neither a distinct species nor distinguishable variety in birds however the case is different since some of our species in particular our coaltit and longtailed tit present wellmarked differences of colour as compared with continental specimens and in mr dressers work on the birds of europe they are considered to be distinct species while professor newton in his new edition of yarrells british birds does not consider the difference to be sufficiently great or sufficiently constant to warrant this and therefore classes 340 them as insular races of the continental species we have however one undoubted case of a bird peculiar to the british isles in the red grouse lagopus scoticus which abounds in scotland ireland the north of england and wales and is very distinct from any continental species although closely allied to the willow grouse of scandinavia this latter species resembles it considerably in its summer plumage but becomes pure white in winter whereas our species retains its dark plumage throughout the year becoming even darker in winter than in summer we have here therefore a most interesting example of an insular form in our own country but it is difficult to determine how it originated on the one hand it may be an old continental species which during the glacial epoch found a refuge here when driven from its native haunts by the advancing ice or on the other hand it may be a descendant of the northern willow grouse which has lost its power of turning white in winter owing to its long residence in the lowlands of an island where there is little permanent snow and where assimilation in colour to the heather among which it lurks is at all times its best protection in either case it is equally interesting as the one large and handsome bird which is peculiar to our islands notwithstanding their recent separation from the continent  the following is a list of the birds now held to be peculiar to the british isles    1  parus ater sub sp britannicus  closely allied to p ater of                                           the continent a local race or                                           subspecies    2  acredula caudata sub sp rosea  allied to a caudata of the

fishesalthough the productions of fresh waters have generally as mr darwin has shown a wide range fishes appear to form an exception many of them being extremely limited in distribution some are confined to particular river valleys or even to single rivers others inhabit the lakes of a limited district only while some are 341 confined to single lakes often of small area and these latter offer examples of the most restricted distribution of any organisms whatever cases of this kind are found in our own islands and deserve our especial attention it has long been known that some of our lakes possessed peculiar species of trout and charr but how far these were unknown on the continent and how many of those in different parts of our islands were really distinct had not been ascertained till dr günther so well known for his extensive knowledge of the species of fishes obtained numerous specimens from every part of the country and by comparison with all known continental species determined their specific differences the striking and unexpected result has thus been attained that no less than fifteen wellmarked species of freshwater fishes are altogether peculiar to the british islands

ireland  these fifteen peculiar fishes differ from each other and from all british and continental species not in colour only but in such important structural characters as the number and size of the scales form and size of the fins and the form or proportions of the head body or tail some of them like s killinensis and the coregoni are in fact as dr günther assures me just as good and distinct species as any other recognised species of fish it may indeed be objected that until all the small lakes of scandinavia are explored and their fishes compared with ours we cannot be sure that we have any peculiar species but this objection has very little weight if we consider how our own species vary from lake to lake and from island to island so that the orkney species is not found in scotland and only one of the peculiar british species extends to ireland which has no less than five species altogether peculiar to it if the species of our own two islands are thus distinct what reason have we for believing that they will be otherwise than distinct from those of scandinavia at all events with the amount of evidence we already possess of the very restricted ranges of many of our species we must certainly hold them to be peculiar till they have been proved to be otherwise  the great speciality of the irish fishes is very interesting because it is just what we should expect on the theory of evolution in ireland the two main causes of specific changeisolation and altered conditionsare each more powerful than in britain whatever difficulty continental fishes may have in passing over to britain that difficulty will certainly be increased by the second sea passage to ireland and the latter country has been longer isolated for the irish sea with its northern and southern channels is considerably deeper than the german ocean and the 343 eastern half of the english channel so that when the last subsidence occurred ireland would have been an island for some length of time while england and scotland still formed part of the continent again whatever differences have been produced by the exceptional climate of our islands will have been greater in ireland where insular conditions are at a maximum the abundance of moisture and the equability of temperature being far more pronounced than in any other part of europe  among the remarkable instances of limited distribution afforded by these fishes we have the loch stennis trout confined to the little group of lakes in the mainland of orkney occupying altogether an area of about ten miles by three the welsh charr confined to the llanberris lakes about three miles in length grays charr confined to lough melvin about seven miles long while the loch killin charr known only from a small mountain lake in invernessshire and the vendace from the equally small lakes at loch maben in scotland are two examples of restricted distribution which can hardly be surpassed  cause of great speciality in fishesthe reason why fishes alone should exhibit such remarkable local modifications in lakes and islands is sufficiently obvious it is due to the extreme rarity of their transmission from one lake to another just as we found to be the case in oceanic islands where the means of transmission were ample hardly any modification of species occurred while where these means were deficient and individuals once transported remained isolated during a long succession of ages their forms and characters became so much changed as to bring about what we term distinct species or even distinct generaso these lake fishes have become modified because the means by which they are enabled to migrate so rarely occur it is quite in accordance with this view that some of the smaller lakes contain no fishes because none have ever been conveyed to them others contain several and some fishes which have peculiarities of constitution or habits which render their transmission somewhat less difficult occur in several lakes over a wide area of country though only one appears to be common to the british and irish lakes 344  the manner in which fishes are enabled to migrate from lake to lake is unknown but many suggestions have been made it is a fact that whirlwinds and waterspouts sometimes carry living fish in considerable numbers and drop them on the land here is one mode which might certainly have acted now and then in the course of thousands of years and the eggs of fishes may have been carried with even greater ease again we may well suppose that some of these fish have once inhabited the streams that enter or flow out of the lakes as well as the lakes themselves and this opens a wide field for conjecture as to modes of migration because we know that rivers have sometimes changed their courses to such an extent as to form a union with distinct river basins this has been effected either by floods rising over low watersheds by elevations of the land changing lines of drainage or by ice blocking up valleys and compelling the streams to flow over watersheds to find an outlet this is known to have occurred during the glacial epoch and is especially manifest in the case of the parallel roads of glenroy and it probably affords the true solution of many of the cases in which existing species of fish inhabit distinct river basins whether in streams or lakes if a fish thus wandered out of one riverbasin into another it might then retire up the streams to some of the lakes where alone it might find conditions favourable to it by a combination of the modes of migration here indicated it is not difficult to understand how so many species are now common to the lakes of wales cumberland and scotland while others less able to adapt themselves to different conditions have survived only in one or two lakes in a single district or these last may have been originally identical with other forms but have become modified by the particular conditions of the lake in which they have found themselves isolated  peculiar british insectswe now come to the class of insects and here we have much more difficulty in determining what are the actual facts because new species are still being yearly discovered and considerable portions of europe are but imperfectly explored it often happens that an insect is discovered in our islands and for some 345 years britain is its only recorded locality but at length it is found on some part of the continent and not unfrequently has been all the time known there but disguised by another name or by being classed as a variety of some other species this has occurred so often that our best entomologists have come to take it for granted that all our supposed peculiar british species are really natives of the continent and will one day be found there and owing to this feeling little trouble has been taken to bring together the names of such as from time to time remain known from this country only the view of the probable identity of our entire insectfauna with that of the continent has been held by such wellknown authorities as the late mr e c rye and dr d sharp for the beetles and by mr h t stainton for butterflies and moths but as we have already seen that among two orders of vertebratesbirds and fishesthere are undoubtedly peculiar british species it seems to me that all the probabilities are in favour of there being a much larger number of peculiar species of insects in every other island where some of the vertebrates are peculiaras in the azores the canaries the andaman islands and ceylonthe insects show an equal if not a higher proportion of speciality and there seems no reason whatever why the same law should not apply to us our climate is undoubtedly very distinct from that of any part of the continent and in scotland ireland and wales we possess extensive tracts of wild mountainous country where a moist uniform climate an alpine or northern vegetation and a considerable amount of isolation offer all the conditions requisite for the preservation of some species which may have become extinct elsewhere and for the slight modification of others since our last separation from the continent i think therefore that it will be very interesting to take stock as it were of our recorded peculiarities in the insect world for it is only by so doing that we can hope to arrive at any correct solution of the question on which there is at present so much difference of opinion for the list of coleoptera with the accompanying notes i was originally indebted to the late mr e c rye and dr sharp also gave me valuable information as to the recent 346 occurrence of some of the supposed peculiar species on the continent the list has now been revised by the rev canon fowler author of the best modern work on the british coleoptera who has kindly furnished some valuable notes  for the lepidoptera i first noted all the species and varieties marked as british only in staudingers catalogue of european lepidoptera this list was carefully corrected by mr stainton who weeded out all the species known by him to have been since discovered and furnished me with valuable information on the distribution and habits of the species this information often has a direct bearing on the probability of the insect being peculiar to britain and in some cases may be said to explain why it should be so for example the larvæ of some of our peculiar species of tineina feed during the winter which they are enabled to do owing to our mild and insular climate but which the severer continental winters render impossible a curious example of the effect this habit may have on distribution is afforded by one of our commonest british species elachista rufocinerea the larva of which mines in the leaves of holcus mollis and other grasses from december to march this species though common everywhere with us extending to scotland and ireland is quite unknown in similar latitudes on the continent but appears again in italy the south of france and dalmatia where the mild winters enable it to live in its accustomed manner  such cases as this afford an excellent illustration of those changes of distribution dependent probably on recent changes of climate which may have led to the restriction of certain species to our islands for should any change of climate lead to the extinction of the species in south europe where it is far less abundant than with us we should have a common and widespread species entirely restricted to our islands other species feed in the larva state on our common gorse a plant found only in limited portions of western and southern europe and the presence of this plant in a mild and insular climate such as ours may well be supposed to have led to the preservation of some of the numerous species which are or have been dependent on it since the first edition was 347 published many new british species have been discovered while some of the supposed peculiar species have been found on the continent information as to these has been kindly furnished by mr w warren mr c g barrett lord walsingham and other students of british lepidoptera and the firstnamed gentleman has also looked over the proofs  mr mclachlan has kindly furnished me with some valuable information on certain species of trichoptera or caddis flies which seem to be peculiar to our islands and this completes the list of orders which have been studied with sufficient care to afford materials for such a comparison we will now give the list of peculiar british insects beginning with the lepidoptera and adding such notes as have been supplied by the gentlemen already referred to  list of the species or varieties of lepidoptera which so far as at present known are confined to the british islands the figures show the dates when the species was first described species added since the first edition are marked with an asterisk      diurni      1 polyommatus dispar the large copper this fine insect once     common in the fens but now extinct owing to extensive drainage is     generally admitted to be peculiar to our island at all events as a     variety or local form its continental ally differs constantly in being     smaller and in having smaller spots but the difference though     constant is so slight that it is now classed as a variety under the     name of

here a list of eightynine species which according to the best authorities are in the present state of our knowledge peculiar to britain it is a curious fact that no less than fifty of these have been described more than twentyfive years and as during all that time they have not been recognised on the continent notwithstanding that good coloured figures exist of almost all of them it seems highly probable that many of them are really confined to our island at the same time we must not apply this argument too rigidly for the very day before my visit to mr stainton he had received a letter from professor zeller announcing the discovery on the continent of a species of our last family pterophorina which for more than forty years had been considered to be exclusively british this insect platyptilia similidactyla pterophorus isodactylus staintons manual had been taken rarely in the extreme north and south of our islandsteignmouth and orkney a fact which seemed somewhat indicative of its being a straggler again seven of the species are unique that is have only been captured once and it may be supposed that as they are so rare as to have been found only once in england they may be all 351 equally rare and not yet found on the continent but this is hardly in accordance with the laws of distribution widely scattered species are generally abundant in some localities while when a species is on the point of extinction it must for a time be very rare in the single locality where it last maintains itself it is then more probable that some of these unique species represent such as are almost extinct than that they have a wide range and are equally rare everywhere and the peculiarity of our insular climate combined with our varied soil and vegetation offer conditions which may favour the survival of some species with us after they have become extinct on the continent  of the sixtynine species recorded in my first edition fourteen have been since discovered on the continent while no less than twentytwo species and eleven varieties have been added to the list as we can hardly suppose continental entomologists to be less thorough collectors than ourselves it ought to be more and more difficult to find any insects which are unknown on the continent if all ours really exist there and the fact that the list of apparently peculiar british species is an increasing one renders it probable that many of them are not only apparently but really so both general considerations dependent on the known laws of distribution and the peculiar habits conspicuous appearance and restricted range of many of our species alike indicate that some considerable proportion of them will remain permanently as peculiar british species  we will now pass on to the coleoptera or beetles

species  of the sixtyseven species and varieties of beetles in the preceding list a considerable number no doubt owe their presence there to the fact that they have not yet been discovered or recognised on the continent this is almost certainly the case with many of those which have been separated from other species by very minute and obscure characters and especially with the excessively minute trichopterygidæ described by mr matthews there are others however to which this mode of getting rid of them will not apply as they are so marked as to be at once recognised by any competent entomologist and often so plentiful that they can be easily obtained when searched for the peculiar species of apion in the shetland islands is interesting and may be connected with the very peculiar climatal conditions there prevailing which have led in some cases to a change of habits so that a species of weevil otiorhynchus maurus always found on mountain sides in scotland here occurs on the seashore still more curious is the occurrence of two distinct forms a species and a wellmarked variety on the small granitic lundy island in the bristol channel this island is about three miles long and twelve from the coast of devonshire consisting mainly of granite with a little of the devonian formation and the presence here of peculiar insects can only be due to isolation with special conditions and immunity from enemies or competing forms when we consider the similar islands off 355 the coast of scotland and ireland with the isle of man and the scilly islands none of which have been yet thoroughly explored for beetles it is probable that many similar examples of peculiar isolated forms remain to be discovered  looking then at what seem to me the probabilities of the case from the standpoint of evolution and natural selection and giving due weight to the facts of local distribution as they are actually presented to us i am forced to differ from the opinion held by our best entomological authorities and to believe that some at least perhaps many of the species which in the present state of our knowledge appear to be peculiar to our islands are not only apparently but really so peculiar  i am indebted to mr robert mclachlan for the following information on certain trichopterous neuroptera or caddisflies which appear to be confined to our islands the peculiar aquatic habits of the larvæ of these insects some living in ponds or rivers others in lakes and others again only in clear mountain streams render it not improbable that some of them should have become isolated and preserved in our islands or that they should be modified owing to such isolation  trichoptera peculiar to the british isles      1 philopotamus insularis  a variety of p montanusthis can     hardly be termed a british species or variety because so far as at     present known it is peculiar to the island of guernsey it agrees     structurally with p montanus a species found both in britain and on     the continent but it differs in its strikingly yellow colour and less     pronounced markings all the specimens from guernsey are alike and     resident entomologists assured mr mclachlan that no other kind is     known strange to say some examples from jersey differ considerably     resembling the common european and british form even should this     peculiar variety be at some future time found on the continent it would     still be a remarkable fact that the form of insect inhabiting two small     islands only twenty miles apart should constantly differ but as jersey     is between guernsey and the coast it seems just possible that the more     insular conditions and perhaps some peculiarity of the soil and water     in the former island have really led to the production or preservation     of a wellmarked variety of insect in the first edition of this work     two other species were named as then peculiar to britainsetodes     argentipunctella and rhyacophila munda but both have now been taken on     the continent      2 mesophylax impunctatus var zetlandicusa variety of a south     and central european species one specimen of which has been found in     dumfriesshire the variety is distinguished by its small size and dark     colour  356  land and freshwater shellsin the first edition of this work four species were noted as being so far as was then known exclusively british two of these cyclas pisidioides now called sphærium pisidioides and geomalacus maculosus have been discovered on the continent but the other two remain still apparently confined to these islands and to these another has been added by the discovery of a new species of hydrobia in the estuary of the thames the peculiar species now stands as follows      1 limnea involutaa pond snail with a small polished ambercoloured     shell found only in a small alpine lake and its inflowing stream on     cromagloun mountain near the lakes of killarney it was discovered in     1838 and has frequently been obtained since in the same locality it     is sometimes classed as a variety of limnea peregra and is at all     events closely allied to that species      2 hydrobia jenkinsiia small shell of the family rissoidæ inhabiting     the thames estuary both in essex and kent it was discovered only a few     years ago and was first described in 1889      3 assiminea grayanaa small estuarine pulmonobranch found on the     banks of the thames between greenwich and gravesend on mud at the     roots of aquatic plants it has been discovered more than sixty years  but besides the abovenamed species there are a considerable number of wellmarked varieties of shells which seem to be peculiar to our islands a list of these has been kindly furnished me by mr theo d a cockerell who has paid much attention to the subject and after omitting all those whose peculiarities are very slight or whose absence from the continent is doubtful there remain a series of forms some of which are in all probability really endemic with us this is the more probable from the fact that an introduced colony of helix nemoralis at lexington virginia presents numerous varieties among which are several which do not occur in europe84 the following list is therefore given in the hope that it may be useful in calling attention to those varieties which are not yet positively known to occur elsewhere than in our islands and 357 thus lead ultimately to a more accurate knowledge of the facts it is only by obtaining a full knowledge of varieties their distribution and their comparative stability that we can ever hope to detect the exact process by which nature works in the formation of species  list of the species and varieties of land and freshwater shells which so far

but not finding any enumeration of such in the british floras of babington hooker or bentham i applied to the greatest living authority on the distribution of british plantsthe late mr h c watson who very kindly gave me the information i required and i cannot do better than quote his words it may be stated pretty confidently that there is no species generally accepted among botanists as a good species peculiar to the british isles true during the past hundred years nominally new species have been named and described on british specimens only from time to time but these have gradually come to be identified with species described elsewhere under other namesor they have been reduced in rank by succeeding botanists and placed or replaced as varieties of more widely distributed species in his british rubi professor babington includes as good species some halfdozen which he has apparently not identified with any foreign species or variety none of these are accepted as true species nor even as subspecies in the students flora where the brambles are described by baker a botanist well acquainted with the plants of britain and as all these nominal species of rubi are of late creation they have truly never been subjected to real or critical tests as species  in my first edition i was only able to name four species subspecies or varieties of flowering plants which were believed to be unknown on the continent but much attention has of late years been paid to the critical examination of british plants in comparison with continental specimens and i am now enabled to give a much more 360 extensive list of the species or forms which at present seem to be peculiar for the following list i am primarily indebted to mr arthur bennett of croydon sir joseph hooker has been so kind as to examine it carefully and to give me his conclusions on the relative value of the differences of the several forms and mr baker of kew has also assisted with his extensive knowledge of british

potamogeton lanceolatus      three american species sisyrinchium angustifolium spiranthes     romanzoviana eriocaulon septangulare      2 there are sixteen endemic varieties of british species viz

fluviatilis spartium stricta var townsendi  the above twenty species are marked in the list with an asterisk of the remaining fiftyfive sir joseph hooker says that for various reasons it would not be safe to rely on them as evidence in most cases the varietal form is so very trifling a departure from the type that this may be safely set down to a local cause and is probably not constant in others the plant is doubtfully endemic in still others a hybrid  even should it ultimately prove that of the whole number of the fiftyfive doubtful forms none are established as peculiar british varieties the number admitted after so 364 rigorous an examination is about what we should expect in comparison with the limited amount of speciality we have seen to exist in other groups the three american species which inhabit the extreme west and northwest of the british isles but are not found on the continent of europe are especially interesting because they demonstrate the existence of some peculiar conditions such as would help to explain the presence of the other peculiar species whether we suppose these american forms to have migrated from america to europe before the glacial epoch or to be the remnants of a vegetation once spread over the north temperate zone we can only explain their presence with us and not further east by something favourable either in our insular climate or in the limited competition due to our comparative poverty in species  about half of the peculiar forms are found in the extreme west or north of britain or in ireland where peculiar insular conditions are at a maximum and the influence of these conditions is further shown by the number of species of west or south european plants which occur in the same districts  we may here notice the interesting fact that ireland possesses no less than twenty species or subspecies of flowering plants not found in britain and some of these may be altogether peculiar as a whole they show the effect of the preeminently mild and insular climate of ireland in extending the range of some south european species the following list of these plants for which i am indebted to mr a g more with a few remarks on

var hookeri on the shores and islands     of lough neagh and in germany arctic europe and north america  we find here nine southwest european species which probably had a wider range in mild preglacial times and have been preserved in the south and west of ireland owing to its milder climate it must be remembered that during the height of the glacial epoch ireland was continental so that these plants may have followed the retreating ice to their present stations and survived the subsequent depression this seems more probable than that so many species should have reached ireland for the first time during the last union with the continent subsequent to the glacial epoch the arctic alpine and american plants may all be examples of species which once had a wider range and which owing to the more favourable conditions have continued to exist in ireland while becoming extinct in the adjacent parts of britain and western europe  as contrasted with the extreme scarcity of peculiar species among the flowering plants it is the more interesting and unexpected to find a considerable number of peculiar mosses and hepaticæ some of which present us with phenomena of distribution of a very remarkable character for the following lists and the information as to the distribution of the genera and species i am indebted to mr william mitten one of the first authorities

the above are minute or obscure plants and are closely allied to other european species with which they may have been confounded we cannot therefore lay any stress on these individually as being absent from the continent of europe so much of which is imperfectly explored though it is probable that several of them are really confined to britain but there are a fewindicated by italicswhich are in a very different category for they belong to genera which are altogether unknown in any other part of europe and their nearest allies are to be found in the tropics or in the southern hemisphere the four noneuropean genera of mosses to which we refer all have their maximum of development in the andes while the three noneuropean hepaticæ appear to have their maximum in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere mr mitten has kindly furnished me with the following particulars of the distribution of these genera      bartramidula asia africa s america and australia but not europe or     n america      streptopogon is a comparatively small genus with seven species in the     andes one in the himalayas and three in the south temperate zone     besides our english species      daltonia is a large genus of inconspicuous mosses having seventeen     species in the andes two in brazil two in mexico one in the     galapagos six in india and ceylon five in java two in africa and     three in the antarctic islands and one in ireland      hookeria restricting that term to the species referable to     cyclodictyon is still a large genus of handsome and remarkable mosses     having twentysix species in the andes eleven in brazil eight in the     antilles one in mexico two in the pacific islands one in new     zealand one in java one in india and five in africabesides our     british species which is found also in madeira and the azores but in     no part of europe proper  these last two are very remarkable cases of distribution since mr mitten assures me that the plants are so markedly different from all other mosses that they would scarcely be overlooked in europe  the distribution of the noneuropean genera of hepaticæ is as follows      chasmatocolia south america and ireland      acrobolbus a small genus found only in new zealand and the adjacent     islands besides ireland      368 petalophyllum a small genus confined to australia and new     zealand in the southern hemisphere algeria and ireland in the     northern we have also one of the hepaticæmastigophora     woodsiifound in ireland and the himalayas but unknown in any part     of continental europe the genus is most developed in new zealand  these are certainly very interesting facts but they are by no means so exceptional in this group of plants as to throw any doubt upon their accuracy the atlantic islands present very similar phenomena in the rhamphidium purpuratum whose nearest allies are in the west indies and south america and in three species of sciaromium whose only allies are in new zealand tasmania and the andes of bogota an analogous and equally curious fact is the occurrence in the drontheim mountains in central norway of a little group of four or five peculiar species of mosses of the genus mnium which are found nowhere else although the genus extends over europe india and the southern hemisphere but always represented by a very few wideranging species except in this one mountain group85  such facts show us the wonderful delicacy of the balance of conditions which determine the existence of particular species in any locality the spores of mosses and hepaticæ are so minute that they must be continually carried through the air to great distances and we can hardly doubt that so far as its powers of diffusion are concerned any species which fruits freely might soon spread itself over the whole world that they do not do so must depend on peculiarities of habit and constitution which fit the different species for restricted stations and special climatic conditions and according as the adaptation is more general or the degree of specialisation extreme species will have wide or restricted ranges although their fossil remains have been rarely detected we can hardly doubt that mosses have as high an antiquity as ferns or lycopods and coupling this antiquity with their great powers of dispersal we may understand how many of the genera have come to occupy a number of detached areas scattered over the whole earth but 369 always such as afford the peculiar conditions of climate and soil best suited to them the repeated changes of temperature and other climatic conditions which as we have seen occurred through all the later geological epochs combined with those slower changes caused by geographical mutations must have greatly affected the distribution of such ubiquitous yet delicately organised plants as mosses throughout countless ages they must have been in a constant state of comparatively rapid migration driven to and fro by every physical and organic change often subject to modification of structure or habit but always seizing upon every available spot in which they could even temporarily maintain themselves86  here then we have a group in which there is no question of the means of dispersal and where the difficulties that present themselves are not how the species reached the remote localities in which they are now found but rather why they have not established themselves in 370 many other stations which so far as we can judge seem equally suitable to them yet it is a curious fact that the phenomena of distribution actually presented by this group do not essentially differ from those presented by the higher flowering plants which have apparently far less diffusive power as we shall find when we come to treat of the floras of oceanic islands and we believe that the explanation of this is that the life of species and especially of genera is often so prolonged as to extend over whole cycles of such terrestrial mutations as we have just referred to and that thus the majority of plants are afforded means of dispersal which are usually sufficient to carry them into all suitable localities on the globe hence it follows that their actual existence in such localities depends mainly upon vigour of constitution and adaptation to conditions just as it does in the case of the lower and more rapidly diffused groups and only partially on superior facilities for diffusion this important principle will be used further on to afford a solution of some of the most difficult problems in the distribution of plant life87  concluding remarks on the peculiarities of the british fauna and florathe facts now i believe for the first time brought together respecting the peculiarities of the british fauna and flora are sufficient to show that there is considerable scope for the study of geographical distribution even in so apparently unpromising a field as one of the most recent of continental islands looking at the general bearing of these facts they prove that the idea so generally entertained as to the biological identity of the british isles with the adjacent continent is not altogether correct among birds we have undoubted peculiarities in at least three instances peculiar fishes are much more numerous and in this case the fact that the irish species 371 are almost all different from the british and those of the orkneys distinct from those of scotland renders it almost certain that the great majority of the fifteen peculiar british fishes are really peculiar and will never be found on the european continent the mosses and hepaticæ also have been sufficiently collected in europe to render it pretty certain that the more remarkable of the peculiar british forms are not found there why therefore it may be well asked should there not be a proportionate number of peculiar british insects it is true that numerous species have been first discovered in britain and subsequently on the continent but we have many species which have been known for twenty thirty or forty years some of which are not rare with us and yet have never been found on the continent we have also the curious fact of our outlying islands such as the shetland isles the isle of man and the little lundy island possessing each some peculiar forms which certainly do not exist on our principal island which has been so very thoroughly worked analogy therefore would lead us to conclude that many other species or varieties would exist on our islands and not on the continent and when we find that a very large number 150 in three orders only are so recorded we may i think be sure that some considerable portion of these though how many we cannot say are really endemic british species  the general laws of distribution also lead us to expect such phenomena very rare and very local species are such as are becoming extinct and it is among insects which are so excessively varied and abundant which present so many isolated forms and which even on continents afford numerous examples of very rare species confined to restricted areas that we should have the best chance of meeting with every degree of rarity down to the point of almost complete extinction but we know that in all parts of the world islands are the refuge of species or groups which have become extinct elsewhere and it is therefore in the highest degree probable that some species which have ceased to exist on the continent should be preserved in some part or other of our islands especially 372 as these present favourable climatic conditions such as do not exist elsewhere  there is therefore a considerable amount of harmony in the various facts adduced in this chapter as well as a complete accordance with what the laws of distribution in islands would lead us to expect in proportion to the species of birds and freshwater fishes the number of insectforms is enormously great so that the numerous species or varieties here recorded as not yet known on the continent are not to be wondered at while it would i think be almost an anomaly if with peculiar birds and fishes there were not a fair proportion of peculiar insects our entomologists should therefore give up the assumption that all our insects do exist on the continent and will some time or other be found there as not in accordance either with the evidence or the probabilities of the case and when this is done and the interesting peculiarities of some of our smaller islands are remembered the study of our native animals and plants in relation to those of other countries will acquire a new interest the british isles are said to consist of more than a thousand islands and islets how many of these have ever been searched for insects with the case of lundy island before us who shall say that there is not yet scope for extensive and interesting investigations into the british fauna and flora                                        373  chapter xvii

geographical changes of java and borneothe philippine     islandsconcluding remarks on the malay islands  as a representative of recent continental islands situated in the tropics we will take borneo since although perhaps not much more ancient than great britain it presents a considerable amount of speciality and in its relations to the surrounding islands and the asiatic continent offers us some problems of great interest and considerable difficulty  the accompanying map shows that borneo is situated on the eastern side of a submarine bank of enormous extent being about 1200 miles from north to south and 1500 from east to west and embracing java sumatra and the malay peninsula this vast area is all included within the 100 fathom line but by far the larger part of itfrom the gulf of siam to the java seais under fifty fathoms or about the same depth as the sea that separates our own island from the continent the distance from borneo to the southern extremity of the malay peninsula is about 350 miles and it is nearly as far from sumatra and java while it is more than 600 miles from the siamese peninsula opposite to which its long northern coast extends there is i believe nowhere else upon the globe an island so far from a continent yet separated from it by so shallow a sea recent changes of sea and land must have occurred here on a grand scale and this adds to the interest attaching to the study of this large island  374  illustration map of borneo and java showing the great submarine bank of southeastern asia    the light tint shows a less depth than 100 fathoms   the figures show the depth of the sea in fathoms  375 the internal geography of borneo is somewhat peculiar a large portion of its surface is lowland consisting of great alluvial valleys which penetrate far into the interior while the mountains except in the north are of no great elevation and there are no extensive plateaux a subsidence of 500 feet would allow the sea to fill the great valleys of the pontianak banjarmassing and coti rivers almost to the centre of the island greatly reducing its extent and causing it to resemble in form the island of celebes to the east of it  in geological structure borneo is thoroughly continental possessing formations of all ages with basalt and crystalline rocks but no recent volcanoes it possesses vast beds of coal of tertiary age and these no less than the great extent of alluvial deposits in its valleys indicate great changes of level in recent geological times  having thus briefly indicated those physical features of borneo which are necessary for our inquiry let us turn to the organic world  neither as regards this great island nor those which surround it have we the amount of detailed information in a convenient form that is required for a full elucidation of its past history we have however a tolerable acquaintance with the two higher groupsmammalia and birds both of borneo and of all the surrounding countries and to these alone will it be necessary to refer in any detail the most convenient course and that which will make the subject easiest for the reader will be to give first a connected sketch of what is known of the zoology of borneo itself with the main conclusions to which they point and then to discuss the mutual relations of some of 376 the adjacent islands and the series of geographical changes that seem required to explain them  zoological features of borneo  mammalianearly a hundred and forty species of mammalia have been discovered in borneo and of these more than threefourths are identical with those of the surrounding countries and more than one half with those of the continent among these are two lemurs nine civets five cats five deer the tapir the elephant the rhinoceros and many squirrels an assemblage which could certainly only have reached the country by land the following species of mammalia are supposed to be peculiar to borneo    quadrumana   1 simia morio a small

spadiceus   29 hipposideros doriæ  of the twentynine peculiar species here enumerated it is possible that a few may be found to be identical with those of malacca or sumatra but there are also four peculiar genera which are less likely to be discovered elsewhere these are nasalis the remarkable longnosed monkey rheithrosciurus a peculiar form of squirrel and trichys a tailless porcupine these peculiar forms do not however imply that the separation of the island from the continent is of very ancient date for the country is so vast and 377 so much of the once connecting land is covered with water that the amount of speciality is hardly if at all greater than occurs in many continental areas of equal extent and remoteness this will be more evident if we consider that borneo is as large as the indochinese peninsula or as the indian peninsula south of bombay and if either of these countries were separated from the continent by the submergence of the whole area north of them as far as the himalayas they would be found to contain quite as many peculiar genera and species as borneo actually does now a more decisive test of the lapse of time since the separation took place is to be found in the presence of a number of representative species closely allied to those of the surrounding countries such as the tailed monkeys and the numerous squirrels these relationships however are best seen among the birds which have been more thoroughly collected and more carefully studied than the mammalia  birdsabout 580 species of birds are now known to inhabit borneo of which 420 species are landbirds88 one hundred and eight species are supposed to be peculiar to the island and of these one half have been noted either by count salvadori or mr everett as being either representative species of or closely allied to birds inhabiting other islands or countries the majority of these are as might be expected allied to species inhabiting the surrounding countries especially sumatra the malay peninsula or java a smaller number having their representative forms in the philippine islands or celebes but there is another group of eight species whose nearest allies are found in such remote lands as ceylon north india burma or china these last have been indicated in the following list by a double star  while those which are representative of forms found in the immediately surrounding

distribution of asiatic birds he states that 125 per cent of the land birds of burmah and tenasserim are peculiar species whereas we find that in borneo they are about 25 per cent and the difference may fairly be imputed to the greater proportion of slightly modified representative species due to a period of complete isolation of peculiar genera the indochinese peninsula has oneampeliceps a remarkable yellowcrowned starling with bare pinkcoloured orbits while two others temnurus and crypsirhinasingular birds allied to the jaysare found in no other part of the asiatic continent though they occur in some of the malay islands borneo has seven peculiar genera of passeres89 as well as hæmatortyx a crested partridge and lobiophasis a pheasant hardly distinct from euplocamus while two others pityriasis an extraordinary bareheaded bird between a jay and a shrike and carpococcyx a pheasantlike ground cuckoo formerly thought to be peculiar are said to have been discovered also in sumatra  the insects and landshells of borneo and of the surrounding countries are too imperfectly known to enable us to arrive at any accurate results with regard to their distribution they agree however with the birds and mammals in their general approximation to malayan forms but the number of peculiar species is perhaps larger  the proportion here shown of less than onefourth peculiar species of mammalia and fully onefourth peculiar species of landbirds teaches us that the possession of the power of flight affects but little the distribution of 381 landanimals and gives us confidence in the results we may arrive at in those cases where we have from whatever cause to depend on a knowledge of the birds alone and if we consider the wide range of certain groups of powerful flightas the birds of prey the swallows and swifts the kingcrows and some others we shall be forced to conclude that the majority of forestbirds are restricted by even narrow watery barriers to an even greater extent than mammalia  the affinities of the bornean faunathe animals of borneo exhibit an almost perfect identity in general character and a close similarity in species with those of sumatra and the malay peninsula so great is this resemblance that it is a question whether it might not be quite as great were the whole united for the extreme points of borneo and sumatra are 1500 miles apartas far as from madrid to constantinople or from the missouri valley to california in such an extent of country we always meet with some local species and representative forms so that we hardly require any great lapse of time as an element in the production of the peculiarities we actually find so far as the forms of life are concerned borneo as an island may be no older than great britain for the time that has elapsed since the glacial epoch would be amply sufficient to produce such a redistribution of the species consequent on their mutual relations being disturbed as would bring the islands into their present zoological condition there are however other facts to be considered which seem to imply much greater and more complex revolutions than the recent separation of borneo from sumatra and the malay peninsula and that these changes must have been spread over a considerable lapse of time in order to understand what these changes probably were we must give a brief sketch of the fauna of java the peculiarities of which introduce a new element into the question we have to discuss 382  java  the rich and beautiful island of java interesting alike to the politician the geographer and the naturalist is more especially attractive to the student of geographical distribution because it furnishes him with some of the most curious anomalies and difficult problems in a place where such would be least expected as java forms with sumatra one almost unbroken line of volcanoes and volcanic mountains interrupted only by the narrow straits of sunda we should naturally expect a close resemblance between the productions of the two islands but in point of fact there is a much greater difference between them than between sumatra and borneo so much further apart and so very unlike in physical features90 java differs from the three great land massesborneo sumatra and the malay peninsula far more than either of these do from each other and this is the first anomaly we encounter but a more serious difficulty than this remains to be stated java has certain close resemblances to the siamese peninsula and also to the himalayas which borneo and sumatra do not exhibit to so great a proportionate extent and looking at the relative position of these lands respectively this seems most incomprehensible in order fully to appreciate the singularity and difficulty of the problem it will be necessary to point out the exact nature and amount of these peculiarities in the fauna of java  general character of the fauna of javaif we were only to take account of the number of peculiar species in java and the relations of its fauna generally to that of the surrounding lands we might pass it over as a less interesting island than borneo or sumatra its mammalia ninety species are nearly as numerous as those of borneo but are apparently less peculiar none of the genera and only five or six of the species being confined to the island in landbirds it is decidedly less rich having only 300 species of which about fortyfive are peculiar and only one 383 or two belong to peculiar genera so that here again the amount of speciality is considerably less than in borneo it is only when we proceed to analyse the species of the javan fauna and trace their distribution and affinities that we discover its interesting nature  difference between the fauna of java and that of the other great malay islandscomparing the fauna of java with that which may be called the typical malayan fauna as exhibited in borneo sumatra and the malay peninsula we find the following differences no less than thirteen genera of mammalia each of which is known to inhabit at least two and generally all three of the abovenamed malayan countries are totally absent from java and they include such important forms as the elephant the tapir and the malay bear it cannot be said that this difference depends on imperfect knowledge for java is one of the oldest european settlements in the east and has been explored by a long succession of dutch and english naturalists every part of it is thoroughly well known and it would be almost as difficult to find a new mammal of any size in europe as in java of birds there are twentyfive genera all typically malayan and occurring at least in two and for the most part in all three of the malay countries which are yet absent from java most of these are large and conspicuous forms such as jays gapers beeeaters woodpeckers hornbills cuckoos parrots pheasants and partridges as impossible to have remained undiscovered in java as the large mammalia above referred to  besides these absent genera there are some curious illustrations of javan isolation in the species there being several cases in which the same species occurs in all three of the typical malay countries while in java it is represented by an allied species these occur chiefly among birds there being no less than seven species which are common to the three great malay countries but are represented in java by distinct though closely allied species  from these facts it is impossible to doubt that java has had a history of its own quite distinct from that of the other portions of the malayan area 384  special relations of the javan fauna to that of the asiatic continentthese relations are indicated by comparatively few examples but they are very clear and of great importance among mammalia the genus helictis is found in java but in no other malay country though it inhabits also north india while two species rhinoceros javanicus and lepus kurgosa are natives of indochinese countries and java but not of typical malaya in birds there are five genera or subgenerazoothera notodela crypsirhina allotrius and cochoa which inhabit java the himalayas and indochina all but the last extending south to tenasserim but none of them occurring in malacca sumatra or borneo there are also two species of birdsa trogon harpactes oreskios and the javanese peacock pavo muticus which inhabit only java and the indochinese countries the former reaching tenasserim and the latter perak in the malay peninsula  here then we find a series of remarkable similarities between java and the asiatic continent quite independent of the typical malay countriesborneo sumatra and the malay peninsula which latter have evidently formed one connected land and thus appear to preclude any independent union of java and siam  the great difficulty in explaining these facts is that all the required changes of sea and land must have occurred within the period of existing species of mammalia sumatra borneo and malacca have as we have seen a great similarity as regards their species of mammals and birds while java though it differs from them in so curious a manner has no greater degree of speciality since its species when not malayan are almost all north indian or siamese  there is however one consideration which may help us over this difficulty it seems highly probable that in the equatorial regions species have changed less rapidly than in the north temperate zone on account of the equality and stability of the equatorial climate we have seen in chapter x how important an agent in producing extinction and modification of species must have been the repeated changes from cold to warm and from warm to cold 385 conditions with the migrations and crowding together that must have been their necessary consequence but in the lowlands near the equator these changes would be very little if at all felt and thus one great cause of specific modification would be wanting let us now see whether we can sketch out a series of not improbable changes which may have brought about the existing relations of java and borneo to the continent  past geographical changes of java and borneoalthough java and sumatra are mainly volcanic they are by no means wholly so sumatra possesses in its great mountain masses ancient crystalline rocks with much granite while there are extensive tertiary deposits of eocene age overlying which are numerous beds of coal now raised up many thousand feet above the sea91 the volcanoes appear to have burst through these older mountains and to have partly covered them as well as great areas of the lowlands with the products of their eruptions in java either the fundamental strata were less extensive and less raised above the sea or the period of volcanic action has been of longer duration for here no crystalline rocks have been found except a few boulders of granite in the western part of the island perhaps the relics of a formation destroyed by denudation or covered up by volcanic deposits in the southern part of java however there is an extensive range of low mountains about 3000 feet high consisting of basalt with limestone apparently of miocene age  during this last named period then java would have been at least 3000 feet lower than it is now and such a depression would probably extend to considerable parts of sumatra and borneo so as to reduce them all to a few small islands at some later period a gradual elevation occurred which ultimately united the whole of the islands with the continent this may have continued till the glacial period of the northern hemisphere during the severest part of which a few himalayan species of birds and mammals may have been driven southward and 386 have ranged over suitable portions of the whole area java then became separated by subsidence and these species were imprisoned in the island while those in the remaining part of the malayan area again migrated northward when the cold had passed away from their former home the equatorial forests of borneo sumatra and the malay peninsula being more especially adapted to the typical malayan fauna which is there developed in rich profusion a little later the subsidence may have extended farther north isolating borneo and sumatra in which a few other indian or indochinese forms have been retained but probably leaving the malay peninsula as a ridge between them as far as the islands of banca and biliton other slight changes of climate followed when a further subsidence separated these lastnamed islands from the malay peninsula and left them with two or three species which have since become slightly modified we may thus explain how it is that a species is sometimes common to sumatra and borneo while the intervening island banca possesses a distinct form92  in my geographical distribution of animals vol i p 357 i have given a somewhat different hypothetical explanation of the relations of java and borneo to the continent in which i took account of changes of land and sea only but a fuller consideration of the influence of changes of climate on the migration of animals has led me to the much simpler and i think more probable explanation above given the amount of the relationship between java and siam as well as of that between java and the himalayas is too small to be well accounted for by an independent geographical connection in which borneo and sumatra did not take part it is at the same time too distinct and indisputable to be ignored and a change of climate which should drive a portion of the himalayan fauna southward leaving a few species in java and borneo from which they could not return owing to the subsequent isolation of those islands by subsidence seems 387 to be a cause exactly adapted to produce the kind and amount of affinity between these distant countries that actually exists  the philippine islands  a general account of the fauna of these islands and of their biological relations to the countries which form the subject of this chapter has been given in my geographical distribution of animals vol i pp 345349 but since the publication of that work considerable additions have been made to their fauna having the effect of somewhat diminishing their isolation from the other islands four genera have been added to the terrestrial mammaliacrocidura felis pteromys and mus as well as two additional squirrels while the black ape cynopithecus niger has been struck out as not inhabiting the philippines this brings the true land mammalia to twentyone species of which fourteen are peculiar to the islands but to these we must add no less than thirtythree species of bats of which only ten are peculiar93 in these estimates the palawan 388 group has been omitted as these islands contain so many bornean species that if included they obscure the special features of the fauna  birdsthe late marquis of tweeddale made a special study of philippine birds and in 1873 published a catalogue in the transactions of the zoological society vol ix pt 2 pp 125247 but since that date large collections have been made by everett steere and other travellers the result of which has been to more than double the known species and to render the ornithological fauna an exceedingly rich one many of the malayan genera which were thought to be absent when the first edition of this work was published have since been discovered among which are phyllornis criniger diceum prionochilus and batrachostomus but there still remain a large number of highly characteristic malayan genera whose absence gives a distinctive feature to the philippine bird fauna among these are tiga and meiglyptes genera of woodpeckers phænicophaes and centropus remarkable cuckoos the longtailed paroquets palæornis all the genera of barbets except xantholæma the small but beautiful family eurylæmidæ many genera allied to timalia and ixos the mynahs gracula the longtailed flycatchers tchitrea the firebacked pheasants euplocamus the argus pheasants the junglefowl and many others  the following tabular statement will illustrate the rapid growth of our

very large there being about 300 land and fortytwo water birds which are not 389 known to occur beyond the group we have here still more pronounced than in the case of borneo the remarkable fact of the true land birds presenting a larger amount of speciality than the land mammals for while more than fourfifths of the birds are peculiar only a little more than half the mammals are so and if we exclude the bats only twothirds  the general character of the fauna of this group of islands is evidently the result of their physical conditions and geological history the philippines are almost surrounded by deep sea but are connected with borneo by means of two narrow submarine banks on the northern of which is situated palawan and on the southern the sulu islands two small groups of islands the bashees and babuyanes have also afforded a partial connection with the continent by way of formosa it is evident that the philippines once formed part of the great malayan extension of asia but that they were separated considerably earlier than java and having been since greatly isolated and much broken up by volcanic disturbances their species have for the most part become modified into distinct local forms representative species often occurring in the different islands of the group they have also received a few chinese types by the route already indicated and a few australian forms owing to their proximity to the moluccas their comparative poverty in genera and species of the mammalia is perhaps due to the fact that they have been subjected to a great amount of submersion in recent times greatly reducing their area and causing the extinction of a considerable portion of their fauna this is not a mere hypothesis but is supported by direct evidence for i am informed by mr everett who has made extensive explorations in the islands that almost everywhere are found large tracts of elevated coralreefs containing shells similar to those living in the adjacent seas an indisputable proof of recent elevation  concluding remarks on the malay islandsthis completes our sketch of the great malay islands the seat of the typical malayan fauna it has been shown that the peculiarities presented by the individual islands may be all 390 sufficiently well explained by a very simple and comparatively unimportant series of geographical changes combined with a limited amount of change of climate towards the northern tropic beginning in late miocene times when the deposits on the south coast of java were upraised we suppose a general elevation of the whole of the extremely shallow seas uniting what are now sumatra java borneo and the philippines with the asiatic continent and forming that extended equatorial area in which the typical malayan fauna was developed after a long period of stability giving ample time for the specialisation of so many peculiar types the philippines were first separated then at a considerably later period java a little later sumatra and borneo and finally the islands south of singapore to banca and biliton this one simple series of elevations and subsidences combined with the changes of climate already referred to and such local elevations and depressions as must undoubtedly have occurred appears sufficient to have brought about the curious and at first sight puzzling relations of the faunas of java and the philippines as compared with those of the larger islands  we will now pass on to the consideration of two other groups which offer features of special interest and which will complete our illustrative survey of recent continental islands                                        391  chapter xviii  japan and formosa      japan its position and physical featureszoological features of

japanese islands occupy a very similar position on the eastern shore of the great euroasiatic continent to that of the british islands on the western except that they are about sixteen degrees further south and having a greater extension in latitude enjoy a more varied as well as a more temperate climate their outline is also much more irregular and their mountains loftier the volcanic peak of fusiyama being 14177 feet high while their geological structure is very complex their soil extremely fertile and their vegetation in the highest degree varied and beautiful like our own islands too they are connected with the continent by a marine bank less than a hundred fathoms below the surfaceat all events towards the north and south but in the intervening space the sea of japan opens out to a width of six hundred miles and in its central portion is very deep and this may be an indication that the connection between the islands and the continent is of rather ancient date at the straits of corea the distance from the main land is about 120 miles while at the northern extremity of yesso it is about 200 the island of saghalien however separated from yesso by a strait only twentyfive miles wide forms a connection with amoorland in about 52° n lat a southern warm current flowing a little to the eastward of the islands ameliorates their climate much in the same way as the gulf stream does ours and added to their insular position enables them to support a more tropical vegetation and more varied forms of life than are found at corresponding latitudes in china  392  illustration map of

japanas we might expect from the conditions here sketched out japan exhibits in all its forms of animal life a close general resemblance to the adjacent continent but with a considerable element of specific individuality while it also possesses some remarkable isolated groups its fauna presents indications of there having been two or more lines of migration at different epochs the majority of its animals are related to those of the temperate or cold regions of the continent either as identical or allied species but a smaller number have a tropical character and these have in several instances no allies in china but occur again only in northern india or the malay archipelago there is also a slight american element in the fauna of japan a relic probably of the period when a land communication existed between the two continents over what are now the shallow seas of japan ochotsk and kamschatka we will now proceed to examine the peculiarities and relations of the fauna  mammaliathe mammalia of japan at present known are forty in number not very many when compared with the rich fauna of china and manchuria but containing monkeys bears deer wild goats and wild boars as well as foxes badgers moles squirrels and hares so that there can be no doubt whatever that they imply a land connection with the continent no complete account of japan mammals has been given by any competent zoologist since the publication of von siebolds fauna japonica in 1844 394 but by collecting together most of the scattered observations since that period the following list has been drawn up and will it is hoped be of use to naturalists the species believed to be peculiar to japan are printed in italics these are very numerous but it must be remembered that corea and manchuria the portions of the continent opposite japan are comparatively little known while in very few cases have the species of japan and of the continent been critically compared where this has been done however the peculiar species established by the older naturalists have been in many cases found to be correct  list of the mammalia of the japanese islands      1 macacus speciosus a monkey with rudimentary tail and red face     allied to the barbary ape it inhabits the island of niphon up to 41°     n lat and has thus the most northern range of any living monkey      2 pteropus dasymallus a peculiar

mizura günth allied to t wogura      13 urotrichus talpoides a peculiar genus of moles confined to     japan an american species has been named urotrichus gibsii and mr     lord after comparing the two says that he can find no difference     whatever either generic or specific in shape size and colour they     are exactly alike but dr günther p z s 1880 p 441 states     that u gibsii differs so much in dentition from the japanese species     that it should be placed in a distinct genus which he calls     neurotrichus      14 sorex myosurus a shrew found also in india and malaya      15 sorex

wild boar allied to s taeranus of formosa  we thus find that no less than twentysix out of the fortyone japanese mammals are peculiar and if we omit the aërial bats nine in number as well as the marine seaotter we shall have remaining only thirty strictly land mammalia of which twentyfive are peculiar or fivesixths of the whole nor does this represent all their speciality for we have a mole differing in its dentition from the european mole another superficially resembling but quite distinct from an american species a peculiar genus of otters and an antelope whose nearest allies are in formosa and sumatra the importance of these facts will 396 be best understood when we have examined the corresponding affinities of the birds of japan  birdsowing to the recent researches of some english residents we have probably a fuller knowledge of the birds than of the mammalia yet the number of true landbirds ascertained to inhabit the islands either as residents or migrants is only 200 which is less than might be expected considering the highly favourable conditions of mild climate luxuriant vegetation and abundance of insectlife and the extreme riches of the adjacent continentmr swinhoes list of the birds of china containing more than 400 land species after deducting all which are peculiar to the adjacent islands only seventeen species or about onetwelfth of the whole are now considered to be peculiar to japan proper while seventeen more are peculiar to the various outlying small islands constituting the bonin and loo choo groups even of these six or seven are classed by mr seebohm as probably subspecies or slightly modified forms of continental birds so that ten only are wellmarked species undoubtedly distinct from those of any other country  the great majority of the birds are decidedly temperate forms identical with those of northern asia and europe while no less than forty of the species of landbirds are also found in britain or are such slight modifications of british species that the difference is only perceptible to a trained ornithologist the following list of the landbirds common to britain and japan is very interesting when we consider that these

species from our own have the same general appearance and give a familiar aspect to the ornithology there remains however a considerable body of chinese and siberian species which link the islands to

species in the outlying bonin and loo choo islands is an interesting feature of japanese ornithology the comparative remoteness of 399 these islands their mild subtropical climate and luxuriant vegetation and perhaps the absence of violent storms and their being situated out of the line of continental migration seem to be the conditions that have favoured the specialisation of modified types adapted to the new environment  japan birds recurring in distant areasthe most interesting feature in the ornithology of japan is undoubtedly the presence of several species which indicate an alliance with such remote districts as the himalayas the malay islands and europe among the peculiar species the most remarkable of this class arethe fruitpigeon of the genus treron entirely unknown in china but reappearing in formosa and japan the hypsipetes whose nearest ally is in south china at a distance of nearly 500 miles and the jay garrulus japonicus whose near ally g glandarius inhabits europe only at a distance of 3700 miles but even more extraordinary are the following nonpeculiar speciesspizaetus orientalis a crested eagle inhabiting the himalayas formosa and japan but unknown in southern or eastern china ceryle guttata a spotted kingfisher almost confined to the himalayas and japan though occurring rarely in central china and halcyon coromanda a brilliant red kingfisher inhabiting northern india the malay islands to celebes formosa and japan we have here an excellent illustration of the favourable conditions which islands afford both for species which elsewhere live further south halcyon coromanda and for the preservation in isolated colonies of species which are verging towards extinction for such we must consider the abovenamed eagle and kingfisher both confined to a very limited area on the continent but surviving in remote islands referring to our account of the birth growth and death of a species in chapter iv it can hardly be doubted that the ceryle guttata formerly ranged from the himalayas to japan and has now almost died out in the intervening area owing to geographical and physical changes a subject which will be better discussed when we have examined the interesting fauna of the island of formosa 400  the other orders of animals are not yet sufficiently known to enable us to found any accurate conclusions upon them the main facts of their distribution have already been given in my geographical distribution of animals vol i pp 227231 and they sufficiently agree with the birds and mammalia in showing a mixture of temperate and tropical forms with a considerable proportion of peculiar species owing to the comparatively easy passage from the northern extremity of japan through the island of saghalien to the mainland of asia a large number of temperate forms of insects and birds are still able to enter the country and thus diminish the proportionate number of peculiar species in the case of mammals this is more difficult and the large proportion of specific difference in their case is a good indication of the comparatively remote epoch at which japan was finally separated from the continent how long ago this separation took place we cannot of course tell but we may be sure it was much longer than in the case of our own islands and therefore probably in the earlier portion of the pliocene period  formosa  among recent continental islands there is probably none that surpasses in interest and instructiveness the chinese island named by the portuguese formosa or the beautiful till quite recently it was a terra incognita to naturalists and we owe almost all our present knowledge of it to a single man the late mr robert swinhoe who in his official capacity as one of our consuls in china visited it several times between 1856 and 1866 besides residing on it for more than a year during this period he devoted all his spare time and energy to the study of natural history more especially of the two important groups birds and mammals and by employing a large staff of native collectors and hunters he obtained a very complete knowledge of its fauna in this case too we have the great advantage of a very thorough knowledge of the adjacent parts of the continent in great part due to mr swinhoes own exertions during the twenty years of his service in 401 that country we possess too the further advantage of having the whole of the available materials in these two classes collected together by mr swinhoe himself after full examination and comparison of specimens so that there is probably no part of the world if we except europe north america and british india of whose warmblooded vertebrates we possess fuller or more accurate knowledge than we do of those of the coast districts of china and its islands95  physical features of formosathe island of formosa is nearly half the size of ireland being 220 miles long and from twenty to eighty miles wide it is traversed down its centre by a fine mountain range which reaches an altitude of about 8000 feet in the south and 12000 feet in the northern half of the island and whose higher slopes and valleys are everywhere clothed with magnificent forests it is crossed by the line of the tropic of cancer a little south of its centre and this position combined with its lofty mountains gives it an unusual variety of tropical and temperate climates these circumstances are all highly favourable to the preservation and development of animal life and from what we already know of its productions it seems probable that few if any islands of approximately the same size and equally removed from a continent will be found to equal it in the number and variety of their higher animals the outline map at page 392 shows that formosa is connected with the mainland by a submerged bank the hundredfathom line including it along with hainan to the southwest and japan on the northeast while the line of twohundred fathoms includes also the madjicosima and loochoo islands and may perhaps mark out approximately the last great extension of the asiatic continent the submergence of which isolated these islands from the mainland  animal life of formosawe are at present acquainted 402 with 35 species of mammalia and 128 species of landbirds from formosa fourteen of the former and fortythree of the latter being peculiar while the remainder inhabit also some part of the continent or adjacent islands this proportion of peculiar species is perhaps as regards the birds the highest to be met with in any island which can be classed as both continental and recent and this in all probability implies that the epoch of separation is somewhat remote it was not however remote enough to reach back to a time when the continental fauna was very different from what it is now for we find all the chief types of living asiatic mammalia represented in this small island thus we have monkeys insectivora numerous carnivora pigs deer antelopes and cattle among ungulata numerous rodents and the edentate manisa very fair representation of asiatic mammals all being of known genera and of species either absolutely identical with some still living elsewhere or very closely allied to them the birds exhibit analogous phenomena with the exception that we have here two peculiar and very interesting genera  but besides the amount of specific and generic modification that has occurred we have another indication of the lapse of time in the peculiar relations of a large proportion of the formosan animals which show that a great change in the distribution of asiatic species must have taken place since the separation of the island from the continent before pointing these out it will be advantageous to give lists of the mammalia and peculiar birds of the island as we shall have frequent occasion to refer to them  list of the mammalia of formosa the peculiar species are printed in italics       1 macacus cyclopis a

manis dalmanni scaly anteater china and the himalayas  the most interesting and suggestive feature connected with these formosan mammals is the identity or affinity of several of them with indian or malayan rather than with chinese species we have the rockmonkey of formosa allied to the rhesus monkeys of india and burma not to those of south china and hainan the tree civet helictis subaurantiaca and the small flying squirrel sciuropterus kaleensis are both allied to himalayan species swinhoes deer and goatantelope are nearest to malayan species as are the red and whitebreasted flying squirrels while the fruitbat the wild pig 404 and the spotted deer are all allied to peculiar japanese species the clouded tiger is a malay species unknown in china while the asiatic wild cat is a native of the himalayas and malacca it is clear therefore that before formosa was separated from the mainland the above named animals or their ancestral types must have ranged over the intervening country as far as the himalayas on the west japan on the north and borneo or the philippines on the south and that after that event occurred the conditions were so materially changed as to lead to the extinction of these species in what are now the coast provinces of china while they or their modified descendants continued to exist in the dense forests of the himalayas and the malay islands and in such detached islands as formosa and japan we will now see what additional light is thrown upon this subject by an examination of the birds  list of the land birds peculiar to formosa      turdidÆ

himalayas south india the malay islands or japan rather than in the adjacent parts of the asiatic continent fourteen species have himalayan allies and six of these belong to genera which are unknown in china one has its nearest ally in the nilgherries and five in the malay islands and of these six four belong to genera which are not chinese two have their only near allies in japan perhaps more curious still are those cases in which though the genus is chinese the nearest allied species is to be sought for in some remote region thus we have the formosan babbler garrulax ruficeps not allied to the species found in south china but to one inhabiting north india and east thibet while the black bulbul hypsipetes nigerrimus is not allied to the chinese species but to an assamese form  in the same category as the above we must place eight species not peculiar to formosa but which are indian or malayan rather than chinese so that they offer examples of discontinuous distribution somewhat analogous to what 407 we found to occur in japan these are enumerated in the following list  species of birds common to formosa and india or malaya but not found in china  1 siphia superciliaris the rufousbreasted flycatcher of the s e himalayas  2 halcyon coromanda the great red kingfisher of india malaya and japan  3 palumbus pulchricollis the darjeeling woodpigeon of the s e himalayas  4 turnix dussumieri the larger buttonquail of india  5 spizaetus nipalensis the spotted hawkeagle of nepal and assam  6 lophospiza trivirgata the crested goshawk of the malay islands  7 bulaca newarensis the brown woodowl of the himalayas  8 strix candida the grassowl of india and malaya  the most interesting of the above are the pigeon and the flycatcher both of which are so far as yet known strictly confined to the himalayan mountains and formosa they thus afford examples of discontinuous specific distribution exactly parallel to that of the great spotted kingfisher already referred to as found only in the himalayas and japan  comparison of the faunas of hainan formosa and japanthe island of hainan on the extreme south of china and only separated from the mainland by a strait fifteen miles wide appears to have considerable similarity to formosa inasmuch as it possesses seventeen peculiar landbirds out of 130 obtained by mr swinhoe two of which are close allies of formosan species while two others are identical we also find four species whose nearest allies are in the himalayas our knowledge of this island and of the adjacent coast of china is not yet sufficient to enable us to form an accurate judgment of its relations but it seems probable that it was separated from the continent at approximately the same epoch as formosa and japan and that the special features of each of these islands are mainly due to their geographical position formosa being more completely isolated than either of the others possesses a larger proportion of peculiar species of birds while its tropical situation and lofty mountain ranges 408 have enabled it to preserve an unusual number of himalayan and malayan forms japan almost equally isolated towards the south and having a much greater variety of climate as well as a much larger area possesses about an equal number of mammalia with formosa and an even larger proportion of peculiar species its birds however though more numerous are less peculiar and this is probably due to the large number of species which migrate northwards in summer and find it easy to enter japan through the kurile isles or saghalien96 japan too is largely peopled by those northern types which have an unusually wide range and which being almost all migratory are accustomed to cross over seas of moderate extent the regular or occasional influx of these species prevents the formation of special insular races such as are almost always produced when a portion of the population of a species remains for a considerable time completely isolated we thus have explained the curious fact that while the mammalia of the two islands are almost equally peculiar those of japan being most so in the present state of our knowledge the birds of formosa show a far greater number of peculiar species than those of japan  general remarks on recent continental islandswe have now briefly sketched the zoological peculiarities of an illustrative series of recent continental islands commencing with one of the most recentgreat britainin which the process of formation of peculiar species has only just commenced and terminating with formosa probably one of the most ancient of the series and which accordingly presents us with a very large proportion of peculiar species not only in its mammalia which have no means of crossing the wide strait which separates it from the mainland but also in its birds many of which are quite able to cross over  here too we obtain a glimpse of the way in which 409 species die out and are replaced by others which quite agrees with what the theory of evolution assures us must have occurred on a continent the process of extinction will generally take effect on the circumference of the area of distribution because it is there that the species comes into contact with such adverse conditions or competing forms as prevent it from advancing further a very slight change will evidently turn the scale and cause the species to contract its range and this usually goes on till it is reduced to a very restricted area and finally becomes extinct it may conceivably happen and almost certainly has sometimes happened that the process of restriction of range by adverse conditions may act in one direction only and over a limited district so as ultimately to divide the specific area into two separated parts in each of which a portion of the species will continue to maintain itself we have seen that there is reason to believe that this has occurred in a very few cases both in north america and in northern asia see pp 6568 but the same thing has certainly occurred in a considerable number of cases only it has resulted in the divided areas being occupied by representative forms instead of by the very same species the cause of this is very easy to understand we have already shown that there is a large amount of local variation in a considerable number of species and we may be sure that were it not for the constant intermingling and intercrossing of the individuals inhabiting adjacent localities this tendency to local variation in adaptation to slightly different conditions would soon form distinct races but as soon as the area is divided into two portions the intercrossing is stopped and the usual result is that two closely allied races classed as representative species become formed such pairs of allied species on the two sides of a continent or in two detached areas are very numerous and their existence is only explicable on the supposition that they are descendants of a parent form which once occupied an area comprising that of both of themthat this area then became discontinuousand lastly that as a consequence of the discontinuity the two sections of the parent species became segregated into distinct races or new species 410  now when the division of the area leaves one portion of the species in an island a similar modification of the species either in the island or in the continent occurs resulting in closelyallied but distinct forms and such forms are as we have seen highly characteristic of islandfaunas but islands also favour the occasional preservation of the unchanged speciesa phenomenon which very rarely occurs in continents this is probably due to the absence of competition in islands so that the parent species there maintains itself unchanged while the continental portion by the force of that competition is driven back to some remote mountain area where it also obtains a comparative freedom from competition thus may be explained the curious fact that the species common to formosa and india are generally confined to limited areas in the himalayas or in other cases are found only in remote islands as japan or hainan  the distribution and affinities of the animals of continental islands thus throws much light on that obscure subjectthe decay and extinction of species while the numerous and delicate gradations in the modification of the continental species from perfect identity through slight varieties local forms and insular races to welldefined species and even distinct genera afford an overwhelming mass of evidence in favour of the theory of descent with modification  we shall now pass on to another class of islands which though originally forming parts of continents were separated from them at very remote epochs this antiquity is clearly manifested in their existing faunas which present many peculiarities and offer some most curious problems to the student of distribution                                        411  chapter xix  ancient continental islands the madagascar group      remarks on ancient continental islandsphysical features of

south     africapreponderance of ferns in the mascarene floraconcluding     remarks on the madagascar group  we have now to consider the phenomena presented by a very distinct class of islandsthose which although once forming part of a continent have been separated from it at a remote epoch when its animal forms were very unlike what they are now such islands preserve to us the record of a bygone worldof a period when many of the higher types had not yet come into existence and when the distribution of others was very different from what prevails at the present day the problem presented by these ancient islands is often complicated by the changes they themselves have undergone since the period of their separation a partial subsidence will have led to the 412 extinction of some of the types that were originally preserved and may leave the ancient fauna in a very fragmentary state while subsequent elevations may have brought it so near to the continent that some immigration even of mammalia may have taken place if these elevations and subsidences occurred several times over though never to such an extent as again to unite the island with the continent it is evident that a very complex result might be produced for besides the relics of the ancient fauna we might have successive immigrations from surrounding lands reaching down to the era of existing species bearing in mind these possible changes we shall generally be able to arrive at a fair conjectural solution of the phenomena of distribution presented by these ancient islands  undoubtedly the most interesting of such islands and that which exhibits their chief peculiarities in the greatest perfection is madagascar and we shall therefore enter somewhat fully into its biological and physical history  physical features of madagascarthis great island is situated about 250 miles from the east coast of africa and extends from 12° to 25½° s lat it is almost exactly 1000 miles long with an extreme width of 360 and an average width of more than 260 miles a lofty granitic plateau from eighty to 160 miles wide and from 3000 to 5000 feet high occupies its central portion on which rise peaks and domes of basalt and granite to a height of nearly 9000 feet and there are also numerous extinct volcanic cones and craters all round the island but especially developed on the south and west are plains of a few hundred feet elevation formed of rocks which are shown by their fossils to be of jurassic age or at all events to belong to somewhere near the middle portion of the secondary period the higher granitic plateau consists of bare undulating moors while the lower secondary plains are more or less wooded and there is here also a continuous belt of dense forest varying from six or eight to fifty miles wide encircling the whole island usually at about thirty miles distance from the coast but in the northeast coming down to the seashore 413  illustration  414  the sea around madagascar when the shallow bank on which it stands is passed is generally deep this 100fathom bank is only from one to three miles wide on the east side but on the west it is much broader and stretches out opposite mozambique to a distance of about eighty miles the mozambique channel is rather more than 1000 fathoms deep but there is only a narrow belt of this depth opposite mozambique and still narrower where the comoro islands and adjacent shoals seem to form steppingstones to the continent of africa the 1000fathom line includes aldabra and the small farquhar islands to the north of madagascar while to the east the sea deepens rapidly to the 1000fathom line and then more slowly a profound channel of 2400 fathoms separating madagascar from bourbon and mauritius to the northeast of mauritius are a series of extensive shoals forming four large banks less than 100 fathoms below the surface while the 1000fathom line includes them all with an area about half that of madagascar itself a little further north is the seychelles group also standing on an extensive 1000fathom bank while all round the sea is more than 2000 fathoms deep  it seems probable then that to the northeast of madagascar there was once a series of very large islands separated from it by not very wide straits while eastward across the indian ocean we find the chagos and maldive coral atolls perhaps marking the position of other large islands which together would form a line of communication by comparatively easy stages of 400 or 500 miles each between madagascar and india these submerged islands as shown in our map at p 424 are of great importance in explaining some anomalous features in the zoology of this great island  if the rocks of secondary age which form a belt around the island are held to indicate that madagascar was once of less extent than it is now though this by no means necessarily follows we have also evidence that it has recently been considerably larger for along the east coast there is an extensive barrier coralreef about 350 miles in length and varying in distance from the land from a quarter of a mile to three or four miles this seems to indicate recent subsidence while we have no record of raised coral rocks inland which would certainly mark any recent elevation though fringing coral reefs surround a considerable portion of the northern eastern and southwestern coasts we may therefore conclude that during tertiary times the island was usually as large as and often probably much larger than it is now 415  illustration map of the madagascar group showing depths of sea  in this map the depth of the sea is shown by three tints the lightest tint indicating from 0 to 100 fathoms the medium tint from 100 to 1000 fathoms the dark tint more than 1000 fathoms  416  biological features of madagascarmadagascar possesses an exceedingly rich and beautiful fauna and flora rivalling in some groups most tropical countries of equal extent and even when poor in species of surpassing interest from the singularity the isolation or the beauty of its forms of life in order to exhibit the full peculiarity of its natural history and the nature of the problems it offers to the biological student we must give an outline of its more important animal forms in systematic order  mammaliamadagascar possesses no less than sixtysix species of mammalsa certain proof in itself that the island has once formed part of a continent but the character of these animals is very extraordinary and altogether different from the assemblage now found in africa or in any other existing continent africa is now most prominently characterised by its monkeys apes and baboons by its lions leopards and hyænas by its zebras rhinoceroses elephants buffaloes giraffes and numerous species of antelopes but no one of these animals nor any thing like them is found in madagascar and thus our first impression would be that it could never have been united with the african continent but as the tigers the bears the tapirs the deer and the numerous squirrels of asia are equally absent there seems no probability of its having been united with that continent let us then see to what groups the mammalia of madagascar belong and where we must look for their probable allies  first and most important are the lemurs consisting of six genera and thirtythree species thus comprising just half the entire mammalian population of the island this group of lowlyorganised and very ancient creatures 417 still exists scattered over a wide area but they are nowhere so abundant as in the island of madagascar they are found from west africa to india ceylon and the malay archipelago consisting of a number of isolated genera and species which appear to maintain their existence by their nocturnal and arboreal habits and by haunting dense forests it can hardly be said that the african forms of lemurs are more nearly allied to those of madagascar than are the asiatic the whole series appearing to be the disconnected fragments of a once more compact and extensive group of animals  next we have about a dozen species of insectivora consisting of one shrew a group distributed over all the great continents and five genera of a peculiar family centetidæ which family exists nowhere else on the globe except in the two largest west indian islands cuba and hayti thus adding still further to our embarrassment in seeking for the original home of the madagascar fauna  we then come to the carnivora which are represented by a peculiar catlike animal cryptoprocta forming a distinct family and having no close allies in any part of the globe and eight civets belonging to four peculiar genera here we first meet with some decided indications of an african origin for the civet family is more abundant in this continent than in asia and some of the madagascar genera seem to be decidedly allied to african groupsas for example eupleres to suricata and crossarchus97  the rodents consist only of four rats and mice of peculiar genera one of which is said to be allied to an american genus and lastly we have a riverhog of the african genus potamochærus and a small subfossil hippopotamus both of which being semiaquatic animals might easily have reached the island from africa by way of the comoros without any actual land connection98  reptiles of madagascarpassing over the birds for the present as not so clearly demonstrating 418 landconnection let us see what indications are afforded by the reptiles the large and universally distributed family of colubrine snakes is represented in madagascar not by african or asiatic genera but by two american generaphilodryas and heterodon and by herpetodryas a genus found in america and china the other genera are all peculiar and belong mostly to widespread tropical families but two familieslycodontidæ and viperidæ both abundant in africa and the eastern tropicsare absent lizards are mostly represented by peculiar genera of african or tropical families but several african genera are represented by peculiar species and there are also some species belonging to two american genera of the iguanidæ a family which is exclusively american while a genus of geckoes inhabiting america and australia also occurs in madagascar  relation of madagascar to africathese facts taken all together are certainly very extraordinary since they show in a considerable number of cases as much affinity with america as with africa while the most striking and characteristic groups of animals now inhabiting africa are entirely wanting in madagascar let us first deal with this fact of the absence of so many of the most dominant african groups the explanation of this deficiency is by no means difficult for the rich deposits of fossil mammals of miocene or pliocene age in france germany greece and northwest india have demonstrated the fact that all the great african mammals then inhabited europe and temperate asia we also know that a little earlier in eocene times tropical africa was cut off from europe and asia by a sea stretching from the atlantic to the bay of bengal at which time africa must have formed a detached islandcontinent such as australia is now and probably like it very poor in the higher forms of life coupling these two facts the inference seems clear that all the higher types of mammalia were developed in the great euroasiatic continent which then included northern africa and that they only migrated into tropical africa when the two continents became united by the upheaval of the seabottom probably 419 in the latter portion of the miocene or early in the pliocene period99  it is clear therefore that if madagascar had once formed part of africa but had been separated from it before africa was united to europe and asia it would not contain any of those kinds of animals which then first entered the country but besides the african mammals we know that some birds now confined to africa then inhabited europe and we may therefore fairly assume that all the more important groups of birds reptiles and insects now abundant in africa but absent from madagascar formed no part of the original african fauna but entered the country only after it was joined to europe and asia  early history of africa and madagascarwe have seen that madagascar contains an abundance of mammals and that most of them are of types either peculiar to or existing also in africa it follows that that continent must have had an earlier union with europe asia or america or it could never have obtained any mammals at all  420 now these ancient african mammals are lemurs insectivora and small carnivora chiefly viverridæ and all these groups are known to have inhabited europe in eocene and miocene times and that the union was with europe rather than with america is clearly proved by the fact that even the insectivorous centetidæ now confined to madagascar and the west indies inhabited france in the lower miocene period while the viverridæ or civets which form so important a part of the fauna of madagascar as well as of africa were abundant in europe throughout the whole tertiary period but are not known to have ever lived in any part of the american continent we here see the application of the principle which we have already fully proved and illustrated chapter iv p 60 that all extensive groups have a wide range at the period of their maximum development but as they decay their area of distribution diminishes or breaks up into detached fragments which one after another disappear till the group becomes extinct those animal forms which we now find isolated in madagascar and other remote portions of the globe all belong to ancient groups which are in a decaying or nearly extinct condition while those which are absent from it belong to more recent and more highlydeveloped types which range over extensive and continuous areas but have had no opportunity of reaching the more ancient continental islands  anomalies of distribution and how to explain themif these considerations have any weight it follows that there is no reason whatever for supposing any former direct connection between madagascar and the greater antilles merely because the insectivorous centetidæ now exist only in these two groups of islands for we know that the ancestors of this family must once have had a much wider range which almost certainly extended over the great northern continents we might as reasonably suppose a landconnection across the pacific to account for the camels of asia having their nearest existing allies in the llamas and alpacas of the peruvian andes and another between sumatra and brazil in order that the ancestral tapir of one country might have passed over to the other in both 421 these cases we have ample proof of the former wide extension of the group extinct camels of numerous species abounded in north america in miocene pliocene and even postpliocene times and one has also been found in northwestern india but none whatever among all the rich deposits of mammalia in europe we are thus told as clearly as possible that from the north american continent as a centre the camel tribe spread westward over nowsubmerged land at the shallow behring straits and kamschatka sea into asia and southward along the andes into south america tapirs are even more interesting and instructive their remotest known ancestors appear in western europe in the early portion of the eocene period in the latter eocene and the miocene other forms occur both in europe and north america these seem to have become extinct in north america while in europe they developed largely into many forms of true tapirs which at a much later period found their way again to north and thence to south america where their remains are found in caves and gravel deposits it is an instructive fact that in the eastern continent where they were once so abundant they have dwindled down to a single species existing in small numbers in the malay peninsula sumatra and borneo only while in the western continent where they are comparatively recent immigrants they occupy a much larger area and are represented by three or four distinct species who could possibly have imagined such migrations and extinctions and changes of distribution as are demonstrated in the case of the tapirs if we had only the distribution of the existing species to found an opinion upon such cases as theseand there are many others equally strikingshow us with the greatest distinctness how nature has worked in bringing about the examples of anomalous distribution that everywhere meet us and we must on every ground of philosophy and common sense apply the same method of interpretation to the more numerous instances of anomalous distribution we discover among such groups as reptiles birds and insects where we rarely have any direct evidence of their past migrations through the discovery of 422 fossil remains whenever we can trace the past history of any group of terrestrial animals we invariably find that its actual distribution can be explained by migrations effected by means of comparatively slight modifications of our existing continents in no single case have we any direct evidence that the distribution of land and sea has been radically changed during the whole lapse of the tertiary and secondary periods while as we have already shown in our fifth chapter the testimony of geology itself if fairly interpreted upholds the same theory of the stability of our continents and the permanence of our oceans yet so easy and pleasant is it to speculate on former changes of land and sea with which to cut the gordian knot offered by anomalies of distribution that we still continually meet with suggestions of former continents stretching in every direction across the deepest oceans in order to explain the presence in remote parts of the globe of the same genera even of plants or of insectsorganisms which possess such exceptional facilities both for terrestrial aërial and oceanic transport and of whose distribution in early geological periods we generally know little or nothing  the birds of madagascar as indicating a supposed lemurian continenthaving thus shown how the distribution of the land mammalia and reptiles of madagascar may be well explained by the supposition of a union with africa before the greater part of its existing fauna had reached it we have now to consider whether as some ornithologists think the distribution and affinities of the birds present an insuperable objection to this view and require the adoption of a hypothetical continentlemuriaextending from madagascar to ceylon and the malay islands  there are about one hundred and fifty land birds known from the island of madagascar of which a hundred and twentyseven are peculiar and about half of these peculiar species belong to peculiar genera many of which are extremely isolated so that it is often difficult to class them in any of the recognised families or to determine their affinities to any living birds100 among the other moiety 423 belonging to known genera we find fifteen which have undoubted african affinities while five or six are as decidedly oriental the genera or nearest allied species being found in india or the malay islands it is on the presence of these peculiar indian types that dr hartlaub in his recent work on the birds of madagascar and the adjacent islands lays great stress as proving the former existence of lemuria while he considers the absence of such peculiar african families as the plantaineaters glossystarlings oxpeckers barbets honeyguides hornbills and bustardsbesides a host of peculiar african generaas sufficiently disproving the statement in my geographical distribution of animals that madagascar is more nearly related to the ethiopian than to any other region and that its fauna was evidently mainly derived from africa  but the absence of the numerous peculiar groups of african birds is so exactly parallel to the same phenomenon among mammals that we are justified in imputing it to the same cause the more especially as some of the very groups that are wantingthe plantaineaters and the trogons for exampleare actually known to have inhabited europe along with the large mammalia which subsequently migrated to africa as to the peculiarly eastern generasuch as copsychus and hypsipetes with a dicrurus a ploceus a cisticola and a scops all closely allied to indian or malayan speciesalthough very striking to the ornithologist they certainly do not outweigh the fourteen african genera found in madagascar their presence may moreover be accounted for more satisfactorily than by means of an ancient lemurian continent which even if granted would not explain the very facts adduced in its support  let us first prove this latter statement  the supposed lemuria must have existed if at all at so remote a period that the higher animals did not then inhabit either africa or southern asia and it must have 424 become partially or wholly submerged before they reached those countries otherwise we should find in madagascar many other animals besides lemurs insectivora and viverridæ especially such active arboreal creatures as monkeys and squirrels such hardy grazers as deer or antelopes or such wideranging carnivores as foxes or bears this obliges us to date the disappearance of the hypothetical continent about the earlier part of the miocene epoch at latest for during the latter part of that period we know that such animals existed in abundance in every part of the great northern continents wherever we have found organic remains but the oriental birds in madagascar by whose presence dr hartlaub upholds the theory of a lemuria are slightly modified forms of existing indian genera or sometimes as dr hartlaub himself points out species hardly distinguishable from those of india now all the evidence at our command leads us to conclude that even if these genera and species were in existence in the early miocene period they must have had a widely different distribution from what they have now along with so many african and indian genera of mammals they then probably inhabited europe which at that epoch enjoyed a subtropical climate and this is rendered almost certain by the discovery in the miocene of france of fossil remains of trogons and junglefowl if then these indian birds date back to the very period during which alone lemuria could have existed that continent was quite unnecessary for their introduction into madagascar as they could have followed the same track as the mammalia of miocene europe and asia while if as i maintain they are of more recent date then lemuria had ceased to exist and could not have been the means of their introduction  submerged islands between madagascar and indialooking at the accompanying map of the indian ocean we see that between madagascar and india there are now extensive shoals and coral reefs such as are usually held to indicate subsidence and we may therefore fairly postulate the former existence here of several large islands some of them not much inferior to madagascar itself these reefs are all separated from each other by very deep 425 seamuch deeper than that which divides madagascar from africa and we have therefore no reason to imagine their former union but they would nevertheless greatly facilitate the introduction of indian birds into the mascarene islands and madagascar and these facilities existing such an immigration would be sure to take place just as surely as american birds have entered the galapagos and juan fernandez as european birds now reach the azores and as australian birds reach such a distant island as new zealand this would take place the more certainly because the indian ocean is a region of violent periodical storms at the changes of the monsoons and we have seen in the case of the azores and bermuda how important a factor this is in determining the transport of birds across the ocean  illustration map of the indian ocean  showing the position of banks less than 1000 fathoms deep between africa and the indian peninsula  426  the final disappearance of these now sunken islands does not in all probability date back to a very remote epoch and this exactly accords with the fact that some of the birds as well as the fruitbats of the genus pteropus are very closely allied to indian species if not actually identical others being distinct species of the same genera the fact that not one closelyallied species or even genus of indian or malayan mammals is found in madagascar sufficiently proves that it is no landconnection that has brought about this small infusion of indian birds and bats while we have sufficiently shown that when we go back to remote geological times no landconnection in this direction was necessary to explain the phenomena of the distribution of the lemurs and insectivora a landconnection with some continent was undoubtedly necessary or there would have been no mammalia at all in madagascar and the nature of its fauna on the whole no less than the moderate depth of the intervening strait and the comparative approximation of the opposite shores clearly indicate that the connection was with africa  concluding remarks on lemuriai have gone into this question in some detail because dr hartlaubs criticism on my views has been reproduced in a scientific periodical101 and the supposed lemurian continent is constantly referred to by quasiscientific writers as well as by naturalists and geologists as if its existence had been demonstrated by facts or as if it were absolutely necessary to postulate such a land in order to account for the entire series of phenomena connected with the madagascar fauna and especially with the distribution of the lemuridæ102 i 427 think i have now shown on the other hand that it was essentially a provisional hypothesis very useful in calling attention to a remarkable series of problems in geographical distribution but not affording the true solution of those problems any more than the hypothesis of an atlantis solved the problems presented by the atlantic islands and the relations of the european and north american flora and fauna the atlantis is now rarely introduced seriously except by the absolutely unscientific having received its deathblow by the chapter on oceanic islands in the origin of species and the researches of professor asa gray on the affinities of the north american and asiatic floras but lemuria still keeps its placea good example of the survival of a provisional hypothesis which offers what seems an easy solution of a difficult problem and has received an appropriate and easily remembered name long after it has been proved to be untenable  it is now more than fifteen years since i first showed by a careful examination of all the facts to be accounted for that the hypothesis of a lemurian continent was alike unnecessary to explain one portion of the facts and inadequate to explain the remaining portion103 since that time i have seen no attempt even to discuss the question on general grounds in opposition to my views nor on the other hand have those who have hitherto supported the hypothesis taken any opportunity of acknowledging its weakness and inutility i have therefore here explained my reasons for rejecting it somewhat more fully and in a more popular form in the hope that a check may thus be placed on the continued restatement of this unsound theory as if it were one of the accepted conclusions of modern science  428  the mascarene islands104in the geographical distribution of animals a summary is given of all that was known of the zoology of the various islands near madagascar which to some extent partake of its peculiarities and with it form the malagasy subregion of the ethiopian region as no great additions have since been made to our knowledge of the fauna of these islands and my object in this volume being more especially to illustrate the mode of solving distributional problems by means of the most suitable examples i shall now confine myself to pointing out how far the facts presented by these outlying islands support the views already enunciated with regard to the origin of the madagascar fauna  the comoro islandsthis group of islands is situated nearly midway between the northern extremity of madagascar and the coast of africa the four chief islands vary between sixteen and forty miles in length the largest being 180 miles from the coast of africa while one or two smaller islets are less than 100 miles from madagascar all are volcanic great comoro being an active volcano 8500 feet high and as already stated they are situated on a submarine bank with less than 500 fathoms soundings connecting madagascar with africa there is reason to believe however that these islands are of comparatively recent origin and that the bank has been formed by matter ejected by the volcanoes or by upheaval anyhow there is no indication whatever of there having been here a landconnection between madagascar and africa while the islands themselves have been mainly colonised from madagascar some of them making a near approach to the 100fathom bank which surrounds that island  the comoros contain two land mammals a lemur and a civet both of madagascar genera and the latter an identical species and there is also a peculiar species of fruitbat pteropus comorensis a group which ranges from australia to asia and madagascar but is unknown in africa of landbirds fortyone species are known of 429 which sixteen are peculiar to the islands twentyone are found also in madagascar and three found in africa and not in madagascar while of the peculiar species six belong to madagascar or mascarene genera a species of chameleon is also peculiar to the islands  these facts point to the conclusion that the comoro islands have been formerly more nearly connected with madagascar than they are now probably by means of intervening islets and the former extension of the latter island to the westward as indicated by the extensive shallow bank at its northern extremity so as to allow of the easy passage of birds and the occasional transmission of small mammalia by means of floating trees105  the seychelles archipelagothis interesting group consists of about thirty small islands situated 700 miles nne of madagascar or almost exactly in the line formed by continuing the central ridge of that great island the seychelles stand upon a rather extensive shallow bank the 100fathom line around them enclosing an area nearly 200 miles long by 100 miles wide while the 500fathom line shows an extension of nearly 100 miles in a southern direction all the larger islands are of granite with mountains rising to 3000 feet in mahé and to from 1000 to 2000 feet in several of the other islands we can therefore hardly doubt that they form a portion of the great line of upheaval which produced the central granitic mass of madagascar intervening points being indicated by the amirantes the providence and the farquhar islands which though all coralline probably rest on a granitic basis deep channels of more than 1000 fathoms now separate these islands from each other and if they were ever sufficiently elevated to be united it was probably at a very remote epoch  the seychelles may thus have had ample facilities for receiving from madagascar such immigrants as can pass over narrow seas and on the other hand they were equally favourably situated as regards the extensive saya de malha and cargados banks which were probably once 430 large islands and may have supported a rich insular flora and fauna of mixed mascarene and indian type the existing fauna and flora of the seychelles must therefore be looked upon as the remnants which have survived the partial submergence of a very extensive island and the entire absence of nonaërial mammalia may be due either to this island having never been actually united to madagascar or to its having since undergone so much submergence as to have led to the extinction of such mammals as may once have inhabited it the birds and reptiles however though few in number are very interesting and throw some further light on the past history of the seychelles  birds of the seychellesfifteen indigenous landbirds are known to inhabit the group thirteen of which are peculiar species106 belonging to genera which occur also in madagascar or africa the genera which are more peculiarly indian arecopsychus and hypsipetes also found in madagascar and palæornis which has species in mauritius and rodriguez as well as one on the continent of africa a black parrot coracopsis congeneric with two species that inhabit madagascar and with one that is peculiar to the comoros and a beautiful redheaded blue pigeon alectorænas pulcherrimus allied to those of madagascar and mauritius but very distinct are the most remarkable species characteristic of this group of islands  reptiles and amphibia of the seychellesthe reptiles and amphibia are rather numerous and very interesting indicating clearly that the islands can hardly be classed as oceanic there are seven species of lizards three being peculiar to the islands while the others have rather a wide range the first is a chameleondefenceless 431 slowmoving lizards especially abundant in madagascar from which no less than eighteen species are now known about the same number as on the continent of africa the seychelles species chamæleon tigris also occurs at zanzibar the next are skinks scincidæ small groundlizards with a wide distribution in the eastern hemisphere two species are however peculiar to the islandsmabuia seychellensis and m wrightii the other peculiar species is one of the geckoes geckotidæ named Æluronyx seychellensis and there are also three other geckoes phelsuma madagascarensis gehyra mutilata and hemidactylus frenatus the two latter having a wide distribution in the tropical regions of both hemispheres these lizards clinging as they do to trees and timber are exceedingly liable to be carried in ships from one country to another and i am told by dr günther that some are found almost every year in the london docks it is therefore probable that when species of this family have a very wide range they have been assisted in their migrations by man though their habit of clinging to trees also renders them likely to be floated with large pieces of timber to considerable distances dr percival wright to whom i am indebted for much information on the productions of the seychelles archipelago informs me that the lastnamed species varies greatly in colour in the different islands so that he could always tell from which particular island a specimen had been brought this is analogous to the curious fact of certain lizards on the small islands in the mediterranean being always very different in colour from those of the mainland usually becoming rich blue or black see nature vol xix p 97 and we thus learn how readily in some cases differences of colour are brought about either directly or indirectly by local conditions  snakes as is usually the case in small or remote islands are far less numerous than lizards only two species being known one dromicus seychellensis is a peculiar species of the family colubridæ the rest of the genus being found in madagascar and south america the other boodon geometricus one of the lycodontidæ or fanged groundsnakes is also peculiar so far then as the reptiles are 432 concerned there is nothing but what is easily explicable by what we know of the general means of distribution of these animals  we now come to the amphibia which are represented in the seychelles by two tailless and two serpentlike forms the frogs are rana mascareniensis found also in mauritius bourbon angola and abyssinia and probably all over tropical africa and megalixalus seychellensis a peculiar treefrog having allies in madagascar and tropical africa it is found dr wright informs me on the pandani or screwpines and as these form a very characteristic portion of the vegetation of the mascarene islands all the species being peculiar and confined each to a single island or small group we may perhaps consider it as a relic of the indigenous fauna of that more extensive land of which the present islands are the remains  the serpentine amphibia are represented by two species of cæcilia these creatures externally resemble large worms except that they have a true head with jaws and rudimentary eyes while internally they have of course a true vertebrate skeleton they live underground burrowing by means of the ringlike folds of the skin which simulate the jointed segments of a worms body and when caught they exude a viscid slime the young have external gills which are afterwards replaced by true lungs and this peculiar metamorphosis shows that they belong to the amphibia rather than to the reptiles the cæcilias are widely but very sparingly distributed through all the tropical regions a fact which may as we have seen be taken as an indication of the great antiquity of the group and that it is now verging towards extinction in the seychelles islands there appear to be three species of these singular animals cryptopsophis multiplicatus is confined to the islands herpele squalostoma is found also in western india and in africa while hypogeophis rostratus inhabits both west africa and south america107 this last is certainly one of the most remarkable cases of the wide and discontinuous distribution of a species and 433 when we consider the habits of life of these animals and the extreme slowness with which it is likely they can migrate into new areas we can hardly arrive at any other conclusion than that this species once had an almost worldwide range and that in the process of dying out it has been left stranded as it were in these three remote portions of the globe the extreme stability and long persistence of specific form which this implies is extraordinary but not unprecedented among the lower vertebrates the crocodiles of the eocene period differ but slightly from those of the present day while a small freshwater turtle from the pliocene deposits of the siwalik hills is absolutely identical with a still living indian species emys tectus the mudfish of australia ceratodus forsteri is a very ancient type and may well have remained specifically unchanged since early tertiary times it is not therefore incredible that this seychelles cæcilia may be the oldest land vertebrate now living on the globe dating back to the early part of the tertiary period when the warm climate of the northern hemisphere in high latitudes and the union of the asiatic and american continents allowed of the migration of such types over the whole northern hemisphere from which they subsequently passed into the southern hemisphere maintaining themselves only in certain limited areas where the physical conditions were especially favourable or where they were saved from the attacks of enemies or the competition of higher forms  freshwater fishesthe only other vertebrates in the seychelles are two freshwater fishes abounding in the streams and rivulets one haplochilus playfairii is peculiar to the islands but there are allied species in madagascar it is a pretty little fish about four inches long of an olive colour with rows of red spots and is very abundant in some of the mountain streams the fishes of this genus as i am informed by dr günther often inhabit both sea and fresh water so that their migration from 434 madagascar to the seychelles and subsequent modification offers no difficulty the other species is fundulus orthonotus found also on the east coast of africa and as both belong to the same familycyprinodontidæthis may possibly have migrated in a similar manner  landshellsthe only other group of animals inhabiting the seychelles which we know with any approach to completeness are the land and freshwater mollusca but they do not furnish any facts of special interest about forty species are known and mr geoffrey nevill who has studied them thinks their meagre number is chiefly owing to the destruction of so much of the forests which once covered the islands seven of the speciesand among them one of the most conspicuous achatina fulicahave almost certainly been introduced and the remainder show a mixture of madagascar and indian forms with a preponderance of the latter five generastreptaxis cyathoponea onchidium helicina and paludomus are mentioned as being especially indian while only twotropidophora and gibbus are found in madagascar but not in india108 about twothirds of the species appear to be peculiar to the islands  mauritius bourbon and rodriguezthese three islands are somewhat out of place in this chapter because they really belong to the oceanic group being of volcanic formation surrounded by deep sea and possessing no indigenous mammals or amphibia yet their productions are so closely related to those of madagascar to which they may be considered as attendant satellites that it is absolutely necessary to associate them together if we wish to comprehend and explain their many interesting features  mauritius and bourbon are lofty volcanic islands evidently of great antiquity they are about 100 miles apart and the sea between them is less than 1000 fathoms deep while on each side it sinks rapidly to depths of 2400 and 2600 fathoms we have therefore no reason to believe that they have ever been connected with 435 madagascar and this view is strongly supported by the character of their indigenous fauna of this however we have not a very complete or accurate knowledge for though both islands have long been occupied by europeans the study of their natural products was for a long time greatly neglected and owing to the rapid spread of sugar cultivation the virgin forests and with them no doubt many native animals have been almost wholly destroyed there is however no good evidence of there ever having been any indigenous mammals or amphibia though both are now found and are often recorded among the native animals109  the smaller and more remote island rodriguez is also volcanic but it has besides a good deal of coralline rock an indication of partial submergence helping to account for the poverty of its fauna and flora it stands on a 100fathom bank of considerable extent but beyond this the 436 sea rapidly deepens to more than 2000 fathoms so that it is truly oceanic like its larger sister isles  birdsthe living birds of these islands are few in number and consist mainly of peculiar species of mascarene types together with two peculiar generaoxynotus belonging to the campephagidæ or caterpillarcatchers a family abundant in the oldworld tropics and a dove trocazza forming a peculiar subgenus the origin of these birds offers no difficulty looking at the position of the islands and of the surrounding shoals and islets  extinct birdsthese three islands are however preeminently remarkable as having been the home of a group of large groundbirds quite incapable of flight and altogether unlike anything found elsewhere on the globe and which though once very abundant have become totally extinct within the last two hundred years the best known of these birds is the dodo which inhabited mauritius while allied species certainly lived in bourbon and rodriguez abundant remains of the species of the latter islandthe solitaire having been discovered corresponding with the figure and description given of it by legouat who resided in rodriguez in 1692 these birds constitute a distinct family dididæ allied to the pigeons but very isolated they were quite defenceless and were rapidly exterminated when man introduced dogs pigs and cats into the island and himself sought them for food the fact that such perfectly unprotected creatures survived in great abundance to a quite recent period in these three islands only while there is no evidence of their ever having inhabited any other countries whatever is itself almost demonstrative that mauritius bourbon and rodriguez are very ancient but truly oceanic islands from what we know of the general similarity of miocene birds to living genera and families it seems clear that the origin of so remarkable a type as the dodos must date back to early tertiary times if we suppose some ancestral groundfeeding pigeon of large size to have reached the group by means of intervening islands afterwards submerged and to have thenceforth remained to increase and multiply unchecked by the attacks of any more 437 powerful animals we can well understand that the wings being useless would in time become almost aborted110 it is also not improbable that this process would be aided by natural selection because the use of wings might be absolutely prejudicial to the birds in their new home those that flew up into trees to roost or tried to cross over the mouths of rivers might be blown out to sea and destroyed especially during the hurricanes which have probably always more or less devastated the islands while on the other hand the more bulky and shortwinged individuals who took to sleeping on the ground in the forest would be preserved from such dangers and perhaps also from the attacks of birds of prey which may always have visited the islands but whether or no this was the mode by which these singular birds acquired their actual form and structure it is perfectly certain that their existence and development depended on complete isolation and on freedom from the attacks of enemies we have no single example of such defenceless birds having ever existed on a continent at any geological period whereas analogous though totally distinct forms do exist in new zealand where enemies are equally wanting on the other hand every continent has always produced abundance of carnivora adapted to prey upon the herbivorous animals inhabiting it at the same period and we may therefore be sure that 438 these islands have never formed part of a continent during any portion of the time when the dodos inhabited them  it is a remarkable thing that an ornithologist of dr hartlaubs reputation looking at the subject from a purely ornithological point of view should yet entirely ignore the evidence of these wonderful and unique birds against his own theory when he so confidently characterises lemuria as that sunken land which containing parts of africa must have extended far eastward over southern india and ceylon and the highest points of which we recognise in the volcanic peaks of bourbon and mauritius and in the central range of madagascar itselfthe last resorts of the mostly extinct lemurine race which formerly peopled it111 it is here implied that lemurs formerly inhabited bourbon and mauritius but of this there is not a particle of evidence and we feel pretty sure that had they done so the dodos would never have been developed there in madagascar there are no traces of dodos while there are remains of extinct gigantic struthious birds of the genus Æpyornis which were no doubt as well able to protect themselves against the smaller carnivora as are the ostriches emus and cassowaries in their respective countries at the present day  the whole of the evidence at our command therefore tends to establish in a very complete manner the oceanic character of the three islandsmauritius bourbon and rodriguez and that they have never formed part of lemuria or of any continent  reptilesmauritius like bourbon has lizards some of which are peculiar species but no snakes and no frogs or toads but such as have been introduced112 strange to say however a small islet called round island only about a mile across and situated about fourteen miles northeast of mauritius possesses a snake which is not only unknown in mauritius but also in any other part of the world being 439 altogether confined to this minute islet it belongs to the boa family and forms a peculiar and very distinct genus casaria whose nearest allies seem to be the ungalia of cuba and bolyeria of australia it is hardly possible to believe that this serpent has very long maintained itself on so small an island and though we have no record of its existence on mauritius it may very well have inhabited the lowland forests without being met with by the early settlers and the introduction of swine which soon ran wild and effected the final destruction of the dodo may also have been fatal to this snake it is however now almost certainly confined to the one small islet and is probably the landvertebrate of most restricted distribution on the globe  on the same island there is a small lizard scelotes bojeri recorded also from mauritius and bourbon though it appears to be rare in both islands but a gecko phelsuma guentheri is restricted to the island as round island is connected with mauritius by a bank under a hundred fathoms below the surface it has probably been once joined to it and when first separated would have been both much larger and much nearer the main island circumstances which would greatly facilitate the transmission of these reptiles to their present dwellingplace where they have been able to maintain themselves owing to the complete absence of competition while some of them have become extinct in the larger island  flora of madagascar and the mascarene islandsthe botany of the great island of madagascar has been perhaps more thoroughly explored than that of the opposite coasts of africa so that its peculiarities may not be really so great as they now appear to be yet there can be no doubt of its extreme richness and grandeur its remarkable speciality and its anomalous external relations it is characterised by a great abundance of foresttrees and shrubs of peculiar genera or species and often adorned with magnificent flowers some of these are allied to african forms others to those of asia and it is said that of the two affinities the latter preponderates but there are also as in the animal world some decided south 440 american relations while other groups point to australia or are altogether isolated  no less than 3740 flowering plants are now known from madagascar with 360 ferns and fernallies the most abundant natural orders are the following                   species   leguminosæ         346   ferns              318   compositæ          281   euphorbiaceæ       228   orchideæ           170   cyperaceæ          160   rubiaceæ           147   acanthaceæ         131   gramineæ           130  the flora contains representatives of 144 natural orders and 970 genera one of the former and 148 of the latter being peculiar to the island the peculiar order chælnaceæ comprises seven genera and twentyfour species while rubiaceæ and compositæ have the largest number of peculiar genera followed by leguminosæ and melastomaceæ nearly threefourths of the species are endemic  beautiful flowers are not conspicuous in the flora of madagascar though it contains several magnificent flowering plants a shrub with the dreadful name harpagophytum grandidieri has bunches of gorgeous red flowers tristellateia madagascariensis is a climbing plant with spikes of rich yellow flowers while poinciana regia a tall tree rhodolæna altivola and astrapoea wallichii shrubs are among the most magnificent flowering plants in the world disa buchenaviana commelina madagascarica and tachiadenus platypterus are fine blueflowered plants while the superb orchid angræcum sesquipedale vinca rosea euphorbia splendens and stephanotis floribunda have been long cultivated in our hothouses there are also many handsome combretaceæ rubiaceæ and leguminosæ but as in most tropical regions this wealth of floral beauty has to be searched for and produces little effect in the landscape  the affinities of the madagascar flora are to a great extent in accordance with those of the fauna the tropical portion of the flora agrees closely with that of tropical africa while the plants of the highlands are 441 equally allied to those of the cape and of the mountains of central africa some asiatic types are present which do not occur in africa and even the curious american affinities of some of the animals are reproduced in the vegetable kingdom these last are so interesting that they deserve to be enumerated an american genus of euphorbiaceæ omphalea has one species in madagascar and pedilanthus another genus of the same natural order has a similar distribution myrosma an american genus of scitamineæ has one madagascar species while the celebrated travellers tree ravenala madagascariensis belonging to the order musaceæ has its nearest ally in a plant inhabiting n brazil and guiana echinolæna a genus of grasses has the same distribution113  of the flora of the smaller madagascarian islands we possess a fuller account owing to the recent publication of mr bakers flora of the mauritius and the seychelles including also rodriguez the total number of species in this flora is 1058 more than half of which 536 are exclusively mascarenethat is found only in some of the islands of the madagascar group while nearly a third 304 are endemic or confined to single islands of the widespread plants sixtysix are found in africa but not in asia and eightysix in asia but not in africa showing a similar asiatic preponderance to what is said to occur in madagascar with the genera however the proportions are different for i find by going through the whole of the generic distributions as given by mr baker that out of the 440 genera of wild plants fifty are endemic twentytwo are asiatic but not african while twentyeight are african but not asiatic this implies that the more ancient connection has been on the side of africa while a more recent immigration shown by identity of species has come from the side of asia and it is already certain that when the flora of madagascar is more thoroughly worked out a still greater african preponderance will be found in that island  442  a few mascarene genera are found elsewhere only in south america australia or polynesia and there are also a considerable number of genera whose metropolis is south america but which are represented by one or more species in madagascar and by a single often widely distributed species in africa this fact throws light upon the problem offered by those mammals reptiles and insects of madagascar which now have their only allies in south america since the two cases would be exactly parallel were the african plants to become extinct plants however are undoubtedly more longlived specifically than animalsespecially the more highly organised groups and are less liable to complete extinction through the attacks of enemies or through changes of climate or of physical geography hence we find comparatively few cases in which groups of madagascar plants have their only allies in such distant regions as america and australia while such cases are numerous among animals owing to the extinction of the allied forms in intervening areas for which extinction as we have already shown ample cause can be assigned  curious relations of mascarene plantsamong the curious affinities of mascarene plants we have culled the following from mr bakers volume trochetia a genus of sterculiaceæ has four species in mauritius one in madagascar and one in the remote island of st helena mathurina a genus of turneraceæ consisting of a single species peculiar to rodriguez has its nearest ally in another monotypic genus erblichia confined to central america siegesbeckia one of the compositæ consists of two species one inhabiting the mascarene islands the other peru labourdonasia a genus of sapotaceæ has two species in mauritius one in natal and one in cuba nesogenes belonging to the verbena family has one species in rodriguez and one in polynesia mespilodaphne an extensive genus of lauraceæ has six species in the mascarene islands and all the rest about fifty species in south america nepenthes the wellknown pitcher plants are found chiefly in the malay islands south china and ceylon with species in the seychelles islands 443 and in madagascar milla a large genus of liliaceæ is exclusively american except one species found in mauritius and bourbon agauria a genus of ericaceæ is found in madagascar the mascarene islands the plateau of central africa and the camaroon mountains in west africa an acacia found in mauritius and bourbon a heterophylla can hardly be separated specifically from acacia koa of the sandwich islands the genus pandanus or screwpine has sixteen species in the three islandsmauritius rodriguez and the seychellesall being peculiar and none ranging beyond a single island of palms there are fifteen species belonging to ten genera and all these genera are peculiar to the islands we have here ample evidence that plants exhibit the same anomalies of distribution in these islands as do the animals though in a smaller proportion while they also exhibit some of the transitional stages by which these anomalies have in all probability been brought about rendering quite unnecessary any other changes in the distribution of sea and land than physical and geological evidence warrants114  444  fragmentary character of the mascarene floraalthough the peculiar character and affinities of the vegetation of these islands is sufficiently apparent there can be little doubt that we only possess a fragment of the rich flora which once adorned them the cultivation of sugar and other tropical products has led to the clearing away of the virgin forests from all the lowlands plateaus and accessible slopes of the mountains so that remains of the aboriginal woodlands only linger in the recesses of the hills and numbers of foresthaunting plants must inevitably have been exterminated the result is that nearly three hundred species of foreign plants have run wild in mauritius and have in their turn helped to extinguish the native 445 species in the seychelles too the indigenous flora has been almost entirely destroyed in most of the islands although the peculiar palms from their longevity and comparative hardiness have survived mr geoffrey nevill tells us that at mahé and most of the other islands visited by him it was only in a few spots near the summits of the hills that he could perceive any remains of the ancient flora pineapples cinnamon bamboos and other plants have obtained a firm footing covering large tracts of country and killing the more delicate native flowers and ferns the pineapple especially grows almost to the tops of the mountains where the timber and shrubs have been destroyed the water falling on the surface immediately cuts channels runs off rapidly and causes the land to become dry and arid and the same effect is largely seen both in mauritius and bourbon where originally dense forest covered the entire surface and perennial moisture with its everaccompanying luxuriance of vegetation prevailed  flora of madagascar allied to that of south africain my geographical distribution of animals i have remarked on the relation between the insects of madagascar and those of south temperate africa and have speculated on a great southern extension of the continent at the time when madagascar was united with it as supporting this view i now quote mr benthams remarks on the compositæ he says the connections of the mascarene endemic compositæ especially those of madagascar itself are eminently with the southern and subtropical african races the more tropical races plucheineæ c may be rather more of an asiatic type he further says that the composite flora is almost as strictly endemic as that of the sandwich islands and that it is much diversified with evidences of great antiquity while it shows insular characteristics in the tendency to tall shrubby or arborescent forms in several of the endemic or prevailing genera  preponderance of ferns in the mascarene floraa striking character of the flora of these smaller mascarene islands is the great preponderance of ferns and next to them of orchideæ the following figures are taken from 446 mr bakers flora for mauritius and the seychelles and from an estimate by m frappier of the flora of bourbon given in maillards volume

bourbon and rodriguez must be classed as such though from their proximity to madagascar they have to be considered as satellites to that great island the abundance of orchids the reverse of what occurs in remoter oceanic islands may be in part due to analogous causes their usually minute and abundant seeds would be as easily carried by the wind as the spores of ferns and their frequent epiphytic habit affords them an endless variety of stations on which to vegetate and at the same time removes them in a great measure from the competition of other plants when therefore the climate is sufficiently moist and equable and there is a luxuriant forest vegetation we may expect to find orchids plentiful on such tropical islands as possess an abundance of insects adapted to fertilise them and which are not too far removed from other lands or continents from which their seeds might be conveyed  concluding remarks on madagascar and the mascarene islandsthere is probably no portion of the globe that contains within itself so many and such varied features of interest connected with geographical distribution or which so well illustrates the mode of solving the problems it presents as the comparatively small insular region which comprises the great island of madagascar and the smaller islands and islandgroups which immediately surround it in madagascar we have a continental island of the first rank and undoubtedly of immense antiquity we have detached fragments of this island in the comoros and 447 aldabra in the seychelles we have the fragments of another very ancient island which may perhaps never have been continental in mauritius bourbon and rodriguez we have three undoubtedly oceanic islands while in the extensive banks and coral reefs of cargados saya de malha the chagos and the maldive isles we have indications of the submergence of many large islands which may have aided in the transmission of organisms from the indian peninsula but between and around all these islands we have depths of 2500 fathoms and upwards which renders it very improbable that there has ever been here a continuous land surface at all events during the tertiary or secondary periods of geology  it is most interesting and satisfactory to find that this conclusion arrived at solely by a study of the form of the seabottom and the general principle of oceanic permanence is fully supported by the evidence of the organic productions of the several islands because it gives us confidence in those principles and helps to supply us with a practical demonstration of them we find that the entire group contains just that amount of indian forms which could well have passed from island to island that many of these forms are slightly modified species indicating that the migration occurred during late tertiary times while others are distinct genera indicating a more ancient connection but in no one case do we find animals which necessitate an actual landconnection while the numerous indian types of mammalia reptiles birds and insects which must certainly have passed over had there been such an actual landconnection are totally wanting the one fact which has been supposed to require such a connectionthe distribution of the lemurscan be far more naturally explained by a general dispersion of the group from europe where we know it existed in eocene times and such an explanation applies equally to the affinity of the insectivora of madagascar and cuba the snakes herpetodryas c of madagascar and america and the lizards cryptoblepharus of mauritius and australia to suppose in all these cases and in many others a direct landconnection is really absurd because 448 we have the evidence afforded by geology of wide differences of distribution directly we pass beyond the most recent deposits and when we go back to mesozoicand still more to palæozoictimes the majority of the groups of animals and plants appear to have had a worldwide range a large number of our european miocene genera of vertebrates were also indian or african or even american the south american tertiary fauna contained many european types while many mesozoic reptiles and mollusca ranged from europe and north america to australia and new zealand  by very good evidence the occurrence of wide areas of marine deposits of eocene age geologists have established the fact that africa was cut off from europe and asia by an arm of the sea in early tertiary times forming a large islandcontinent by the evidence of abundant organic remains we know that all the types of large mammalia now found in africa but which are absent from madagascar inhabited europe and asia and many of them also north america in the miocene period at a still earlier epoch africa may have received its lower types of mammalslemurs insectivora and small carnivora together with its ancestral struthious birds and its reptiles and insects of american or australian affinity and at this period it was joined to madagascar before the later continental period of africa madagascar had become an island and thus when the large mammalia from the northern continent overran africa they were prevented from reaching madagascar which thenceforth was enabled to develop its singular forms of lowtype mammalia its gigantic ostrichlike Æpyornis its isolated birds its remarkable insects and its rich and peculiar flora from it the adjacent islands received such organisms as could cross the sea while they transmitted to madagascar some of the indian birds and insects which had reached them  the method we have followed in these investigations is to accept the results of geological and palæontological science and the ascertained facts as to the powers of dispersal of the various animal groups to take full account of the laws of evolution as affecting distribution 449 and of the various ocean depths as implying recent or remote union of islands with their adjacent continents and the result is that wherever we possess a sufficient knowledge of these various classes of evidence we find it possible to give a connected and intelligible explanation of all the most striking peculiarities of the organic world in madagascar we have undoubtedly one of the most difficult of these problems but we have i think fairly met and conquered most of its difficulties the complexity of the organic relations of this island is due partly to its having derived its animal forms from two distinct sourcesfrom one continent through a direct landconnection and from another by means of intervening islands now submerged but mainly to the fact of its having been separated from a continent which is now zoologically in a very different condition from that which prevailed at the time of the separation and to its having been thus able to preserve a number of types which may date back to the eocene or even to the cretaceous period some of these types have become altogether extinct elsewhere others have spread far and wide over the globe and have survived only in a few remote countriesand especially in those which have been more or less secured by their isolated position from the incursions of the more highlydeveloped forms of later times this explains why it is that the nearest allies of the madagascar fauna and flora are now so often to be found in south america or australiacountries in which low forms of mammalia and birds still largely prevailit being on account of the longcontinued isolation of all these countries that similar forms descendants of ancient types are preserved in them had the numerous suggested continental extensions connecting these remote continents at various geological periods been realities the result would have been that all these interesting archaic forms all these defenceless insular types would long ago have been exterminated and one comparatively monotonous fauna have reigned over the whole earth so far from explaining the anomalous facts the alleged continental extensions had they existed would have left no such facts to be explained                                        450  chapter xx  anomalous islands celebes

continental are the larger antilles cuba haiti jamaica and porto rico iceland and perhaps celebes the antilles have been so fully discussed and illustrated in my former work and there is so little fresh information about them that i do not propose to treat of them here especially as they fall short of madagascar in all points of biological interest and offer no problems of a different character from such as have already been sufficiently explained  iceland also must apparently be classed as belonging to the ancient continental islands for though usually described as wholly volcanic it is more probably an island of varied geological structure buried under the lavas of its numerous volcanoes but of late years extensive tertiary deposits of miocene age have been discovered showing that it is not a mere congeries of 451 volcanoes it is connected with the british islands and with greenland by seas less than 500 fathoms deep and it possesses a few mammalia one of which is peculiar and at least three peculiar species of birds it was therefore almost certainly united with greenland and probably with europe by way of britain in the early part of the tertiary period and thus afforded one of the routes by which that intermigration of american and european animals and plants was effected which we know occurred during some portion of the eocene and miocene periods and probably also in the pliocene the fauna and flora of this island are however so poor and offer so few peculiarities that it is unnecessary to devote more time to their consideration  there remains the great malay islandcelebes which owing to its possession of several large and very peculiar mammalia must be classed zoologically as ancient continental but whose central position and relations both to asia and to australia render it very difficult to decide in which of the primary zoological regions it ought to be placed or whether it has ever been united with either of the great continents although i have pretty fully discussed its zoological peculiarities and past history in my geographical distribution of animals it seems advisable to review the facts on the present occasion more especially as the systematic investigation of the characteristics of continental islands we have now made will place us in a better position for determining its true zoogeographical relations  physical features of celebesthis large and still comparatively unexplored island is interesting to the geographer on account of its remarkable outline but much more so to the zoologist for its curious assemblage of animal forms the geological structure of celebes is almost unknown the extremity of the northern peninsula is volcanic while in the southern peninsula there are extensive deposits of a crystalline limestone in some places overlying basalt gold is found in the northern peninsula and in the central mass as well as iron tin and copper in small quantities so that there can be little 452 doubt that the mountain ranges of the interior consist of ancient stratified rocks  illustration map of celebes and the surrounding islands  the depth of sea is shown by three tints the lightest indicating less than 100 fathoms the medium tint less than 1000 fathoms and the dark tint more than 1000 fathoms the figures show depths in fathoms  it is not yet known whether celebes is completely separated from the surrounding islands by a deep sea but 453 the facts at our command render it probable that it is so the northern and eastern portions of the celebes sea have been ascertained to be from 2000 to 2600 fathoms deep and such depths may extend over a considerable portion of it or even be much exceeded in the centre in the molucca passage a single sounding on the gilolo side gave 1200 fathoms and a large part of the molucca and banda seas probably exceed 2000 fathoms the southern portion of the straits of macassar is full of coral reefs and a shallow sea of less than 100 fathoms extends from borneo to within about forty miles of the western promontory of celebes but farther north there is deep water close to the shore and it seems probable that a deep channel extends quite through the straits which have no doubt been much shallowed by the deposits from the great bornean rivers as well as by those of celebes itself southward again the chain of volcanic islands from bali to timor appears to rise out of a deep ocean the few soundings we possess showing depths of from 670 to 1300 fathoms almost close to their northern shores we seem justified therefore in concluding that celebes is entirely surrounded by a deep sea which has however become partially filled up by river deposits by volcanic upheaval or by coral reefs such shallows where they exist may therefore be due to antiquity and isolation instead of being indications of a former union with any of the surrounding islands  zoological character of the islands around celebesin order to have a clear conception of the peculiar character of the celebesian fauna we must take into account that of the surrounding countries from which we may suppose it to have received immigrants these we may divide broadly into two groups those on the west belonging to the oriental region of our zoological geography and those on the east belonging to the australian region of the first group borneo is a typical representative and from its proximity and the extent of its opposing coasts it is the island which we should expect to show most resemblance to celebes we have already seen that the fauna of borneo is essentially the same as that of southern asia and that it is excessively rich in all the malayan types of 454 mammalia and birds java and bali closely resemble borneo in general character though somewhat less rich and with several peculiar forms while the philippine islands though very much poorer and with a greater amount of speciality yet exhibit essentially the same character these islands taken as a whole may be described as having a fauna almost identical with that of southern asia for no family of mammalia is found in the one which is absent from the other and the same may be said with very few and unimportant exceptions of the birds while hundreds of genera and of species are common to both  in the islands east and south of celebesthe moluccas new guinea and the timor group from lombok eastwardwe find on the other hand the most wonderful contrast in the forms of life of twentyseven families of terrestrial mammals found in the great malay islands all have disappeared but four and of these it is doubtful whether two have not been introduced by man we also find here four families of marsupials all totally unknown in the western islands even birds though usually more widely spread show a corresponding difference about eleven malayan families being quite unknown east of celebes where six new families make their appearance which are equally unknown to the westward115  we have here a radical difference between two sets of islands not very far removed from each other the one set belonging zoologically to asia the other to australia the asiatic or malayan group is found to be bounded strictly by the eastward limits of the great bank for the most part less than fifty fathoms below the surface which 455 stretches out from the siamese and malayan peninsula as far as java sumatra borneo and the philippines to the east another bank unites new guinea and the papuan islands as far as aru mysol and waigiou with australia while the moluccas and timor groups are surrounded by much deeper water which forms in the banda and celebes seas and perhaps in other parts of this area great basins of enormous depths 2000 to 3000 fathoms or even more enclosed by tracts under a thousand fathoms which separate the basins from each other and from the adjacent pacific and indian oceans see map this peculiar formation of the seabottom probably indicates that this area has been the seat of great local upheavals and subsidences and it is quite in accordance with this view that we find the moluccas while closely agreeing with new guinea in their forms of life yet strikingly deficient in many important groups and exhibiting an altogether povertystricken appearance as regards the higher animals it is a suggestive fact that the philippine islands bear an exactly parallel relation to borneo being equally deficient in many of the higher groups and here too in the sooloo sea we find a similar enclosed basin of great depth hence we may in both cases connect on the one hand the extensive area of landsurface and of adjacent shallow sea with a long period of stability and a consequent rich development of the forms of life and on the other hand a highly broken landsurface with the adjacent seas of great but very unequal depths with a period of disturbance probably involving extensive submersions of the land resulting in a scanty and fragmentary vertebrate fauna  zoology of celebesthe zoology of celebes differs so remarkably from that of both the great divisions of the archipelago above indicated that it is very difficult to decide in which to place it it possesses only about sixteen species of terrestrial mammalia so that it is at once distinguished from borneo and java by its extreme poverty in this class of this small number four belong to the moluccan and australian faunathere being two marsupials of the genus cuscus and two forest rats said to be allied to australian types 456  the remaining twelve species are generally speaking of malayan or asiatic types but some of them are so peculiar that they have no near allies in any part of the world while the rest are of the ordinary malay type or even identical with malayan species and some of these may be recent introductions through human agency these twelve species of asiatic type will be now enumerated they consist of five peculiar squirrelsa group unknown farther east a peculiar species of wild pig a deer so closely allied to the cervus hippelaphus of borneo that it may well have been introduced by man both here and in the moluccas a civet viverra tangalunga common in all the malay islands and also perhaps introduced the curious malayan tarsier tarsius spectrum said to be only found in a small island off the coastand besides these three remarkable animals all of large size and all quite unlike anything found in the malay islands or even in asia these are a black and almost tailless baboonlike ape cynopithecus nigrescens an antelopean buffalo anoa depressicornis and the strange babirusa babirusa alfurus  none of these three animals last mentioned has any close allies elsewhere and their presence in celebes may be considered the crucial fact which must give us the clue to the past history of the island let us then see what they teach us the ape is apparently somewhat intermediate between the great baboons of africa and the shorttailed macaques of asia but its cranium shows a nearer approach to the former group in its flat projecting muzzle large superciliary crests and maxillary ridges the anoa though anatomically allied to the buffaloes externally more resembles the bovine antelopes of africa while the babirusa is altogether unlike any other living member of the swine family the canines of the upper jaws growing directly upwards like horns forming a spiral curve over the eyes instead of downwards as in all other mammalia an approach to this peculiarity is made by the african warthogs in which the upper tusk grows out laterally and then curves up but these animals are not otherwise closely allied to the babirusa 457  probable derivation of the mammals of celebesit is clear that we have here a group of extremely peculiar and in all probability very ancient forms which have been preserved to us by isolation in celebes just as the monotremes and marsupials have been preserved in australia and so many of the lemurs and insectivora in madagascar and this compels us to look upon the existing island as a fragment of some ancient land once perhaps forming part of the great northern continent but separated from it far earlier than borneo sumatra and java the exceeding scantiness of the mammalian fauna however remains to be accounted for we have seen that formosa a much smaller island contains more than twice as many species and we may be sure that at the time when such animals as apes and buffaloes existed the asiatic continent swarmed with varied forms of mammals to quite as great an extent as borneo does now if the portion of separated land had been anything like as large as celebes now is it would certainly have preserved a far more abundant and varied fauna to explain the facts we have the choice of two theorieseither that the original island has since its separation been greatly reduced by submersion so as to lead to the extinction of most of the higher land animals or that it originally formed part of an independent land stretching eastward and was only united with the asiatic continent for a short period or perhaps even never united at all but so connected by intervening islands separated by narrow straits that a few mammals might find their way across the latter supposition appears best to explain the facts the three animals in question are such as might readily pass over narrow straits from island to island and we are thus better enabled to understand the complete absence of the arboreal monkeys of the insectivora and of the very numerous and varied carnivora and rodents of borneo all of which except the squirrels are entirely unrepresented in celebes by any peculiar and ancient forms  the question at issue can only be finally determined by geological investigations if celebes has once formed part of asia and participated in its rich mammalian fauna which has been since destroyed by submergence then some 458 remains of this fauna must certainly be preserved in caves or late tertiary deposits and proofs of the submergence itself will be found when sought for if on the other hand the existing animals fairly represent those which have ever reached the island then no such remains will be discovered and there need be no evidence of any great and extensive subsidence in late tertiary times  birds of celebeshaving thus clearly placed before us the problem presented by the mammalian fauna of celebes we may proceed to see what additional evidence is afforded by the birds and any other groups of which we have sufficient information about 164 species of true landbirds are now known to inhabit the island of celebes itself considerably more than half of these ninetyfour species are peculiar to it twentynine are found also in borneo and the other malay islands to which they specially belong while sixteen are common to the moluccas or other islands of the australian region the remainder being species of wide range and not characteristic of either division of the archipelago we have here a large preponderance of western over eastern species of birds inhabiting celebes though not to quite so great an extent as in the mammalia and the inference to be drawn from this fact is simply that more birds have migrated from borneo than from the moluccaswhich is exactly what we might expect both from the greater extent of the coast of borneo opposite that of celebes and also from the much greater richness in species of the bornean than the moluccan birdfauna  it is however to the relations of the peculiar species of celebesian birds that we must turn in order to ascertain the origin of the fauna in past times and we must look to the source of the generic types which they represent to give us this information the ninetyfour peculiar species above noted belong to about sixtysix genera of which about twentythree are common to the whole archipelago and have therefore little significance of the remainder twelve are altogether peculiar to celebes twentyone are malayan but not moluccan or australian while ten are moluccan or australian but not malayan this 459 proportion does not differ much from that afforded by the nonpeculiar species and it teaches us that for a considerable period celebes has been receiving immigrants from all sides many of which have had time to become modified into distinct representative species these evidently belong to the period during which borneo on the one side and the moluccas on the other have occupied very much the same relative position as now there remain the twelve peculiar celebesian genera to which we must look for some further clue as to the origin of the older portion of the fauna and as these are especially interesting we must examine them somewhat closely  birdtypes peculiar to celebesfirst we have artamides one of the campephaginæ or caterpillarshrikesa not very wellmarked genus and which may have been derived either from the malayan or the moluccan side of the archipelago two peculiar genera of kingfishersmonachalcyon and citturaseem allied the former to the widespread todiramphus and to the caridonax of lombok the latter to the australian melidora another kingfisher ceycopsis combines the characters of the malayan ceyx and the african ispidina and thus forms an example of an ancient generalised form analogous to what occurs among the mammalia streptocitta is a peculiar form allied to the magpies while basilornis found also in ceram enodes and scissirostrum are very peculiar starlings the latter altogether unlike any other bird and perhaps forming a distinct subfamily meropogon is a peculiar beeeater allied to the malayan nyctiornis rhamphococyx is a modification of phænicophaes a malayan genus of cuckoos prioniturus found also in the philippines is a genus of parrots distinguished by raquetformed tail feathers altogether unique in the order while megacephalon is a remarkable and very isolated form of the australian megapodiidæ or moundbuilders  omitting those whose affinity may be pretty clearly traced to groups still inhabiting the islands of the western or the eastern half of the archipelago we find four birds which have no near allies at all but appear to be either ancestral forms or extreme modifications of asiatic or 460 african birdsbasilornis enodes scissirostrum ceycopsis these may fairly be associated with the baboonape anoa and babirusa as indicating extreme antiquity and some communication with the asiatic continent at a period when the forms of life and their geographical distribution differed considerably from what they are at the present time  but here again we meet with exactly the same difficulty as in the mammalia in the comparative poverty of the types of birds now inhabiting celebes although the preponderance of affinity especially in the case of its more ancient and peculiar forms is undoubtedly with asia rather than with australia yet still more decidedly than in the case of the mammalia are we forbidden to suppose that it ever formed a part of the old asiatic continent on account of the total absence of so many important and extensive groups of asiatic birds it is not single species or even genera but whole families that are thus absent and among them families which are preeminently characteristic of all tropical asia such are the timaliidæ or babblers of which there are twelve genera in borneo and nearly thirty genera in the oriental region but of which one species only hardly distinguishable from a malayan form inhabits celebes the phyllornithidæ or green bulbuls and the pycnonotidæ or bulbuls both absolutely ubiquitous in tropical asia and malaya but unknown in celebes the eurylæmidæ or gapers found everywhere in the great malay islands the megalæmidæ or barbets the trogonidæ or trogons and the phasianidæ or pheasants all preeminently asiatic and malayan but all absent from celebes with the exception of the common junglefowl which owing to the passion of malays for cockfighting may have been introduced to these important families may be added asiatic and malayan genera by the score but confining ourselves to these seven ubiquitous families we must askis it possible that at the period when the ancestors of the peculiar celebes mammals entered the island and when the forms of life though distinct could not have been quite unlike those now living it could have actually formed a part of the continent without 461 possessing representatives of the greater part of these extensive and important families of birds to get rid altogether of such varied and dominant types of birdlife by any subsequent process of submersion is more difficult than to exterminate mammalia and we are therefore again driven to our former conclusionthat the present land of celebes has never in tertiary times been united to the asiatic continent but has received its population of asiatic forms by migration across narrow straits and intervening islands taking into consideration the amount of affinity on the one hand and the isolation on the other of the celebesian fauna we may probably place the period of this earlier migration in the early part of the latter half of the tertiary period that is in middle or late miocene times  celebes not strictly a continental islanda study of the mammalian and of the birdfauna of celebes thus leads us in both cases to the same conclusion and forbids us to rank it as a strictly continental island on the asiatic side but facts of a very similar character are equally opposed to the idea of a former landconnection with australia or new guinea or even with the moluccas the numerous marsupials of those countries are all wanting in celebes except the phalangers of the genus cuscus and these arboreal creatures are very liable to be carried across narrow seas on trees uprooted by earthquakes or floods the terrestrial cassowaries are equally absent and thus we can account for the presence of all the moluccan or australian types actually found in celebes without supposing any landconnection on this side during the tertiary period the presence of the celebes ape in the island of batchian and of the babirusa in bouru can be sufficiently explained by a somewhat closer approximation of the respective lands or by a few intervening islands which have since disappeared or it may even be due to human agency  if the explanation now given of the peculiar features presented by the fauna of celebes be the correct one we are fully justified in classing it as an anomalous island since it possesses a small but very remarkable mammalian fauna without ever having been directly united with any 462 continent or extensive land and both by what it has and what it wants occupies such an exactly intermediate position between the oriental and australian regions that it will perhaps ever remain a mere matter of opinion with which it should properly be associated forming as it does the western limit of such typical australian groups as the marsupials among mammalia and the trichoglossidæ and meliphagidæ among birds and being so strikingly deficient in all the more characteristic oriental families and genera of both classes i have always placed it in the australian region but it may perhaps with equal propriety be left out of both till a further knowledge of its geology enables us to determine its early history with more precision  peculiarities of the insects of celebesthe only other class of animals in celebes of which we have a tolerable knowledge is that of insects among which we meet with peculiarities of a very remarkable kind and such as are found in no other island on the globe having already given a full account of some of these peculiarities in a paper read before the linnean societyrepublished in my contributions to the theory of natural selectionwhile others have been discussed in my geographical distribution of animals vol i p 434i will only here briefly refer to them in order to see whether they accord with or receive any explanation from the somewhat novel view of the past history of the island here advanced  the general distribution of the two best known groups of insectsthe butterflies and the beetlesagrees very closely with that of the birds and mammalia inasmuch as celebes forms the eastern limit of a number of asiatic and malayan genera and at the same time the western limit of several moluccan and australian genera the former perhaps preponderating as in the higher animals  himalayan types of birds and butterflies in celebesa curious fact of distribution exhibited both among butterflies and birds is the occurrence in celebes of species and genera unknown to the adjacent islands but only found again when we reach the himalayan mountains or the indian peninsula among birds we have a small yellow 463 flycatcher myialestes helianthea a flowerpecker pachyglossa aureolimbata a finch munia brunneiceps and a roller coracias temminckii all closely allied to indian not malayan speciesall the genera except munia being in fact unknown in any malay island an exactly parallel case is that of a butterfly of the genus dichorrhagia which has a very close ally in the himalayas but nothing like it in any intervening country these facts call to mind the similar case of formosa where some of its birds and mammals occurred again under identical or closely allied forms in the himalayas and in both instances they can only be explained by going back to a period when the distribution of these forms was very different from what it is now  peculiarities of shape and colour in celebesian butterflieseven more remarkable are the peculiarities of shape and colour in a number of celebesian butterflies of different genera these are found to vary all in the same manner indicating some general cause of variation able to act upon totally distinct groups and produce upon them all a common result nearly thirty species of butterflies belonging to three different families have a common modification in the shape of their wings by which they can be distinguished at a glance from their allies in any other island or country whatever and all these are larger than the representative forms inhabiting most of the adjacent islands116 no such remarkable local modification as this is known to occur in any other part of the globe and whatever may have been its cause that cause must certainly have been long in action and have been confined to a limited area we have here therefore another argument in favour of the longcontinued isolation of celebes from all the surrounding islands and continentsa hypothesis which we have seen to afford the best if not the only explanation of its peculiar vertebrate fauna  concluding remarksif the view here given of the origin of the remarkable celebesian fauna is correct we have in this island a fragment of the great eastern 464 continent which has preserved to us perhaps from miocene times some remnants of its ancient animal forms there is no other example on the globe of an island so closely surrounded by other islands on every side yet preserving such a marked individuality in its forms of life while as regards the special features which characterise its insects it is so far as yet known absolutely unique unfortunately very little is known of the botany of celebes but it seems probable that its plants will to some extent partake of the speciality which so markedly distinguishes its animals and there is here a rich field for any botanist who is able to penetrate to the forestclad mountains of its interior 465  appendix to chapter xx  the following list of the land birds of celebes and the adjacent islands which partake of its

deduced from its     wingless birdsbirds and reptiles of new zealandconclusions from the     peculiarities of the new zealand fauna  the fauna of new zealand has been so recently described and its bearing on the past history of the islands so fully discussed in my large work already referred to that it would not be necessary to introduce the subject again were it not that we now approach it from a somewhat different point of view and with some important fresh material which will enable us to arrive at more definite conclusions as to the nature and origin of this remarkable fauna and flora the present work is besides addressed to a wider class of readers than my former volumes and it would be manifestly incomplete if all reference to one of the most remarkable and interesting of insular faunas was omitted  the two great islands which mainly constitute new zealand are together about as large as the kingdom of italy they stretch over thirteen degrees of latitude in the warmer portion of the southtemperate zone their extreme points corresponding to the latitudes of vienna and cyprus their climate throughout is mild and 472 equable their vegetation is luxuriant and deserts or uninhabitable regions are as completely unknown as in our own islands  the geological structure of these islands has a decidedly continental character ancient sedimentary rocks granite and modern volcanic formations abound gold silver copper tin iron and coal are plentiful and there are also some considerable deposits of early or late tertiary age the secondary rocks alone are very scantily developed and such fragments as exist are chiefly of cretaceous age often not clearly separated from the succeeding eocene beds  illustration map showing depths of sea around australia and new zealand    the light tint indicates a depth of less than 1000 fathoms   the dark tint                   more than 1000 fathoms  the position of new zealand in the great southern ocean about 1200 miles distant from the australian 473 continent is very isolated it is surrounded by a moderately deep ocean but the form of the seabottom is peculiar and may help us in the solution of some of the anomalies presented by its living productions the line of 200 fathoms encloses the two islands and extends their area considerably but the 1000fathom line which indicates the landarea that would be produced if the seabottom were elevated 6000 feet has a very remarkable conformation extending in a broad mass westward and northward then sending out a great arm reaching to beyond lord howes island norfolk island is situated on a moderatesized bank while two others much more extensive to the northwest approach the great barrier reef which here carries the 1000fathom line more than 300 miles from the coast it is probable that a bank less than 1500 fathoms below the surface extends over this area thus forming a connection with tropical australia and new guinea temperate australia on the other hand is divided from new zealand by an oceanic gulf about 700 miles wide and between 2000 and 3000 fathoms deep the 2000fathom line embraces all the islands immediately round new zealand as far as the fijis to the north while a submarine plateau at a depth somewhere between one and two thousand fathoms stretches southward to the antarctic continent judging from these indications we should say that the most probable ancient connections of new zealand were with tropical australia new caledonia and the fiji islands and perhaps at a still more remote epoch with the great southern continent by means of intervening lands and islands and we shall find that a landconnection or near approximation in these two directions at remote periods will serve to explain many of the remarkable anomalies which these islands present  zoological character of new zealandwe see then that both geologically and geographically new zealand has more of the character of a continental than of an oceanic island yet its zoological characteristics are such as almost to bring it within the latter categoryand it is this which gives it its anomalous character it is usually 474 considered to possess no indigenous mammalia it has no snakes and only one frog it possesses living or quite recently extinct an extensive group of birds incapable of flight and its productions generally are wonderfully isolated and seem to bear no predominant or close relation to those of australia or any other continent these are the characteristics of an oceanic island and thus we find that the inferences from its physical structure and those from its forms of life directly contradict each other let us see how far a closer examination of the latter will enable us to account for this apparent contradiction  mammalia of new zealandthe only undoubtedly indigenous mammalia appear to be two species of bats one of which scotophilus tuberculatus is according to mr dobson identical with an australian form while the other mystacina tuberculata forms a very remarkable and isolated genus of emballonuridæ a family which extends throughout all the tropical regions of the globe the genus mystacina was formerly considered to belong to the american phyllostomidæ but this has been shown to be an error117 the poverty of new zealand in bats is very remarkable when compared with our own islands where there are at least twelve distinct species though we have a far less favourable climate  of the existence of truly indigenous land mammals in new zealand there is at present no positive evidence but there is some reason to believe that one if not two species may be found there the maoris say that before europeans came to their country a forestrat abounded and was largely used for food they believe that their ancestors brought it with them when they first came to the country but it has now become almost if not quite exterminated by the european brown rat what this native animal was is still somewhat doubtful several specimens have been caught at different times which have been declared by the natives to be the true kiore maorias they term it but these have usually proved on examination to be either the european black rat or some of the native australian rats which now 475 often find their way on board ships but within the last few years many skulls of a rat have been obtained from the old maori cookingplaces and from a cave associated with moa bones and captain hutton who has examined them states that they belong to a true mus but differ from the mus rattus this animal might have been on the islands when the maoris first arrived and in that case would be truly indigenous while the maori legend of their ancestors bringing the rat from their polynesian home may be altogether a myth invented to account for its presence in the islands because the only other land mammal which they knewthe dogwas certainly so brought the question can only be settled by the discovery of remains of a rat in some deposit of an age decidedly anterior to the first arrival of the maori race in new zealand118  much more interesting is the reported existence in the mountains of the south island of a small otterlike animal dr haast has seen its tracks resembling those of our european otter at a height of 3000 feet above the sea in a region never before trodden by man and the animal itself was seen by two gentlemen near lake heron about seventy miles due west of christchurch it was described as being dark brown and the size of a large rabbit on being struck at with a whip it uttered a shrill yelping sound and disappeared in the water119 an animal seen so closely as to be struck at with a whip could hardly have been mistaken for a dogthe only other animal that it could possibly be supposed to have been and a dog would certainly not have disappeared in the water this account as well as the footsteps point to an aquatic animal and if it now frequents only the high alpine lakes and streams this might explain why it has never yet been captured hochstetter also states that it has a native namewaitotekea striking evidence of its actual existence while a gentleman who lived many years in the district assures me that 476 it is universally believed in by residents in that part of new zealand the actual capture of this animal and the determination of its characters and affinities could not fail to aid us greatly in our speculations as to the nature and origin of the new zealand fauna120  wingless birds living and extinctalmost equally valuable with mammalia in affording indications of geographical changes are the wingless birds for which new zealand is so remarkable these consist of four species of apteryx called by the natives kiwiscreatures which hardly look like birds owing to the apparent absence externally of tail or wings and the dense covering of hairlike feathers they vary in size from that of a small fowl up to that of a turkey and have a long slightly curved bill somewhat resembling that of the snipe or ibis two species appear to be confined to the south island and one to the north island but all are becoming scarce and they will no doubt gradually become extinct these birds are generally classed with the struthiones or ostrich tribe but they form a distinct family and in many respects differ greatly from all other known birds  but besides these a number of other wingless birds called moas inhabited new zealand during the period of human occupation and have only recently become extinct these were much larger birds than the kiwis and some of them were even larger than the ostrich a specimen 477 of dinornis maximus mounted in the british museum in its natural attitude being eleven feet high they agreed however with the living apteryx in the character of the pelvis and some other parts of the skeleton while in their short bill and in some important structural features they resembled the emu of australia and the cassowaries of new guinea121 no less than eleven distinct species of these birds have now been discovered and their remains exist in such abundancein recent fluviatile deposits in old native cooking places and even scattered on the surface of the groundthat complete skeletons of several of them have been put together illustrating various periods of growth from the chick up to the adult bird feathers have also been found attached to portions of the skin as well as the stones swallowed by the birds to assist digestion and eggs some containing portions of the embryo bird so that everything confirms the statements of the maoristhat their ancestors found these birds in abundance on the islands that they hunted them for food and that they finally exterminated them only a short time before the arrival of europeans122 bones of apteryx are also found fossil but apparently of the same species as the living birds 478 how far back in geological time these creatures or their ancestral types lived in new zealand we have as yet no evidence to show some specimens have been found under a considerable depth of fluviatile deposits which may be of quaternary or even of pliocene age but this evidently affords us no approximation to the time required for the origin and development of such highly peculiar insular forms  past changes of new zealand deduced from its wingless birdsit has been well observed by captain hutton in his interesting paper already referred to that the occurrence of such a number of species of struthious birds living together in so small a country as new zealand is altogether unparalleled elsewhere on the globe this is even more remarkable when we consider that the species are not equally divided between the two islands for remains of no less than ten out of the eleven known species of dinornis have been found in a single swamp in the south island where also three of the species of apteryx occur the new zealand struthiones in fact very nearly equal in number those of all the rest of the world and nowhere else do more than three species occur in any one continent or island while no more than two ever occur in the same district thus there appear to be two closely allied species of ostriches inhabiting africa and southwestern asia respectively south america has three species of rhea each in a separate district australia has an eastern and a western variety of emu and a cassowary in the north while eight other cassowaries are known from the islands north of australiaone from ceram two from the aru islands one from jobie one from new britain and three from new guineabut of these last one is confined to the northern and another to the southern part of the island  this law of the distribution of allied species in separate areaswhich is found to apply more or less accurately to all classes of animalsis so entirely opposed to the crowding together of no less that fifteen species of wingless birds in the small area of new zealand that the idea is at once suggested of great geographical changes captain hutton points out that if the islands from ceram to new britain 479 were to become joined together we should have a large number of species of cassowary perhaps several more than are yet discovered in one land area if now this land were gradually to be submerged leaving a central elevated region the different species would become crowded together in this portion just as the moas and kiwis were in new zealand but we also require at some remote epoch a more or less complete union of the islands now inhabited by the separate species of cassowaries in order that the common ancestral form which afterwards became modified into these species could have reached the places where they are now found and this gives us an idea of the complete series of changes through which new zealand is believed to have passed in order to bring about its abnormally dense population of wingless birds first we must suppose a land connection with some country inhabited by struthious birds from which the ancestral forms might be derived secondly a separation into many considerable islands in which the various distinct species might become differentiated thirdly an elevation bringing about the union of these islands to unite the distinct species in one area and fourthly a subsidence of a large part of the area leaving the present islands with the various species crowded together  if new zealand has really gone through such a series of changes as here suggested some proofs of it might perhaps be obtained in the outlying islands which were once presumably joined with it and this gives great importance to the statement of the aborigines of the chatham islands that the apteryx formerly lived there but was exterminated about 1835 it is to be hoped that some search will be made here and also in norfolk island in both of which it is not improbable remains either of apteryx or dinornis might be discovered  so far we find nothing to object to in the speculations of captain hutton with which on the contrary we almost wholly concur but we cannot follow him when he goes on to suggest an antarctic continent uniting new zealand and australia with south america and probably also with south africa in order to explain the existing distribution 480 of struthious birds our best anatomists as we have seen agree that both dinornis and apteryx are more nearly allied to the cassowaries and emus than to the ostriches and rheas and we see that the form of the seabottom suggests a former connection with north australia and new guineathe very region where these types most abound and where in all probability they originated the suggestion that all the struthious birds of the world sprang from a common ancestor at no very remote period and that their existing distribution is due to direct land communication between the countries they now inhabit is one utterly opposed to all sound principles of reasoning in questions of geographical distribution for it depends upon two assumptions both of which are at least doubtful if not certainly falsethe first that their distribution over the globe has never in past ages been very different from what it is now and the second that the ancestral forms of these birds never had the power of flight as to the first assumption we have found in almost every case that groups now scattered over two or more continents formerly lived in intervening areas of existing land thus the marsupials of south america and australia are connected by forms which lived in north america and europe the camels of asia and the llamas of the andes had many extinct common ancestors in north america the lemurs of africa and asia had their ancestors in europe as had the trogons of south america africa and tropical asia but besides this general evidence we have direct proof that the struthious birds had a wider range in past times than now remains of extinct rheas have been found in central brazil and those of ostriches in north india while remains believed to be of struthious birds are found in the eocene deposits of england and the cretaceous rocks of north america have yielded the extraordinary toothed bird hesperornis which professor o marsh declares to have been a carnivorous swimming ostrich  as to the second point we have the remarkable fact that all known birds of this group have not only the rudiments of wingbones but also the rudiments of wings that is an external limb bearing rigid quills or largelydeveloped 481 plumes in the cassowary these wingfeathers are reduced to long spines like porcupinequills while even in the apteryx the minute external wing bears a series of nearly twenty stiff quilllike feathers123 these facts render it almost certain that the struthious birds do not owe their imperfect wings to a direct evolution from a reptilian type but to a retrograde development from some low form of winged birds analogous to that which has produced the dodo and the solitaire from the more highlydeveloped pigeontype professor marsh has proved that so far back as the cretaceous period the two great forms of birdsthose with a keeled sternum and fairlydeveloped wings and those with a convex keelless sternum and rudimentary wingsalready existed side by side while in the still earlier archæopteryx of the jurassic period we have a bird with welldeveloped wings and therefore probably with a keeled sternum we are evidently therefore very far from a knowledge of the earliest stages of bird life and our acquaintance with the various forms that have existed is scanty in the extreme but we may be sure that birds acquired wings and feathers and some power of flight before they developed a keeled sternum since we see that bats with no such keel fly very well since therefore the struthious birds all have perfect feathers and all have rudimentary wings which are anatomically those of true birds not the rudimentary forelegs of reptiles and since we know that in many higher groups of birdsas the pigeons and the railsthe wings have become more or less aborted and the keel of the sternum greatly reduced in size by disuse it seems probable that the very remote ancestors of the rhea the cassowary and the apteryx were true flying birds although not perhaps provided with a keeled sternum or possessing very great powers of flight but in addition to the possible ancestral power of flight we have the undoubted fact that the rhea and the emu both swim freely the former having been seen swimming from island to island off the coast of patagonia this taken in connection with the wonderful aquatic ostrich of the cretaceous period discovered by professor marsh opens 482 up fresh possibilities of migration while the immense antiquity thus given to the group and their universal distribution in past time renders all suggestions of special modes of communication between the parts of the globe in which their scattered remnants now happen to exist altogether superfluous and misleading  the bearing of this argument on our present subject is that so far as accounting for the presence of wingless birds in new zealand is concerned we have nothing whatever to do with any possible connection by way of a southern continent or antarctic islands with south america and south africa because the nearest allies of its moas and kiwis are the cassowaries and emus and we have distinct indications of a former land extension towards north australia and new guinea which is exactly what we require for the original entrance of the struthious type into the new zealand area  winged birds and lower vertebrates of new zealandhaving given a pretty full account of the new zealand fauna elsewhere124 i need only here point out its bearing on the hypothesis now advanced of the former landconnection having been with north australia new guinea and the western pacific islands rather than with the temperate regions of australia  of the australian genera of birds which are found also in new zealand almost every one ranges also into new guinea or the pacific islands while the few that do not extend beyond australia are found in its northern districts as regards the peculiar new zealand genera all whose affinities can be traced are allied to birds which belong to the tropical parts of the australian region while the starling family to which four of the most remarkable new zealand birds belong the genera creadion heterolocha and callæas is totally wanting in temperate australia and is comparatively scarce in the entire australian region but is abundant in the oriental region with which new guinea and the moluccas are in easy communication it is certainly a most suggestive fact that there are more than sixty 483 genera of birds peculiar to the australian continent with tasmania many of them almost or quite confined to its temperate portions and that no single one of these should be represented in temperate new zealand125 the affinities of the living and more highly organised no less than those of the extinct and wingless birds strikingly accord with the line of communication indicated by the deep submarine bank connecting these temperate islands with the tropical parts of the australian region  the reptiles so far as they go are quite in accordance with the birds the lizards belong to two genera lygosoma which has a wide range in all the tropics as well as in australia and naultinus a genus peculiar to new zealand but belonging to a familygeckonidæspread over the whole of the warmer parts of the world australia with new guinea on the other hand has a peculiar family and no less than twentyone peculiar genera of lizards many of which are confined to its temperate regions but no one of them extends to temperate new zealand126 the extraordinary lizardlike hatteria punctata of new zealand forms of itself a distinct order of reptiles in some respects intermediate between lizards and crocodiles and having therefore no affinity with any living animal  the only representative of the amphibia in new zealand is a solitary frog of a peculiar genus liopelma hochstetteri but it has no affinity for any of the australian frogs which are numerous and belong to eleven different families while the liopelma belongs 484 to a very distinct family discoglossidæ confined to the palæarctic region  of the freshwater fishes we need only say here that none belong to peculiar australian types but are related to those of temperate south america or of asia  the invertebrate classes are comparatively little known and their modes of dispersal are so varied and exceptional that the facts presented by their distribution can add little weight to those already adduced we will therefore now proceed to the conclusions which can fairly be drawn from the general facts of new zealand natural history already known to us  deductions from the peculiarities of the new zealand faunathe total absence or extreme scarcity of mammals in new zealand obliges us to place its union with north australia and new guinea at a very remote epoch we must either go back to a time when australia itself had not yet received the ancestral forms of its present marsupials and monotremes or we must suppose that the portion of australia with which new zealand was connected was then itself isolated from the mainland and was thus without a mammalian population we shall see in our next chapter that there are certain facts in the distribution of plants no less than in the geological structure of the country which favour the latter view but we must on any supposition place the union very far back to account for the total want of identity between the winged birds of new zealand and those peculiar to australia and a similar want of accordance in the lizards the freshwater fishes and the more important insectgroups of the two countries from what we know of the long geological duration of the generic types of these groups we must certainly go back to the earlier portion of the tertiary period at least in order that there should be such a complete disseverance as exists between the characteristic animals of the two countries and we must further suppose that since their separation there has been no subsequent union or sufficiently near approach to allow of any important intermigration even of winged birds between them it seems probable therefore that 485 the bampton shoal west of new caledonia and lord howes island further south formed the western limits of that extensive land in which the great wingless birds and other isolated members of the new zealand fauna were developed whether this early land extended eastward to the chatham islands and southward to the macquaries we have no means of ascertaining but as the intervening sea appears to be not more than about 1500 fathoms deep it is quite possible that such an amount of subsidence may have occurred it is possible too that there may have been an extension northward to the kermadec islands and even further to the tonga and fiji islands though this is hardly probable or we should find more community between their productions and those of new zealand  a southern extension towards the antarctic continent at a somewhat later period seems more probable as affording an easy passage for the numerous species of south american and antarctic plants and also for the identical and closely allied freshwater fishes of these countries  the subsequent breaking up of this extensive land into a number of separate islands in which the distinct species of moa and kiwi were developedtheir union at a later period and the final submergence of all but the existing islands is a pure hypothesis which seems necessary to explain the occurrence of so many species of these birds in a small area but of which we have no independent proof there are however some other facts which would be explained by it as the presence of three peculiar but allied genera of starlings the three species of parrots of the genus nestor and the six distinct rails of the genus ocydromus as well as the numerous species in some of the peculiar new zealand genera of plants which seem less likely to have been developed in a single area than when isolated and thus preserved from the counteracting influence of intercrossing  in the present state of our knowledge these seem all the conclusions we can arrive at from a study of the new zealand fauna but as we fortunately possess a tolerably 486 full and accurate knowledge of the flora of new zealand as well as of that of australia and the south temperate lands generally it will be well to see how far these conclusions are supported by the facts of plant distribution and what further indications they afford us of the early history of these most interesting countries this inquiry is of sufficient importance to occupy a separate chapter                                        487  chapter xxii  the flora of

plants have means of dispersal far exceeding those possessed by animals yet as a matter of fact comparatively few species are carried for very great distances and the flora of a country taken as a whole usually affords trustworthy indications of its past history plants too are more numerous in species than the higher animals and are almost always better known their affinities have been more systematically studied and it may be safely affirmed that no explanation of the origin of the fauna of a country can be sound which does not also explain or at least harmonise with the distribution and relations of its flora the distribution of the two may be very different but both should be explicable by the same series of geographical changes  the relations of the flora of new zealand to that of australia have long formed an insoluble enigma for 488 botanists sir joseph hooker in his most instructive and masterly essay on the flora of australia saysunder whatever aspect i regard the flora of australia and of new zealand i find all attempts to theorise on the possible causes of their community of feature frustrated by anomalies in distribution such as i believe no two other similarly situated countries in the globe present everywhere else i recognise a parallelism or harmony in the main common features of contiguous floras which conveys the impression of their generic affinity at least being affected by migration from centres of dispersion in one of them or in some adjacent country in this case it is widely different regarding the question from the australian point of view it is impossible in the present state of science to reconcile the fact of acacia eucalyptus casuarina callitris c being absent in new zealand with any theory of transoceanic migration that may be adopted to explain the presence of other australian plants in new zealand and it is very difficult to conceive of a time or of conditions that could explain these anomalies except by going back to epochs when the prevalent botanical as well as geographical features of each were widely different from what they are now on the other hand if i regard the question from the new zealand point of view i find such broad features of resemblance and so many connecting links that afford irresistible evidence of a close botanical connection that i cannot abandon the conviction that these great differences will present the least difficulties to whatever theory may explain the whole case i will now state as briefly as possible what are the facts above referred to as being of so anomalous a character and there is little difficulty in doing so as we have them fully set forth with admirable clearness in the essay above alluded to and in the same writers introduction to the flora of new zealand only requiring some slight modifications owing to the later discoveries which are given in the handbook of the new zealand flora  confining ourselves always to flowering plants we find that the flora of new zealand is a very poor one considering the extent of surface and the favourable conditions of 489 soil and climate it consists of 1085 species our own islands possessing about 1500 but a very large proportion of these are peculiar there being no less than 800 endemic species and thirtytwo endemic genera  out of the 285 species not peculiar to new zealand no less than 215 are australian but a considerable number of these are also antarctic south american or european so that there are only about 100 species absolutely confined to new zealand and australia and what is important as indicating a somewhat recent immigration only some halfdozen of these belong to genera which are peculiar to the two countries and hardly any to the larger and more important australian genera many too are rare species in both countries and are often alpines  far more important are the relations of the genera and families of the two countries all the natural orders of new zealand are found in australia except threecoriariæ a widelyscattered group found in south europe the himalayas and the andes escallonieæ a widely distributed group and chloranthaceæ found in tropical asia japan polynesia and south america out of a total of 310 new zealand genera no less than 248 are australian and sixty of these are almost peculiar to the two countries only thirtytwo however being absolutely confined to them127 in the three large orderscompositæ orchideæ and gramineæ the genera are almost identical in the two countries while the speciesin the two former especiallyare mostly distinct  here then we have apparently a wonderful resemblance between the new zealand flora and that of australia indicated by more than twothirds of the nonpeculiar species and more than ninetenths of the nonpeculiar genera 255 being australian but now let us look at the other side of the question  there are in australia seven great genera of plants each containing more than 100 species all widely spread over 490 the country and all highly characteristic australian formsacacia eucalyptus melaleuca leucopogon stylidium grevillea and hakea these are entirely absent from new zealand except one species of leucopogon a genus which also has representatives in the malayan and pacific islands sixteen more australian genera have over fifty species each and of these eight are totally absent from new zealand five are represented by one or two species and only two are fairly represented but these twodrosera and helichrysumare very widespread genera and might have reached new zealand from other countries than australia  but this by no means exhausts the differences between new zealand and australia no less than seven australian natural ordersdilleniaceæ buettneriaceæ polygaleæ tremandreæ casuarineæ hæmodoraceæ and xyrideæ are entirely wanting in new zealand and several others which are excessively abundant and highly characteristic of the former country are very poorly represented in the latter thus leguminosæ are extremely abundant in australia where there are over 1000 species belonging to about 100 genera many of them altogether peculiar to the country yet in new zealand this great order is most scantily represented there being only five genera and thirteen species and only two of these genera swainsonia and clianthus are australian and as the latter consists of but two species it may as well have passed from new zealand to australia as the other way or more probably from some third country to them both128 goodeniaceæ with ten genera and 220 species australian has but two species in new zealandand one of these is a saltmarsh plant found also in tasmania and in chile and four other large australian ordersrhamneæ myoporineæ proteaceæ and santalaceæ have very few representatives in new zealand  we find then that the great fact we have to explain and account for is the undoubted affinity of the new 491 zealand flora to that of australia but an affinity almost exclusively confined to the least predominant and least peculiar portion of that flora leaving the most predominant most characteristic and most widely distributed portion absolutely unrepresented we must however be careful not to exaggerate the amount of affinity with australia apparently implied by the fact that nearly sixsevenths of the new zealand genera are also australian for as we have already stated a very large number of these are european antarctic south american or polynesian genera whose presence in the two contiguous areas only indicates a common origin about oneeighth only are absolutely confined to australia and new zealand thirtytwo genera and even of these several are better represented in new zealand than in australia and may therefore have passed from the former to the latter no less than 174 of the new zealand genera are temperate south american many being also antarctic or european while others again are especially tropical or polynesian yet undoubtedly a larger proportion of the natural orders and genera are common to australia than to any other country so that we may say that the basis of the flora is australian with a large intermixture of northern and southern temperate forms and others which have remote worldwide affinities  general features of the australian flora and its probable originbefore proceeding to point out how the peculiarities of the new zealand flora may be best accounted for it is necessary to consider briefly what are the main peculiarities of australian vegetation from which so important a part of that of new zealand has evidently been derived  the actual australian flora consists of two great divisionsa temperate and a tropical the temperate being again divisible into an eastern and a western portion all that is most characteristic of the australian flora belongs to the temperate division though these often overspread the whole continent in which are found almost all the remarkable australian types of vegetation and the numerous genera peculiar to this part of the world contrary to what occurs in most other countries the 492 tropical appears to be less rich in species and genera than the temperate region and what is still more remarkable it contains fewer peculiar species and very few peculiar genera although the area of tropical australia is about equal to that of the temperate portions and it has now been pretty well explored botanically it has probably not more than half as many species129 nearly 500 of its species are identical with indian or malayan plants or are very close representatives of them while there are more than 200 indian genera confined for the most part to the tropical portion of australia the remainder of the tropical flora consists of a few species and many genera of temperate 493 australia which range over the whole continent but these form only a small portion of the peculiarly australian genera  these remarkable facts clearly point to one conclusionthat the flora of tropical australia is comparatively recent and derivative if we imagine the greater part of north australia to have been submerged beneath the ocean from which it rose in the middle or latter part of the tertiary period offering an extensive area ready to be covered by such suitable forms of vegetation as could first reach it something like the present condition of things would inevitably arise from the north widespread indian and malay plants would quickly enter while from the south the most dominant forms of warmtemperate australia and such as were best adapted to the tropical climate and arid soil would intermingle with them even if numerous islands had occupied the area of northern australia for long periods anterior to the final elevation very much the same state of things would result  the existence in north and northeast australia of enormous areas covered with cretaceous and other secondary deposits as well as extensive tertiary formations lends support to the view that during very long epochs temperate australia was cut off from all close connection with the tropical and northern lands by a wide extent of sea and this isolation is exactly what was required in order to bring about the wonderful amount of specialisation and the high development manifested by the typical australian flora before proceeding further however let us examine this flora itself so far as regards its component parts and probable past history  the floras of southeastern and southwestern australiathe peculiarities presented by the southeastern and southwestern subdivisions of the flora of temperate australia are most interesting and suggestive and are perhaps unparalleled in any other part of the world southwest australia is far less extensive than the southeastern divisionless varied in soil and climate with no lofty mountains and much sandy desert yet strange to say it contains an equally rich flora and a far greater proportion of peculiar species and genera of plants as sir 494 joseph hooker remarkswhat differences there are in conditions would judging from analogy with other countries favour the idea that southeastern australia from its far greater area many large rivers extensive tracts of mountainous country and humid forests would present much the most extensive flora of which only the drier types could extend into southwestern australia but such is not the case for though the far greater area is much the best explored presents more varied conditions and is tenanted by a larger number of natural orders and genera these contain fewer species by several hundreds130  the fewer genera of southwestern australia are due almost wholly to the absence of the numerous european antarctic and southamerican types found in the southeastern region while in purely australian types it is far the richer for while it contains most of those found in the east it has a large number altogether peculiar to it and sir joseph hooker states that there are about 180 genera out of 600 in southwestern australia that are either not found at all in southeastern or that are represented there by a very few species only and these 180 genera include nearly 1100 species  geological explanation of the differences of these two florasthese facts again clearly point to the conclusion that southwestern australia is the remnant of the more extensive and more isolated portion of the continent in which the peculiar australian flora was principally developed the existence there of a very large area of granite800 miles in length by nearly 500 in maximum width with detached masses 200 miles to the north and 500 miles to the eastindicates such an extension for these 495 granitic masses were certainly once buried under piles of stratified rock since denuded and then formed the nucleus of the old western australian continent if we take the 1000fathom line around the southern part of australia to represent the probable extension of this old land we shall see that it would give a wide additional area south of the great australian bight and form a continent which even if the greater part of tropical australia were submerged would be sufficient for the development of a peculiar and abundant flora we must also remember that an elevation of 6000 feet added to the vast amount which has been taken away by denudation would change the whole country including what are now the deserts of the interior into a mountainous and wellwatered region  but while this rich and peculiar flora was in process of formation the eastern portion of the continent must either have been widely separated from the western or had perhaps not yet risen from the ocean the whole of this part of the country consists of palæozoic and secondary formations with granite and metamorphic rocks the secondary deposits being largely developed on both sides of the central range extending the whole length of the continent from tasmania to cape york and constituting the greater part of the plateau of the blue mountains and other lofty ranges during some portion of the secondary and tertiary periods therefore this side of australia must have been almost wholly submerged beneath the ocean and if we suppose that during this time the western part of the continent was at nearly its maximum extent and elevation we shall have a sufficient explanation of the great difference between the flora of western and eastern australia since the latter would only have been able to receive immigrants from the former at a later period and in a more or less fragmentary manner  if we examine the geological map of australia given in stanfords compendium of geography and travel volume australasia we shall see good reason to conclude that the eastern and the western divisions of the country first existed as separate islands and only became united at a comparatively recent epoch this is indicated by an 496 enormous stretch of cretaceous and tertiary formations extending from the gulf of carpentaria completely across the continent to the mouth of the murray river during the cretaceous period therefore and probably throughout a considerable portion of the tertiary epoch131 there must have been a wide arm of the sea occupying this area dividing the great mass of land on the westthe true seat and origin of the typical australian florafrom a long but narrow belt of land on the east indicated by the continuous mass of secondary and palæozoic formations already referred to which extend uninterruptedly from tasmania to cape york whether this formed one continuous land or was broken up into islands cannot be positively determined but the fact that no marine tertiary beds occur in the whole of this area renders it probable that it was almost if not quite continuous and that it not improbably extended across to what is now new guinea at this epoch then as shown in the accompanying map australia may not improbably have consisted of a very large and fertile western island almost or quite extratropical and extending from the silurian rocks of the flinders range in south australia to about 150 miles west of the present west coast and southward to about 350 miles south of the great australian bight to the east of this at a distance of from 250 to 400 miles extended in a north and south direction a long but comparatively narrow island stretching from far south of tasmania to new guinea while the crystalline and secondary formations of central north australia probably indicate the existence of one or more large islands in that direction  497    the white portions represent land the shaded parts sea   the existing land of australia is shown in outline  the eastern and the western islandswith which we are now chiefly concernedwould then differ considerably in their vegetation and animal life the western and more ancient land already possessed in its main features the peculiar australian flora and also the ancestral forms of its strange marsupial fauna both of which it had probably received at some earlier epoch by a temporary union with the asiatic continent over what is now the java sea eastern australia on the other hand possessed only the rudiments of its existing mixed flora derived from three distinct sources some important fragments of the typical australian vegetation had reached it across the marine 498 strait and had spread widely owing to the soil climate and general conditions being exactly suited to it from the north and northeast a tropical vegetation of polynesian type had occupied suitable areas in the north while the extension southward of the tasmanian peninsula accompanied probably as now with lofty mountains favoured the immigration of southtemperate forms from whatever antarctic lands or islands then existed this supposition is strikingly in harmony with what is known of the ancient flora of this portion of australia in deposits supposed to be of eocene age in new south wales and victoria fossil plants have been found showing a very different vegetation from that now existing along with a few australian typessuch as pittosporum knightia and eucalyptus there occur birches alders oaks and beeches while in tasmania in freshwater limestone apparently of miocene age are found willows alders birches oaks and beeches132 all except the latter genus fagus now quite extinct in australia133 these temperate forms probably indicate a more oceanic climate cooler and moister than at present the union with western australia and the establishment of an arid interior by modifying the climate may have led to the extinction of many of these forms and their replacement by special australian types more suited to the new conditions  at this time the marsupial fauna had not yet reached this eastern land which was however occupied in the north by some ancestral struthious birds which had entered it by way of new guinea through some very ancient continental extension and of which the emu the cassowaries the extinct dromornis of queensland and the moas and kiwis of new zealand are the modified descendants  the origin of the australian element in the new zealand florawe have now brought down the history of australia as deduced from its geological structure and the main features of its existing and tertiary flora to the period 499 when new zealand was first brought into close connection with it by means of a great northwestern extension of that country which as already explained in our last chapter is so clearly indicated by the form of the sea bottom see map p 471 the condition of new zealand previous to this event is very obscure that it had long existed as a more or less extensive land is indicated by its ancient sedimentary rocks while the very small areas occupied by jurassic and cretaceous deposits imply that much of the present land was then also above the sealevel the country had probably at that time a scanty vegetation of mixed antarctic and polynesian origin but now for the first time it would be open to the free immigration of such australian types as were suitable to its climate and which had already reached the tropical and subtropical portions of the eastern australian island it is here that we obtain the clue to those strange anomalies and contradictions presented by the new zealand flora in its relation to australia which have been so clearly set forth by sir joseph hooker and which have so puzzled botanists to account for but these apparent anomalies cease to present any difficulty when we see that the australian plants in new zealand were acquired not directly but as it were at second hand by union with an island which itself had as yet only received a portion of its existing flora and then further difficulties were placed in the way of new zealand receiving such an adequate representation of that portion of the flora which had reached east australia as its climate and position entitled it to by the fact of the union being not with the temperate but with the tropical and subtropical portions of that island so that only those groups could be acquired which were less exclusively temperate and had already established themselves in the warmer portion of their new home134  500  it is therefore no matter of surprise but exactly what we should expect that the great mass of preeminently temperate australian genera should be absent from new zealand including the whole of such important families as dilleniaceæ tremandreæ buettneriacæ polygaleæ casuarineæ and hæmodoraceæ while others such as rutaceæ stackhousieæ rhamneæ myrtaceæ proteaceæ and santalaceæ are represented by only a few species thus too we can explain the absence of all the peculiar australian leguminosæ for these were still mainly confined to the great western island along with the peculiar acacias and eucalypti which at a later period spread over the whole continent it is equally accordant with the view we are maintaining that among the groups which sir joseph hooker enumerates as keeping up the features of extra tropical australia in its tropical quarter several should have reached new zealand such as drosera some pittosporeæ and myoporineæ with a few proteaceæ loganiaceæ and restiaceæ for most of these are not only found in tropical australia but also in the malayan and pacific islands  tropical character of the new zealand flora explainedin this origin of the new zealand fauna by a northwestern route from northeastern australia we find also an explanation of the remarkable number of tropical groups of plants found there for though as sir joseph hooker has 501 shown a moist and uniform climate favours the extension of tropical forms in the temperate zone yet some means must be afforded them for reaching a temperate island on carefully going through the handbook and comparing its indications with those of benthams flora australiensis i find that there are in new zealand thirtyeight thoroughly tropical genera thirtythree of which are found in australiamostly in the tropical portion of it though a few are temperate and these may have reached it through new zealand135 to these we must add thirtytwo more genera which though chiefly developed in temperate australia extend into the tropical or subtropical portions of it and may well have reached new zealand by the same route  on the other hand we find but few new zealand genera certainly derived from australia which are especially temperate and it may be as well to give a list of such as 502 do occur with a few remarks they are sixteen in number as follows      1 pennantia 1 sp this genus has a species in norfolk island     indicating perhaps its former extension to the northwest      2 pomaderris 3 sp one species inhabits victoria and new zealand     indicating recent transoceanic migration      3 quintinia 2 sp this genus has winged seeds facilitating     migration      4 olearia 20 sp seeds with pappus      5 craspedia 2 sp seeds with pappus alpine identical with     australian species and therefore of comparatively recent introduction      6 celmisia 25 sp seeds with pappus only three australian species     two of which are identical with new zealand forms probably therefore     derived from new zealand      7 ozothamnus 5 sp seeds with pappus      8 epacris 4 sp minute seeds some species are subtropical and     they are all found in the northern warmer island of new zealand      9 archeria 2 sp minute seeds a species common to e australia and     new zealand      10 logania 3 sp small seeds alpine plants      11 hedycarya 1 sp      12 chiloglottis 1 sp minute seeds in auckland islands alpine in     australia      13 prasophyllum 1 sp minute seeds identical with australian     species indicating recent transmission      14 orthoceras 1 sp minute seeds identical with an australian     species      15 alepyrum 1 sp alpine mosslike an antarctic type      16 dichelachne 3 sp identical with australian species an awned     grass  we thus see that there are special features in most of these plants that would facilitate transmission across the sea between temperate australia and new zealand or to both from some antarctic island and the fact that in several of them the species are absolutely identical shows that such transmission has occurred in geologically recent times  species common to new zealand and australia mostly temperate formslet us now take the species which are common to new zealand and australia but found nowhere else and which must therefore have passed from one country to the other at a more recent period than the mass of genera with which we have hitherto been dealing these are ninetysix in number and they present a striking contrast to the similarly restricted genera in being wholly temperate in character the entire list presenting only a 503 single species which is confined to subtropical east australiaa grass apera arundinacea only found in a few localities on the new zealand coast  now it is clear that the larger portion if not the whole of these plants must have reached new zealand from australia or in a few cases australia from new zealand by transmission across the sea because we know there has been no actual land connection during the tertiary period as proved by the absence of all the australian mammalia and almost all the most characteristic australian birds insects and plants the form of the seabed shows that the distance could not have been less than 600 miles even during the greatest extension of southern new zealand and tasmania and we have no reason to suppose it to have been less because in other cases an equally abundant flora of identical species has reached islands at a still greater distancenotably in the case of the azores and bermuda the character of the plants is also just what we should expect for about twothirds of them belong to genera of worldwide range in the temperate zones such as ranunculus drosera epilobium gnaphalium senecio convolvulus atriplex luzula and many sedges and grasses whose exceptionally wide distribution shows that they possess exceptional powers of dispersal and vigour of constitution enabling them not only to reach distant countries but also to establish themselves there another set of plants belong to especially antarctic or south temperate groups such as colobanthus acæna gaultheria pernettya and muhlenbeckia and these may in some cases have reached both australia and new zealand from some now submerged antarctic island again about onefourth of the whole are alpine plants and these possess two advantages as colonisers their lofty stations place them in the best position to have their seeds carried away by winds and they would in this case reach a country which having derived the earlier portion of its flora from the side of the tropics would be likely to have its higher mountains and favourable alpine stations to a great extent unoccupied or occupied by plants unable to compete with specially adapted alpine groups 504  fully onethird of the exclusively australonew zealand species belong to the two great orders of the sedges and the grasses and there can be no doubt that these have great facilities for dispersion in a variety of ways their seeds often enveloped in chaffy glumes would be carried long distances by storms of wind and even if finally dropped into the sea would have so much less distance to reach the land by means of surface currents and mr darwins experiments show that even cultivated oats germinated after 100 days immersion in seawater others have hispid awns by which they would become attached to the feathers of birds and there is no doubt this is an effective mode of dispersal but a still more important point is probably that these plants are generally if not always windfertilised and are thus independent of any peculiar insects which might be wanting in the new country  why easilydispersed plants have often restricted rangesthis last consideration throws light on a very curious point which has been noted as a difficulty by sir joseph hooker that plants which have most clear and decided powers of dispersal by wind or other means have not generally the widest specific range and he instances the small number of compositæ common to new zealand and australia but in all these cases it will i think be found that although the species have not a wide range the genera often have in new zealand for instance the compositæ are very abundant there being no less than 167 species almost all belonging to australian genera yet only about onesixteenth of the whole are identical in the two countries the explanation of this is not difficult owing to their great powers of dispersal the australian compositæ reached new zealand at a very remote epoch and such as were adapted to the climate and the means of fertilisation established themselves but being highly organised plants with great flexibility of organisation they soon became modified in accordance with the new conditions producing many special forms in different localities and these spreading widely soon took possession of all suitable stations henceforth immigrants from australia had to compete 505 with these indigenous and wellestablished plants and only in a few cases were able to obtain a footing whence it arises that we have many australian types but few australian species in new zealand and both phenomena are directly traceable to the combination of great powers of dispersal with a high degree of adaptability exactly the same thing occurs with the still more highly specialised orchideæ these are not proportionally so numerous in new zealand thirtyeight species and this is no doubt due to the fact that so many of them require insectfertilisation often by a particular family or genus whereas almost any insect will fertilise compositæ and insects of all orders are remarkably scarce in new zealand136 this would at once prevent the establishment of many of the orchids which may have reached the islands while those which did find suitable fertilisers and other favourable conditions would soon become modified into new species it is thus quite intelligible why only three species of orchids are identical in australia and new zealand although their minute and abundant seeds must be dispersed by the wind almost as readily as the spores of ferns  another specialised groupthe scrophularineæabounds in new zealand where there are sixtytwo species but though almost all the genera are australian only three species are so here too the seeds are usually very small and the powers of dispersal great as shown by several european generaveronica euphrasia and limosella being found in the southern hemisphere  looking at the whole series of these australonew zealand plants we find the most highly specialised groupscompositæ scrophularineæ orchideæwith a small proportion of identical species onethirteenth to one twentieth the less highly specialisedranunculaceæ onagrariæ and ericeæwith a higher proportion oneninth to onesixth and the least specialisedjunceæ 506 cyperaceæ and gramineæwith the high proportion in each case of onefourth these nine are the most important new zealand orders which contain species common to that country and australia and confined to them and the marked correspondence they show between high specialisation and want of specific identity while the generic identity is in all cases approximately equal points to the conclusion that the means of diffusion are in almost all plants ample when long periods of time are concerned and that diversities in this respect are not so important in determining the peculiar character of a derived flora as adaptability to varied conditions great powers of multiplication and inherent vigour of constitution this point will have to be more fully discussed in treating of the origin of the antarctic and north temperate members of the new zealand flora  summary and conclusion on the new zealand floraconfining ourselves strictly to the direct relations between the plants of new zealand and of australia as i have done in the preceding discussion i think i may claim to have shown that the union between the two countries in the latter part of the secondary epoch at a time when eastern australia was widely separated from western australia as shown by its geological formation and by the contour of the seabottom does sufficiently account for all the main features of the new zealand flora it shows why the basis of the flora is fundamentally australian both as regards orders and genera for it was due either to a direct land connection or a somewhat close approximation between the two countries it shows also why the great mass of typical australian forms are unrepresented for the australian flora is typically western and temperate and new zealand received its immigrants from the eastern island which had itself received only a fragment of this flora and from the tropical end of this island and thus could only receive such forms as were not exclusively temperate in character it shows further why new zealand contains such a very large proportion of tropical forms for we see that it derived the main portion of its flora directly from the tropics again this hypothesis shows us why though 507 the specially australian genera in new zealand are largely tropical or subtropical the specially australian species are wholly temperate or alpine for these are comparatively recent arrivals they must have migrated across the sea in the temperate zone and these temperate and alpine forms are exactly such as would be best able to establish themselves in a country already stocked mainly by tropical forms and their modified descendants this hypothesis further fulfils the conditions implied in sir joseph hookers anticipation thatthese great differences of the floras will present the least difficulties to whatever theory may explain the whole casefor it shows that these differences are directly due to the history and development of the australian flora itself while the resemblances depend upon the most certain cause of all such broad resemblancesclose proximity or actual land connection  one objection will undoubtedly be made to the above theorythat it does not explain why some species of the prominent australian genera acacia eucalyptus melaleuca grevillea c have not reached new zealand in recent times along with the other temperate forms that have established themselves but it is doubtful whether any detailed explanation of such a negative fact is possible while general explanations sufficient to cover it are not wanting nothing is more certain than that numerous plants never run wild and establish themselves in countries where they nevertheless grow freely if cultivated and the explanation of this fact given by mr darwinthat they are prevented doing so by the competition of better adapted formsis held to be sufficient in this particular case however we have some very remarkable evidence of the fact of their nonadaptation the intercourse between new zealand and europe has been the means of introducing a host of common european plantsmore than 150 in number as enumerated at the end of the second volume of the handbook yet although the intercourse with australia has probably been greater only two or three australian plants have similarly established themselves more remarkable still sir joseph hooker states 508 i am informed that the late mr bidwell habitually scattered australian seeds during his extensive travels in new zealand we may be pretty sure that seeds of such excessively common and characteristic groups as acacia and eucalyptus would be among those so scattered yet we have no record of any plants of these or other peculiar australian genera ever having been found wild still less of their having spread and taken possession of the soil in the way that many european plants have done we are then entitled to conclude that the plants above referred to have not established themselves in new zealand although their seeds may have reached it because they could not successfully compete with the indigenous flora which was already well established and better adapted to the conditions of climate and of the organic environment this explanation is so perfectly in accordance with a large body of wellknown facts including that which is known to every onehow few of our oldest and hardiest garden plants ever run wildthat the objection above stated will i feel convinced have no real weight with any naturalists who have paid attention to this class of questions

new zealandthe absence of southern types     from the northern hemisphereconcluding remarks on the new zealand and     south temperate floras  we have now to deal with another portion of the new zealand flora which presents perhaps equal difficultiesthat which appears to have been derived from remote parts of the north and south temperate zones and this will lead us to inquire into the origin of the northern or arctic element in all the south temperate floras  more than onethird of the entire number of new zealand genera 115 are found also in europe and even fiftyeight species are identical in these remote parts of the world temperate south america has seventyfour genera in common with new zealand and there are even eleven species identical in the two countries as well as thirtytwo which are close allies or representative species 510 a considerable number of these northern or antarctic plants and many more which are representative species are found also in tasmania and in the mountains of temperate australia and sir joseph hooker gives a list of thirtyeight species very characteristic of europe and northern asia but almost or quite unknown in the warmer regions which yet reappear in temperate australia other genera seem altogether antarcticthat is confined to the extreme southern lands and islands and these often have representative species in southern america tasmania and new zealand while others occur only in one or two of these areas many north temperate genera also occur in the mountains of south africa on the other hand few if any of the peculiar australian or antarctic types have spread northwards except some of the former which have reached the mountains of borneo and a few of the latter which spread along the andes to mexico  on these remarkable facts of which i have given but the barest outline sir joseph hooker makes the following suggestive observations  when i take a comprehensive view of the vegetation of the old world i am struck with the appearance it presents of there being a continuous current of vegetation if i may so fancifully express myself from scandinavia to tasmania along in short the whole extent of that arc of the terrestrial sphere which presents the greatest continuity of land in the first place scandinavian genera and even species reappear everywhere from lapland and iceland to the tops of the tasmanian alps in rapidly diminishing numbers it is true but in vigorous development throughout they abound on the alps and pyrenees pass on to the caucasus and himalayas thence they extend along the khasia mountains and those of the peninsulas of india to those of ceylon and the malayan archipelago java and borneo and after a hiatus of 30° they appear on the alps of new south wales victoria and tasmania and beyond these again on those of new zealand and the antarctic islands many of the species remaining unchanged throughout it matters not what the vegetation of the bases and flanks of these mountains may be the northern species may be 511 associated with alpine forms of germanic siberian oriental chinese american malayan and finally australian and antarctic types but whereas these are all more or less local assemblages the scandinavian asserts his prerogative of ubiquity from britain to beyond its antipodes137  it is impossible to place the main facts more forcibly before the reader than in the above striking passage it shows clearly that this portion of the new zealand flora is due to widespread causes which have acted with even greater effect in other south temperate lands and that in order to explain its origin we must grapple with the entire problem of the transfer of the north temperate flora to the southern hemisphere taking therefore the facts as given by sir joseph hooker in the works already referred to i shall discuss the whole question broadly and shall endeavour to point out the general laws and subordinate causes that in my opinion have been at work in bringing about the anomalous phenomena of distribution he has done so much to make known and to elucidate  aggressive power of the scandinavian florathe first important fact bearing upon this question is the wonderful aggressive and colonising power of the scandinavian flora as shown by the way in which it establishes itself in any temperate country to which it may gain access about 150 species have thus established themselves in new zealand often taking possession of large tracts of country about the same number are found in australia and nearly as many in the atlantic states of america where they form the commonest weeds whether or not we accept mr darwins explanation of this power as due to development in the most extensive land area of the globe where competition has been most severe and longcontinued the fact of the existence of this power remains and we can see how important an agent it must be in the formation of the floras of any lands to which these aggressive plants have been able to gain access  but not only are these plants preeminently capable of holding their own in any temperate country in the world but they also have exceptional powers of migration and 512 dispersal over seas and oceans this is especially well shown by the case of the azores where no less than 400 out of a total of 478 flowering plants are identical with european species these islands are more than 800 miles from europe and as we have already seen in chapter xii there is no reason for supposing that they have ever been more nearly connected with it than they are now since an extension of the european coast to the 1000fathom line would very little reduce the distance now it is a most interesting and suggestive fact that more than half the european genera which occur in the australian flora occur also in the azores and in several cases even the species are identical in both138 the importance of such a case as this cannot be exaggerated because it affords a demonstration of the power of the very plants in question to pass over wide areas of sea some no doubt wholly through the air carried by storms in the same way as the european birds and insects which annually reach the azores others by floating on the waters or by a combination of the two methods while some may have been carried by aquatic birds to whose feathers many seeds have the power of attaching themselves and some even in the stomachs of fruit or seed eating birds we have in such facts as these a complete disproof of the necessity for those great changes of sea and land which are continually appealed to by those who think landconnection the only efficient means of accounting for the migration of animals or plants but at the same time we do not neglect to make the fullest use of such moderate changes as all the evidence at our command leads us to believe have actually occurred and especially of the former existence of intermediate islands so often indicated by shoals in the midst of the deepest oceans  means by which plants have migrated from north to southbut if plants can thus pass in considerable numbers and variety over wide seas and oceans it must be yet more easy for them to traverse continuous areas of land whereever mountainchains offer suitable stations at moderate 513 intervals on which they might temporarily establish themselves the facilities afforded for the transmission of plants by mountains has hardly received sufficient attention the numerous landslips the fresh surfaces of broken rock and precipice the debris of torrents and the moraines deposited by glaciers afford numerous unoccupied stations on which windborne seeds have a good chance of germinating it is a wellknown fact that fresh surfaces of soil or rock such as are presented by railway cuttings and embankments often produce plants strange to the locality which survive for a few years and then disappear as the normal vegetation gains strength and permanence139 but such a surface 514 will in the meantime have acted as a fresh centre of dispersal and thus a plant might pass on step by step by means of stations temporarily occupied till it reached a district 515 where the general conditions being more favourable it was able to establish itself as a permanent member of the flora such generally speaking was probably the process by which the scandinavian flora has made its way to the southern hemisphere but it could hardly have done so to any important extent without the aid of those powerful causes explained in our eighth chaptercauses which acted as a constantly recurrent motivepower to produce that continuous current of vegetation from north to south across the whole width of the tropics referred to by sir joseph hooker those causes were the repeated changes 516 of climate which during all geological time appear to have occurred in both hemispheres culminating at rare intervals in glacial epochs and which have been shown to depend upon changes of excentricity of the earths orbit and the occurrence of summer or winter in aphelion in conjunction with the slower and more irregular changes of geographical conditions these combined causes acting chiefly through the agency of heatbearing oceanic currents and of snow and icecollecting highlands let us now briefly consider how such changes would act in favouring the dispersal of plants  elevation and depression of the snow line as aiding the migration of plantswe have endeavoured to show in an earlier portion of this volume that wherever geographical or physical conditions were such as to produce any considerable amount of perpetual snow this would be increased whenever a high degree of excentricity concurred with winter in aphelion and diminished during the opposite phase on all mountain ranges therefore which reached above the snowline there would be a periodical increase and decrease of snow and when there were extensive areas of plateau at about the same level the lowering of the snowline might cause such an increased accumulation of snow as to produce great glaciers and icefields such as we have seen occurred in south africa during the last period of high excentricity but along with such depression of the line of perpetual snow there would be a corresponding depression of the alpine and subalpine zones suitable for the growth of an arctic and temperate vegetation and what is perhaps more important the depression would necessarily produce a great extension of the area of these zones on all high mountains because as we descend the average slopes become less abruptthus affording a number of new stations suitable for such temperate plants as might first reach them but just above and below the snowline is the area of most powerful disintegration and denudation from the alternate action of frost and sun of ice and water and thus the more extended area would be subject to the constant occurrence of landslips bergfalls and floods with their 517 accompanying accumulations of débris and of alluvial soil affording innumerable stations in which solitary windborne seeds might germinate and temporarily establish themselves  this lowering and rising of the snowline each 10500 years during periods of high excentricity would occur in the northern and southern hemispheres alternately and where there were high mountains within the tropics the two would probably overlap each other so that the northern depression would make itself felt in a slight degree even across the equator some way into the southern hemisphere and vice versâ and even if the difference of the height of perpetual snow at the two extremes did not average more than a few hundred feet this would be amply sufficient to supply the new and unoccupied stations needful to facilitate the migration of plants it is well known that all great mountain ranges have undergone such fluctuations as proved by icemarks below the present level of snow and ice  but the differences of temperature in the two hemispheres caused by the sun being in perihelion in the winter of the one while it was in aphelion during the same season in the other would necessarily lead to increased aërial and marine currents as already explained and whenever geographical conditions were such as to favour the production of glaciation in any area these effects would become more powerful and would further aid in the dispersal of the seeds of plants  changes of climate favourable to migrationit is clear then that during periods when no glacial epochs were produced in the northern hemisphere and even when a mild climate extended over the whole polar area alternate changes of climate favouring the dispersal of plants would occur on all high mountains and with particular force on such as rise above the snowline but during that longcontinued though comparatively recent phase of high excentricity which produced an extensive glaciation in the northern hemisphere and local glaciations in the southern these risings and lowerings of the snowline on all mountain ranges would have been at a maximum and 518 would have been increased by the depression of the ocean which must have arisen from such a vast bulk of water being locked up in landice and which depression would have produced the same effect as a general elevation of all the continents at this time too aërial currents would have attained their maximum of force in both hemispheres and this would greatly facilitate the dispersal of all windborne seeds as well as of those carried in the plumage or in the stomachs of birds since we have seen by the cases of the azores and bermuda how vastly the migratory powers of birds are increased by a stormy atmosphere  migration from north to south has been long going onnow if each phase of colder and warmer mountainclimateeach alternate depression and elevation of the snowline only helped on the migration of a few species some stages of the long route from the north to the south temperate regions yet during the long course of the tertiary period there might well have arisen that representation of the northern flora in the southern hemisphere which is now so conspicuous for it is very important to remark that it is not the existing flora alone that is represented such as might have been conveyed during the last glacial epoch only but we find a whole series of northern types evidently of varying degrees of antiquity while even some genera characteristic of the southern hemisphere appear to have been originally derived from europe thus eucalyptus and metrosideros have been determined by dr ettingshausen from their fruits in the eocene beds of sheppey while pimelea leptomeria and four genera of proteaceæ have been recognised by professor heer in the miocene of switzerland and the former writer has detected fiftyfive australian forms in the eocene plant beds of häring  belgium140 then we have such peculiar genera 519 as pachychladon and notothlaspi of new zealand said to have affinities with arctic plants while stilbocarpaanother peculiar new zealand genushas its nearest allies in the himalayan and chinese aralias following these are a whole host of very distinct species of northern genera which may date back to any part of the tertiary period and which occur in every south temperate land then we have closely allied representative species of european or arctic plants and lastly a number of identical speciesand these two classes are probably due entirely to the action of the last great glacial epoch whose long continuance and the repeated fluctuations of climate with which it commenced and terminated rendered it an agent of sufficient power to have brought about this result  here then we have that constant or constantly recurrent process of dispersal acting throughout long periods with varying powerthat continuous current of vegetation as it has been termed which the facts demand and the extraordinary phenomenon of the species and genera of european and even of arctic plants being represented abundantly in south america australia and new zealand thus adds another to the long series of phenomena which are rendered intelligible by frequent alternations of warmer and colder climates in either hemisphere culminating at long intervals and in favourable situations in actual glacial epochs  geological changes as aiding migrationit will be well also to notice here that there is another aid to dispersion dependent upon the changes effected by denudation during the long periods included in the duration of the species and genera of plants a considerable number of 520 the plants of the miocene period of europe were so much like existing species that although they have generally received fresh names they may well have been identical and a large proportion of the vegetation during the whole tertiary period consisted of genera which are still living141 but from what is now known of the rate of subaërial denudation we are sure that during each division of this period many mountain chains must have been considerably lowered while we know that some of the existing ranges have been greatly elevated ancient volcanoes too have been destroyed by denudation and new ones have been built up so that we may be quite sure that ample means for the transmission of temperate plants across the tropics may have existed in countries where they are now no longer to be found the great mountain masses of guiana and brazil for example must have been far more lofty before the sedimentary covering was denuded from their granitic bosses and metamorphic peaks and may have aided the southern migration of plants before the final elevation of the andes and if africa presents us with an example of a continent of vast antiquity we may be sure that its great central plateaux once bore far loftier mountain ranges before they were reduced to their present condition by long ages of denudation  proofs of migration by way of the andeswe are now prepared to apply the principles above laid down to the explanation of the character and affinities of the various portions of the north temperate flora in the southern hemisphere and especially in australia and new zealand  at the present time the only unbroken chain of highlands and mountains connecting the arctic and north temperate with the antarctic lands is to be found in the american continent the only break of importance being the comparatively low isthmus of panama where there is 521 a distance of about 300 miles occupied by rugged forestclad hills between the lofty peaks of veragua and the northern extremity of the andes of new grenada such distances are as we have already seen no barrier to the diffusion of plants and we should accordingly expect that this great continuous mountainchain has formed the most effective agent in aiding the southward migration of the arctic and north temperate vegetation we do find in fact not only that a large number of northern genera and many species are scattered all along this line of route but that at the end of the long journey in southern chile and fuegia they have established themselves in such numbers as to form an important part of the flora of those countries from the lists given in the works already referred to it appears that there are between sixty and seventy northern genera in fuegia and southern chile while about forty of the species are absolutely identical with those of europe and the arctic regions considering how comparatively little the mountains of south temperate america are yet known this is a very remarkable result and it proves that the transmission of species must have gone on up to comparatively recent times yet as only a few of these species are now found along the line of migration we see that they only occupied such stations temporarily and we may connect their disappearance with the passing away of the last glacial period which by raising the snowline reduced the area on which alone they could exist and exposed them to the competition of indigenous plants from the belt of country immediately below them  now just as these numerous species and genera have undoubtedly passed along the great american range of mountains although only now found at its two extremes so others have doubtless passed on further and have found more suitable stations or less severe competition in the antarctic continent and islands in new zealand in tasmania and even in australia itself the route by which they may have reached these countries is easily marked out immediately south of cape horn at a distance of only 500 miles are the south shetland islands and grahams land whence the antarctic continent or a 522 group of large islands probably extends across or around the south polar area to victoria land and thence to adélie land the outlying young island 12000 feet high is about 750 miles south of the macquarie islands which may be considered a southern outlier of the new zealand group and the macquarie islands are about the same distance from the 1000fathom line at a point marking the probable southern extension of tasmania other islands may have existed at intermediate points but even as it is these distances are not greater than we know are traversed by plants both by flotation and by aërial currents especially in such a stormy atmosphere as that of the antarctic regions now we may further assume that what we know occurred within the arctic circle also took place in the antarcticthat is that there have been alternations of climate during which some portion of what are now iceclad lands became able to support a considerable amount of vegetation142 during such periods there would be a steady migration of plants from all southern circumpolar countries to people the comparatively unoccupied continent and the southern extremity of america being considerably the nearest and also being the best stocked with those northern types which have such great powers of migration and colonisation such plants would form the bulk of the antarctic vegetation and during the continuance of the milder southern climate would occupy the whole area  when the cold returned and the land again became iceclad these plants would be crowded towards the outer margins of the antarctic land and its islands and some of them would find their way across the sea to such countries as offered on their mountain summits suitable cool stations and as this process of alternately receiving plants from chile and fuegia and transmitting them in all directions from the central antarctic land may have been 523 repeated several times during the tertiary period we have no difficulty in understanding the general community between the european and antarctic plants found in all south temperate lands kerguelens land and the crozets are within about the same distance from the antarctic continent as new zealand and tasmania and we need not therefore be surprised at finding in each of these islands some fuegian species which have not reached the others of course there will remain difficulties of detail as there always must remain so long as our knowledge of the past changes of the earths surface and the history of the particular plants concerned is so imperfect sir joseph hooker notes for example the curious fact that several compositæ common to three such remote localities as the auckland islands fuegia and kerguelens land have no pappus or seeddown while such as have pappus are in no case common even to two of these islands without knowing the exact history and distribution of the genera to which these plants belong it would be useless to offer any conjecture except that they are ancient forms which may have survived great geographical changes or may have some peculiar and exceptional means of dispersion  proofs of migration by way of the himalayas and southern asiabut although we may thus explain the presence of a considerable portion of the european element in the floras of new zealand and australia we cannot account for the whole of it by this means because australia itself contains a host of european and asiatic genera of which we find no trace in new zealand or south america or any other antarctic land we find in fact in australia two distinct sets of european plants first we have a number of species identical with those of northern europe or asia of the most characteristic of whichthirtyeight in numbersir joseph hooker gives a list and in the second place a series of european genera usually of a somewhat more southern character mostly represented by very distinct species and all absent from new zealand such as clematis papaver cleome polygala lavatera ajuga c now of the first setthe north european speciesabout threefourths occur in some parts of america 524 and about half in south temperate america or new zealand whence we may conclude that most of these as well as some others have reached australia by the route already indicated the second set of australoeuropean genera however and many others characteristic of the south european or the himalayan flora have probably reached australia by way of the mountains of southern asia borneo the moluccas and new guinea at a somewhat remote period when loftier ranges and some intermediate peaks may have existed sufficient to carry on the migration by the aid of the alternate climatal changes which are known to have occurred the long belt of secondary and palæozoic formations in east australia from tasmania to cape york continued by the lofty ranges of new guinea indicates the route of this immigration and sufficiently explains how it is that these northern types are almost wholly confined to this part of the australian continent some of the earlier immigrants of this class no doubt passed over to new zealand and now form a portion of the peculiar genera confined to these two countries but most of them are of later date and have thus remained in australia only  proofs of migration by way of the african highlandsit is owing to this twofold current of vegetation flowing into australia by widely different routes that we have in this distant land a better representation of the european flora both as regards species and genera than in any other part of the southern hemisphere and so far as i can judge of the facts there is no general phenomenonthat is nothing in the distribution of genera and other groups of plants as opposed to cases of individual speciesthat is not fairly accounted for by such an origin it further receives support from the case of south africa which also contains a large and important representation of the northern flora but here we see no indications or very slight ones of that southern influx which has given australia such a community of vegetation with the antarctic lands there are no less than sixty genera of strictly north temperate plants in south africa none of which occur in australia while very few of the species so characteristic of australia new zealand and fuegia are found there it 525 is clear therefore that south africa has received its european plants by the direct route through the abyssinian highlands and the lofty equatorial mountains and mostly at a distant period when the conditions for migration were somewhat more favourable than they are now the much greater directness of the route from northern europe to south africa than to australia and the existence even now of lofty mountains and extensive highlands for a large portion of the distance will explain what sir joseph hooker notes as a very curious fact why south africa has more very northern european genera than australia while australia has more identical species and a better representation on the whole of the european florathis being clearly due to the large influx of species it has received from the antarctic islands in addition to those which have entered it by way of asia the greater distance of south africa even now from any of these islands and the much deeper sea to the south of the african continent than in the case of tasmania and new zealand indicating a smaller recent extension southward is all quite in harmony with the facts of distribution of the northern flora above referred to  supposed connection of south africa and australiathere remains however the small amount of direct affinity between the vegetation of south africa and that of australia new zealand and temperate south america consisting in all of fifteen genera five of which are confined to australia and south africa while several natural orders are better represented in these two countries than in any other part of the world this resemblance has been supposed to imply some former landconnection of all the great southern lands but it appears to me that any such supposition is wholly unnecessary the differences between the faunas and floras of these countries are too great and too radical to render it possible that any such connection should have existed except at a very remote period but if we have to go back so far for an explanation a much simpler one presents itself and one more in accordance with what we have learnt of the general permanence of deep oceans and the great changes that have taken place 526 in the distribution of all forms of life just as we explain the presence of marsupials in australia and america and of centetidæ in madagascar and the antilles by the preservation in these localities of remnants of once widespread types so we should prefer to consider the few genera common to australia and south africa as remnants of an ancient vegetation once spread over the northern hemisphere driven southward by the pressure of more specialised types and now finding a refuge in these two widely separated southern lands it is suggestive of such an explanation that these genera are either of very ancient groupsas conifers and cycadsor plants of low organisation as the restiaceæor of worldwide distribution as melanthaceæ  the endemic genera of plants in new zealandreturning now to the new zealand flora with which we are more especially concerned there only remains to be considered the peculiar or endemic genera which characterise it these are thirtytwo in number and are mostly very isolated a few have affinities with arctic groups others with himalayan or australian genera several are tropical forms but the majority appear to be altogether peculiar types of worldwide groupsas leguminosæ saxifrageæ compositæ orchideæ c we must evidently trace back these peculiar forms to the earliest immigrants either from the north or from the south and the great antiquity we are obliged to give to new zealandan antiquity supported by every feature in its fauna and flora no less than by its geological structure and its extinct forms of life143affords ample time for the changes in the general distribution of plants and for those due to isolation and modification under 527 the influence of changed conditions which are manifested by the extreme peculiarity of many of these interesting endemic forms  the absence of southern types from the northern hemispherewe have now only to notice the singular want of reciprocity in the migrations of northern and southern types of vegetation in return for the vast number of european plants which have reached australia not one single australian plant has entered any part of the north temperate zone and the same may be said of the typical southern vegetation in general whether developed in the antarctic lands new zealand south america or south africa the furthest northern outliers of the southern flora are a few genera of antarctic type on the bornean alps the genus acæna which has a species in california two representatives of the australian floracasuarina and stylidium in the peninsula of india while china and the philippines have two strictly australian genera of orchideæmicrotis and thelymitra as well as a restiaceous genus several distinct causes appear to have combined to produce this curious inability of the southern flora to make its way into the northern hemisphere the primary cause is no doubt the totally different distribution of land in the two hemispheres so that in the south there is the minimum of land in the colder parts of the temperate zone and in the north the maximum this is well shown by the fact that on the parallel of lat 50° n we pass over 240° of land or shallow sea while on the same parallel of south latitude we have only 4° where we cross the southern part of patagonia again the three most important south temperate landareassouth temperate america south africa and australiaare widely separated from each other and have in all probability always been so whereas the whole of the north temperate lands are practically continuous it follows that instead of the enormous northern area in which highly organised and dominant groups of plants have been developed gifted with great colonising and aggressive powers we have in the south three comparatively small and detached areas in which rich floras have been developed with special 528 adaptations to soil climate and organic environment but comparatively impotent and inferior beyond their own domain  another circumstance which makes the contest between the northern and southern forms still more unequal is the much greater hardiness of the former from having been developed in a colder region and one where alpine and arctic conditions extensively prevail whereas the southern floras have been mainly developed in mild regions to which they have been altogether confined while the northern plants have been driven north or south by each succeeding change of climate the southern species have undergone comparatively slight changes of this nature owing to the areas they occupy being unconnected with the icebearing antarctic continent it follows that whereas the northern plants find in all these southern lands a milder and more equable climate than that to which they have been accustomed and are thus often able to grow and flourish even more vigorously than in their native land the southern plants would find in almost every part of europe north america or northern asia a more severe and less equable climate with winters that usually prove fatal to them even under cultivation these causes taken separately are very powerful but when combined they must i think be held to be amply sufficient to explain why examples of the typical southern vegetation are almost unknown in the north temperate zone while a very few of them have extended so far as the northern tropic144  529  concluding remarks on the last two chaptersour inquiry into the external relations and probable origin of the fauna and flora of new zealand has thus led us on to a general theory as to the cause of the peculiar biological relations between the northern and the southern hemispheres and no better or more typical example could be found of the wide range and great interest of the study of the geographical distribution of animals and plants  the solution which has here been given of one of the most difficult of this class of problems has been rendered possible solely by the knowledge very recently obtained of the form of the seabottom in the southern ocean and of the geological structure of the great australian continent without this knowledge we should have nothing but a series of guesses or probabilities on which to found our hypothetical explanation which we have now been able to build up on a solid foundation of fact the complete separation of east from west australia during a portion of the cretaceous and tertiary periods could never have been guessed till it was established by the laborious explorations of the australian geologists while the hypothesis of a comparatively shallow sea uniting new zealand by a long route with tropical australia while a profoundly deep ocean always separated it from temperate australia would have been rejected as too improbable a supposition for the foundation of even the most enticing theory yet it is mainly by means of these two facts that we are enabled to give an adequate explanation of the strange anomalies in the flora of australia and its relation to that of new zealand  in the more general explanation of the relations of the various northern and southern floras i have shown what an important aid to any such explanation is the theory of repeated changes of climate not necessarily of great amount given in chapters viii and ix while the whole discussion justifies the importance attached to the theory of the general permanence of continents and oceans as demonstrated in chapter vi since any rational explanation based upon facts as opposed to mere unsupported 530 conjecture must take such general permanence as a startingpoint the whole inquiry into the phenomena presented by islands which forms the main subject of the present volume has i think shown that this theory does afford a firm foundation for the discussion of questions of distribution and dispersal and that by its aid combined with a clear perception of the wonderful powers of dispersion and modification in the organic world when long periods are considered the most difficult problems connected with this subject cease to be insoluble                                        531  chapter xxiv  summary and conclusion      the present volume is the development and

of facts and theories and it will be well to recall these to the readers attention and point out their connection with each other in a concluding chapter i hope to be able to show that although at first sight somewhat fragmentary and disconnected this work is really the development of a clear and definite theory and its application to the solution of a number of biological problems that theory is briefly that the distribution of the various species and groups of living things over the earths surface and their aggregation in definite assemblages in certain areas is the 532 direct result and outcome of a complex set of causes which may be grouped as biological and physical the biological causes are mainly of two kindsfirstly the constant tendency of all organisms to increase in numbers and to occupy a wider area and their various powers of dispersion and migration through which when unchecked they are enabled to spread widely over the globe and secondly those laws of evolution and extinction which determine the manner in which groups of organisms arise and grow reach their maximum and then dwindle away often breaking up into separate portions which long survive in very remote regions the physical causes are also mainly of two kinds we have first the geographical changes which at one time isolate a whole fauna and flora at another time lead to their dispersal and intermixture with adjacent faunas and florasand it was here important to ascertain and define the exact nature and extent of these changes and to determine the question of the general stability or instability of continents and oceans in the second place it was necessary to determine the exact nature extent and frequency of the changes of climate which have occurred in various parts of the earthbecause such changes are among the most powerful agents in causing the dispersal and extinction of plants and animals hence the importance attached to the question of geological climates and their causes which have been here investigated at some length with the aid of the most recent researches of geologists physicists and explorers these various inquiries led on to an investigation of the mode of formation of stratified deposits with a view to fix within some limits their probable age and also to an estimate of the probable rate of development of the organic world and both these processes are shown to involve so far as we can judge periods of time less vast than have generally been thought necessary  the numerous facts and theories established in the first part of the work are then applied to explain the phenomena presented by the floras and faunas of the chief islands of the globe which are classified in accordance with their physical origin in three groups or classes each 533 of which are shown to exhibit certain wellmarked biological features  having thus shown that the work is a connected whole founded on the principle of tracing out the more recondite causes of the distribution of organisms we will briefly indicate the scope and object of the several chapters by means of which this general conception has been carried out  beginning with simple and familiar facts relating to british and european quadrupeds and birds i have defined and shown the exact character of areas of distribution as applied to species genera and families and have illustrated the subject by maps showing the peculiarities of distribution of some wellknown groups of birds taking then our british mammals and landbirds i follow them over the whole area they inhabit and thus obtain a foundation for the establishment of zoological regions and a clear insight into their character as distinct from the usual geographical divisions of the globe  the facts thus far established are then shown to be necessary results of the law of evolution the nature and amount of variation is exhibited by a number of curious examples the origin growth and decay of species and genera are traced and all the interesting phenomena of isolated groups and discontinuous generic and specific areas are shown to follow as logical consequences  the next subject investigated is the means by which the various groups of animals are enabled to overcome the natural barriers which often seem to limit them to very restricted areas how far those barriers are themselves liable to be altered or abolished and what is the exact nature and amount of the changes of sea and land which our earth has undergone in past times this latter part of the inquiry is shown to be the most important as it is the most fundamental and as it is still a subject of controversy and many erroneous views prevail in regard to it it is discussed at some length several distinct classes of evidence are adduced to prove that the grand features of our globethe position of the great oceans 534 and the chief landareashave remained on the whole unchanged throughout geological time our continents are shown to be built up mainly of shoredeposits and even the chalk which is so often said to be the exact equivalent of the globigerina ooze now forming in midatlantic is shown to be a comparatively shallowwater deposit formed in inland seas or in the immediate vicinity of land the general stability of continents has however been accompanied by constant changes of form and insular conditions have prevailed over every part in succession and the effect of such changes on the distribution of organisms is pointed out  we then approach the consideration of another set of changesthose of climatewhich have probably been agents of the first importance in modifying the specific forms as well as the distribution of animals here again we find ourselves in the midst of fierce controversies the occurrence of a recent glacial epoch of great severity in the northern hemisphere is now universally admitted but the causes which brought it on are matter of dispute but unless we can arrive at these causes as well as at those which produced the equally well demonstrated mild climate in the arctic regions we shall be quite unable to determine the nature and amount of the changes of climate which have occurred throughout past ages and shall thus be left without a most important clue to the explanation of many of the anomalies in the distribution of animals and plants  i have therefore devoted three chapters to a full investigation of this question i have first given such a sketch of the most salient facts as to render the phenomena of the glacial epoch clear and intelligible i then review the various suggested explanations and taking up the two which alone seem tenable i endeavour to determine the true principles of each while adopting generally mr crolls views as to the causes of the glacial epoch i have introduced certain limitations and modifications i have pointed out i believe more clearly than has hitherto been done the very different effects on climate of water in the liquid and in the solid state and i have 535 shown by a variety of evidence that without high land there can be no permanent snow and ice from these facts and principles the very important conclusion is reached that the alternate phases of precessioncausing the winter of each hemisphere to be in aphelion and perihelion each 10500 yearswould produce a complete change of climate only where a country was partially snowclad while whenever a large area became almost wholly buried in snow and iceas was certainly the case with northern europe and america during the glacial epochthen the glacial conditions would be continued and perhaps even intensified when the sun approached nearest to the earth in winter instead of there being at that time as mr croll maintains an almost perpetual spring this important result is supported by reference to the existing differences between the climates of the northern and southern hemispheres and by what is known to have occurred during the last glacial epoch and it is shown to be in complete harmony with the geological evidence as to interglacial mild periods  discussing next the evidence for glacial epochs in earlier times it is shown that mr crolls views are opposed by a vast body of facts and that the geological evidence leads irresistibly to the conclusion that during a large portion of the secondary and tertiary periods uninterrupted warm climates prevailed in the north temperate zone and so far ameliorated the climate of the arctic regions as to admit of the growth of a luxuriant vegetation in the highest latitudes yet explored the geographical condition of the northern hemisphere at these periods is then investigated and it is shown to have been probably such as to admit the warm tropical waters freely to penetrate the land and to reach the arctic seas by several channels and adopting mr crolls calculations as to the enormous quantity of heat that would thus be conveyed northwards it is maintained that the mild arctic climates are amply accounted for with such favourable geographical conditions it is shown that changes of excentricity and of the phases of precession would have no other effect than to cause greater differences 536 of temperature between summer and winter but wherever there was a considerable extent of very lofty mountains the snowline would be lowered and the snowcollecting area being thus largely increased a considerable amount of local glaciation might result thus may be explained the presence of enormous iceborne rocks in eocene and miocene times in central europe while at the very same period all the surrounding country enjoyed a tropical or subtropical climate  the general conclusion is thus reached that geographical conditions are the essential causes of great changes of climate and that the radically different distribution of land and sea in the northern and southern hemispheres has generally led to great diversity of climate in the arctic and antarctic regions the form and arrangement of the continents is shown to be such as to favour the transfer of warm oceanic currents to the north far in excess of those which move towards the south and whenever these currents had free passage through the northern landmasses to the polar area a mild climate must have prevailed over the whole northern hemisphere it is only in very recent times that the great northern continents have become so completely consolidated as they now are thus shutting out the warm water from their interiors and rendering possible a widespread and intense glacial epoch but this great climatal change was actually brought about by the high excentricity which occurred about 200000 years ago and it is doubtful if a similar glaciation in equally low latitudes could be produced by means of any such geographical combinations as actually occur without the concurrence of a high excentricity  a survey of the present condition of the earth supports this view for though we have enormous mountain ranges in every latitude there is no glaciated country south of greenland in n lat 61° but directly we go back a very short period we find the superficial evidences of glaciation to an enormous extent over threefourths of the globe in the alps and pyrenees in the british isles and scandinavia in spain and the atlas in the caucasus 537 and the himalayas in eastern north america and west of the rocky mountains in the andes of south temperate america in south africa and in new zealand huge moraines and other unmistakable icemarks attest the universal descent of the snowline for several thousand feet below its present level if we reject the influence of high excentricity as the cause of this almost universal glaciation we must postulate a general elevation of all these mountains about the same time geologically speakingfor the general similarity in the state of preservation of the icemarks and the known activity of denudation as a destroying agent forbid the idea that they belong to widely separated epochs it has indeed been suggested that denudation alone has lowered these mountains so much during the posttertiary epoch that they were previously of sufficient height to account for the glaciation of all of them but this hardly needs refutation for it is clear that denudation could not at the same time have removed some thousands of feet of rock from many hundreds of square miles of lofty snowcollecting plateaus and yet have left moraines and blocks and even glacial striæ undisturbed and uneffaced on the slopes and in the valleys of these same mountains  the theory of geological climates set forth in this volume while founded on mr crolls researches differs from all that have yet been made public in clearly tracing out the comparative influence of geographical and astronomical revolutions showing that while the former have been the chief if not the exclusive causes of the longcontinued mild climates of the arctic regions the concurrence of the latter has been essential to the production of glacial epochs in the temperate zones as well as of those local glaciations in low latitudes of which there is such an abundance of evidence  the next question discussed is that of geological time as bearing on the development of the organic world the periods of time usually demanded by geologists have been very great and it was often assumed that there was no occasion to limit them but the theory of development demands far more for the earliest fossiliferous rocks 538 prove the existence of many and varied forms of life which require unrecorded ages for their developmentages probably far longer than those which have elapsed from that period to the present day the physicists however deny that any such indefinitely long periods are available the sun is ever losing heat far more rapidly than it can be renewed from any known or conceivable source the earth is a cooling body and must once have been too hot to support life while the friction of the tides is checking the earths rotation and this cannot have gone on indefinitely without making our day much longer than it is a limit is therefore placed to the age of the habitable earth and it has been thought that the time so allowed is not sufficient for the long processes of geological change and organic development it is therefore important to inquire whether these processes are either of them so excessively slow as has been supposed and i devote a chapter to the inquiry  geologists have measured with some accuracy the maximum thickness of all the known sedimentary rocks the rate of denudation has also been recently measured by a method which if not precise at all events gives results of the right order of magnitude and which err on the side of being too slow rather than too fast if then the maximum thickness of the known sedimentary rocks is taken to represent the average thickness of all the sedimentary rocks and we also know the amount of sediment carried to the sea or lakes and the area over which that sediment is spread we have a means of calculating the time required for the building up of all the sedimentary rocks of the geological system i have here inquired how far the above suppositions are correct or on which side they probably err and the conclusion arrived at is that the time required is very much less than has hitherto been supposed  another estimate is afforded by the date of the last glacial epoch if coincident with the last period of high excentricity while the alpine glaciation of the miocene period is assumed to have been caused by the next earlier phase of very high excentricity taking these as data the 539 proportionate change of the species of mollusca affords a means of arriving at the whole lapse of time represented by the fossiliferous rocks and these two estimates agree in the order of their magnitudes  it is then argued that the changes of climate every 10500 years during the numerous periods of high excentricity have acted as a motive power in hastening on both geological and biological change by raising and lowering the snowline in all mountain ranges it has caused increased denudation while the same changes have caused much migration and disturbance in the organic world and have thus tended to the more rapid modification of species the present epoch being a period of very low excentricity the earth is in a phase of exceptional stability both physical and organic and it is from this period of exceptional stability that our notions of the very slow rate of change have been derived  the conclusion is on the whole that the periods allowed by physicists are not only far in excess of such as are required for geological and organic change but that they allow ample margin for a lapse of time anterior to the deposit of the earliest fossiliferous rocks several times longer than the time which has elapsed since their deposit to the present day  having thus laid the foundation for a scientific interpretation of the phenomena of distribution we proceed to the second part of our workthe discussion of a series of typical insular faunas and floras with a view to explain the interesting phenomena they present taking first two north atlantic groupsthe azores and bermudait is shown how important an agent in the dispersal of most animals and plants is a stormy atmosphere although 900 and 700 miles respectively from the nearest continents their productions are very largely identical with those of europe and america and what is more important fresh arrivals of birds insects and plants are now taking place almost annually these islands afford therefore test examples of the great dispersive powers of certain groups of organisms and thus serve as a basis on which to found our explanations of many anomalies of distribution passing 540 on to the galapagos we have a group less distant from a continent and of larger area yet owing to special conditions of which the comparatively stormless equatorial atmosphere is the most important exhibiting far more speciality in its productions than the more distant azores still however its fauna and flora are as unmistakably derived from the american continent as those of the azores are from the european  we next take st helena and the sandwich islands both wonderfully isolated in the midst of vast oceans and no longer exhibiting in their productions an exclusive affinity to one continent here we have to recognise the results of immense antiquity and of those changes of geography of climate and in the general distribution of organisms which we know have occurred in former geological epochs and whose causes and consequences we have discussed in the first part of our volume this concludes our review of the oceanic islands  coming now to continental islands we consider first those of most recent origin and offering the simplest phenomena and begin with the british isles as affording the best example of very recent and well known continental islands reviewing the interesting past history of britain we show why it is comparatively poor in species and why this poverty is still greater in ireland by a careful examination of its fauna and flora it is then shown that the british isles are not so completely identical biologically with the continent as has been supposed a considerable amount of speciality is shown to exist and that this speciality is real and not apparent is supported by the fact that small outlying islands such as the isle of man the shetland isles lundy island and the isle of wight all possess certain species or varieties not found elsewhere  borneo and java are next taken as illustrations of tropical islands which may be not more ancient than britain but which owing to their much larger area greater distance from the continent and the extreme richness of the equatorial fauna and flora possess a large proportion of peculiar species though these are in general very closely allied to those of the adjacent parts of asia the 541 preliminary studies we have made enable us to afford a simpler and more definite interpretation of the peculiar relations of java to the continent and its differences from borneo and sumatra than was given in my former work the geographical distribution of animals  japan and formosa are next taken as examples of islands which are decidedly somewhat more ancient than those previously considered and which present a number of very interesting phenomena especially in their relations to each other and to remote rather than to adjacent parts of the asiatic continent  we now pass to the group of ancient continental islands of which madagascar is the most typical example it is surrounded by a number of smaller islands which may be termed its satellites since they partake of many of its peculiarities though some of theseas the comoros and seychellesmay be considered continental while othersas bourbon mauritius and rodriguezare decidedly oceanic in order to understand the peculiarities of the madagascar fauna we have to consider the past history of the african and asiatic continents which it is shown are such as to account for all the main peculiarities of the fauna of these islands without having recourse to the hypothesis of a nowsubmerged lemurian continent considerable evidence is further adduced to show that lemuria is a myth since not only is its existence unnecessary but it can be proved that it would not explain the actual facts of distribution the origin of the interesting mascarene wingless birds is discussed and the main peculiarities of the remarkable flora of madagascar and the mascarene islands pointed out while it is shown that all these phenomena are to be explained on the general principles of the permanence of the great oceans and the comparatively slight fluctuations of the land area and by taking account of established palæontological facts  there remain two other islandscelebes and new zealandwhich are classed as anomalous the one because it is almost impossible to place it in any of the six zoological regions or determine whether it has ever been actually joined to a continentthe other because it 542 combines the characteristics of continental and oceanic islands  the peculiarities of the celebesian fauna have already been dwelt upon in several previous works but they are so remarkable and so unique that they cannot be omitted in a treatise on insular faunas and here as in the case of borneo and java fuller consideration and the application of the general principles laid down in our first part lead to a solution of the problem at once more simple and more satisfactory than any which have been previously proposed i now look upon celebes as an outlying portion of the great asiatic continent of miocene times which either by submergence or some other cause had lost the greater portion of its animal inhabitants and since then has remained more or less completely isolated from every other land it has thus preserved a fragment of a very ancient fauna along with a number of later types which have reached it from surrounding islands by the ordinary means of dispersal this sufficiently explains all the peculiar affinities of its animals though the peculiar and distinctive characters of some of them remain as mysterious as ever  new zealand is shown to be so completely continental in its geological structure and its numerous wingless birds so clearly imply a former connection with some other land as do its numerous lizards and its remarkable reptile the hatteria that the total absence of indigenous landmammalia was hardly to be expected some attention is therefore given to the curious animal which has been seen but never captured and this is shown to be probably identical with an animal referred to by captain cook the more accurate knowledge which has recently been obtained of the sea bottom around new zealand enables us to determine that the former connection of that island with australia was towards the north and this is found to agree well with many of the peculiarities of its fauna  the flora of new zealand and that of australia are now both so well known and they present so many peculiarities and relations of so anomalous a character 543 as to present in sir joseph hookers opinion an almost insoluble problem much additional information on the physical and geological history of these two countries has however been obtained since the appearance of sir joseph hookers works and i therefore determined to apply to them the same method of discussion and treatment which has been usually successful with similar problems in the case of animals the fact above noted that new zealand was connected with australia in its northern and tropical portion only of itself affords a clue to one portion of the specialities of the new zealand florathe presence of an unusual number of tropical families and genera while the temperate forms consist mainly of species either identical with those found in australia or closely allied to them but a still more important clue is obtained in the geological structure of australia itself which is shown to have been for long periods divided into an eastern and a western island in the latter of which the highly peculiar flora of temperate australia was developed this is found to explain with great exactness the remarkable absence from new zealand of all the most abundant and characteristic australian genera both of plants and of animals since these existed at that time only in the western island while new zealand was in connection with the eastern island alone and with the tropical portion of it from these geological and physical facts and the known powers of dispersal of plants all the main features and many of the detailed peculiarities of the new zealand flora are shown necessarily to result  our last chapter is devoted to a wider and if possible more interesting subjectthe origin of the european element in the floras of new zealand and australia and also in those of south america and south africa this is so especially a botanical question that it was with some diffidence i entered upon it yet it arose so naturally from the study of the new zealand and australian floras and seemed to have so much light thrown upon it by our preliminary studies as to changes of climate and the causes which have favoured the distribution of plants that i felt my work would be incomplete without a consideration of 544 it the subject will be so fresh in the readers mind that a complete summary of it is unnecessary i venture to think however that i have shown not only the several routes by which the northern plants have reached the various southern lands but have pointed out the special aids to their migration and the motive power which has urged them on  in this discussion if nowhere else will be found a complete justification of that lengthy investigation of the exact nature of past changes of climate which to some readers may have seemed unnecessary and unsuited to such a work as the present without the clear and definite conclusions arrived at by that discussion and those equally important views as to the permanence of the great features of the earths surface and the wonderful dispersive powers of plants which have been so frequently brought before us in our studies of insular floras i should not have ventured to attack the wide and difficult problem of the northern element in southern floras    in concluding a work dealing with subjects which have occupied my attention for many years i trust that the reader who has followed me throughout will be imbued with the conviction that ever presses upon myself of the complete interdependence of organic and inorganic nature not only does the marvellous structure of each organised being involve the whole past history of the earth but such apparently unimportant facts as the presence of certain types of plants or animals in one island rather than in another are now shown to be dependent on the long series of past geological changeson those marvellous astronomical revolutions which cause a periodic variation of terrestrial climateson the apparently fortuitous action of storms and currents in the conveyance of germsand on the endlessly varied actions and reactions of organised beings on each other and although these various causes are far too complex in their combined action to enable us to follow them out in the case of any one species yet their broad results are clearly recognisable and we are thus encouraged to study more completely every detail and 545 every anomaly in the distribution of living things in the firm conviction that by so doing we shall obtain a fuller and clearer insight into the course of nature and with increased confidence that the mighty maze of being we see everywhere around us is not without a plan  549          index            a   acacia wide range of in australia 185   acacia heterophylla and acacia koa 443   acæna in california 527   accipiter hawaii 314   achatinellinæ

comparatively scanty and unimportant results to natural history of most of the great scientific voyages of the various civilized governments during the present century all these expeditions combined have done far less than private collectors in making known the products of remote lands and islands they have brought home fragmentary collections made in widely scattered localities and these have been usually described in huge folios or quartos whose value is often in inverse proportion to their bulk and cost the same species have been collected again and again often described several times over under new names and not unfrequently stated to be from places they never inhabited the result of this wretched system is that the productions of some of the most frequently visited and most interesting islands on the globe are still very imperfectly known while their native plants and animals are being yearly exterminated and this is the case even with countries under the rule or protection of european governments such are the sandwich islands tahiti the marquesas the philippine islands and a host of smaller ones while bourbon and mauritius st helena and several others have only been adequately explored after an important portion of their productions has been destroyed by cultivation or the reckless introduction of goats and pigs the employment in each of our possessions and those of other european powers of a resident naturalist at a very small annual expense would have done more for the advancement of knowledge in this direction than all the expensive expeditions that have again and again circumnavigated the globe  3 the general facts of palæontology as bearing on the migrations of animal groups are summarised in my geographical distribution of animals vol i

however improbable that it may be as great as in europe my friend a c swinton esq while working in the then almost unknown goldfield of maryborough victoria in january 1855 found a fragment of a wellformed stone axe resting on the metamorphic schistose bedrock about five feet beneath the surface it was overlain by the compact gravel drift called by the miners cement and by an included layer of hard ironstained sandstone the fragment is about an inch and threeeighths wide and the same length and is of very hard finegrained black basalt one side is ground to a very smooth and regular surface terminating in a wellformed cutting edge more than an inch long the return face of the cutting part being about a quarter of an inch wide the other side is a broken surface the weapon appears to have been an axe or tomahawk closely resembling that figured at p 335 of lumholtzs among cannibals from central queensland the fragment was discovered by mr swinton and the late mr mackworth shore one of the discoverers of the goldfield before any rush to it had taken place and it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that it was formed prior to the deposit of the gravel drift and ironstained sandstone under which it lay this would indicate a great antiquity of man in australia and would enable us to account for the fossilised remains of the dingo in pleistocene deposits as those of an animal introduced by man  9 these facts are taken from a memoir on the mammals and winter birds of florida by j a allen forming vol ii no 3 of the bulletin of the museum of comparative zoology at harvard college cambridge massachusetts  10 the great variation in wild animals is more fully discussed and illustrated in the authors darwinism chapter iii  11 see ibis 1879 p 32  12 in mr

1890 mr seebohm classes the japanese and european forms as e schoeniclus and thinks that their range is probably continuous across the two continents  14 lyells principles of geology ii p 369  15 mr darwin found that the large helix pomatia lived after immersion in seawater for twenty days it is hardly likely that this is the extreme limit of their powers of endurance but even this would allow of their being floated many hundred miles at a stretch and if we suppose the shell to be partially protected in the crevice of a log of wood and to be thus out of water in calm weather the distance might extend to a thousand miles or more the eggs of freshwater mollusca as well as the young animals are known to attach themselves to the feet of aquatic birds and this is probably the most efficient cause of their very wide diffusion  16 principles of geology 11th ed vol i p 258  17 on limestone as an index of geological time  18 in his preliminary report on oceanic deposit mr murray saysit has been found that the deposits taking place near continents and islands have received their chief characteristics from the presence of the debris of adjacent lands in some cases these deposits extend to a distance of over 150 miles from the coast proceedings of the royal society vol xxiv p 519  the materials in suspension appear to be almost entirely deposited within 200 miles of the land proceedings of the royal society of edinburgh 187677 p 253  19 geographical evolution proceedings of the royal geographical society 1879 p 426  20 professor dana was i believe the first to point out that the regions which after long undergoing subsidence and accumulating vast piles of sedimentary deposit have been elevated into mountain ranges thereby become stiff and unyielding and that the next depression and subsequent upheaval will be situated on one or the other sides of it and he has shown that in north america this is the case with all the mountains of the successive geological formations thus depressions and elevations of extreme slowness but often of vast amount have occurred successively in restricted adjacent areas and the effect has been to bring each portion in succession beneath the ocean but always bordered on one or both sides by the remainder of the continent from the denudation of which the deposits are formed which on the subsequent upheaval become

pacific but with these exceptions the globigerinæ are really found all over the bottom of the ocean murray on oceanic depositsproceedings of royal society vol xxiv p 523  the above analysis shows a far closer resemblance to chalk than that of the globigerinaooze of the atlantic four specimens of which given by sir w thomson voyage of the challenger vol ii appendix pp 374376 nos 9 10 11 and 12

supposed to be the product of volcanic dust or ashes carried either in the air or by ocean currents this volcanic matter amounts to from 460 to 833 per cent of the globigerinaooze of the midatlantic where it seems to be always present and the small proportion of similar matter in true chalk is another proof that its origin is different and that it was deposited far more rapidly than the oceanic

28 in his lecture on geographical evolution which was published after the greater part of this chapter had been written sir archibald geikie expresses views in complete accordance with those here advocated he saysthe next long era the cretaceous was more remarkable for slow accumulation of rock under the sea than for the formation of new land during that time the atlantic sent its waters across the whole of europe and into asia but they were probably nowhere more than a few hundred feet deep over the site of our continent even at their deepest part upon their bottom there gathered a vast mass of calcareous mud composed in great part of foraminifera corals echinoderms and molluscs our english chalk which ranges across the north of france belgium denmark and the north of germany represents a portion of the deposits of that seafloor the weighty authority of the directorgeneral of the geological survey may perhaps cause some geologists to modify their views as to the deepsea origin of chalk who would have treated any arguments advanced by myself as not worthy of consideration  29 introduction and succession of vertebrate life in america by professor o c marsh reprinted

soundings of hms challenger a mountainrange comparable in its extent elevation and volcanic character with the andes of south america geological mag 1874 p 71 on examining the diagram of the atlantic ocean in the challenger reports no 7 a considerable part of this ridge is found to be more than 1900 fathoms deep while the portion called the connecting ridge seems to be due in part to the deposits carried out by the river amazon in the neighbourhood of the azores st pauls rocks ascension and tristan dacunha are considerable areas varying from 1200 to 1500 fathoms deep while the rest of the ridge is usually 1800 or 1900 fathoms the shallower water is no doubt due to volcanic upheaval and the accumulation of volcanic ejections and there may be many other deeply submerged old volcanoes on the ridge but that it ever formed a chain of mountains comparable in elevation with the andes there seems not a particle of evidence to prove it is however probable that this ridge indicates the former existence of some considerable atlantic islands which may serve to explain the presence of a few identical genera and even species of plants and insects in africa and south america while the main body of the fauna and flora of these two continents remains radically distinct  in my darwinism pp 3445 i have given an additional argument founded on the comparative height and area of land with the depth and area of ocean which seems to me to add considerably to the weight of the evidence here submitted for the permanence of oceanic and continental areas  32 in a review of mr t mellard reades chemical denudation and geological time in nature oct 2nd 1879 the writer remarks as followsone of the funny notions of some scientific thinkers meets with no favour from mr reade whose geological knowledge is practical as well as theoretical they consider that because the older rocks contain nothing like the present red clays c of the ocean floor that the oceans have always been in their present positions mr reade points out that the first proposition is not yet proved and the distribution of animals and plants and the fact that the bulk of the strata on land are of marine origin are opposed to the hypothesis we must leave it to our readers to decide whether the notion developed in this chapter is funny or whether such hasty and superficial arguments as those here quoted from a practical geologist have any value as against the different classes of facts all pointing to an opposite conclusion which have now been briefly laid before them supported as they are by the expressed opinion of so weighty an authority as sir archibald geikie who in the lecture already quoted saysfrom all this evidence we may legitimately conclude that the present land of the globe though formed in great measure of marine formations has never lain under the deep sea but that its site must always have been near land even its thick marine limestones are the deposits of comparatively shallow water  33 antiquity of man 4th ed pp 340348  34 the great ice age and its relation to the antiquity of man by james geikie frs isbister and co 1874  35 this view of the formation of till is that adopted by dr geikie and upheld by almost all the scotch swiss and scandinavian geologists the objection however is made by many eminent english geologists including the late mr searles v wood jun that mud ground off the rocks cannot remain beneath the ice forming sheets of great thickness because the glacier cannot at the same time grind down solid rock and yet pass over the surface of soft mud and loose stones but this difficulty will disappear if we consider the numerous fluctuations in the glacier with increasing size and the additions it must have been constantly receiving as the ice from one valley after another joined together and at last produced an icesheet covering the whole country the grinding power is the motion and pressure of the ice and the pressure will depend on its thickness now the points of maximum thickness must have often changed their positions and the result would be that the matter ground out in one place would be forced into another place where the pressure was less if there were no lateral escape for the mud it would necessarily support the ice over it just as a waterbed supports the person lying on it and when there was little drainage water and the ice extended say twenty miles in every direction from a given part of a valley where the ice was of less than the average thickness the mud would necessarily accumulate at this part simply because there was no escape for it whenever the pressure all round any area was greater than the pressure on that area the débris of the surrounding parts would be forced into it and would even raise up the ice to give it room this is a necessary result of hydrostatic pressure during this process the superfluous water would no doubt escape through fissures or pores of the ice and would leave the mud and stones in that excessively compressed and tenacious condition in which the till is found the unequal thickness and pressure of the ice above referred to would be a necessary consequence of the inequalities in the valleys now narrowing into gorges now opening out into wide plains and again narrowed lower down and it is just in these openings in the valleys that the till is said to be found and also in the lowlands where an icesheet must have extended for many miles in every direction in these lowland valleys the till is both thickest and most widespread and this is what we might expect at first when the glaciers from the mountains pushed out into these valleys they would grind out the surface beneath them into hollows and the drainagewater would carry away the débris but when they spread all over the surface from sea to sea and there was little or no drainage water compared to the enormous area covered with ice the great bulk of the débris must have gathered under the ice wherever the pressure was least and the ice would necessarily rise as it accumulated some of the mud would no doubt be forced out along lines of least resistance to the sea but the friction of the stonecharged till would be so enormous that it would be impossible for any large part of it to be disposed of in this way  36 that the icesheet was continuous from scotland to ireland is proved by the glacial phenomena in the isle of man where till similar to that in scotland abounds and rocks are found in it which must have come from cumberland and scotland as well as from the north of ireland this would show that glaciers from each of these districts reached the isle of man where they met and flowed southwards down the irish sea icemarks are traced over the tops of the mountains which are

1878 p 77  44 this subject is admirably discussed in professor asa grays lecture on forest geography and archæology in the american journal of science and arts vol xvi 1878  45 in a letter to nature of october 30th 1879 the rev o fisher calls attention to a result arrived at by pouillet that the temperature which the surface of the ground would assume if the sun were extinguished would be 128° f instead of 239° f if this corrected amount were used in our calculations the january temperature of england during the glacial epoch would come out 17° f and this mr fisher thinks not low enough to cause any extreme difference from the present climate in this opinion however i cannot agree with him on the contrary it would i think be a relief to the theory were the amounts of decrease of temperature in winter and increase in summer rendered more moderate since according to the usual calculation which i have adopted the differences are unnecessarily great i cannot therefore think that this modification of the temperatures should it be ultimately proved to be correct which is altogether denied by dr croll would be any serious objection to the adoption of dr crolls theory of the astronomical and physical causes of the glacial epoch  the reason of the theoretical increase of summer heat being greater than the decrease of winter cold is because we are now nearest the sun in winter and farthest in summer whereas we calculate the temperatures of the glacial epoch for the phase of precession when the aphelion was in winter a large part of the increase of temperature would no doubt be used up in melting ice and evaporating water so that there would be a much less increase of sensible heat while only a portion of the theoretical lowering of temperature in winter would be actually produced owing to equalising effect of winds and currents and the storing up of heat by the earth and ocean  46 dr croll says this is one of the most widespread and fundamental errors within the whole range of geological climatology the temperature of the snow itself is he says one of the main factors climate and cosmology p 85 but surely the temperature of the snow must depend on the temperature of the air through which it falls  47 in an account of prof nordenskjölds recent expedition round the northern coast of asia given in nature november 20th 1879 we have the following passage fully supporting the statement in the text along the whole coast from the white sea to behrings straits no glacier was seen during autumn the siberian coast is nearly free of ice and snow there are no mountains covered all the year round with snow although some of them rise to a height of more than 2000 feet it must be remembered that the north coast of eastern siberia is in the area of supposed greatest winter cold on the globe  48 dr croll objects to this argument on the ground that greenland and the antarctic continent are probably lowlands or groups of islands climate and cosmology chap v  49 on the glacial epoch by james croll geol mag july august 1874  50 the general absence of recent marks of glacial action in eastern europe is well known and the series of changes which have been so well traced and described by prof szabó as occurring in those districts seems to leave no room for those periodical extensions of icecaps with which some authors in this country have amused themselves and their readers mr campbell whose ability to recognise the physical evidence of glaciers will scarcely be questioned finds quite the same absence of the proof of extensive iceaction in north america westward of the meridian of chicago prof j w judd in geol mag 1876 p 535  the same author notes the diminution of marks of iceaction on going eastward in the alps and the altai mountains far in central asia show no signs of having been largely glaciated west of the rocky mountains however in the sierra nevada and the coast ranges further north signs of extensive old glaciers again appear all which phenomena are strikingly in accordance with the theory here advocated of the absolute dependence of glaciation on abundant rainfall and elevated snowcondensers and accumulators  51 i have somewhat modified this whole passage in the endeavour to represent more accurately the difference between the views of dr croll and sir charles lyell  52 for numerous details and illustrations see the paperon ocean currents in relation to the physical theory of secular changes of climatein the philosophical magazine 1870  53 see darwins naturalists voyage round the world 2nd edition pp 244251  54 the influence of geographical changes on climate is now held by many geologists who oppose what they consider the extravagant hypotheses of dr croll thus prof dana imputes the glacial epoch chiefly if not wholly to elevation of the land caused by the lateral pressure due to shrinking of the earths crust that has caused all other elevations and depressions he says now that elevation of the land over the higher latitudes which brought on the glacial era is a natural result of the same agency and a natural and almost necessary counterpart of the coralisland subsidence which must have been then in progress the accumulating folding solidification and crystallisation of rocks attending all the rockmaking and mountainmaking through the palæozoic mesozoic and cenozoic eras had greatly stiffened the crust in these parts and hence in after times the continental movements resulting from the lateral pressure necessarily appeared over the more northern portions of the continent where the accumulations and other changes had been relatively small to the subsidence which followed the elevation the weight of the icecap may have contributed in some small degree but the great balancing movements of the crust of the continental and oceanic areas then going forward must have had a greatly preponderating effect in the oscillating agency of all timelateral pressure within the crust american journal of science and arts 3rd series vol ix p 318  in the 2nd edition of his manual of geology professor dana suggests elevation of arctic lands sufficient to exclude the gulf stream as a source of cold during glacial epochs this he thinks would have made an epoch of cold at any era of the globe a deep submergence of behrings strait letting in the pacific warm current to the polar area would have produced a mild arctic climate like that of the miocene period when the warm current was shut out from the polar area it would yet reach near to it and bring with it that abundant moisture necessary for glaciation manual of geology 2nd edition pp 541755 756  55 danas manual of geology 2nd edition p 540  56 dr croll says that i here assume an impossible state of things he maintains that the change from the distant sun in winter and near sun in summer to the near sun in winter and distant sun in summer aided by the change in the physical causes which this would necessarily bring about would certainly be sufficient to cause the snow and ice to disappear climate and cosmology p 106 but i demur to his necessarily it is not the direct effect of the nearer sun in winter that is supposed to melt the snow and ice but the physical causes such as absence of fogs and increase of warm equatorial currents but the near sun in winter acting on an iceclad surface would only increase the fogs and snow while the currents could only change if a large portion of the ice were first melted in which case they would no doubt be modified so as to cause a further melting of the ice dr croll says the warm and equable conditions of climate which would then prevail and the enormous quantity of intertropical water carried into the southern ocean would soon produce a melting of the ice loc cit p 111 this seems to me to be assuming the very point at issue he has himself shown that the presence of large quantities of ice prevents a warm and equable climate however great may be the sunheat the ice therefore would not be melted and there would be no increased flow of intertropical water to the southern ocean the ocean currents are mainly due to the difference of temperature of the polar and equatorial areas combined with the peculiar form and position of the continents and some one or more of these factors must be altered before the ocean currents towards the north pole can be increased the only factor available is the antarctic ice and if this were largely increased the northwardflowing currents might be so increased as to melt some of the arctic ice but the very same argument applies to both poles without some geographical change the antarctic ice could not materially diminish during its winter in perihelion nor increase to any important extent during the opposite phase we therefore seem to have no available agency by which to get rid of the ice over a glaciated hemisphere so long as the geographical conditions remained unchanged and the excentricity continued high  57 in the geological magazine april 1880 mr searles v wood adduces what he considers to be the conclusive objection to dr crolls excentricity theory which is that during the last glacial epoch europe and north america were glaciated very much in proportion to their respective climates now which are generally admitted to be due to the distribution of oceanic currents but dr croll admits his theory to be baseless unless there was a complete diversion of the warm ocean currents from the hemisphere glaciated in which case there ought to be no difference in the extent of glaciation in europe and north america whether or not this is a correct statement of dr crolls theory the above objection certainly does not apply to the views here advocated but as i also hold the excentricity theory in a modified form it may be as well to show why it does not apply in the first place i do not believe that the gulf stream was completely diverted during the glacial epoch but that it was diminished in force and as described at p 144 partly diverted southward a portion of its influence would however still remain to cause a difference between the climates of the two sides of the atlantic and to this must be added two other causesthe far greater penetration of warm seawater into the european than into the north american continent and the proximity to america of the enormous iceproducing mass of greenland we have thus three distinct causes all combining to produce a more severe winter climate on the west than on the east of the atlantic during the glacial epoch and though the first of thesethe gulf streamwas not nearly so powerful as it is now neither is the difference indicated by the iceextension in the two countries so great as the present difference of wintertemperature which is the essential point to be considered the icesheet of the united states is usually supposed to have extended about ten or at most twelve degrees further south than it did in western europe whereas we must go twenty degrees further south in the former country to obtain the same mean wintertemperature we find in the latter as may be seen by examining any map of winter isothermals this difference very fairly corresponds to the difference of conditions existing during the glacial epoch and the present time so far as we are able to estimate them and it certainly affords no grounds of objection to the theory by which the glaciation is here explained  58 dr croll objects to this argument and adduces the case of greenland as showing that ice may accumulate far from sea but the width of greenland is small compared with that of the supposed antarctic icecap climate and cosmology p 78  59 the recent extensive glaciation of new zealand is generally imputed by the local geologists to a greater elevation of the land but i cannot help believing that the high phase of excentricity which caused our own glacial epoch was at all events an assisting cause this is rendered more probable if taken in connection with the following very definite statement of glacial markings in south africa captain aylward in his transvaal of today p 171 saysit will be interesting to geologists and others to learn that the entire country from the summits of the quathlamba to the junction of the vaal and orange rivers shows marks of having been swept over and that at no very distant period by vast masses of ice from east to west the striations are plainly visible scarring the older rocks and marking the hillsidesgetting lower and lower and less visible as descending from the mountains the kopjies small hills stand wider apart but wherever the hills narrow towards each other again showing how the vast icefields were checked thrown up and raised against their eastern extremities  this passage is evidently written by a person familiar with the phenomena of glaciation and as captain aylwards preface is dated from edinburgh he has probably seen similar markings in scotland the country described consists of the most extensive and lofty plateau in south africa rising to a mountain knot with peaks more than 10000 feet high thus offering an appropriate area for the condensation of vapour and the accumulation of snow at present however the mountains do not reach the snowline and there is no proof that they have been much higher in recent times since the coast of natal is now said to be rising it is evident that no slight elevation would now lead to the accumulation of snow and ice in these mountains situated as they are between 27° and 30° s lat since the andes which in 32° s lat reach 23300 feet high and in 28° s lat 20000 with far more extensive plateaus produce no icefields we cannot therefore believe that a few thousand feet of additional elevation even if it occurred so recently as indicated by the presence of striations would have produced the remarkable amount of glaciation above described while from the analogy of the northern hemisphere we may well believe that it was mainly due to the same high excentricity that led to the glaciation of western and central europe and eastern north america  these observations confirm those of mr g w stow who in a paper published in the quarterly journal of the geological society vol xxvii p 539 describes similar phenomena in the same mountains and also mounds and ridges of unstratified clay packed with angular boulders while further south the stormberg mountains are said to be similarly glaciated with immense accumulations of morainic matter in all the valleys we have here most of the surface phenomena characteristic of a glaciated country only a few degrees south of the tropic and taken in connection with the indications of recent glaciation in new zealand and those discovered by dr r von lendenfeld in the australian alps between 6000 and 7000 feet elevation nature vol xxxii p 69 we can hardly doubt the occurrence of some general and widespread cause of glaciation in the southern hemisphere at a period so recent that the superficial phenomena are almost as well preserved as in europe other geologists however deny that there are any distinct indications of glacial action in south africa but the recent discovery by dr j w gregory fgs of the former extension of glaciers on mount kenya 5000 feet below their present limits renders probable the former glaciation of the south african highlands  60 the astronomical facts connected with the motions and appearance of the planet are taken from a paper by mr edward carpenter ma in the geological magazine of march 1877 entitled evidence afforded by mars on the subject of glacial periods but i arrive at somewhat different conclusions from those of the writer of the paper  61 in an article in nature of jan 1 1880 the rev t w webb states that in 1877 the pole of mars  the south pole was according to schiaparelli entirely free of snow he remarks also on the regular contour of the supposed snows of mars as offering a great contrast to ours and also the strongly marked dark border which has often been observed on the whole mr webb seems to be of opinion that there can be no really close resemblance between the physical condition of the earth and mars and that any arguments founded on such supposed similarity are therefore untrustworthy  62 london edinburgh and dublin philosophical magazine vol xxxvi pp 144150 1868  63 climate and time in their geological relations p 341  64 nature vol xxi p 345 the interior of greenland  65 prof j w judd says in the case of the alps i know of no glacial phenomena which are not capable of being explained like those of new zealand by a great extension of the area of the tracts above the snowline which would collect more ample supplies for the glaciers protruded into surrounding plains and when we survey the grand panoramas of ridges pinnacles and peaks produced for the most part by subaërial action we may well be prepared to admit that before the intervening ravines and valleys were excavated the glaciers shed from the elevated plateaux must have been of vastly greater magnitude than at present contributions to the study of volcanoes geological magazine 1876 p 536 professor judd applies these remarks to the last as well as to previous glacial periods in the alps but surely there has been no such extensive alteration and lowering of the surface of the country since the erratic blocks were deposited on the jura and the great moraines formed in north italy as this theory would imply we can hardly suppose wide areas to have been lowered thousands of feet by denudation and yet have left other adjacent areas apparently untouched and it is even very doubtful whether such an extension of the snowfields would alone suffice for the effects which were certainly produced  66 geological magazine 1876 p 392  67 colonel fielden thinks that these trees have all been brought down by rivers and have been stranded on shores which have been recently elevated see trans of norfolk nat hist soc vol iii 1880  68 geological magazine 1876 geology of spitzbergen p 267  69 the preceding account is mostly

has appealed to the imperfection of the geological record as a reply to these arguments in this case as it appears to me a very unsuccessful one  72 it is interesting to observe that the cretaceous flora of the united states that of the dakota group indicates a somewhat cooler climate than that of the following eocene period mr de rance in the geological appendix to capt sir g naress narrative of a voyage to the polar sea remarks as follows in the overlying american eocenes occur types of plants occurring in the european miocenes and still living proving the truth of professor lesquereuxs postulate that the plant types appear in america a stage in advance of their advent in europe these plants point to a far higher mean temperature than those of the dakota group to a dense atmosphere of vapour and a luxuriance of ferns and palms this is very important as adding further proof to the view that the climates of former periods are not due to any general refrigeration but to causes which were subject to change and alternation in former ages as now  73 mr s b j skertchley informs me that he has himself observed thick tertiary deposits consisting of clays and anhydrous gypsum at berenice on the borders of egypt and nubia at a height of about 600 feet above the sealevel but these may have been of freshwater origin  74 by referring to our map of the indian ocean showing the submarine banks indicating ancient islands chap xix it will be evident that the southeast tradewindsthen exceptionally powerfulwould cause a vast body of water to enter the deep arabian sea  75 in his recently published lectures on physical geography professor haughton calculates that more than half the solar heat of the torrid zone is carried to the temperate zones by ocean currents the gulf stream itself carries onetwelfth of the total amount but it is probable that a very small fraction of this quantity of heat reaches the polar seas owing to the wide area over which the current spreads in the north atlantic the corresponding stream of the indian ocean in miocene times would have been fully equal to the gulf stream in heating power while owing to its being so much more concentrated a large proportion of its heat may have reached the polar area but the arctic ocean occupies less than onetenth of the area of the tropical seas so that whatever proportion of the heat of the tropical zone was conveyed to it would by being concentrated into onetenth of the surface produce an enormously increased effect taking this into consideration we can hardly doubt that the opening of a sufficient passage from the indian ocean to the arctic seas would produce the effects above indicated  76 for an account of the resemblances and differences of the mammalia of the two continents during the tertiary epoch see my geographical distribution of animals vol i pp 140156  77 professor haughton has made an elaborate calculation of the difference between existing climates and those of miocene times for all the places where a miocene flora has been discovered by means of the actual range of corresponding species and genera of plants although this method is open to the objection that the ranges of plants and animals are not determined by temperature only yet the results may be approximately correct and are very interesting the following table which summarizes these results is taken from his lectures on physical geography p 344                                       present     miocene                                      latitudetemperaturetemperaturedifference       1

it is interesting to note that iceland which is now exposed to the full influence of the gulf stream was only 12°6 f warmer in miocene times while mackenzie river now totally removed from its influence was 28° warmer this as well as the greater increase of temperature as we go northward and the polar area becomes more limited is quite in accordance with the view of the causes which brought about the miocene climate which is here advocated  78 the objection has been made that the long polar night would of itself be fatal to the existence of such a luxuriant vegetation as we know to have existed as far as 80° n lat and that there must have been some alteration of the position of the pole or diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic to permit such plants as magnolias and largeleaved maples to flourish but there appears to be really no valid grounds for such an objection not only are numbers of alpine and arctic evergreens deeply buried in the snow for many months without injury but a variety of tropical and subtropical plants are preserved in the hothouses of st petersburg and other northern cities which are closely matted during winter and are thus exposed to as much darkness as the night of the arctic regions we have besides no proof that any of the arctic trees or large shrubs were evergreens and the darkness would certainly not be prejudical to deciduous plants with a suitable temperature there is nothing to prevent a luxuriant vegetation up to the pole and the long continued day is known to be highly favourable to the development of foliage which in the same species is larger and better developed in norway than in the south of england  79 geological magazine 1873 p 320  80 geological magazine 1877 p 137  81 manual of geology 2nd ed p 525 see also

usually been the practice to take the amount of denudation in the mississippi valley or one foot in six thousand years as a measure of the rate of denudation in europe from an idea apparently of being on the safe side and of not overestimating the rate of change but this appears to me a most unphilosophical mode of proceeding and unworthy of scientific inquiry what should we think of astronomers if they always took the lowest estimates of planetary or stellar distances instead of the mean results of observation in order to be on the safe side as if error in one direction were any worse than error in another yet this is what geologists do systematically whenever any calculations are made involving the antiquity of man it is those that give the lowest results that are always taken for no reason apparently except that there was for so long a time a prejudice both popular and scientific against the great antiquity of man and now that a means has been found of measuring the rate of denudation they take the slowest rate instead of the mean rate apparently only because there is now a scientific prejudice in favour of extremely slow geological change i take the mean of the whole and as this is almost exactly the same as the mean of the three great european riversthe rhone danube and poi cannot believe that this will not be nearer the truth for europe than taking one north american river as the standard  87 on the height of the land and the depth of the ocean in the scottish geographical magazine 1888  88 these figures are merely used to give an idea of the rate at which denudation is actually going on now but if no elevatory forces were at work the rate of denudation would certainly diminish as the mountains were lowered and the slope of the ground everywhere rendered flatter this would follow not only from the diminished power of rain and rivers but because the climate would become more uniform the rainfall probably less and no rocky peaks would be left to be fractured and broken up by the action of frosts it is certain however that no continent has ever remained long subject to the influences of denudation alone for as we have seen in our sixth chapter elevation and depression have always been going on in one part or other of the surface  89 the following statement of the depths at which the palæozoic formations have been reached in various localities in and round london was given by mr h b woodward in his address to the norwich geological society in 1879    deep wells through the tertiary and cretaceous formations    harwich

carboniferous at a depth of less than 400 feet  90 geological magazine vol viii march 1871  91 mr c lloyd morgan has well illustrated this point by comparing the generally tiltedup strata denuded on their edges to a library in which a fire had acted on the exposed edges of the books destroying a great mass of literature but leaving a portion of each book in its place which portion represents the thickness but not the size of the book geological magazine 1878 p 161  92 professor j young thinks it highly probable thatthe lower greensand is contemporaneous with part of the chalk so were parts of the wealden nay even of the purbeck a portion must have been forming while the cretaceous sea was gradually deepening southward and westward yet these deposits are always arranged successively and their several thicknesses added together to obtain the total thickness of the formations of the country see presidential address sect c british association 1876  93 mr john murray in his more careful estimate makes it about 51½ millions  94 as by far the larger portion of the denuded matter of the globe passes to the sea through comparatively few great rivers the deposits must often be confined to very limited areas thus the denudation of the vast mississippi basin must be almost all deposited in a limited portion of the gulf of mexico that of the nile within a small area of the eastern mediterranean and that of the great rivers of chinathe hoang ho and yangtsekiang in a small portion of the eastern sea enormous lengths of coast like those of western america and eastern africa receive very scanty deposits so that thirty miles in width along the whole of the coasts of the globe will probably give an area greater than that of the area of average deposit and certainly greater than that of maximum deposit which is the basis on which i have here made my estimates in the case of the mississippi it is stated by count pourtales that along the plateau between the mouth of the river and the southern extremity of florida for two hundred and fifty miles in width the bottom consists of clay with some sand and but few rhizopods but beyond this distance the soundings brought up either rhizopod shells alone or these mixed with coral sand nullipores and other calcareous organisms danas manual of geology 2nd ed p 671 it is probable therefore that a large proportion of the entire mass of sediment brought down by the mississippi is deposited on the limited area above indicated  professor dana further remarks over interior oceanic basins as well as off a coast in quiet depths fifteen or twenty fathoms and beyond the deposits are mostly of fine silt fitted for making fine argillaceous rocks as shales or slates when however the depth of the ocean falls off below a hundred fathoms the deposition of silt in our existing oceans mostly ceases unless in the case of a great bank along the border of a continent  95 from the same data professor haughton estimates a minimum of 200 million years for the duration of geological time but he arrives at this conclusion by supposing the products of denudation to be uniformly spread over the whole seabottom instead of over a narrow belt near the coasts a supposition entirely opposed to all the known facts and which had been shown by dr croll five years previously to be altogether erroneous see nature vol xviii p 268 where professor haughtons paper is given as read before the royal society  96 see geological magazine for 1877 p 1  97 in his reply to sir w thomson professor huxley assumed one foot in a thousand years as a not improbable rate of deposition the above estimate indicates a far higher rate and this follows from the wellascertained fact that the area of deposition is many times smaller than the area of denudation  98 dr croll and sir archibald geikie have shown that marine denudation is very small in amount as compared with subaërial since it acts only locally on the edge of the land whereas the latter acts over every foot of the surface mr w t blanford argues that the difference is still greater in tropical than in temperate latitudes and arrives at the conclusion thatif over british india the effects of marine to those of freshwater denudation in removing the rocks of the country be estimated at 1 to 100 i believe that the result of marine action will be greatly overstated geology and zoology of abyssinia p 158 note now as our estimate of the rate of subaërial denudation cannot pretend to any precise accuracy we are justified in neglecting marine denudation altogether especially as we have no method of estimating it for the whole earth with any approach to correctness  99 agassiz appears to have been the first to suggest that the principal epochs of life extermination were epochs of cold and dana thinks that two at least such epochs may be recognised at the close of the palæozoic and of the cretaceous periodsto which we may add the last glacial epoch  100 this view was i believe first put forth by myself in a paper read before the geological section of the british association in 1869 and subsequently in an article in nature vol i p 454 it was also stated by mr s b j skertchley in his physical system of the universe p 363 1878 but we both founded it on what i now consider the erroneous doctrine that actual glacial epochs recurred each 10500 years during periods of high excentricity  101 explication dune seconde édition de la carte géologique de la terre 1875 p 64  102 for most of the facts as to the zoology and botany of these islands i am indebted to mr godmans valuable worknatural history of the azores or western islands by frederick du cane godman fls fzs c london 1870  103 see chap v p 78  104 some of mr darwins experiments are very interesting and suggestive ripe hazelnuts sank immediately but when dried they floated for ninety days and afterwards germinated an asparagusplant with ripe berries when dried floated for eightyfive days and the seeds afterwards germinated out of ninetyfour dried plants experimented with eighteen floated for more than a month and some for three months and their powers of germination seem never to have been wholly destroyed now as oceanic currents vary from thirty to sixty miles a day such plants under the most favourable conditions might be carried 90 x 60  5400 miles but even half of this is ample to enable them to reach any oceanic island and we must remember that till completely waterlogged they might be driven along at a much greater rate by the wind mr darwin calculates the distance by the average time of flotation to be 924 miles but in such a case as this we are entitled to take the extreme cases because such countless thousands of plants and seeds must be carried out to sea annually that the extreme cases in a single experiment with only ninetyfour plants must happen hundreds or thousands of times and with hundreds or thousands of species naturally and thus afford ample opportunities for successful migration see origin of species 6th edition p 325  105 the following remarks kindly communicated to me by mr h n moseley naturalist to the challenger throw much light on the agency of birds in the distribution of plantsgrisebach veg der erde vol ii p 496 lays much stress on the wide ranging of the albatross diomedea across the equator from cape horn to the kurile islands and thinks that the presence of the same plants in arctic and antarctic regions may be accounted for possibly by this fact i was much struck at marion island of the prince edward group by observing that the great albatross breeds in the midst of a dense low herbage and constructs its nest of a mound of turf and herbage some of the indigenous plants eg acæna have flowerheads which stick like burrs to feathers c and seem specially adapted for transposition by birds besides the albatrosses various species of procellaria and puffinus birds which range over immense distances may i think have played a great part in the distribution of plants and especially account in some measure for the otherwise difficult fact when occurring in the tropics that widely distant islands have similar mountain plants the procellaria and puffinus in nesting burrow in the ground as far as i have seen choosing often places where the vegetation is the thickest the birds in burrowing get their feathers covered with vegetable mould which must include spores and often seeds in high latitudes the birds often burrow near the sealevel as at tristan dacunha or kerguelens land but in the tropics they choose the mountains for their nestingplace finsch and hartlaub orn der viti und tongainseln 1867 einleitung p xviii thus puffinus megasi nests at the top of the korobasa basaga mountain viti levu fifty miles from the sea a procellaria breeds in like manner in the high mountains of jamaica i believe at 7000 feet peale describes the same habit of procellaria rostrata at tahiti and i saw the burrows myself amidst a dense growth of fern c at 4400 feet elevation in that island phaethon has a similar habit it nests at the crater of kilauea hawaii at 4000 feet elevation and also high up in tahiti in order to account for the transportation of the plants it is not of course necessary that the same species of procellaria or diomedea should now range between the distant points where the plants occur the ancestor of the now differing species might have carried the seeds the range of the genus is sufficient  106 nature vol vi p 262 recent observations in the bermudas by mr j matthew jones  107 the late sir c wyville thomson was of opinion that the red earth which largely forms the soil of bermuda had an organic origin as well as the red clay which the challenger discovered in all the greater depths of the ocean basins he regarded the red earth and red clay as an ash left behind after the gradual removal of the lime by water charged with carbonic acid this ash he regarded as a constituent part of the shells of foraminifera skeletons of corals and molluscs vide voyage of the challenger atlantic vol i p 316 this theory does not seem to be in any way tenable analysis of carefully selected shells of foraminifera heteropods and pteropods did not show the slightest trace of alumina and none has as yet been discovered in coral skeletons it is most probable that a large part of the clayey matter found in red clay and the red earth of bermuda is derived from the disintegration of pumice which is continually found floating on the surface of the sea see murray on the distribution of volcanic débris over the floor of the ocean proc roy soc edin vol ix pp 247261 18761877 the naturalists of the challenger found it among the floating masses of gulf weed and it is frequently picked up on the reefs of bermuda and other coral islands the red earth contains a good many fragments of magnetite augite felspar and glassy fragments and when a large quantity of the rock of bermuda is dissolved away with acid a small number of fragments are also met with these mineral particles most probably came originally from the pumice which had been cast up on the island for long ages for it is known that these minerals are present in pumice although possibly some of them may have come from the volcanic rock which is believed to form the nucleus of the island

1878 increased the number of wild plants to thirtysix and these belonged to twentysix natural orders  115 juan fernandez is a good example of a small island which with time and favourable conditions has acquired a tolerably rich and highly peculiar flora and fauna it is situated in 34° s lat 400 miles from the coast of chile and so far as facilities for the transport of living organisms are concerned is by no means in a favourable position for the oceancurrents come from the southwest in a direction where there is no land but the antarctic continent and the prevalent winds are also westerly no doubt however there are occasional storms and there may have been intermediate islands but its chief advantages are its antiquity its varied surface and its favourable soil and climate offering many chances for the preservation and increase of whatever plants and animals have chanced to reach it the island consists of basalt greenstone and other ancient rocks and though only about twelve miles long its mountains are three thousand feet high enjoying a moist and temperate climate it is especially adapted to the growth of ferns which are very abundant and as the spores of these plants are as fine as dust and very easily carried for enormous distances by winds it is not surprising that there are nearly fifty species on the island while the remote period when it first received its vegetation may be indicated by the fact that nearly half the species are quite peculiar while of 102 species of flowering plants seventy are peculiar and there are ten peculiar genera the same general character pervades the fauna for so small an island it is rich containing four true landbirds about fifty species of insects and twenty of landshells almost all these belong to south american genera and a large proportion are south american species but several of the insects half the birds and the whole of the landshells are peculiar this seems to indicate that the means of transmission were formerly greater than they are now and that in the case of landshells none have been introduced for so long a period that all have become modified into distinct forms or have been preserved on the island while they have become extinct on the continent for a detailed examination of the causes which have led to the modification of the humming birds of juan fernandez see the chapter on humming

his interesting work entitled the earth as modified by human action p 51 thus remarks on the effect of browsing quadrupeds in destroying and checking woody vegetationi am convinced that forests would soon cover many parts of the arabian and african deserts if man and domestic animals especially the goat and the camel were banished from them the hard palate and tongue and strong teeth and jaws of this latter quadruped enable him to break off and masticate tough and thorny branches as large as the finger he is particularly fond of the smaller twigs leaves and seedpods of the sont and other acacias which like the american robinia thrive well on dry and sandy soils and he spares no tree the branches of which are within his reach except if i remember right the tamarisk that produces manna young trees sprout plentifully around the springs and along the winter watercourses of the desert and these are just the halting stations of the caravans and their routes of travel in the shade of these trees annual grasses and perennial shrubs shoot up but are mown down by the hungry cattle of the bedouin as fast as they grow a few years of undisturbed vegetation would suffice to cover such points with groves and these would gradually extend themselves over soils where now scarcely any green thing but the bitter colocynth and the poisonous foxglove is ever seen  121 coleoptera sanctæ helenæ 1877 testacea atlantica 1878  122 on petermanns map of africa in stielers handatlas 1879 the island of ascension is shown as seated on a much larger and shallower submarine bank than st helena the 1000 fathom line round ascension encloses an oval space 170 miles long by 70 wide and even the 300 fathom line one over 60 miles long and it is therefore probable that a much larger island once occupied this site now ascension is nearly equidistant between st helena and liberia and such an island might have served as an intermediate station through which many of the immigrants to st helena passed as the distances are hardly greater than in the case of the azores this removes whatever difficulty may have been felt of the possibility of any organisms reaching so remote an island the present island of ascension is probably only the summit of a huge volcanic mass and any remnant of the original fauna and flora it might have preserved may have been destroyed by great volcanic eruptions mr darwin collected some masses of tufa which were found to be mainly organic containing besides remains of freshwater infusoria the siliceous tissue of plants in the light of the great extent of the submarine bank on which the island stands mr darwins remark thatwe may feel sure that at some former epoch the climate and productions of ascension were very different from what they are

a special study of mosses and especially of hepaticæ are of interest from what precedes i conclude that no existing agency is capable of transporting the germs of our hepatics of tropical type from the torrid zone to britain and i venture to suppose that their existence at killarney dates from the remote period when the vegetation of the whole northern hemisphere partook of a tropical character if i am challenged to account for their survival through the last glacial period i reply that granting even the existence of a universal icecap down to the latitude of 40° in america and 50° in europe it is not to be assumed that the whole extent even of land was perennially entombed in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice towards the southern margin of the ice the climate was probably very similar to that of greenland and the northern part of norway at the present day the summer sun would have great power and on the borders of sheltered fjords the frozen snow would disappear completely if only for a very short period and i ask only for a month or two not doubting the capacity of our hepatics to survive in a dormant state under the snow for at least ten months in the year i have gathered mosses in the pyrenees where the snow had barely left them on august 2nd by september 25th they were recovered with snow and would not be again uncovered till the following year the mosses of killarney might even enjoy a longer summer than this for the gulfstream laves both sides of the southwestern angle of ireland and its tepid waters would exert great melting power on the icebound coast preventing at the same time any formation of ice in the sea itself this passage is the conclusion of a very interesting discussion on the distribution of hepaticæ in a paper on a new hepatic from killarney in the journal of botany vol 25 feb 1887 pp 3382 in which many curious facts are given as to the habits and distribution of these curious and beautiful little plants  139 while these pages are passing through the press i am informed by my friend mr w h beeby that in the shetland isles where he has been collecting for five summers he has found several plants new to the british flora and a few altogether undescribed among these latter is a very distinct species of hieracium h zetlandicum which is quite unknown in scandinavia and is almost certainly peculiar to the british islands here we have another proof that entirely new species are still to be discovered in the remoter portions of our country  140 in the first edition of this work the numbers were 400 and 340 showing the great

captain blakiston has shown that the northern islandyezois much more temperate and less peculiar in its zoology than the central and southern islands this is no doubt dependent chiefly on the

are said to have their nearest allies in australia see dobson in nature vol xxx p 575  151 this view was i believe first advanced by professor huxley in his anniversary address to the geological society in 1870 he saysin fact the miocene mammalian fauna of europe and the himalayan regions contain associated together the types which are at present separately located in the south african and indian provinces of arctogæa now there is every reason to believe on other grounds that both hindostan south of the ganges and africa south of the sahara were separated by a wide sea from europe and north asia during the middle and upper eocene epochs hence it becomes highly probable that the wellknown similarities and no less remarkable differences between the present faunæ of india and south africa have arisen in some such fashion as the following some time during the miocene epoch the bottom of the nummulitic sea was upheaved and converted into dry land in the direction of a line extending from abyssinia to the mouth of the ganges by this means the dekkan on the one hand and south africa on the other became connected with the miocene dry land and with one another the miocene mammals spread gradually over this intermediate dry land and if the condition of its eastern and western ends offered as wide contrasts as the valleys of the ganges and arabia do now many forms which made their way into africa must have been different from those which reached the dekkan while others might pass into both these subprovinces  this question is fully discussed in my geographical distribution of animals vol i p 285 where i expressed views somewhat different from those of professor huxley and made some slight errors which are corrected in the present work as i did not then refer to professor huxleys prior statement of the theory of miocene immigration into africa which i had read but the reference to which i could not recall i am happy to give his views here  152 the

supposed that india and south africa had been connected by a continent and remained so connected with some short intervals from the permian up to the end of the miocene period and mr woodward expressed his satisfaction with this further evidence derived from the fossil flora of the mesozoic series of india in corroboration of the former existence of an old submerged continentlemuria  those who have read the preceding chapters of the present work will not need to have pointed out to them how utterly inconclusive is the fragmentary evidence derived from such remote periods even if there were no evidence on the other side as indicating geographical changes the notion that a similarity in the productions of widely separated continents at any past epoch is only to be explained by the existence of a direct landconnection is entirely opposed to all that we know of the wide and varying distribution of all types at different periods as well as to the great powers of dispersal over moderate widths of ocean possessed by all animals except mammalia it is no less opposed to what is now known of the general permanency of the great continental and oceanic areas while in this particular case it is totally inconsistent as has been shown above with the actual facts of the distribution of animals  155 geographical distribution of animals vol i pp 272292  156 the term

are given as wild such as lemur mongoz and centetes setosus both madagascar species with such undoubtedly introduced animals as a wild cat a hare and several rats and mice he also gives two species of frogs seven lizards and two snakes the latter are both indian species and certainly imported as are most probably the frogs legouat who resided some years in the island nearly two centuries ago and who was a closer observer of nature mentions numerous birds large bats landtortoises and lizards but no other reptiles or venomous animals except scorpions we may be pretty sure therefore that the landmammalia snakes and frogs now found wild have all been introduced of lizards on the other hand there are several species some peculiar to the island others common to africa and the other mascarene

really an abortion from a more perfect type and not a direct development from some lower form of wingless bird is shown by its possessing a keeled sternum though the keel is exceedingly reduced being only threequarters of an inch deep in a length of seven inches the most terrestrial pigeonthe didunculus of the samoan islands has a far deeper and better developed keel showing that in the case of the dodo the degradation has been extreme we have also analogous examples in other extinct birds of the same group of islands such as the flightless railsaphanapteryx of mauritius and erythromachus of rodriguez as well as the large parrotlophopsittacus of mauritius and the night heron nycticorax megacephala of rodriguez the last two birds probably having been able to fly a little the commencement of the same process is to be seen in the peculiar dove of the seychelles turtur rostratus which as mr edward newton has shown has much shorter wings than its close ally t picturatus of madagascar for

the same creature he says a fourfooted animal was seen by three or four of our people but as no two gave the same description of it i cannot say what kind it is all however agreed that it was about the size of a cat with short legs and of a mouse colour one of the seamen and he who had the best view of it said it had a bushy tail and was the most like a jackal of any animal he knew it is suggestive that so far as the points on which all agreedthe size and the dark colourthis description would answer well to the animal so recently seen while the short legs correspond to the otterlike tracks and the thick tail of an otterlike animal may well have appeared bushy when the fur was dry it has been suggested that it was only one of the native dogs but as none of those who saw it took it for a dog and the points on which they all agreed are not doglike we can hardly accept this explanation while the actual existence of an unknown animal in new zealand of corresponding size and colour is confirmed by this account of a similar animal having been seen about a century ago  173 owen on the genus dinornis trans zool soc vol x p 184 mivart on the axial skeleton of the struthionidæ trans zool soc vol x p 51  174 the recent existence of the moa and its having been exterminated by the maoris appears to be at length set at rest by the statement of mr john white a gentleman who has been collecting materials for a history of the natives for thirtyfive years who has been initiated by their priests into all their mysteries and is said to know more about the history habits and customs of the maoris than they do themselves his information on this subject was obtained from old natives long before the controversy on the subject arose he says that the histories and songs of the maoris abound in allusions to the moa and that they were able to give full accounts of its habits food the season of the year it was killed its appearance strength and all the numerous ceremonies which were enacted by the natives before they began the hunt the mode of hunting how cut up how cooked and what wood was used in the cooking with an account of its nest and how the nest was made where it usually lived c two pages are occupied by these details but they are only given from memory and mr white promises a full account from his mss many of the details given correspond with facts ascertained from the discovery of native cooking places with moas bones and it seems quite incredible that such an elaborate and detailed account should be all invention see transactions of the new zealand institute

and the latter inhabits tasmania and was recorded from new zealand through an error see ibis 1873 p 427  178 the peculiar genera of australian lizards according to boulengers british museum catalogue are as followsfamily geckonidÆ nephrurus rhynchoedura heteronota diplodactylus oedura family pygopodidÆ peculiar pygopus cryptodelma delma pletholax aprasia family agamidÆ chelosania amphibolurus

the origin of the new zealand flora trans n z institute xiv 1881 being the latest that i can obtain they differ somewhat from those given in the first edition but not so as to affect the conclusions drawn from them  180 this accords with the general scarcity of leguminosæ in oceanic islands due probably to their usually dry and heavy seeds not adapted to any of the forms of aërial transmission and it would indicate either that new zealand was never absolutely united with australia or that the union was at a very remote period when leguminosæ were either not differentiated or comparatively rare  181 sir joseph hooker informs me that the number of tropical australian plants discovered within the last twenty years is very great and that the statement as above made may have to be modified looking however at the enormous disproportion of the figures given in the introductory essay in 1859 2200 tropical to 5800 temperate species it seems hardly possible that a great difference should not still exist at all events as regards species in baron von müellers latest summary of the australian flora second systematic census of australian plants 1889 he gives the total species at 8839 of which 3560 occur in west australia and 3251 in new south wales on counting the species common to these two colonies in fifty pages of the census taken at random i find them to be about onetenth of the total species in both this would give the number of distinct species in these areas as about 6130 adding to these the species peculiar to victoria and south australia we shall have a flora of near 6500 in the temperate parts of australia it is true that west australia extends far into the tropics but an overwhelming majority of the species have been discovered in the southwestern portion of the colony while the species that may be exclusively tropical will be more than balanced by those of temperate queensland which have not been taken account of as that colony is half temperate and half tropical it thus appears probable that full three fourths of the species of australian plants occur in the temperate regions and are mainly characteristic of it sir joseph hooker also doubts the generally greater richness of tropical over temperate floras which i have taken as almost an axiom he says taking similar areas to australia in the western world eg tropical africa north of 20° s lat as against temperate africa and europe up to 47°i suspect that the latter would present more genera and species than the former this however appears to me to be hardly a case in point because europe is a distinct continent from africa and has had a very different past history and it is not a fair comparison to take the tropical area in one continent while the temperate is made up of widely separated areas in two continents a closer parallel may perhaps be found in equal areas of brazil and south temperate america or of mexico and the southern united states in both of which cases i suppose there can be little doubt that the tropical areas are far the richest temperate south africa is no doubt always quoted as richer than an equal area of tropical africa or perhaps than any part of the world of equal extent but this is admitted to be an exceptional case  182 sir joseph hooker thinks that later discoveries in the australian alps and other parts of east and south australia may have greatly modified or perhaps reversed the above estimate and the figures given in the preceding note indicate that this is so but still the small area of southwest australia will be proportionally far the richer of the two it is much to be desired that the enormous mass of facts contained in mr benthams flora australiensis and baron von müellers census should be tabulated and compared by some competent botanist so as to exhibit the various relations of its wonderful vegetation in the same manner as was done by sir joseph hooker with the materials available twentyone years ago  183 from an examination of the fossil corals of the southwest of victoria professor p m duncan concludesthat at the time of the formation of these deposits the central area of australia was occupied by sea having open water to the north with reefs in the neighbourhood of java the age of these fossils is not known but as almost all are extinct species and some are almost identical with european pliocene and miocene species they are supposed to belong to a corresponding period journal of geol soc 1870  184 on the origin of the fauna and flora of new zealand by captain f w hutton in annals and mag of nat hist fifth series p 427 june 1884  185 to these must now be added the genera sequoia myrica aralia and acer described by baron von ettingshausen trans nz institute xix p 449  186 the large collection of fossil plants from the tertiary beds of new zealand which have been recently described by baron von ettingshausen trans n z inst vol xxiii pp 237310 prove that a change in the vegetation has occurred similar to that which has taken place in eastern australia and that the plants of the two countries once resembled each other more than they do now we have first a series of groups now living in australia but which have become extinct in new zealand as cassia dalbergia eucalyptus diospyros dryandra casuarina and ficus and also such northern genera as acer planera ulmus quercus alnus myrica and sequoia all these latter except ulmus and planera have been found also in the easternaustralian tertiaries and we may therefore consider that at this period the northern temperate element in both floras was identical if this flora entered both countries from the south and was really antarctic its extinction in new zealand may have been due to the submergence of the country to the south and its elevation and extension towards the tropics admitting of the incursion of the large number of polynesian and tropical australian types now found there while the australian portion of the same flora may have succumbed at a somewhat later period when the elevation of the cretaceous and tertiary sea united it with western australia and allowed the rich typical australian flora to overrun the country of course we are assuming that the identification of these genera is for the most part correct though almost entirely founded on leaves only fuller knowledge both of the extinct flora itself and of the geological age of the several deposits is requisite before any trustworthy explanation of the phenomena can be arrived at  187 the following are the tropical genera common to new zealand

introductory essay on the flora of australia p 130  190 hooker on the flora of australia p 95h c watson in godmans azores pp 278286  191 as this is a point of great interest in its bearing on the dispersal of plants by means of mountain ranges i have endeavoured to obtain a few illustrative facts  1 mr william mitten of hurstpierpoint sussex informs me that when the london and brighton railway was in progress in his neighbourhood melilotus vulgaris made its appearance on the banks remained for several years and then altogether disappeared another case is that of diplotaxis muralis which formerly occurred only near the seacoast of sussex and at lewes but since the railway was made has spread along it and still maintains itself abundantly on the railway banks though rarely found anywhere else  2 a correspondent in tasmania informs me that whenever the virgin forest is cleared in that island there invariably comes up a thick crop of a plant locally known as fireweeda species of senecio probably s australis it never grows except where the fire has gone over the ground and is unknown except in such places my correspondent addsthis autumn i went back about thirtyfive miles through a dense forest along a track marked by some prospectors the year before and in one spot where they had camped and the fire had burnt the fallen logs c there was a fine crop of fireweed all around for many miles was a forest of the largest trees and dense scrub here we have a case in which burnt soil and ashes favour the germination of a particular plant whose seeds are easily carried by the wind and it is not difficult to see how this peculiarity might favour the dispersal of the species for enormous distances by enabling it temporarily to grow and produce seeds on burnt spots  3 in answer to an inquiry on this subject mr h c watson has been kind enough to send me a detailed account of the progress of vegetation on the railway banks and cuttings about thames ditton this account is written from memory but as mr watson states that he took a great interest in watching the process year by year there can be no reason to doubt the accuracy of his memory i give a few extracts which bear especially on the subject we are discussing  one rather remarkable biennial plant appeared early the second year as i recollect and renewed itself either two or three years namely isatis tinctoriaa species usually supposed to be one of our introduced but pretty well naturalised plants the nearest stations then or since known to me for this isatis are on chalk about guildford twenty miles distant there were two or three plants of it at first never more than half a dozen once since i saw a plant of isatis on the railway bank near vauxhall  close by ditton station three species appeared which may be called interlopers the biennial barbarea precox one of these is the least remarkable because it might have come as seed in the earth from some garden or possibly in the thames gravel used as ballast at first it increased to several plants then became less numerous and will soon in all probability become extinct crowded out by other plants the biennial petroselinum segetum was at first one very luxuriant plant on the slope of the embankment it increased by seed into a dozen or a score and is now nearly if not quite extinct the third species is linaria purpurea not strictly a british plant but one established in some places on old walls a single root of it appeared on the chalk facing of the embankment by ditton station it has remained there several years and grown into a vigorous specimen two or three smaller examples are now seen by it doubtless sprung from some of the hundreds or thousands of seeds shed by the original one plant the species is not included in salmon and brewers flora of surrey  the main line of the railway has introduced into ditton parish the perennial arabis hirsuta likely to become a permanent inhabitant the species is found on the chalk and greensand miles away from thames ditton but neither in this parish nor in any adjacent parish so far as known to myself or to the authors of the flora of the county does it occur some years after the railway was made a single root of this arabis was observed in the brickwork of an arch by which the railway is carried over a public road a year or two afterwards there were three or four plants in some later year i laid some of the ripened seedpods between the bricks in places where the mortar had partly crumbled out now there are several scores of specimens in the brickwork of the arch it is presumable that the first seed may have been brought from guildford but how could it get on to the perpendicular face of the brickwork  the bee orchis ophrys apifera plentiful on some of the chalk lands in surrey is not a species of thames ditton or as i presume of any adjacent parish thus i was greatly surprised some years back to see about a hundred examples of it in flower in one clayey field either on the outskirts of thames ditton or just within the limits of the adjoining parish of cobham i had crossed this same field in a former year without observing the ophrys there and on finding it in the one field i closely searched the surrounding fields and copses without finding it anywhere else gradually the plants became fewer and fewer in that one field and some six or eight years after its first discovery there the species had quite disappeared again i guessed it had been introduced with chalk but could obtain no evidence to show this  4 mr a bennett of croydon has kindly furnished me with some information on the temporary vegetation of the banks and cuttings on the railway from yarmouth to caistor in norfolk where it passes over extensive sandy denes with a sparse vegetation the first year after the railway was made the banks produced abundance of oenothera odorata and delphinium ajacis the latter only known thirty miles off in cornfields in cambridgeshire with atriplex patula and a deltoidea gradually the native sand plantscarices grasses galium verum c established themselves and year by year covered more ground till the new introductions almost completely disappeared the same phenomenon was observed in cambridgeshire between chesterton and newmarket where the soil being different stellaria media and other annuals appeared in large patches but these soon gave way to a permanent vegetation of grasses composites c so that in the third year no stellaria was to be seen  5 mr t kirk writing in 1878 states thatin auckland where a dense sward of grass is soon formed single specimens of the european milk thistle carduus marianus have been known for the past fifteen years but although they seeded freely the seeds had no opportunity of germinating so that the thistle did not spread a remarkable exception to this rule occurred during the formation of the onehunga railway where a few seeds fell on disturbed soil grew up and flowered the railway works being suspended the plant increased rapidly and spread wherever it could find disturbed soil  againthe fiddledock rumex pulcher occurs in great abundance on the formation of new streets c but soon becomes comparatively rare it seems probable that it was one of the earliest plants naturalised here but that it partially died out its buried seeds retaining their vitality  medicago sativa and apium graveolens are also noted as escapes from cultivation which maintain themselves for a time but soon die out transactions of the new zealand institute vol x p 367  the preceding examples of the temporary establishment of plants on newly exposed soil often at considerable distances from the localities they usually inhabit might no doubt by further inquiry be greatly multiplied but unfortunately the phenomenon has received little attention and is not even referred to in the elaborate work of de candolle géographie botanique raisonnée in which almost every other aspect of the dispersion and distribution of plants is fully discussed enough has been advanced however to show that it is of constant occurrence and from the point of view here advocated it becomes of great importance in explaining the almost worldwide distribution of many common plants of the north temperate zone  192 sir joseph hooker informs me that he considers these identifications worthless and mr bentham has also written very strongly against the value of similar identifications by heer and unger giving due weight to the opinions of these eminent botanists we must admit that australian genera have not yet been demonstrated to have existed in europe during the tertiary period but on the other hand the evidence that they did so appears to have some weight on account of the improbability that the numerous resemblances to australian plants which have been noticed by different observers should all be illusory while the well established fact of the former wide distribution of many tropical or now restricted types of plants and animals so frequently illustrated in the present volume removes the antecedent improbability which is supposed to attach to such identifications i am myself the more inclined to accept them because according to the views here advocated such migrations must have taken place at remote as well as at recent epochs and the preservation of some of these types in australia while they have become extinct in europe is exactly paralleled by numerous facts in the distribution of animals which have been already referred to in chapter xix and elsewhere in this volume and also repeatedly in my larger work  193 out of fortytwo genera from the eocene of sheppey enumerated by dr ettingshausen in the geological magazine for january 1880 only two or three appear to be extinct while there is a most extraordinary intermixture of tropical and temperate formsmusa nipa and victoria with corylus prunus acer c the rich miocene flora of switzerland described by professor heer presents a still larger proportion of living genera  194 the recent discovery by lieutenant jensen of a rich flora on rocky peaks rising out of the continental ice of greenland as well as the abundant vegetation of the highest northern latitudes renders it possible that even now the antarctic continent may not be wholly destitute of vegetation although its climate and physical condition are far less favourable than those of the arctic lands see nature vol xxi p 345  195 dr hector notes the occurrence of the genus dammara in triassic deposits while in the jurassic period new zealand possessed the genera palæozamia oleandrium alethopteris camptopteris cycadites echinostrobus c all indian forms of the same age neocomian beds contain a true dicotyledonous leaf with dammara and araucaria the cretaceous deposits have produced a rich flora of dicotyledonous plants many of which are of the same genera as the existing flora while the miocene and other tertiary deposits produce plants almost identical with those now inhabiting the country together with many north temperate genera which have since become extinct see p 499 footnote and trans new zealand inst vol xi 1879 p 536  196 the fact stated in the last edition of the origin of species p 340 on the authority of sir joseph hooker that australian plants are rapidly sowing themselves and becoming naturalised on the neilgherrie mountains in the southern part of the indian peninsula though an exception to the rule of the inability of australian plants to become naturalised in the northern hemisphere is yet quite in harmony with the hypothesis here advocated for not only is the climate of the neilgherries more favourable to australian plants than any part of the north temperate zone but the entire indian peninsula has existed for unknown ages as an island and thus possesses the insular characteristic of a comparatively poor and less developed flora and fauna as compared with the truly continental malayan and himalayan regions australian plants are thus enabled to compete with those of the indian peninsula highlands with a fair chance of success
