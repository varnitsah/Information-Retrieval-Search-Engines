whole fire same as some of the chiefs do but when it comes to drivin an engine dan roberts an doin it in time to get the first water or layin hose i wouldnt knuckle down to the biggest man in the department  now see here seth bartlett whats the sense of talkin that way it would be a good deal better an i aint the only one who says it if youd stick right to shinin an stop playin fireman for thats bout the biggest part of the work you do  do you spose i count on shinin boots for a livin all my life  youve got to make a better fist at it than you have done for a year or more else youll never get into anythin else i tell you what it is seth bartlett when a man wants to hire a boy he aint pickin out the feller thats failed up two or three times over but he generally looks for the one whats makin a go of it whether its shinin or sellin papers  i aint sayin but youre right dan an i spose its a good thing for you to keep right on rememberin but its different with me i dont count on any one man hirin me when i strike out for somethin bettern shinin  oh you dont eh what little game have you got goin to run a bank or keep a hotel or do somethin like that  you think youre funny but you aint im goin into the fire department when the right time comes an dont you make any mistake about it  dan laughed loud and long at this announcement and seth gazed at him in grim silence until the explosion of mirth was somewhat subsided when he said sharply  i guess trade must have been pretty good with you today else you wouldnt be feelin so terrible funny  well it hasnt i got stuck on four heralds this mornin an five expresses tonight that comes pretty near cleanin off all the profits cause its awful dull nowadays in my business seth  then i cant guess why you got so dreadful silly when i said i was goin into the department some day  it would make anybody laugh seth to hear a feller no biggern you talk of such things you must be a man to get that kind of a job  well shant i be in timeand not such a terrible long while either im fourteen now leastways thats the way i figger it out an if i could get one of them early spring moustaches like sim jepson is raisin folks would think i was a man when i wasnt only eighteen dont you reckon all the firemen were boys once  yes dan replied doubtfully i spose they was and he added quickly as a sudden thought occurred to him but they had to know a good deal about the business before they could get a job  course they did an it was a case of learnin thats jest what im doin when i tend out on fires im gettin posted an by an by when im old enough youll see me in the department thats all there is about it  seth bartlett and dan roberts were old friends having made each others acquaintance no less than three months previous when the former who had disagreed with jip collins on a matter regarding household affairs was in search of a new roommate  seth owned or believed he did certain rights in a small shed situate in the rear of baxter brothers carpenter shop where he made his home  it was a rude affair originally built for the purpose of sheltering mr baxters horse and carriage but afterward used as a storage place for such odds and ends as accumulate in a carpenters workshop  seth had made his home in this shed for nearly a year having been given permission to sleep there by one of the owners on a certain cold stormy night and he was not averse to telling his friends how he worked the snap  this is his version of what may perhaps be called a business transaction  i did start in to live with jim wardwells folks you see business was mighty good for a spell an i got to feelin way up toney where nothin short of a reglar room would do me i paid a dollar a week jest for sleepin there ten big round plunks for ten weeks an then i tumbled to myself you see it was too rich for my blood when there come a long spell of bad weather an i wasnt takin in moren twentyfive cents a day so i snooped round to see if i couldnt find somethin that would be cheaper then i struck this shed an i says to myself says i thats jest my size but i knew it wouldnt do to try to bite it out of the carpenters ear less i had a pretty good story to put up i waited four whole days till it turned round so cold that the hair on your head would freeze an long towards the middle of the afternoon it began to snow then i said to myself that the time had come when id got to make the trade i crawled into the carpenters shop an give him a pretty straight story told him how bad business waswell he could see for himself nobody would want boots shined in that weather he said if i promised him i wouldnt freeze to death cause he didnt want any dead bootblacks on his hands i could come in for a spell an dont you think i wasnt fixed all the shavings i wanted for a bed right there on the floor an if the boss of the astor house had got down on his knees beggin me to come to his hotel to stop id said no cause i couldnt be bothered with the airs they put on down that way how long can i stay here i aint troublin my head bout that i dont let the man what owns the place see me any oftener than i can help an so longs i keep out of sight there aint much chance of my bein fired  seths home in which he took so much pride was by no means as uncomfortable as one might suppose with ample material in the shape of short lengths of boards he had constructed a tiny apartment in one end with so great care that only such wind as was necessary for perfect ventilation found its way in to him while his bed of shavings was more restinviting and probably more cleanly than was the wellworn mattress on which he had slept at mrs wardwells home  once having taken possession of this abode seth set about making an honest penny out of his new possessions by allowing jip collins to become his roommate upon the payment of fifteen cents each week and for several months these two lived in apparent harmony although seth afterward said that jip tired him by finding so much fault with the fire department  then came the time when the lodger insisted upon the use of candles at night and in smoking cigarettes inside the apartment both of which luxuries or pleasures had been expressly forbidden by mr baxter when he gave the bootblack permission to occupy the premises  jip had not departed in a friendly manner he believed he had good cause for grievance against seth and on the day he left the lodgings threatened with many a needless word to make it hot for the wouldbe fireman  then master bartlett had taken dan roberts as a tenant and the two had been living as peacefully and comfortably as could be expected save at such times as they heard of new and more startling threats from jip up to this moment when the lodger took it upon himself to criticise his landlords admiration of a firemans calling  seth bartlett was not a general favorite among the merchants in the bootblacking and newspaper business owing to the general belief that he put on airs because of his acquaintance with lish davis driver of ninetyfour engine which was stationed near mr baxters shed  when trade was dull instead of joining his brother merchants in pitching pennies or such other games as they might chance to indulge in seth spent his time about the enginehouse on the alert for an opportunity to be of benefit to some of the men hoping thereby to so far earn their favor that he might be looked upon as a welcome visitor  during no less than two months had he thus apparently loitered around bent on one object and pursuing that steadily without having been so fortunate as to attract particular attention then on a certain day elisha davis the driver called upon the small workman for a shine  seths freckled face was radiant with delight as he entered the enginehouse for the first time and his big brown eyes wandered from the glittering machine above the pole of which hung the shining harness to the apparently complicated apparatus of brass and walnut over the housewatchmans desk  lish as his comrades spoke of him was not in the mood to wait until the boys curiosity had been satisfied for at any instant an alarm might summon him to duty and he impatiently called upon seth to set about his work or clear out  never before had the bootblack spent so much time over a single pair of boots he polished them with his brushes until they shone like mirrors then hardened the gloss with a piece of flannel and when it seemed as if his work had been done to perfection blackened the brilliant surface again with the hope of improving what had apparently been a great success  youre not any too quick about the job but there aint a lad around here that could have done it better lish said approvingly and would have given the boy a nickel but that the latter drew back quickly  i dont want anythin for the shine id like mighty well to give you one every day  do you go around working for thanks the driver asked with no little surprise  of course i take my pay from other folks but i wouldnt let any fireman put up for a shine  why not  cause im jest the same as one myselfthat is im goin into the department when im old enough  stuck on the business eh  illustration lish davis and seth page 8  thats jest the size of it seth cried enthusiastically i tend out on most all the fires in ninetyfours district an sometimes i get a chance to sneak inside the lines  you do eh well ill have an eye out after this and if i get my hands on you there wont be any more such sneaking  now whats the matter with my doin a little thing like that it dont hurt anybody an i pick up a good many points  some day a falling wall will knock you down or youll find yourself under the wheels of an engine and then your points wont be of any particular advantage  i can take care of myself as well as you an if i dont knock round when theres a fire how am i ever goin to learn the business  you dont want to learn whats a dogs life at the best steer clear of it lad and put your mind on anything else for a man dont last long at this kind of work even if he doesnt get killed offhand its only a question of timeand in many cases a precious short timebefore a fireman is laid on the shelf worn out now clear away from here if you wont take pay for the shine and remember that ill have my eye out after this to see you dont get inside the lines  seth obeyed promptly with never a protest and lish said to the watchman at the desk  thats a decent kind of a lad and if he hangs around here any more theres no reason why we shouldnt throw a job in his way now and then  how does that fit in with the lesson you read to him  i didnt try to make it fit if i can scare him out of the notion hes got in his head itll show he aint suited for this kind of a life but if he sticks at it ill believe its worth while to give him a lift now and then  if seth could have heard this brief conversation he would most likely have indulged in the latest jigstep he had learned and perhaps neglected his work as bootblack until hunger forced him to take up the brushes again but he was ignorant of lishs good intentions and went away with a heavy heart yet having no idea of abandoning his efforts to learn the business  he did not cease to spend his spare moments about ninetyfours house and after lish davis had many times threatened the direst punishment if he persisted in such a course but without effect the members of the company came to look upon seth as a boy of pluck who would one day force his way into the department  however no one of ninetyfours men had given him an opportunity for doing other than blacking boots and the boy was entirely ignorant of their friendliness toward him  such was the general position of affairs on the night when dan roberts believed it his duty to mildly reprove seth for spending so much time in what seemed to be idleness when he should be looking for customers  after the master of the shedhome had announced so positively that he would be a fireman in due course of time dan remembering how jip collins had lost his footing in the household decided he had done his whole duty in the matter and straightway changed the subject of conversation by saying  sam barney had mighty bad luck today first off somebody passed a lead dime on him an then he lost as many as fifteen cents at one slap  how seth asked with no slight show of interest  thats what he cant make out he had the money in the same pocket where he always carries it when all of a sudden it was gone  somebody touched him  must be an sam thinks hes got an idea who it is  cant be any of the reglar gang cause i dont know a feller what would do a trick like that  sams keepin mighty close about it an i wouldnt wonder if he found the whole business out before long he comes near to bein a reglar detective you know  who sam  sure  but what does he know about the detective business  perhaps hes learnin it sames you are the firemans racket  this reduced seth to silence and dan fearing that he might have given offence hastened to say in a most friendly tone  of course if a feller studies over anything of that kind hell soon come somewhere near knowin a little about it an sam is posted in more ways than one  then how does it happen he let anybody go through him  thats the funny part of it an the folks what did it must have been mighty slick cause you see  dan was interrupted by the sound of footsteps near at hand and ever on the alert against possible danger seth made his way to the door of the shed as he asked sharply  whos there  its only me a familiar voice replied and he knew that the visitor was none other than the boy of whom he and his lodger had just been speaking  dan was tellin me youd lost your money didnt come up here reckonin he or id got it did you  i aint any sich fool as that but jip collins has been makin a good deal of cheap talk this afternoon an i thought perhaps youd like to know bout it  hes allers doin that an i reckon its more wind than anythin else  i wouldnt wonder if this time he got right down to business an you oughter keep a pretty sharp lookout seth these are too snug quarters for you to lose through a feller like jip  come inside and set down master bartlett said as his lodger joined him at the door of the shed dan an me is here alone an you wont mind if its dark cause you see i promised mr baxter straight out an out that there shouldnt ever be any kind of a light inside thats one of the things jip kicked about you know  sam barney promptly accepted the invitation being an old friend of seths he was familiar with the household arrangements and despite the darkness made his way through the shed to the boxlike home in one corner where after some difficulty he found a block of wood that served as chair  seth threw himself upon the bed of shavings and dan lounged negligently near the entrance  i should think it would be kind er lonesome in here nights when its like this sam suggested as he tried in vain to distinguish the form of either of his companions  well it aint cause dan an me dont spend a great deal of time settin round after we once get in we should have been asleep before this if he hadnt had considerable to say bout my tryin to be a fireman hed jest got through when you came  well say seth you dont blieve youre ever goin to get on to the department jest cause you run to every fire ninetyfour goes to do you  i dont know why i cant be a fireman jest as easy as you can a detective an some of the fellers say youre workin mighty hard to be one  well sposen i am and sam spoke sharply  i aint kickin against it but was only sayin that its jest as easy for me to get what im tryin for as it is for you  sams opinion on the subject may have differed from that of his host but he refrained from making any reply and at once began to speak concerning the purpose of his visit  jip collins is goin to work some kind of a racket on you an i reckon i can guess pretty nigh what it is he was makin a good deal of talk this afternoon an it seems as though the time had come when youd better have your eyes open  jips allers had a good deal to say since i told him he couldnt sleep here any longer but it never mounted to anythin  but look here seth this time i blieve hell do some mischief hes been tellin that hell give you a chance to show how much of a fireman you are an i heard him talkin bout touchin a match to shavings sos to smoke you out till ive made up my mind that hes goin to set fire to this place  seth laughed derisively  i aint fraid of a feller like him  then its all right an no harm done in my tellin you but if i was in your place id keep my eyes open pretty wide now jip collins cant scare me a little bit but yet if i was in a snap like this an i knew hed threatened to set fire it would kind er stir me up a bit  dont you go to thinkin i aint glad cause you told me sam for i am only it dont stand to reason a feller like jip collins can do much of anythin  dont you be so sure of that dan roberts cried ive heard somethin bout what jips been sayin though i never blieved he had it in his head to burn the place up but this much is sure if it could be done without his takin too many chances hes jest the kind of a feller what would try it he claims that accordin to the trade you give him the right to stay in this place jest as long as you did and that it was the same as swindlin him when i come in  he knows better than that i told him wed try it a spell an see how we got along the very first night i went all over the business with him an said if we couldnt hitch together easy like why we didnt want to stay in the same place an he was satisfied with it now i dont see how i can do anythin if hes bent on settin fire to the shed moren lookin round pretty sharp before i go to bed  if i owned this place sames you do i should set up nights cause thens when hell try his game sam said with an air of wisdom it aint likely hell come round here in the daytime but after the men have gone away from the shop it wouldnt be anyways hard for him to get in an strike a match to some of these shavins  but accordin to that you couldnt do very much work if you set up all night watchin for jip collins youd have to sleep in the daytime i dont see how a feller is goin to earn his livin any sich way  i didnt say you oughter do it sam replied quickly but was only tellin what i believed in it aint likely youd have to stand watch many nights cause the first time you caught jip youd put an end to it by pretty nigh thumpin the life out er him then i dont reckon hed come again  do you spose hes countin on doin this all alone  no hes got a couple of fellers from brooklyn that hes chummin with jest now an most likely theyre comin into the game  if they do an i should watch for jip till i caught him there aint any great show of my thumpin him very bad if hes got two others to lend a hand  you aint scared of him are you sam asked quickly  not much i aint but ill keep clear from that kind of a racket till i know somethin bout it i cant ford to have a row dont you see cause if any of ninetyfours men heard i was fightin my way along as likely as not theyd shut me off from goin to the enginehouse an then agin when the time comes for me to get into the department it would give me a black eye if i had the name of doin sich things i dont spose that would hurt a detective but theyre mighty careful what kind of fellers they have in the department an i dont count on havin a bad mark to my name four years from now  well suit yourself about that of course it aint any of my business only i thought id tell you what jips sayin an ive got to get along over towards hoboken  then from the noise he made his hosts understood that sam barney was making his way out of the apartment and dan asked in a friendly tone if he had made any new discoveries regarding the theft of his money  im follerin up a pretty good clue now sam replied in a tone calculated to give the hearer an impression that he could tell more if it was necessary and then with a cheery so long he rapidly made his way across the lumberyard to the street     chapter ii  lish davis   when their visitor had departed seth and dan held a long consultation as to the advisability of following sams advice in the matter of standing guard during the hours of darkness  dan believed that owing to his having made a study of the detective business sam barney knew better than they what should be done toward warding off the threatened attack and regardless of the labor involved he proposed that a sentinel be stationed just outside the shed door  ill go on guard until twelve oclock and you can sleep all that time then ill call you an take my turn at it dan said after they had discussed the matter in all its bearings for ten minutes or more  how do you count on keepin awake  that can easily be done cause ill walk round the yard an the nights are just about cold enough to make a feller want to move lively  i dont believe jip collins would dare do what he threatens  he would if he thought the game could be worked without too much risk an i tell you seth if both of us turn in an go to sleep he might carry the whole shed away without our knowin it  all right ill gree to it though if he should come round we mustnt have too much of a row cause you remember what i told sam bout not wantin to be taken for a fighter in this neighborhood else ill never get into the department  you can be pretty certain i shouldnt tackle him alone an if them two fellers from brooklyn mount to anythin why you an i together wouldnt have too much of a show  then after repeating that he was to be called at midnight in order to perform his full share of the labor seth went into the boxlike apartment and dan began his work as watchman  during the first halfhour he paced to and from one end of the yard to the other scrutinizing carefully every unfamiliar object until it seemed to him the night was more than half spent  i must have been here four hours now an sam barney left bout halfpast seven so i havent got a great while to tramp round he said to himself and just at that moment the clock on a neighboring steeple struck the hour of eight  he was both surprised and discouraged at thus learning that the time was passing so slowly and it suddenly came into his mind that he was very tired  it was foolish to keep constantly moving around because if jip collins should come he would see the sentinel and make no effort to carry out his threats until the coast was clear  therefore it was that master roberts built a seat from pieces of board just inside the shed and seating himself where he could have a full view of the yard while remaining unseen he continued his duties in what appeared to him to be a much wiser and certainly a more comfortable fashion  here he was protected from the chill wind and as was only natural here also he fell asleep even while saying to himself that nothing should tempt him to close his eyes even for a single moment  when the nearby clock struck the hour of twelve dan was still wrapped in slumber  at three oclock in the morning his repose was most profound and just at daylight seth shook him by the shoulder as he asked with a laugh  how long have you been asleep  dans most intimate friends claimed that he never told a lie and he was not tempted to do so on this occasion even though the truth provoked mirth at his expense  it couldnt have been a great while after eight oclock it didnt seem possible id go to sleep here seth an sure i meant to keep my eyes wide open but the first thing i knew it was done an i havent woke up since  well that shows how much need there is to watch for jip collins hes all wind that feller is an likes to go round town braggin what hell do to us but youll find every night will be jest like this as soon as its dark he gets where he belongs an dont take the chances of bein out too late comin up here in the night an tryin any funny business is too much for a coward like him an i tell you we might as well go to sleep as to stand guard  nothing could have been more convincing to dan than this experience when the amateur detective left them it seemed positive jip collins would attempt to work mischief before daybreak and had he been forced to lie down on the bed of shavings by the side of his landlord dan roberts would have felt decidedly uneasy in mind  now however since he had kept such poor watch and it was evident the enemy had not been in that vicinity he came to look at the matter much as did seth  although no absolute decision was arrived at regarding what should be done in the future as to standing guard it was understood between these two inmates of the shedhome that such precaution was unnecessary  among his other conveniences for housekeeping seth had a tin biscuitbox which served him as cupboard and the two were in the custom of bringing home at night sufficient for their breakfast next morning  it was necessary dan should be ready to begin business at a very early hour and when the sun rose these two merchants were usually making ready for the days work  on this particular morning however they lingered over the meal having much spare time at their disposal because of seths early awakening and shortly after daybreak both set out one to visit the newspaper offices and the other to loiter in the vicinity of the enginehouse until the firemen should require his services for now nearly all the company patronized the lad whom they were pleased to call the amateur  it is but right however to state that he was paid for such services after that first morning when seth had refused to take money from lish davis he was given to understand that when the members of the company wanted boots blacked they were to pay for the labor otherwise some other of the fraternity would be called upon  seth begged for the privilege of shinin for the crowd free declaring that he should not lose any money through such gratuitous labor for he would be familiarizing himself with the indoor details of a firemans life  to this however lish davis made answer  see here my son youve got your living to earn and cant afford to give up bread an butter for the sake of getting on to our work well pay for the shines or you dont put your nose inside this house and as for finding out what we do hereabout why its nothing but drudgery cleaning harnesses setting the machines to rights and keeping the place neat as a new pin make up the bulk of the work so take a nickel for every shine you give or out you go never to come back  from that hour seth had been paid regularly and thanks to such patronage he was in a great measure independent of other customers because there was seldom a day when he did not earn at least twentyfive cents from ninetyfours men  thus it can be understood that he was warranted in loitering near the enginehouse until his patrons should be ready for his services and on this particular morning the first man who came out of doors found him seated on his box leaning against the building whistling cheerily  feeling pretty good this morning aint you kid the fireman asked rather as a greeting than for the purpose of gaining information and the boy replied in a tone of perplexity  i aint certain about that mr walters  not sure whether youre feeling good or not  no an thats a fact has mr davis turned out yet  well spose he has do you want to consult with him  thats bout the size of it  hes inside with the horses go right through  in order that he might not be an unwelcome visitor seth had had sufficient good sense never to enter the building without an express invitation or permission and perhaps because he was thus scrupulous the men were all the more willing to admit him  hello whats up lish davis asked as the boy appeared thus unannounced  if you aint very busy id like to talk with you bout somethin thats botherin my pardner an me a good bit since last night  fire away lad i reckon ive got time enough to listen to the story unless it is in more than one chapter  it aint so very long an ill be quick as i can seth replied and then he told without going too much into detail of his trouble with jip collins and of the latest threats which the boy had made according to sam barneys statement concluding by saying  now i dont believe jips got sand enough to do any sich thing as settin fire to the shed an its sure he didnt try it last night cause he had every chance but ive been thinkin bout it while i was waitin for the house to be opened an it kinder come into my mind that perhaps he might make a bluff at it  i wouldnt be surprised at anything some of these young villains did lish davis said after a brief time of reflection the general run of street boys get an idea into their heads and dont stop to realize what the consequences may be let me see you live in the rear of baxters carpenter shop dont you  yes sir  theres a brick building butts up against the back end of that lot so your only chance of getting out would be to come through the lumberyard  yes sir  well it wouldnt amount to very much as a fire but in case one got started there you and your partner would stand a good show of getting a dose  seth understood the driver to mean that there was danger of being suffocated by the smoke and he admitted that such might be the case but added  we cant do as sam barney says an set up every night watchin else when would we sleep  why dont you leave this place for two or three days and find some other quarters  that neverd do cause jest as soon as the fellers knew id gone theyd snoop round an id be thrown out of a home mighty quick  you might get baxter to let you put a lock on the shed that would keep them out  i wouldnt like to do it cause you see ive got an idea the carpenter has forgot all about my sleepin there an perhaps if i was to flash up so fresh askin for a lock on the bedroom door hed think it was bout time for me to skip  well look here seth you might as well give me a shine and while you re doing that ill see if i can think of a way out for you im inclined to believe the same as your detective friend does that it stands you in hand to keep a pretty good watch and ill speak to the cop on this beat  seth set about his professional duties without delay and by the time one boot had been polished so perfectly that it reflected surrounding objects almost as well as a mirror the fireman asked abruptly  how old are you kid  fourteen accordin to the way i figger it  dont you know  well you see old miss washburnshe was the woman that claimed to bring me up though its precious little she did towards itwasnt no ways certain herself but thats what she allowed so its good enough for me  havent got any folks eh  well i did have a mother you know till i was a couple of years old so miss washburn says  wheres your father  you see i never had one leastways not what you would call a real father cause when a man is a reglar ginpig no decent feller is goin to own up that hes his relation the last time i saw him he was goin down on the island for ninety days an that was as much as three years ago  youve still got the fool idea in your mind that youre going to be a fireman  it aint any fool idea mr davis cause its a fact thats jest what i count on bein  look here my son ive been thinking about you a considerable bit since i found it was no use trying to scare you out of the plan and in a years time or so i reckon between the captain and walters and me we can get you in up to headquarters now dont jump so i didnt mean we allowed you could go there as a recruit but the captain was saying the other night that we might work it sos you could get some kind of a berth theresweeping floors washing windows and the like of that which if you keep your ears and eyes open would amount to the same as if you went into actual training you aint the lad ive got in my eye if you couldnt soon work your way into one of the classes  if i only might seth replied emphatically with a long indrawing of the breath if i only might  i allow well work it lad but you must grow a good bit twixt now and then  im hopin to get an early spring moustache before long sim jepsons got one an im goin to do the same as he did cause the fellers say he put somethin on to make the hair grow  the driver laughed long and loud at this announcement made in the gravest tone and called upon every idle man in the building to come and hear the amateurs latest scheme for getting into the department  the boys face flushed a deep red before lish davis was willing to cease laughing at or repeating the proposition but finally he wearied of his sport and his boots having long since been polished said in a serious tone  ill speak to the cop on this beat about your friend collins and in the meantime make it your business to hunt him up let the little scoundrel know youve told me that im going to post the policeman and that hell get a mighty hot reception if he should try any of his firebug business i reckon some such hint will knock the mischief out of his head unless hes a born idiot  then mr davis walked away intent on the morning duties and seth set about his regular work until all the company had been served after which he started downtown in accordance with the plan proposed by the driver  owing to customers and they were unusually plentiful on this day it was not until late in the afternoon that he arrived at city hall square where jip collins was most often to be found and here he met his partner  dan was delighted at learning what steps had been taken for their safety although because of the previous nights experience he had begun to doubt if their enemy would dare carry his threats into effect and the two at once made search for master collins  he had been seen thereabouts within an hour by more than one of seths acquaintances but now although the two searched until nightfall it was impossible to accomplish their purpose  it seemed much as if jip collins learning that seth was in the vicinity believed it wisest to keep out of sight and after the night had fully come dan said impatiently  its no use spendin so much time on that duffer cause he wont show up again tonight weve told so many of the fellers what lish davis said that jip will be sure to hear of it before he goes to bed an perhaps that will be just as well as if you had met him cause there might have been a row lets go up and get a bowl of fivecent soup and a piece of pie i can stand a tencent spread tonight an business has been good enough with you  to this proposition seth assented and the two made their way to a certain restaurant on chatham street where after an unusually profitable days work they were in the custom of feasting  if there was any one thing in which dan roberts excelled it was in his ability to eat very fast and for a long while  he ordered the waiter to bring him the pie and the soup at the same time and it seemed to seth as if he had but just begun before his partner was finished  i reckon i can take one more bowl of that soup an then be through before you are he said thoughtfully i made pretty near forty cents an its kinder tough if a feller cant spend fifteen of it eh  go ahead if you want the soup an are willin to pay for it it dont make any difference to me cause ill stay here till youre filled plum full but i tell you what it is dan youre gettin into an awful habit of eatin  is that what you call a habit  course it is if you didnt think about it every minute you wouldnt be so hungry  im pretty near starved all the time as it is an i dont know how id get along with any less dan replied apologetically and then the soup having been brought he gave his undivided attention to the pleasing task  after the feast the boys having nothing of special importance to do lounged leisurely towards their home in the shed and it was nearly nine oclock before they crept into the box that served as chamber both feeling tired and sleepy  not until they were inside did seth realize that they had not searched the lumberyard and he insisted that they go at once to make certain no enemy was hidden near at hand  whats the use of that dan asked petulantly you can be sure jip collins aint anywhere round here cause some of the fellers have told him what we said long before this an hell give the place a wide berth  you aint sure he knows that i told lish davis bout the threats he was makin  well he didnt come last night an you was the one that said he wouldnt dare to show his nose round  i know it but somehow or other dan it seems as if we oughter look out a little sharper cause he might be fool enough to try such a game  an if he did after tellin everybody about it hed go up the river ten or fifteen years surei aint certain but that it would be a life sentence  yes i know all that dan but jip aint the kind of a feller to figger on sich things an if he gets a notion right solid in his head theres no knowin how big a fool he might make of himself so lets go out an have a look round  it was with an ill grace that dan followed seth and even then his share in the search was of but little service owing to the fact that he hurried from one part of the yard to the other without making an effort to ascertain if any one was secreted in the many convenient hidingplaces near at hand  after ten minutes or more had been spent by the two boys seth performing his work faithfully and dan shirking the partners retired and it was as if they had but just stretched themselves at full length on the bed of shavings when both were asleep  if dan had been acting the part of sentinel just inside the shed door an hour after the two retired he would have seen in the gloom three dark forms emerge from behind a pile of boards which he had failed to look over carefully and advance cautiously toward the shed door halting when they were twenty feet or more away  had he been there he would have recognized one of these as jip collins and most probably suspected that the other two were the boys from brooklyn spoken of by the amateur detective  he would also have heard the conversation which followed but he did not because he was asleep and the lad who was willing to commit a crime in order to compass his revenge found no impediment in the way  theyre snorin by this time thats certain jip said to his comrades an even if they wasnt we might talk here for an hour without their hearin cause seths room is in the farther end of the shed and theres a whole pile of lumber between him an the door he dont believe in going out much after hes got inside the yard for fear the carpenter will see him so we can make up our minds that theres nothin to stop us  where do you count on starting the fire  right close by the shed door of course i know where to get a lot of shavings  but it wont do to set it so near because the fellers might be burned to death an that would be a pretty piece of business jip collins  gettin scared eh  you dont want to talk to me bout gettin scared a feller whod let another only half his size back him down sames you did last night  illustration jip collins and the boys from brooklyn page 34  if you aint scared what are you makin a row bout now we greed to put a fire here sos to singe seth an dan a little  yes i agreed to that much but i dont count on killing em  neither do i  but how can you help it if you build the fire right close to the door when theres no other way for em to get out  dont you spose theyve got sense enough to wake up before the thing gets too far along  ive heard of folks bein smothered to death while they was asleep an i aint in this game if thats the way youre goin to work it  then back out if youre scared an ill do it  without paying any further attention to his companions jip made his way to the rear of the carpenters shop where he knew would be found an ample supply of light wood and shavings and when he returned his arms filled with the inflammable material neither of his friends from brooklyn could be seen     chapter iii  jips revenge   if jip collins had not accused the brooklyn boys of being afraid it is doubtful if he would have dared to set fire to the shed  now it seemed to him as if he must carry out the proposed crime or set himself down as a coward and because of being deficient in bravery his one fear was lest such fact should be generally known  he was on the spot the materials for kindling a blaze were in his arms and it appeared at that moment to him as if it was absolutely necessary he should perform what he had so often threatened without really intending to do  the shavings and light wood were laid at the door of the shed jip was careful not to place them in such a manner as would be best calculated to produce the fiercest blaze but dropped them without heed as if saying to himself that chance should decide whether the building caught fire or not  he drew several matches from his pocket and looked around apprehensively hearing in every noise the footsteps of an officer coming to drag him to prison  after thus hesitating several moments he understood beyond a peradventure that he was alonethat nothing save his own conscience prevented him from carrying into effect his plan of revenge  it should be said that at this moment jip failed to realize what might be the consequences of such an act  one of the brooklyn boys had suggested the possibility that those in the shed might be burned to death if the fire was started near the door but to this jip had given little heed he could not believe that two active lads like seth and dan would be overpowered by a little smoke and felt assured the firemen would arrive so soon after the blaze had been kindled that very little damage could ensue  after this brief time of hesitation he turned toward the pile of wood and shavings once more with a gesture as if impatient with himself for delaying  then he lighted a match protecting the tiny flame with both hands until it was a sturdy blaze after which instead of holding it to the shavings he threw it away  for one instant his conscience had triumphed but it was only for an instant  he lighted another match hurriedly this time as if fearing he might not have the courage to apply it and when it was fully on fire muttered to himself  ill drop it an take the chances if she burns its a go an if she dont ive done as much as ive threatened  he suited the action to the words and not daring to wait for the result ran hurriedly into the deserted street  it was his intention to continue on halting only when having arrived at his home but now that the mischief might have been done he was so thoroughly alarmed that it seemed impossible he could leave the vicinity  partially concealing himself in a doorway he waited almost breathlessly hoping fervently the match had been extinguished when it fell and as the seconds passed each one seeming a full minute a great hope came into his heart for he believed chance had decreed that the fire should not be kindled  then a stifled cry of fear burst from his lips for he had suddenly seen a bright tongue of flame leap up and he knew the crime had been committed in fact as well as spirit  at this moment he remembered the words of his friends from brooklyn as distinctly as if they had but just been spoken and like a flash came the realization that perhaps he had done that which would result in the loss of human life  the flames increased until they were reflected on the wall of brick in the rear and it seemed to jip as if the shed must already be in a blaze  why dont somebody send in an alarm he said speaking aloud in his anxiety although there was no one at hand to hear him seth an dan will be burned to death if the engines dont get here mighty soon  then came the thought for he believed the fire was already beyond control that it would be impossible to rescue the boysthat he was indeed a murderer for it seemed to him as if an exceedingly long time had elapsed since he first saw the tiny ray of light  now his one desire was that an alarm might be sent in yet no one could be seen or heard in either direction  each moment of delay increased the peril and when he had waited in most painful suspense for ten seconds it was impossible to remain inactive any longer  far down the street a red light could be seen denoting the location of a firealarm station and he ran toward it as he had never run before so nervous when he would have opened the outer door of the box that for two or three seconds it was impossible to turn the handle  when he did so the sound of the warning gong intended to notify the policeman on that beat that the box was being opened caused him to start back in alarm for he fancied the officers of justice were already on his trail  jip had many times seen a call rung in and in the merest fraction of time he recovered from his fears as he understood the cause of this sudden noise  then he opened the outer door and pulled down the lever once and from that instant until the first engine appeared which was ninetyfour it seemed to him as if an hour had passed although in fact the company of which seth considered himself in a certain degree a member had responded to the call in less than three minutes  jip was standing by the signalbox when a rumble and roar in the distance told of the coming of ninetyfour and he watched as if fascinated the fountain of sparks which went up from the smokestack listened to the sharp clicking of the horses shoes on the pavement to the din of the gongs and the cries of startled pedestrians in the rearhearing everything seeing everything but yet all the while as if in a dream  nearer and nearer came the puffing engine drawn by three plunging horses as if it had been no more than a toy and then his brain still in a whirl jip heard as if from afar off the question  wheres the fire  in baxters carpenter shop  the engine was some distance beyond him by the time he had answered the question and from the opposite direction he heard the rush of a second oncoming machine then here and there the rumble of wheels and hoofbeats of horses driven at their utmost speed until it seemed as if by that one pull on the lever of the signalbox he had aroused the entire city  now seth and dan would be saved if they were yet alive  at that moment there was no hope in jips mind that they could still be living  it was as if he had lighted that match an hour ago so slowly had the seconds passed and with the thought of them as deadburned to death through his actcame wildest terror  he fancied every fireman on ninetyfour had recognized him as they rode past in such mad haste and knew him to be the one who had committed the crime  there was no place in his mind for any thought save that of his own danger and instantly he started at full speed down the street never daring to so much as glance behind him although no man pursued  when the joker which is the name given by firemen to the combinationbell in ninetyfours house rang out the number of the call sent in by jip and as the horses released by the mechanical trip moved by the joker dashed out of their stalls lish davis believed he knew beyond a question to what particular building they were summoned  instantly that which seth had told him came into his mind and with it the painful thought that perhaps by his own neglect he had contributed to what might be a fatal disaster  and i never so much as warned the policeman on this beat he said to himself as he leaped to his seat on the engine snapped into place the belt that would hold him there and with a quick jerk on the reins released the harnesscatch  ninetyfour had seldom left the house more quickly and certainly the horses were never urged to a higher rate of speed than now when lish davis charged himself with criminal neglect  during the minute and a half which intervened before they reached the station from which the alarm had been sent the driver of ninetyfour conceived an absolute affection for the boy who had so persistently followed up his idea of becoming a fireman and prompted by the prickings of his own conscience perhaps he muttered to himself  the kid shall go into the department if i can put him there providing it so be we find  he did not finish the sentence for at that instant it was to lish davis as if he must in a certain degree take upon himself the results of this nights work  when they dashed past the station he needed not jips reply to tell him whence came the glow of light which could now be seen reflected on the taller buildings and ninetyfour got water a full two minutes before any other engine  that little bootblack seth bartlett sleeps in the shed behind the shop lish called hoarsely as the men ran swiftly through the lumberyard and hearing the words even above the tooting of whistles the sounding of gongs from the oncoming engines and the puffing of steam jerry walters cried  ill look out for him lish  every man heard the drivers cry and knew that the amateur fireman was in danger  they also knew where he slept having been given by the boy himself a description of his home and with the first crash of jerrys axe as he burst in the door of the shed the men set up a shout which sounded like music in lishs ears  it was jip collins who had started the fire and he also was the means of saving the lives of seth and dan after the mischief had been wrought for the firemen gained the boxlike apartment not one moment too soon  all unconscious of the danger which threatened the boys had slept on until the noisome vapor overcame without awakening them and when jerry carried the two out into the street through the piles of lumber which were already beginning to blaze he said to joe black as the latter advanced to help him take the apparently lifeless bodies to one of the patrolwagons drawn up near at hand  im afraid the amateur has got more of a dose than he can well stand  ten minutes later when seth woke to consciousness dan was lying by his side in the bottom of the wagon and lish davis bent over him  it must be that jip collins did what he threatened he said speaking with difficulty because of the parched burning sensation in his throat  ay lad thats what he did and this town wont be big enough to hold him after daylight tomorrow morning  but why are you here mr davis what about the team  ben dunton is on hand and im off duty for the time being till i can make sure whether youre alive or not  seth knew that ben dunton was lishs relief therefore the driver was not neglecting his duty by thus staying with him  is it a bad fire he asked  the shop and about half the lumberyard will go its nothing to speak of lad save for the fact of its having been kindled that murder might be done  i dont believe jip collins really meant to kill us he most likely thought we would get out before it was very bad is dan all right  theres nothing much the matter with me master roberts replied in what he intended should be a cheery tone ive been awake quite a spell an thought youd never open your eyes  sure youre all right lish asked shaking seth gently as if doubting whether the boy was fully conscious  of course i am an now were inside the lines theres a good chance for me to look round after points im going into the yard to see what ninetyfours men are doin  i reckon youll lay where you are for a spell lish said with a grim smile speaking half to himself and in such a low tone that neither of the boys heard the words  seth attempted to rise but had no more than gotten up on one elbow when a most violent nausea assailed him and he fell back on the rubber blankets which had served as pillow feeling much as he lookeddesperately ill  dont feel like wiggling round to any great extent eh lish asked understanding full well the boys sensations and so relieved at knowing his life had been saved that the temporary sickness seemed as nothing  i dont see what makes me feel so bad and seth did his best to speak in a careless tone  if it so be you ever get into the department lad this aint the first dose youll take nor the heaviest its the smoke which came nigh to strangling you and there aint a man that answers to ninetyfours rollcall who cant tell exactly how you feel  ive got to brace up pretty soon or dan an me will have to walk round the streets the balance of the night now our housekeepin is broken up  dont worry about that lad i reckon the captain will give you a shelter till daylight and after that well see what can be done  then lish understanding that he could render no assistance left the two boys to join his comrades who were fighting the fire as gallantly in the lumberyard as they would have done at a palatial residence  so jip collins had sand enough to try an burn us out didnt he dan said interrogatively ill run across that duffer one of these days and when i get through with him he wont set anybody elses shed on fire  the police will most likely get hold of him cause mr davis knows all about what he threatened an even if sam barney didnt let out the whole story the driver will  having said this seth relapsed into silence for his bodily condition was such that it seemed a severe exertion to so much as speak  the fire was subdued but not extinguished when the patrolwagon was driven away with ben dunton on the front seat and dan asked in a tone of awe  do you spose theyre goin to carry us up to the enginehouse  it seemed as though that was what mr davis meant but yet im afraid were bound for the hospital  well say you dont catch me inside of one i aint goin to flock in with a lot of dyin folks jest cause ive got a little smoke down my throat and dan who was not suffering as much as his partner attempted to scramble to his feet whereat ben dunton shouted gruffly  lay still there you two kids or ill come down and know the reason why  we aint goin to no hospital dan cried angrily  who asked you to you dont allow were running an ambulance for such kids as you eh  where are we goin  lay still and youll find out  seth had learned enough regarding a firemans life to know that the first engine at the scene of a conflagration must be the last to leave therefore wherever ben dunton might be taking them there was little chance of seeing lish davis until the following morning  to the great delight of both the boys the patrolwagon was drawn up in front of ninetyfours house and dunton asked  can you lads get out alone or shall i lend a hand  are we goin to stay here all night dan asked suspiciously  of course you are its the captains orders and youre to have lish daviss bed  this was sufficient to cause a decided change in seths condition  the fact that he was to sleep in the enginehouse as if he had been a member of the department was so great an honor that for the time being his illness was banished  the boys alighted from the vehicle without assistance and followed ben dunton into the building where a report was made to the housewatchman regarding the guests who were then conducted to the floor above  theres where youre to sleep the fireman said pointing to the drivers bed and you want to get in some precious big licks for it aint often lish davis puts himself out in this fashion for anybody especially when hes likely to be on duty six or eight hours no skylarking now but get between the sheets as quick as you know how  no second bidding was necessary and five minutes later the two boys were enjoying a greater degree of comfort than they had ever fancied would be possible seth refusing to join in the conversation which his partner would have started in order to give himself wholly up to building aircastles all based on the fire department with himself rising from the grade of recruit to that of battalionchief  slumber closed their eyelids in due time however and they journeyed so far into the recesses of dreamland that neither heard the homecoming of ninetyfour nor the bustle consequent upon cleaning up and making ready for duty once more  it was seven oclock in the morning when seth awakened and for the first time since having been told he was to sleep in lishs bed he realized how much inconvenience and possible discomfort he might have caused the driver  say dan we did a mighty mean thing to sleep here an perhaps mr davis had to set up all night hustle your clothes on as quick as you know how sos we can get downstairs an tell him were ashamed of it  neither of the boys was feeling any the worse for the painful experience of the previous night and in a remarkably short space of time they were ready to descend but not by the stairs  for the first time in his life seth enjoyed the pleasure of sliding down the pole to the floor below and this method of descending served to strengthen certain portions of the aircastles he had built just before falling asleep  the driver was found grooming one of the horses and greeted the boys before either could speak by saying cheerily  well how are you getting along after your dose of last night  firstrate sir were as well as ever but feelin mighty mean to think we used your bed an kept you up all night  you didnt do anything of the kind lad we got back about four oclock and i found plenty of spare beds for the short nap i wanted i reckon you lost everything you owned eh  yes sir but that wasnt very much my box brushes and what we had brought home for breakfast  how will you get another outfit  i guess ive got money enough for a secondhand box and brushes but if i havent some of the fellers will lend me whats needed an im goin now to pick up the things sos to get back in time to do the shinin here  there are brushes and blacking belonging to the house and you can use them this morning which will give you a little extra towards buying a new outfit havent been to breakfast yet have you  that dont count even if we havent cause we can get something later and seth knowing where to find the tools of his trade set about his customary mornings work while dan lounged here and there feeling that he was a very fortunate lad in thus being a guest of ninetyfours men  half an hour later in company with dan seth richer by thirty cents set out in search of a secondhand box and brushes  save in the way of questioning him concerning the boy who was believed to have started the fire in the lumberyard none of the men treated the bootblack other than in their customary manner and seth departed with the fear in his mind that they were glad to be rid of him  no sooner had he gone however than lish davis addressed three or four of his comrades who were near at hand saying emphatically  look here that boy seth is bent on getting into the department and i tell you when a lad sticks to one thing as hes stuck to that for the last year some one ought to lend him a hand  you aint thinking of getting him taken on here are you lish walters asked with a laugh  ive got a plan in my head and allow that the rest of you can help me through with it if all hands of us turn to we can get the boy a job at headquarters and he aint the lad ive taken him to be if he dont put himself in the way of being received as a recruit when hes grown stouter and a little older now such a lift as that wont be much for us and it may be the making of him  do you allow its a good idea lish davis to help a boy into the department when he might learn a trade which wouldnt be that of risking his life two or three times every day  would you turn tinker or tailor or candlestickmaker jerry walters in order to avoid risking your life two or three times a day  its different with me lish ive been here so long i couldnt give it up  and it would be almost as hard for that lad to give up his idea i tried to frighten it out of him when he first came around here but he didnt scare worth a cent and i tell you again that hell make a cracking good man for some company one of these days  if theres anything i can do to help the thing along you may count me in walters replied and the other members of the company who heard the remark pledged themselves to the same thing  well let him hoe his own row till everything is ready cause it may do harm if he gets to thinking somebody is trying to give him a lift  whats to be done with the kid who started the fire  i repeated to the captain all the amateur told me so i reckon hell be attended to is ben dunton in the house  upstairs asleep  then im going out for a bit i want to see the battalionchief  going to strike for seth while the irons hot eh  thats what im thinking of jerry and while seth bartlett was making ready to continue his business of blacking boots lish davis began in his behalf the efforts which he believed would result favorably so far as the boys ambition was concerned     chapter iv  sam the detective   the sidewalk merchants in the vicinity of the postoffice were well informed of seth bartletts loss by the time he arrived in that section of the city  those who had not heard the story from dan roberts read an account of the destruction of baxter brothers carpentershop in the morning papers during the early part of the day before the business rush began and thus it was seth found himself the centre of a sympathizing crowd of acquaintances as soon as he crossed city hall park  master barney had but just returned from a journey supposed to have been taken in search of the boy who had robbed him and he immediately cast aside his own business troubles in order to work the case against jip collins as he expressed it  sam was among the throng gathered to meet the homeless bootblack and when others would have asked for further particulars regarding the conflagration even though dan had given all the information in his possession the amateur detective checked the curious ones by saying sharply  this aint any time to talk foolishness cause if im goin to take up this case i must get right down to it before jip has a chance to run very far  what do you mean by takin up the case seth asked in surprise and dan roberts replied quickly  sam says hes willin to go after jip collins an will stick at it till he catches him  thats what ive greed to an im in dead earnest seth of course you cant afford to pay a reglar detective a whole lot of money jest to find jip for you but i can do the work as well an you neednt put out a cent moren im called on to spend for expenses  what do you want of jip seth asked in surprise  to have him rested for settin fire to your shed of course  i dont want anythin of the kind i reckon hes sorry enough for what he did without my tryin to make more trouble for him  do you mean to say youre willin he should burn the shed an come pretty nigh killin you  course i aint willin but now its been done theres no need for me to try to put him in jail cause it wont do any good an id feel bad to think any feller i knew was up to sing sing doin time  it was evident that but few of the sidewalk merchants agreed with seth in the view he took of the matter  the majority of them believed jip should be pursued until captured and then punished to the full extent of the law  some were inclined to the opinion that sam barney might possibly succeed in running down the culprit but these credulous ones were the most intimate friends of the amateur detective and by far the larger number of the throng thought a formal complaint should be lodged with the officers of the law against the boy who had so nearly caused the death of seth and dan  sam barney was literally astounded at the forgiving spirit which the wouldbe fireman displayed and this first burst of astonishment soon gave way to something like anger  he said in what was intended to be a fine tone of irony  well youre too good seth bartlett thats whats the matter with you heres dan been tellin that you were jest about the same as dead when ninetyfours men got in there the snuggest house in town burned an you thrown out of a home after all that youve got the nerve to say theres no reason why we should catch jip collins i aint certain as youve got anythin to do with it sposen the cops find out what was donean most likely ninetyfours driver that you claim is a chum of yours will tell emhow are you goin to help it if they try to find him  i cant an thats a fact but i havent got to start the thing myself  what would you do if you should meet him right here this very minute  im fraid id thump him  fraid sam repeated sarcastically why you oughter pound his head off an then have him jugged  you see its jest like this fellers seth said in an apologetic tone as he looked around at his friends and acquaintances understanding full well that they disapproved of his leniency its jest like this if a feller gets to fightin on the street hes likely to be pulled in for it an then perhaps he has to go down to the island for ten days or so now you all know im tryin to work into the department an what kind of show would i stand if there was a record like that against me fellers who get up a name for fightin dont mount to very much cordin to what ive seen an thats why i said i was fraid i might thump jip you see whats done now will stand against me when im old enough to be a fireman an ive got to look out mighty careful for that now so fars puttin jip in jail goes i dont want anythin to do with it  i cant see how thats goin to give you a bad name some one of the throng cried  i reckon it couldnt but it might stand against jip when he grows up an if i should let sam take the case id be hurtin jip moren he did me so it wouldnt be fair  but you dont allow folks can go round settin fire to houses an tryin to burn other people up without havin to pay for it  course i dont an jip oughter get it hot for what hes done but i wont be the one to send him up the river  if thats the way seth feels bout it we havent got any right to kick dan suggested and sam barney cried sharply  i say we have jest cause seth is gettin so awful good on account of wantin to go into the department theres no reason why we should let jip collins sneak away after whats been done an ill take up the case on my own hook rather than see him wiggle out of it  have you got the feller yet what stole your money dan asked in a meaning tone whereat the remainder of the company set up a loud shout of derision much to the amateur detectives discomfort  if i havent thats no sign i cant i reckon i know enough bout the business to handle two cases at the same time if i want to an youll see if i dont pull jip collins over the coals before im a week older  then sam stalked away with the bearing of one who feels that he has been injured and the remainder of the party discussed the events of the previous night without further reference to the arrest of the evildoer  when the subject had been exhausted seth made inquiries concerning any bootblacks outfit which might be for sale and half an hour later he was once more the owner of a box and brushes  the fire has cost me seventy cents besides the breakfast we lost when the place was burned he said to dan and the latter replied mournfully  id have been willin to give a good deal moren that right out of my own pocket poor as trade has been than to lose the snuggest lodginplace in this town well never find anythin that will come up with that shed  cryin wont help out on it what weve got to do is to hunt up another shanty where we can bunk in without givin up too much money for after havin to buy a new outfit i cant afford to fool away good dollars payin for a bed at a reglar lodginhouse  youll never get anythin that will come up to the shanty jip collins set on fire dan replied sadly and as the realization of their loss came to him with redoubled force now that the time had arrived when they must search for new lodgings he gave way to anger against the boy who had wrought them so much mischief as if believing this would mend matters  seth waited patiently until his partner had indulged in such outburst several moments after which he said sagely  now look here dan scoldin wont fix things the least little bit an theres no sense in keepin on tellin bout how big a villain jip collins is what weve got to do is to hustle an in the long run well find that will pay bettern ravin do you know of any place where we can stop for a night or two till ive had time to look round more  if i did id taken it long ago instead of payin you fifteen cents a week for half of your quarters  well weve got to find one thats all there is to it now sposen instead of tryin to do any more business today we mosey right along about it  where you goin  i dont exactly know well kinder loaf round thats the way i found the carpentershop an if it turns out we dont see a place why itll be a case of puttin up the stuff for one nights lodgins  i aint sure as ive got money enough left to pay for a reglar bed  i reckon i can squeeze out whatll pay the bills if youre broke now come on  unconsciously seth led the way toward ninetyfours house not really being aware he was proceeding in that direction and after walking several blocks in silence dan asked almost sharply  are you countin on their lettin us hang round the enginehouse  course not the firemen cant do anythin like that you know we was mighty lucky to get a bed there last night an wouldnt had it except that wed been burned out  then what are you goin up this way for  theres jest as much chance round here as anywhere an of course id sooner live near ninetyfour cause i do a good deal of shinin for the men then agin i dont want to lose run of em for perhaps some day lish davisll give me a lift into the department  theres no use lookin here cause wed known if there was any place that would suit us  i aint so sure of that you see we wasnt lookin for one an now if we go along with our eyes open theres no tellin but what we may run  seth ceased speaking very suddenly for at that instant the clanging of gongs could be heard far up the street and dan exclaimed  that sounds like ninetyfour  course it is id know her if she was in the middle of a hundred an all of em comin straight for me  there was no longer a thought in the mind of either of the boys regarding the necessity of finding a home that night  under no ordinary circumstances would seth have allowed himself to be prevented from getting possible points and although dan did not share in the aspirations of his friend he was equally excited by the prospect of going to a fire  the two waited breathlessly an instant expecting ninetyfour would continue straight on toward them when from the opposite direction came the clatter of wheels and the booming notes of the gongs telling of the coming of a second engine and they knew that at some point midway the two engines would be turned at right angles with their present course  come this way it looks to me as though ninetyfour was slackenin up master bartlett cried as he darted forward and dan readily followed the advice for while he did not approve of his friends devotion to the fire department he understood full well that seth was thoroughly conversant with all such matters as might be learned by an outsider  there she goes an i wouldnt wonder if the alarm came from some of them big storage warehouses for ninetyfour is headin straight toward them  the first engine had swung sharply around to the left and the driver of the second was urging his horses forward at yet greater speed in the hope perhaps of getting first water when the two boys dashed up the street at their best pace for to seth at least there was but one engine and one point of attraction at any conflagration however extensive  while it is probable he could have picked up as many points from other companies it did not so appear to him and in his mind it was only from the crew of ninetyfour he could gather such information as was most desired  before they neared the station from which the alarm had been sent the throng on the sidewalks added to from nearly every house had so increased that it was only by taking to the street regardless of the danger to be apprehended from hosecarts hookandladder trucks patrolwagons or watertowers that the boys could make any satisfactory headway and because of their being thus hampered in their movements ninetyfours men had already begun their work when seth and dan arrived at a point outside the fire lines where they could see the machine  here a single policeman kept the crowd in check and seth whispered excitedly to his partner  nows our time if were anyways smart well get in before that copper can catch us wait till somebody tries to pass an then scoot dont stop if he yells cause he wont dare leave here to chase us  i thought lish davis said hed have his eye out sos you couldnt get into the fire lines  thats what he said  aint you fraid hell be mad if he finds you in there  he knows ive got to do this thing else ill never get posted on the business but of course if we should sneak in an he told us to march straight out agin id feel as though i oughter go we wont stand very near ninetyfour an then therell be less chance of his knowin were around  the opportunity which seth desired came a few seconds later  two gentlemen who were curious to see the workings of the fire department nearer at hand than was possible while they remained outside the lines approached the officer on duty with the idea that it was only necessary to bluster or threaten a little in order to pass him without difficulty and while they were alternately entreating and threatening seth gave the signal  stooping until their heads were beneath the rope the two boys darted up the street which was covered with a veritable network of hose and before the officer was fully aware of their intentions they were lost to his view amid the panting quivering monsters of steel and iron whose mission is to save rather than destroy  theres lish davis on the engine dan said speaking indistinctly because of his breath which came thick and fast it looks to me as if he has seen us  well keep over this way a bit where theres no danger of his comin watch our men try to get up that stairway aint they the dandies  the fire was as seth had first surmised in a storage warehouse and it appeared from the outside as if the entire second floor of the building was in a blaze  the men had battered in the doors only to be met by a mass of flames which seemed to roll in huge columns down the staircase to the new outlet which had thus been made and just as the boys arrived the brave fellows were momentarily beaten back by the scorching element until they stood on the first landing in plain sight of seth and dan  jerry walters and joe black were at the nozzle with ben dunton close in the rear and at the moment seth called his partners attention to the scene the captain of ninetyfour shouted encouragingly  now hit it up boys get in there get in get in  then it was the flames retreated momentarily and those who were doing such gallant battle advanced step by step up the stairs seemingly into the very midst of the fiery cloud until they were entirely hidden by the downpour of black smoke which came from the open doorway in volume sufficient to drive back even those on the sidewalk  while this desperate fight was in progress other men had raised a ladder and were prying open one of the iron shutters on the second floor in order to use more hose and yet trembling with apprehension for the safety of those friends who had last been seen in the very midst of the fiery element seth involuntarily glanced toward the remainder of the company on the outside while dan looked back to make certain lish davis was not preparing to drive them from their place of vantage  that which he saw reassured him so far as any immediate danger of such kind was to be feared for the driver of ninetyfour was unhitching his horses knowing from the general appearance of the blazing building that the company had a long task before them  at that instant a crashing rending noise as of an explosion sounded high above the din and one of the iron shutters which the men had been trying to force open was hurled from its fastenings and thrown outward into the street falling within half a dozen feet of where davis was busy with his horses  following it was a mighty rush of flame as if the interior was a seething mass of fire loud shouts of command rang out and then came even above all the din the clatter of a horses ironshod hoofs as he dashed madly away in affright involuntarily seth had followed with his eyes the flight of the shutter and unconscious of even having made a movement he sprang toward ninetyfour as if in the time of danger that was his post of duty  he saw the heavy mass of metal as it struck the pavement and instantly afterward was aware of what very few gave heed to because of the fact that all eyes were fixed upon the building from whence might naturally be expected another explosion  the nigh horse of the team one that had been in service only a few weeks leaped forward in frantic terror and by some strange mishap was dragging his driver behind him  at the moment seth had no thought of possible danger to himself his mind was upon lish daviss peril to the exclusion of everything else and almost involuntarily he sprang toward the maddened animal dan close at his heels  it was by accident rather than good judgment that he succeeded in gaining a hold of the bridle just above the bit swinging himself outward by aid of his elbow to avoid being struck by the beasts forefeet  his weight was not sufficient to bring the frightened animal to a standstill instantly but he succeeded in checking his speed so far that the engineer of ninetyfour had time to come to his assistance and between the two the runaway was stopped  a buckle on daviss coat had caught in one of the rings of the harness and this it was which held him prisoner after having been thrown from his feet by the animals sudden plunge  are you hurt seth asked anxiously still retaining his hold of the bridle and the driver replied grimly as he scrambled to his feet  a man is bound to get a few knocks after such a course of treatment but i reckon that all the harm which has been done is a little skin broken here and there do you know lad its a mighty dangerous thing to jump for a horse in that fashion  illustration seth catches the horse page 68  i caught him all right sir  yes that i know else i wouldnt be standing on my feet this minute but suppose you had missed your hold he would have had you under his feet in a jiffy  but he didnt so i cant see as that counts very much but all the same i was willin to take the chances  lish davis having assured himself that he had spoken correctly so far as personal injuries were concerned took charge of the horse the engineer went back to his post and seth fearing lest he should be driven outside the line was making his way toward the building once more with dan by his side when the driver shouted  come back here you young rattlebrain how did you get inside the lines  crept under the rope when the copper wasnt lookin it aint any very hard job to do that  dont you know youre liable to be arrested for doing anything of that sort  well we had to take the chances you see cause it wouldnt do to miss a fire like this seth replied half apologetically and dan cried in his shrill tone  its mighty lucky for you mr davis that he did sneak inside this once  i aint likely to forget that you rapscallion but it has got nothing to do with you lads being where you dont belong and thats right about here  please dont send us away seth cried imploringly well keep out of sight so the chief wont see us an nobody will know where we are  ill take precious good care you cant get into more mischief come over here both of you an stick right by ninetyfour till i give the word to leave dont you dare to so much as move till the engine does an if theres any more mishaps steer clear of them instead of doing your level best to run into trouble are you hearing what im saying  yes sir seth replied meekly and then the boys obeyed readily for mr davis had stationed them in the very place above all others where they could see everything which occurred and dan said in a tone of satisfaction  it was a mighty good thing your stoppin that horse you never had a better chance to see a fire than this is an wed better hold on to it precious close  thats a fact but i aint gettin so many points as i might if we walked round  youd better be satisfied with whats a soft snap even if you dont get points master roberts replied grimly and then he gave himself up to the pleasure of watching the battle between the firemen and the elements for a third alarm had been rung in and the number of men at work round about was more than either he or seth had ever seen engaged at any one time before  the hours passed to these two small but decidedly interested spectators as if they were composed of no more than one quarter the usual number of minutes and when night came the conflagration was subdued but not extinguished  ninetyfour had gotten first water and consequently would be the last to leave the scene  here and there the companies dismissed from this particular duty were taking up their hose or already driving away in order to be ready for the next alarm  the throng of spectators just outside the lines had diminished in number until no more than an hundred remained and lish davis came up with the appearance of one who has already done his full duty  hello amateur still here eh  you told us to stay sir  i didnt allow that youd hold on to go out with us were like to be here till well towards morning an if you lads have got the price of a bed about your clothes youd better be leaving if you havent ill ante up something to hire one  weve got the money sir seth replied but seein s we belong to ninetyfour jest now why cant we stay till she pulls out  please yourself amateur please yourself was the grim reply and as the driver turned away he muttered if that bloomin little duffer dont get into the department it wont be lish daviss fault an that goes for a fact     chapter v  tardy repentance   seth was as happy and proud as a boy well could be  never before had he dared to remain very long near any particular engine lest some of the firemen should take it upon themselves to send him outside the lines consequently all his points had been gathered as he moved from place to place  now however he was in a certain sense attached to ninetyfour and each member of the company had some kindly word with which to greet him for it had become known to all that if the amateur did not actually save lish daviss life he had assisted in preventing that gentleman from receiving severe injury  dan was enjoying the advantages thus arising from his partners popularity which was quite sufficient for him since not aspiring to become a fireman he thought only of the present moment and the privilege of remaining by the engine as if he were really a member of the department was some thing of which he could boast in the future among his comrades  it is true there was little of interest to be seen after the fire was apparently extinguished when the men had nothing more to do than remain on the lookout for any smoldering embers which might be fanned into a blaze but seths interest was almost as great as when the flames were fiercest  shortly after sunset hot coffee and sandwiches were served to the weary firemen and master bartlett believed he had taken a long stride toward the goal he had set himself when the captain shouted  come here you two kids and get your rations while doing duty with ninetyfour youre entitled to all thats going  dan ran forward eagerly intent only on getting his share of the food for he was very hungry but seth walked slowly in order to prolong the pleasure of obeying the captains command and could almost fancy he was wearing the citys uniform  he stood by lish daviss side when the lunch was passed around and that gentleman said grimly as seth blew on the steaming coffee to cool it  you mustnt do that if you ever count on being a fireman amateur  why not and seth looked up in surprise  because you must get used to hot things supposing you could drink that while it was boiling dont you reckon youd stand the heat from a blaze better and longer than them who need to have it mighty nigh cold  this seemed reasonable to seth and without stopping to further consider the matter he instantly raised the cup to his lips drinking the hot liquid until the pain was so great as to bring tears to his eyes  then he lowered the cup slowly striving manfully to repress any sign of suffering and the driver gazed at him admiringly  that kid has got sand eh davis said half interrogatively as he turned toward jerry walters and the latter replied  he showed it when he jumped for the horse i believe if you should tell him to roll over on the embers in that ere cellar hed do it  i guess youre right jerry here amateur dont try to drink any more of that coffee till it cools a bit i was only stuffing you when i said youd stand a better show of being a fireman if you could scald your throat without feeling it  this evidence of solicitude for his welfare was sufficient reward for all seth had suffered and he glanced at dan as if to make certain that young gentleman was fully aware of the great honor which was being bestowed upon his partner  dan had no eyes except for the rapidly decreasing store of sandwiches and no thought save as to how he might get his full share without appearing absolutely greedy therefore all this byplay had passed while he remained in ignorance of it  once his hunger was appeased dan curled himself up on a bale of halfburned merchandise near at hand and immediately fell asleep  for him this association with ninetyfours men was nothing of more importance than the gaining of a meal and so much of a nights lodging as might be possible but to seth it was as if the gates guarding the approach to his desires had been left ajar permitting him to obtain a glimpse of that goal he so ardently longed to reach and he patrolled the ruins of the building as if upon his shoulders rested all the responsibility of making certain the fire had been wholly extinguished  not until fully an hour after midnight was the welcome word given for ninetyfour to pull out and seth awakened his partner lest he should be in the way of the tired men  get a move on you he shouted in dans ear as he shook him roughly theres nothin more to be done here an we dont want to act like as if we was hangin round when the machine goes into her quarters  why dont you kind er loaf here till they have hitched up an perhaps well get another chance to stay in the enginehouse dan asked sleepily  because id be ashamed to do anythin like that get up sos we can be off before they pull out  jerry walters had overheard this brief conversation although neither of the boys was aware of the fact and he asked as the two were making their way out through and over the debris into the darkness  where are you kids going  i reckon its time we was home seth replied giving his partner a warning shake lest he should say that which would seem to indicate that they were sadly in need of a bed  what do you call home now the carpentershop has gone up in smoke  we havent hired any house yet but weve got our eye on one up in fifth avenoo an if the price aint moren weve got in our pockets i reckon well take it  where are you counting on sleeping tonight  most anywhere it dont go hard with dan an me to find a place seth replied with an assumption of carelessness and again shaking his partner to remind him that there must be no approach to begging  look here amateur i dont reckon you know where youre going to sleep  well turn in somewhere that part of it will be all right so long  hold on here you kid and jerry walters spoke in a tone which sounded unusually stern have you been with ninetyfours crew at this ere fire or not  i reckon we have seth replied with a laugh  then well take care you have a roof over your heads for the balance of this night wait till lish davis shows up and see what he has to say about letting the kid who pulled him out of a big hole go off to bunk in the streets come back i say till the driver gets here  we aint begging for a bed mr walters seth said decidedly as he obeyed the command an if we turn anybody out as we did last night  if you was begging a bed i reckon you wouldnt get it from me but since youre so mighty independent im just contrary enough to see that you have one i reckon it wont strain the rules very hard if you sleep on the straw an thats about the best youll get up at the house tonight unless another alarm is sent in  at this moment lish davis returned with the horses and jerry walters held a short whispered conversation with him at the conclusion of which the latter said gruffly  amateur go on with your partner up to the housetheres no need of your ridingan wait there till i come we aint going to have any sulking jest because weve taken it into our heads to see that you get some sleep twixt now and morning  we aint sulkin mr davis seth made haste to say an well go wherever you say but i dont want you to think we cant find a lodginplace  get on with you the driver roared as if in a fury of passion and when the boys obeyed he said in a low tone to jerry walters  the amateur has got a good bit of spirit in him and thats what i like to see he shall come into the department eh  id like to see him there for sure and hope youll be able to work it  i dont know as a firemans life counts much to the city but if it does something oughter be done for the amateur cause if it hadnt been for him thered be one driver short in the department by this time  dan was in high glee at the prospect of spending another night in the enginehouse and said in a tone of satisfaction as the two made their way rapidly up the street  this is great luck eh  yes though i almost wish we was to shirk for ourselves  whats makin you so foolish all of a sudden dont you think a bed on the straw in ninetyfours house is bettern bunkin in anywhere or perhaps walkin the streets for the rest of the night  of course it is but im fraid the men will think we hung round for jest such a chance  after your stoppin that hoss in time to save lish davis from gettin all mashed up i dont reckon they can accuse you of coaxin for a bed  seth made no reply to this remark  he appreciated the invitation which had been given even more highly than did dan yet feared it might appear to some of the company as if he should have gone away when the fire was gotten under control and that by waiting when there was really nothing to be seen he had laid himself open to the possible charge of hangin round  if dan roberts expected seth would be petted and praised because of having rendered such a signal service to the driver of ninetyfour he was disappointed  the two boys arrived at the house a few moments in advance of the engine and seth at once set about trying to make himself useful in the work of cleaning up with the result that he rendered no slight assistance to the weary men but yet not one of them commented upon the fact or even so much as thanked him  after the horses were cared for lish davis went to where seth was at work and said gruffly as if offended  ive shaken some straw out for you kids an when youre through with that job turn in dont get to skylarkin but keep quiet  then the driver went upstairs  dan who was not in favor of working save when it might be absolutely necessary crept slyly to the straw and lay down but seth continued at his selfimposed task and gained much pleasure thereby for the men treated the matter as if it was proper he should perform his share of the labor which made it seem very much as if he was in fact a member of the company  not until fully an hour after the engine had arrived at quarters did seth turn in and then he was so weary that his eyes closed in slumber almost as soon as he was stretched at full length on the straw  the last thought in his mind was a pleasing one none of the company had thanked him for assisting in the work and this was exactly as he would have had it  it seemed to the boys as if they had no more than fallen asleep although as a matter of fact they had both been in dreamland fully two hours when the clanging of the gong the thud of horses feet on the floor and the rapid movements of the men aroused them  seth had longed for and dreamed of just such an opportunity as this  to go out with ninetyfour from quarters was very near to being a member of the department and he made all haste to station himself by the big doors ready to follow the engine  get out of there amateur mr davis shouted as he swung himself into the drivers seat one fire in a night is enough for you lay down an sleep then youll be in better trim to help with the cleanup when we get back  under no circumstances would seth have ventured to remonstrate against any order lish davis might give and even had he been disposed to do so there was not time  the driver had hardly ceased speaking before the doors were swung open and ninetyfour was drawn out with a rush and a clatter that sounded like sweetest music in seths ears  lish kind er took the wind out of your sails that time amateur the housewatchman said with a smile as he closed the heavy doors aint one fire in twentyfour hours enough for you  i did so want to go out once with ninetyfour an it seems too bad to miss this chance for im not likely to get another  why not  cause i cant expect to sleep here very often an theres no show of my happenin round at the very minute an alarm comes in  dont be so certain about that youll go out with them yet or im mightily mistaken youd better take pattern by your partner and get what sleep you can thats a rule we in the department have and it comes handy at times  dan had leaped from the straw when the alarm first sounded but instead of making any attempt to follow the engine crept back again with a smile of content  it is not probable he would have deprived himself of sleep even if permission had been given for him to ride on the engine  seth lay down by dans side and despite his disappointment was soon slumbering peacefully but only for half an hour because at the end of that time he was awakened once more by the noisy return of ninetyfour  the alarm had been sent in for a small blaze in one room of an apartment house and was extinguished almost immediately by the company whose quarters were nearest the signal station therefore ninetyfours men had no labor to perform  however it became necessary to wash down make ready for a new fire in the furnace of the engine roll ninetyfour and her tender to their respective places on the floor adjust the harness start the clock once more for it had been stopped by the weight set free when the first stroke of the alarm rang out and replace the weight which fastened the horses in their stalls  in a portion of this work seth assisted while dan remained apparently asleep on the straw and when the captain had sent in to headquarters the threefours followed by ninetyfours number thus telling that she was again ready for duty lish davis said to the amateur  you didnt miss much that time eh  i missed going out with the company sir  i dont allow that cuts any very great figger for therell be many another chance when youre in better trim than you were this night  anyway ive helped wash up twice an that counts for something cause im just so much ahead on points  take care you dont stick your nose too near a fire some time and get one point too many the driver said with a smile as he ascended the stairs wearily and seth called after him  id rather it would be that way mr davis than never know anythin about the business  youll do amateur youll do if youre driven with a tight curb an thats what i count on seein that you have  then seth lay down on the straw once more and slept soundly during the two hours which followed  it was seven oclock in the morning when he finally arose and although he would have been pleased to remain there a while longer the boy knew it was time to begin his days work  dan grumbled not a little because seth insisted he should turn out declaring he had hardly slept a wink but understanding he would not be permitted to remain there very many moments longer now the men were already astir he arose to his feet and lounged lazily around until seth had polished the boots of those members of the company who called upon him for such service  lish davis came downstairs just as seth his labor finished was on the point of leaving the building and he stopped the boy by asking in a friendly tone  where are you off to now amateur  out chasin nickels its time we hustled if we expect to find lodgins between now an night  flash up here about three oclock this afternoon and if i aint in wait for me  all right sir  then seth went out of doors followed by dan and when they were on the sidewalk master roberts asked curiously  what do you spose hes got on hand for you at three oclock  most likely he dont want his boots shined till then  it must be somethin moren that dan replied sagely  of course it aint what else could he want of me  perhaps hes goin to give you somethin for what you did last night  ill feel awful bad if he does  id like to know why  cause then it would seem all the more as if i was really an outsider he wouldnt give jerry walters anythin for helpin him out of a scrape  i dont see asjimminey but theres jip collins aint he got the nerve to be snoopin round here say we can nab him easy as a wink if you say the word  i dont want to have him arrested anything like that wouldnt bring back our lodgins  to the great surprise of the boys jip collins appeared relieved rather than frightened at seeing them and instead of running away advanced rapidly almost eagerly  look here seth im mighty sorry i set fire to your place the other night an if theres any way to square it ill hump myself the best i know how he cried while yet some distance away  its a big pity you wasnt took in this style before you touched her off for then seth and me wouldnt be huntin a place to sleep dan said sternly before his partner could speak  i know that jip wailed and seth fancied there was a ring of real sorrow in his tones i must have been crazy to do it an after the match was dropped in the shavings i hoped they wouldnt catch fire then i sent in the alarm cause the light kept growin brighter an nobody else saw it  but you touched her off all the same and it could readily be seen that dans anger was getting the best of him  yes i did an of course you can have me sent up the river for it but what good will that do you say seth wont you let me square it somehow  its all over now jip an the only way to fix things is by keepin mighty straight after this i dont want to send you up the river nor i wont but if the cops get to know who did it im afraid theyll run you in without tryin to see whether i want it done or not  i know all that seth but i dont believe ill get jugged if sam barney keeps quiet he says hes taken up the case an is goin to push it straight through sos to show how good a detective he can be when theres a chance to spread hisself  how do you know that dan asked suspiciously  bill dean told me so i met him up to the erie basin where ive been hidin  why didnt you stay there  i did till i was most starved an had to come out to earn some money sos to buy grub bill was round there last night lookin for a feller what runs on a canalboat an jest the same as tumbled over me  youd stood as good a show of earnin money over in brooklyn or jersey city as here an then there wouldnt be so much danger of runnin across anybody who knew you  im goin to williamsburg but wanted to talk with you fellers first so come up here where i could see if you was in ninetyfours house  what are you countin on doin right now seth asked in a friendly tone  find joe carter an try to get the ten cents he owes me sos ill have somethin to buy the first lot of papers with  joes gone to baltimore to live went off last night dan said promptly and an expression of disappointment came over jips face  is he the only feller who owes you anythin seth asked  yes an i reckon hes the only one who would try to give me a lift after what ive done he was  wheres them swell brooklyn chums of yours dan interrupted  they went dead back on me after i started the fire an bill dean says they told sam barney all about it if sam would only let up on me id show that i could be as square as any of the fellers  i dont reckon youll ever do that dan cried angrily and seth added soothingly  ill see sam today an do all i can to make him drop the case cause it dont seem to me hes got any right to take it up unless i say the word now im goin to lend you fifteen cents jip an you neednt worry bout payin it back for quite a spell theres plenty of places to sell papers in where the fellers dont know you an after a while you can come round city hall again  youre goin to lend me money after what i did jip cried in astonishment not unmixed with fear for he failed to understand why the boy he had tried to injure should be so generous i counted on your thumpin me an id stood still to let you do it  if seth bartlett has gone crazy theres no reason why i shouldnt serve you out jip collins and dan advanced threateningly i aint sich a chump as to pay a feller for tryin to burn me to death an im goin to knock your two eyes into one stead of throwin away good money on a duffer like you  jip made no effort to defend himself and dan had raised his hand to strike the first blow when seth stepped in front of him  dont do anythin like that dan jip is sorry an theres nothin more he can do or say  theres a good deal more i can do and by this time master roberts had worked himself into a towering passion  go away jip seth cried clasping dan by the body in such a manner as to pin the boys arms to his side clear out an after he gets over his mad a little hell come round all right  it would only be servin me in decent shape if he should jest about knock my head off jip replied penitently making no move toward seeking safety in flight  i wont have dan fightin in the streets an theres no reason now why you should be thumped seth cried speaking indistinctly because of his efforts to hold master roberts in check get away as quick as you can  ill go if you say the word though i aint certain but hed better do what hes tryin for youre a jim dandy seth bartlett an ill square everythin with you some day im sleepin in a boat up at the erie basin an i wish youd come there to see me id like to let you know how sorry i am for what i did  dan was making the most strenuous efforts to free himself from seths grasp and the latter held him captive only by the greatest exertion  dont hang round here any longer jip get away quick an ill see you again some time  will you come up to the basin  yes yes seth replied hurriedly hardly understanding the promise he made because of his anxiety to prevent a fight and jip started off rapidly crying as he ran  youre a dandy seth bartlett an ill pay you off for this as true as i live  not until jip was two blocks or more away did seth release his hold and turn to face dan in his wrath     chapter vi  an obstinate detective   dan was in a fine temper when seth finally released his hold and after understanding that it would be useless to pursue the fugitive he turned upon his partner savagely  a nice kind of a chump you are let a feller burn your house down an then pay him fifteen cents for doin it after that when i make up my mind to give him the dose he needs you turn against me to help him i spose thats what you call bein a chum of mine  thats exactly what it is dan seth replied soothingly after youve cooled off a bit youll be glad i didnt let you pitch into a feller who wouldnt raise his hands  he didnt cause he dont dare  if a feller had any spunk about him he would dare to do all he could while somebody else was thumpin him jip feels bad for what he did to us an would stand still to let you pound him but it couldnt have done you any good dan you dont want to get the name of bein a bruiser  id be willin to take most any kind of a name rathern let jip collins off without so much as turnin a hair on his head  thats the way you feel jest now cause youre off your base but wait a couple of hours an then youll talk different  i wont if i live to be twice as grayheaded as ever methuselah was for its a downright shame to let him go with money in his pockets after tryin to kill us  he was hungry  it would do him solid good to starve to death  he turned in the alarm an if he hadnt done that wed been burned to death  i notice he didnt do it till the fire got a mighty good start an then i reckon it was only cause he grew scared if youre so fraid of gettin your name up for fightin you might er stood still and let me have a whack at him i dont see how that could have hindered your slippin into the department i wouldnt be quite so mad if you hadnt given him the money  he was hungry dan an id do that much for the biggest duffer in the town  dan made no reply to this remark but with his hands plunged deep in his pockets walked swiftly away in the direction of city hall as if his one desire was to be free from his partner  seth was not minded to let him go while in a temper but at the same time he knew full well that it would be useless to attempt to stop him with words therefore he followed without further remark biding his time until the proper moment should come when the soft answer could be given  without looking to the right or the left dan continued on much as if bent on running away from his partner until ten minutes had elapsed when he halted suddenly wheeled about and addressed seth with his usual friendly manner  theres sam barney over by that alley  glancing in the direction indicated by dans outstretched finger seth saw the wouldbe detective moving cautiously along looking stealthily around and otherwise behaving as if he had suddenly taken leave of his senses  do you spose hes countin on findin jip collins in that fool way  i reckon he thinks hes doin the detective act in great shape dan replied with a laugh all traces of illhumor having vanished he says a feller in his line of business has to keep his eyes open every minute an sneakin along in that style is what he most likely calls bein wide awake  sam had arrived at the corner of the alley and instead of walking boldly in to make a search was standing where he might be partially screened by the building craning his head forward for a single glance and then drawing it back suddenly repeating these movements about every thirty seconds with great regularity  dan gave full rein to his mirth for this method of playing the detective seemed to him very comical but seth checked him whenever his laughter became boisterous  if he sees us pokin fun at him we wont be able to make any kind of a trade an i dont want to stir the feller up till things are fixed  what things  i want him to promise that he wont go prowlin round the town after jip collins  see here seth are you countin on keepin that racket up  if you mean am i goin to give jip a lift by tryin to keep that imitation detective quiet ill say yes we both have got good reason to be mighty ugly because he burned us out but its all over now an hes sorry lets give him one more showyou an ian if he goes wrong after this i wont say a word against your doin whatever you like  the lines on dans face hardened as if he was determined nothing should turn him from his purpose of punishing jip in such manner as he believed the latters misdemeanors warranted but after one glance at his partner the anger vanished  go ahead seth an fix it up to suit you ill do what i can this time even if it does rub against the grain it aint because im feelin sorry for jip but jest to please you  so long as you do what i ask it dont make very much difference whether its for jip or me an you wont be sorry old man now well tackle sam an see if we can make him behave himself for a spell  i reckon youll find that a mighty hard job hes stuck on the detective business as bad as you are on gettin into the department an this is the kind of a case he dont get a whack at very often i spose he thinks that catchin jip would put him way up on the top notch  seth did not spend any time arguing the matter with his partner but called loudly to the wouldbe detective  hi sam come over here a minute  master barney pretended not to have heard the summons although the words rang out clear and distinct above the noises of the street but continued his grotesque manner of reconnoitering the alley and again seth shouted  come over here sam theres no need of your bobbin round in that style cause nobody is in the alley except a couple of little kids who wouldnt be very much frightened if you walked right up on em  this time sam turned affected to be greatly surprised at seeing these acquaintances and then crossed the street apparently in an illtemper  dont you know any bettern to break up what a fellers fixin he asked angrily as he stood before seth and dan i was doin some mighty fine work an youve spoiled it all by yellin so loud now the folks in there know im round an wont so much as show theirselves  do you reckon they believe youre a detective dan asked trying in vain to check his mirth  of course i do sam replied hotly folks have heard of me before this an it stands me in hand to keep out of sight all i can  who did you think was in the alley seth asked  im lookin for moren one in this town an counted on finishin up two or three little jobs in the detective line before i lighted out to nab jip collins  do you know where he is and seth appeared disturbed  what kind of a detective do you allow i am if i dont know that ive got it all figgered out an most likely ill take a spin over to philadelphy tonight if i do youll see him in court tomorrow mornin  oh has he gone over there dan asked with a great show of interest pursing his mouth into shape for whistling to prevent an outburst of laughter  thats about the size of it but he neednt think he can run away from me  look here sam and now seth spoke in a serious tone jip didnt try to hurt anybody but dan an me an we dont want you to bother him were willin to give him a fair show cause hell take a big turn after this  i cant help what you want the detective replied obstinately when i know that a feller has been burnin up houses its my business to run him in an im goin to do it  what is it to you so long as were satisfied dan asked sharply  see here aint i a detective  i aint so certain of that master roberts cried promptly  i guess other people know it if you dont cause ive had moren one case in this town now so long as that is my business im bound to take up anythin i hear about an  other detectives dont do that they wait till the chief sends em out or somebody hires em  dans reply staggered sam for an instant but he soon bethought himself of what seemed to be the proper answer and replied  that would be all right if i was on the force but so long as i aint it stands me in hand to work my way along sames seths tryin to do in the fire department if i can catch jip collins and send him up the river itll be a big feather in my cap  would you be willin to send a feller to jail sos you might get ahead in the business seth asked reproachfully  course i would  aint there anythin we can do to stop you from tryin to run jip down  you might talk till you was black in the face an then i wouldnt let up  understanding that it was useless to hold any further converse with this obstinate detective in the hope of turning him from his purpose seth motioned to dan and set off downtown without a word to sam by way of adieu  ill be in philadelphy tonight an tomorrow mornin jip collins will be in the lockup master barney shouted vindictively and glancing back dan saw him approaching the alley once more with cautious steps as if it were beneath his dignity as an officer of the law to move in any other fashion  itll be all right if he goes to philadelphy dan said sagely but im mightily afraid he wont get money enough to buy a ticket on the cars  i dont believe he ever thought of goin there till we talked with him an then only said it to let us believe he knew where jip was sam aint any kind of a detective but he can make a lot of trouble for jip  seth was disturbed in mind because of the possibilities that master barney would work mischief for jip collins and dan shared in such forebodings although in a much less degree  the two were walking on in silence each trying to devise some plan whereby it would be possible to divert the amateur detective from his purpose when they suddenly came face to face with bill dean  hello where are you fellers goin  to work  kinder late this mornin eh  yes but well make up for it by pluggin in all the harder after we begin  bill hesitated an instant as if hardly daring to say that which was in his mind and then asked in a meaning tone  seen anybody in particlar this mornin  yes we saw jip an then run across sam barney seth replied  i suppose sam still holds to it that hell pull jip in  yes an he counted on findin him in philadelphy cordin to his talk  look here seth youve got good reason to make it hot for jip after all hes  i wouldnt do a thing to hurt him an stand ready to give him a lift if he needs it  youre straight as a die seth bartlett an ill bet you wont be sorry for lettin up on him for im thinkin jip will run different after this  i hope so but he aint out of the woods till somebody sets down on sam barney weve been tryin to make him stop but he wont cause he thinks itll give him a big name if he arrests jip hes up by sweeneys alley bobbin round like a jumpinjack  say dan cried as a sudden and what seemed like a happy thought came into his mind sam says jip is in philadelphy now sposen all hands chipped in enough to buy a ticket for him to go there hed never get back cause he dont earn a dollar in a month an jip wouldnt be bothered  this plan appealed strongly to both seth and dan and the latter asked as to the probable cost of such a scheme  this was a question neither of the boys could answer and after some thought master dean agreed to make the necessary inquiries without delay  dan an me will ante up a nickel apiece to get rid of him an in case you dont have to pay too much the other fellers who wouldnt want to see jip sent to jail oughter put in the balance  master dean was quite as eager to aid jip as was seth and without waiting to discuss the matter further started off on his errand of mercy  then the partners were at liberty to set about the work of the day but it was now so late that they could not expect to earn very much money  well come out mighty slim for supper im thinkin dan said grimly youve got to knock off in time to meet lish davis at three oclock an the trade in evenin papers wont be much moren begun by then  you neednt go up with me if you dont want toi can meet you after the days work is over  but i do want to go i wouldnt miss knowin what the driver has got to say not if i went without supper an breakfast too  i could tell you all about it  yes but i want to hear for myself dan replied decidedly and thus the matter was concluded  seth worked industriously once he was in that section of the city where certain rights he claimed were respected by his brother artisans and although the majority of the fraternity were fully occupied in discussing the question of what sam barney might succeed in doing he refused to spend any idle time however much interest he felt in the matter  dan also attended strictly to business regardless of the many temptations to remain idle and at two oclock in the afternoon the partners had earned as much as would suffice to provide them with food during at least two days but the question of lodgings yet remained to be settled  well go up now to see what mr davis wants an then we must hustle for lodgins therell be no more hangin round ninetyfours house after dark cause it looks too much as if we was beggin seth said as he met dan who reported that it wouldnt pay to buy another stock of papers that day  master roberts made no reply to this remark  he secretly hoped that it might be possible for them to sleep in the enginehouse one more night at least and believed seth was foolishly sensitive about the matter  according to his views on the subject there was no good reason why they should not go even so far as to ask the firemen for a shelter more particularly since they appeared to be so well disposed toward seth  the two boys arrived in the vicinity of the enginehouse ten minutes before the time set and seth insisted that they should not present themselves until the hour named consequently both lounged around near by until the clock struck three when they marched boldly up to the open door  the driver was on the lower floor as if awaiting their arrival and greeted seth in a manner both familiar and kind  so youve come have you amateur i was beginning to think youd struck a business rush and i shouldnt see you before tomorrow  you said we was to come at three oclock so i waited round till then  afraid to get here ahead of time eh  i thought it was best to do as you told us though weve been loafin outside for ten minutes  mr davis chuckled audibly as if in the statement was something very comical and not until after several seconds had elapsed did he speak when it was to ask  well what have you two kids done about finding a place where you can sleep  were goin to hustle lively after we leave here we had to earn a little money first an it was pretty late when we got downtown so we couldnt do any huntin but you can make certain some place will flash up before dark  i wouldnt wonder if it did amateur i wouldnt wonder if it did what made you late in getting downtown i thought you left here earlier than usual  so we did sir but we met jip collins an  the kid who started the fire in the lumberyard  yes sir an hes mighty sorry for what he did  then seth repeated what had been said by the repentant boy and gave a detailed account of the interview with sam barney all of which appeared wonderfully amusing not only to lish davis but to all the men on the floor  and are you allowing to adopt this ere kid who is setting himself up as a firebug the driver asked when seth had concluded the story  id like to give him one more show for i dont believe hell go wrong again an if we can get sam barney so far away that he cant come back it may be done  but what about us were bound to give up all such information as we may happen to run across and its a serious matter to keep a close tongue on anything of that kind  have you got to get jip arrested seth asked in alarm  its our duty and i aint so certain that hes reformed  but you never can know till hes been given a chance an it would be mighty tough if he had to have it put down against him when he grows up that hes been in jail  i grant you all that amateur yet the law says man or boy must pay the penalty for arson and it wouldnt be fair to make an exception in his case  what do you mean by arson  thats the name given to the crime of setting fires and when the trick is played in the night in a building where people are living it costs the criminal a good many years of his life  lish davis was speaking very seriously now and seth literally trembled with apprehension for jip  aint there anything i can do to help the poor feller out of the scrape he asked in a tone which told that the tears were very near his eyelids  thats what i cant say right on the spur of the minute but ill think the matter over and it may be well see a way out if youre dead sure he wont try any more such games  i dont believe he will cause hes feelin mighty bad an promises to be straight after this  ive thought all along that he oughter be sent up for startin the fire dan said with an air of exceeding wisdom but seth has been makin such a row about givin him another chance that i had to hold my tongue  i wouldnt be surprised if the amateur was nearer in the right than you are daniel though the officers of the law may look at the matter in a different light however the young reprobate hasnt been caught yet even if that keeneyed detective of yours is on his track and well drop the subject for a spell what i wanted to see the amateur about was lodgings  dans eyes sparkled for he felt certain they were to be given quarters in the enginehouse and seth looked really distressed  whats the matter lish davis asked in surprise as he noted the expression on the boys face it dont seem to strike you right because im thinking of where youll find a shelter  im fraid itll seem like as if dan an i were beggin for a bed we can find one after a spell an it wouldnt be any new thing if we knocked around the streets a few nights  now dont distress yourself on the score of begging the driver said with a hearty laugh ive come to know how thinskinned you are on that point and aint counting on giving either of you the value of a pin but it so happens that a friend of mine lives in the next block and hes got a room in his attic that hes just dying to let i was telling him about you kids and hell make what i call a fair trade  do you mean that were to hire a reglar room seth asked in surprise  why not if it comes cheap enough now this ere place im speaking of aint very swell and i dont allow he could let it to any but boys like you hell give a lease of it with bed and such furniture thrown in as his wife can scare up for fifty cents a week by blacking ben duntons and my boots five mornings a week youll have the price earned and itll pay a heap better than skinning round the streets likely to be moved on by a policeman a dozen times twixt sunset and sunrise  seth looked suspiciously at lish davis  the possibility of hiring a reglar room at such a low price had never before entered his mind and he feared there might be something in regard to the transaction which was being kept a secret from him  now then amateur what are you staring at do you think id give you any fairy story about the place youd better have a look at it before thinking its a very big bargain and the driver leaned back in his chair laughing heartily although seth could not understand what had so excited his mirth  well be mighty glad to get lodgins at that price dan said promptly and mr davis handed him a card on the back of which was written an address saying as he did so  go to that place and ask to see the room lish davis was talking about if it suits you take it and if it dont theres been no great harm done  youre mighty good to think of us in this way seth said feeling almost ashamed because of his previous mistrust  yes i reckon i am but well hope it dont spoil me and again the driver gave way to his mirth     chapter vii  new lodgings   dan was so eager to see the new lodgings that he could not wait with any degree of patience until seth had fully satisfied himself regarding certain matters connected with the leasing of them but insisted on setting out at once and his partner felt obliged to accompany him  arriving at the address given them by lish davis they found affairs exactly as he had stated  the room which had been offered at such a low rental was in the attic of an oldfashioned pitchroof house and although it was not such an apartment as could readily have been let to adults to the boys it appeared as the acme of comfort and even luxury  mrs hanson the mistress of the dwelling had provided a fairly good bed for the lodgers and the clothing on it looked so restinviting that dan declared that it was hard to resist the temptation to turn in at once  there were two chairs a rude stand on which were a waterpitcher and a basin a small mirror and an old table  the window boasted of a curtain but the floor was carpetless save for two wellworn rugs  dan fearing lest seth might refuse to hire this very swell apartment because of the suspicion that some of ninetyfours men had agreed to pay a certain portion of the rental in order that it might be offered at an exceedingly low price promptly announced his willingness to take the room and when this had been done it seemed to master bartlett as if he was in duty bound to ratify the bargain  well pay in advance he said as he counted out the required amount thereby reducing his cash account to an exceedingly small margin  theres no need of your doing anything like that mrs hanson replied kindly mr davis says hell guarantee that the rent is paid promptly and that should be enough for me without taking money before it is due  mr davis is mighty good but theres no reason why he should back a couple of boys who are able to pay their own way the rent is so cheap i was fraid hed been puttin up money on our account sos we could afford to hire it  he said you were mighty independent and i guess hes right but you neednt be afraid of getting any more than you pay for this room couldnt be let to many people and those who would be willing to live in such a place we would not want in the house except in a case like yours where a friend of ours says everything is as it should be mr davis is a very nice man  you can jest bet he is seth replied emphatically hes been mighty good to me  then having counted the money and promised to give a receipt in due form for the same mrs hanson left her new lodgers and dan cried when they were alone  say seth this kinder knocks the spots out er baxters shed eh it aint costin me but ten cents a week moren the other place did an that bed is worth three times them figgers talk bout fifteencent lodgins why the best i ever saw wasnt a marker alongside of this  its fine an no mistake but weve got to put up twentyfive cents every week for it  thatll be all right i owe you a quarter for this weeks rent an ill pay it tomorrow or next day ive got enough in my pocket now but kinder reckoned on havin a swell layout tonight for a celebration hold on here an ill go after some grub  do you spose we oughter thank mr davis now for findin the room for us  itll do jest as well in the mornin an youre so fraid of hangin round the enginehouse that it dont seem as if youd better go there for nothin else but to tell him what we think of the place  seth would have been pleased could he have told ninetyfours driver what he thought of the new quarters but dans suggestion as to hangin round was sufficient to prevent him from venturing out  then he tried to dissuade dan from squandering his money on a feast arguing that it would be wiser to keep what he had lest there should be a sudden lull in business but master roberts refused to listen  unless youre fraid to trust me for my share of the rent im goin to spread myself tonight its too bad we hadnt known bout this before we come uptown for then we might er knocked the eyes out er some of the fellers by showin it to em  i dont believe wed better have too much company or miss hanson will make a kick it aint likely shes willin to have a crowd of fellers rushin in and out for fifty cents a week  i spose thats so but all the same id like to have the gang see how were fixed  then master roberts went out to make the purchases and seth was left alone to familiarize himself with his seemingly luxurious surroundings  fully half an hour elapsed before dan returned and then he was accompanied by master dean  i found bill hangin round ninetyfours house lookin for you an thought the best thing i could do was to bring him right up here dan said as he ostentatiously placed half a dozen small packages on the table  aint you fellers slingin a terrible lot of style bill asked as he gazed around him it strikes me that business must be boomin if you can afford all this  itll only cost twentyfive cents a week for each one of us seth replied as if thinking something in the way of an apology was necessary  what and master dean was so thoroughly astonished as to be unable to speak for several seconds then he cried eagerly say you dont want to take another feller in i spose id like to get sich a snap as this  i dont know as miss hanson would want to take another lodger you might ask her though after weve been here a spell  why not have it settled now  it seems to me as if youd better hold off for a while till she sees how we flash up cordin to what she said i dont believe wed got in here if it hadnt been for mr davis  id like to come mighty well bill said longingly and then his attention was attracted to dans movements  master roberts was busily engaged displaying his purchases on the table in such a manner as to make the greatest possible show and there was no question but that he had succeeded in layin himself out in great shape  fully a pound of bologna sausage cut in thick slices four large crullers two smoked herrings two ham sandwiches a pint of peanuts and four apples caused the shaky table to look as if literally laden with dainties  dan pushed it toward the bed that one of the party might sit there placed the two chairs at either end and invited his companions to join in the feast  pitch in an fill yourselves way up full this is the first swell house i ever lived in an im willin to pay for style after this i reckon seth an me will skin along for grub sames weve allers done but im goin to have one blowout if it takes every cent ive got  no second invitation was needed and not until a goodly portion of the eatables had disappeared did either speak then it was bill dean who broke the partial silence  say ive raised money enough to send sam barney to philadelphy if you fellers come up with the nickels you promised  how much will it cost and dan began searching his pockets for the contribution which had been promised in his name  i can get the duffer over there for seventyfive cents by sendin him with the emigrants i gave him a big stiff this afternoon bout how we fellers would give him a chance to show how much of a detective he is an he puffed way up allowin there wasnt many men on the force in this town who could beat him he believes its a great snap to go off huntin after jip an hasnt got head enough to think of how hell get back  heres my nickel and seth produced the money dan following his partners example ill be glad if we can get rid of sam but im fraid that wont settle things for jip  then he repeated all lish davis had said regarding the matter and when he concluded master dean was looking remarkably serious  if the firemen are goin to run jip down there aint much show we can keep him out er trouble dont you spose the driver would kinder help somehow  from what he said this afternoon it didnt seem as if he would but perhaps hell change his mind after a while dan replied not minded to cloud this first merrymaking in the new home by disagreeable thoughts and attempted to change the subject of the conversation by speculating as to what sort of a welcome sam barney was most likely to receive from the philadelphia boys  theyll think hes a mighty good feller till he lets out strong on what he can do in the detective business an then theyll tumble to him bill dean replied with the air of one who has closed an argument finally so long as he leaves town we neednt bother our heads about him its jip im thinkin of an it seems to me as if we oughter see him mighty soon  why dan asked in surprise  because he must know what lish davis says else hes likely to knock round ninetyfours house most any time  why dont you hunt him up  its too late to tackle the job tonight but whats to stop all three of us from goin to the erie basin after sam barney leaves town of course youre countin on seein him off  i oughter tend right out on business seth replied thoughtfully but perhaps i can waste time enough for that  course you can if you dont get through with the shinin at the enginehouse as early as usual ill hold him over till the next train then we can skip up to the basin an be back in time to start in with the last editions of the evenin papers  after some reflection and many misgivings as to whether he was warranted in devoting so much of his time to others seth decided to do as bill had suggested and a place of meeting was agreed on  then master dean took his departure after congratulating the partners on having found such pleasant quarters and reminding them for at least the tenth time that they had promised to ask mrs hanson if she would take another lodger  when they were alone once more seth set about clearing away the remnants of the feast and while he was thus employed dan paced to and fro admiring himself in the mirror as he passed and repassed it in such attitudes as he believed befitted a boy who was the lessee of such a swell apartment  seth was not in a mood for conversation the question in his mind was as to whether he was bettering or weakening his chances for admission into the department by thus occupying regular lodgings  the argument was very equally balanced in the first place he had followed lish daviss advice and by so doing it hardly seemed as if he could go astray but as opposed to this was the fact that he was not as likely to be awakened by ninetyfour when she responded to an alarm and consequently his opportunities for getting points would scarcely be as good  however he settled the matter with himself finally by reflecting that he had already taken the step and could not well back out now after having agreed to occupy the apartment therefore it was unwise to indulge in misgivings  there was no trouble in dans mind he was thoroughly well satisfied with the situation and instead of discussing any possibilities he congratulated seth and himself very heartily  all this swellin will cost us twentyfive cents a week an it stands us in hand to scoop the biggest good time out of it we can im goin to turn in for whats the use of payin for a bed if you only get into it for the sake of sleepin i want er lay awake a spell sos to know what a great racket im havin  he had made his preparations for retiring while seth yet stood at the window looking out thoughtfully and once beneath the clothing cried excitedly  say hurry up an get in here this is the greatest snap i ever struck its twice as soft as what we slept in over to ninetyfours house an when trade is dull ill come up here an snooze all the time  youll stand a good chance of goin broke if you do seth replied with a laugh and then he joined his partner  dan was not able to remain awake very long for the purpose of realizing what a great racket he was having for slumber closed his eyes shortly after he lay down and the day had fully dawned before he was again aware of his surroundings  but for seth master roberts might have slept until noon and even when he was aroused the desire to linger in that restinviting bed was so great that he proposed to neglect work in order to remain there  you go over to the enginehouse an ill stay here till youve finished your job there i dont blieve papers will sell very well today  see here dan if youre goin to loaf in bed half the time itll be best for us to stop swellin else we shant earn enough to pay the rent you must come down to business an might as well begin now for it wont be any easier to get up tomorrow  dan was disposed to grumble a little at thus being forced to arise but once he had plunged his face into a basin of cold water his indolence vanished  the boys made a hearty breakfast from the remains of the previous nights feast and then dan hurried away to purchase his stock of papers while seth went to the enginehouse  well how did you sleep last night the driver asked as he entered  great that place is away up in g but the only trouble is that i shant know when ninetyfour goes out  it wont hurt if you dont ive about made up my mind that such business must be stopped  seth looked at lish in pained surprise and there was an ominous quivering of his lip as he asked  whats the reason i cant turn out at the fires ill never get ahead if i dont pick up points  that isnt the best way to do it my boy the driver said in a kindly tone ive been thinking about your plan of getting into the department and come to the conclusion that seeings youre so set on it wed better lend a hand  the expression of sorrow on seths face changed very suddenly as the driver ceased speaking an instant and in its place came a flush of joy so great as to seemingly prevent him from speaking  yes amateur all of us have taken up the idea that youre to be a fireman though i dont say as its the kind of a life a boy should hanker for and weve been working to get you into a place where you can learn the business  do you really mean that seth cried fearing lest he had misunderstood the words  i shouldnt be saying it if i didnt amateur davis continued gravely of course you cant expect any promise of a place in the department till youve got more years on your head but weve struck a plan which will work all right if youre the lad ive always taken you to be  seth was literally breathless now it would have been impossible for him to speak and seeing how great was the suspense mr davis added quickly  weve got a job for you up at headquarters youll be called on to sweep floors wash windows build fires and do odd jobs generally but at the same time youll be in whats called the general school of instructionwhere the men who want to get into the department are put on probation so to speak its been promised us who run with ninetyfour that if you behave yourself you shall have a chance to learn the drill and once that has been done amateur youll be in shape to join us as soons youve got size to your body  big tears of delight stood in seths eyes as he stammered and hesitated in trying to give words to his gratitude and understanding what was in his mind lish davis added  never mind about trying to say anything amateur we dont want thanks now because well get them when you show yourself the kind of a boy weve claimed you are its a case of your picking up points all the time but youll have plenty of hard work and mighty poor pay youll get two dollars a week and your grub later im reckoning you can sleep in the building but at the start its a case of having a home elsewhere and mrs hansons house about fills the bill  two dollars every week is big money seth managed to say  not so much as it seems just now because youll need to come out a bit stronger in the way of clothes we cant afford to have you go there togged out the way you are because weve said you were a kid that belonged to us all hands here have chipped in to buy a full suit like our own with the exception of the brass buttons and you must take it as a present from us therell be no squirming on account of accepting the present otherwise you dont go on the new job well have the togs ready in a couple of days and from this out youll do no more shining round the town spend today and tomorrow in settling up your business and then well launch you into the berth from which youll come out a fireman if it so be you tend right close to work weve cracked you up mighty high amateur and if you dont toe the mark itll be the same as proving us liars  again seth tried to speak and again he failed whereupon lish davis said gruffly  i reckon you want time to think it over amateur take a spin round town closing out your bootblacking business and flash up here this evening remember theres to be no more running to fires except you get a straight invitation from some of ninetyfours men  of course ill black boots here same as ive allers done seth said in a tremulous voice  it wont look well amateur it wont look well  but id a good deal rather mr davis you an all hands here have been mighty good to me an theres no other way i can show how i feel about it  you can keep your eyes wide open up to headquarters and thatll do us more good than if you kept our boots in a regular patentleather polish all the time  please let me do somethin for you mr davis ill get on up at headquarters as fast as any feller can but i want to keep my job here sos to show how i feel on account of what youre doin for me  all the members of the company who were on the lower floor had listened to this conversation and now when lish davis hesitated to give the desired permission ben dunton cried  let amateur manoeuvre as he likes lish i dont wonder he wants to do what he can an so long as he doesnt black boots anywhere except here i cant see that itll work any harm  all right amateur mr davis said after a brief hesitation you shall do as ben thinks is right though there must be no more of that business outside of this house cause youve just the same as begun to hatch into a fireman and we cant afford to have it said we couldnt ante up enough to keep you going  seth was delighted at receiving such permission for by thus being allowed to work for ninetyfours men it was as if he occupied a definite place among them whereas if this had been denied it would have seemed almost as if he had been cast out  he blacked every pair of boots he could find and at first refused to take pay for the labor but lish davis prevented such gratuitous work by saying sternly  take your pay like a man amateur and look pleasant about it therell be no chance for you to handle the citys money until after being at headquarters a month and in the meantime youve got to pay your bills i did count on lending you enough to pull through on but perhaps this will be the best way what about that firebug of yours has the imitation detective caught him yet  seth told of bill deans plan to prevent sam from working mischief and the story caused the men to laugh heartily  that boy bill must have quite a head on his shoulders lish davis said when his mirth had so far subsided that it was possible for him to speak you can tell the firebug that hed better give this section of the city a wide berth for a spell and if he walks a chalkline it may be he wont be troubled about that crime of his if he should get funny in that way again however well bring this case up in a jiffy and hell get a long taste of prison life  then you will keep the officers from arrestin him seth asked eagerly  i didnt say that amateur it may happen that he wont be troubled while he does what is right but theres been no promises made  when seth had finally finished the work of blacking boots to his satisfaction he put the box and brushes away upstairs and approaching lish davis said in a whisper  youve been awful good to me an i promise you shant be sorry for it  i believe you amateur i believe you else i wouldnt have turned a hand in the business even though you did do me a precious good turn the other night youre now in a fair way to get into the department but from this out it all depends upon yourself keep moving as youve been doing since i first saw you and itll come out all right in the long run  then seth left the building on his way downtown and it is safe to say that in all the city of new york there was not another as happy as he for it seemed just then as if the goal he had set himself was very near at hand     chapter viii  jip collinss retreat   so excited was seth by this sudden and unexpected change in his fortunes that he could not bring himself to walk demurely downtown as he was in the custom of doing but ran swiftly more than half the distance repeating to himself over and over again  im really goin into the department after all  he was so highly elated when he met dan that the latter instantly understood something of the utmost importance had transpired and asked eagerly  whats flashed up on you seth got a big job  indeed i have im goin into the department  whawhawhat  im goin into the department mr davis an the rest of ninetyfours men have got me a job up at headquarters where ill have a chance to learn all the business an then when im big enough if my record is all right ill slip in for a fireman as easy as winkin  look here seth what kind of a stiff are you tryin to give me dan asked sharply  its a straight tip old man mr davis jest told me all about it an says i mustnt black boots any more except for ninetyfours men he didnt even want me to do that but i hung on till mr dunton backed me up an he finally gave in say do you know theyve bought a uniform for me jest like they wear only theres no brass buttons on it  oh go way seth youve slipped your trolley  no its all straight goods dan what kept me up there so long this mornin was talkin bout it im to go tonight and get the clothes the only thing that worries me is i cant pay for them myself  anybodyd think to hear you talk that was hard luck look here seth if what youve been givin me is straight youve struck a terrible snap an a feller whod kick cause somebody gives him a suit of clothes oughter go barebacked  it would look a good deal better dan if i had the money to buy the things rather than let them give em to me  i aint so certain bout that the biggest part of it is gettin em an if theyre willin to put up id say let em buy anythin they wanted look here i cant quite get it through my head that things is the way you tell cause it dont seem likely a boy could get in at headquarters  seth repeated to his partner all that lish davis had said and when the story was concluded master roberts commented on it in this fashion  youll be out er sight seth thats all there is to it then realizing how his brother newsvenders might be surprised he added come on quick an lets tell as many fellers as we can before we go to see bill dean ship sam barney to philadelphy  seth was by no means averse to making known his good fortune and very shortly afterward the two were surrounded by a throng of incredulous newsvenders and bootblacks the majority of whom insisted that they wouldnt be stuffed with any such yarns cause of course a feller as small as seth bartlett couldnt get a job in the department even if it was only to sweep floors wash windows an that sort of thing besides if he was taken on at headquarters nobody would give him a show of learnin the drill  bill dean called dan aside and after first persuading him to cross his throat with his fingers in order that he should be put on oath as it were asked regarding the truth of the statements made  its jest as i said an hes goin to have a reglar uniform all but the buttons tonight  did you hear any of ninetyfours men say so  i wasnt there of course but you know seth bartlett dont go round shootin his mouth off the way some of the fellers do an you can hang up to everythin he says so im certain its true  it must be bill replied in a tone of conviction and then approaching seth gravely he extended his hand saying as the amateur fireman grasped it  im mighty glad youve struck it so rich old man an thats a fact all of us know youve been runnin to fires pretty reglar but we never blieved youd really get into the department  i aint there yet seth replied modestly but mr davis says itll be my own fault if i dont get in so you can make up your mind ill keep my eyes open mighty wide  one by one seths business acquaintances followed bills example in the matter of giving credence to the wonderful story until it was a generally accepted fact that no more than the truth had been told  there were some doubters however but they were so few in number that it seemed as if there was no longer any question regarding the matter and during the halfhour which followed seth was kept busy answering the questions of the curious and perhaps envious ones  the astounding news brought by seth and dan had caused sam barneys friends and acquaintances to forget for the time being that this promising detective was about to depart from new york but bill dean who had taken it upon himself to thus aid jip collins soon bethought himself of the business in hand and reminded the others of their duty by saying  look here fellers we mustnt hang round here much longer else there wont be a chance of gettin sam away today hes got to go on the emigrant train an the railroad folks will look for him jest as i said cause i made a good deal of talk bout his bein a detective you see i thought theyd be glad to have him go on their cars if we could make em blieve half as much as sam tells bout himself  thus reminded of their duty the young merchants set out in a body for the cortlandt street ferry much to the annoyance of those pedestrians against whom they jostled and tumbled in their eagerness to make way through the crowded thoroughfare  the amateur detective was found at the corner of west street where he had promised to await bill deans coming and one glance at the throng which had gathered to do him honor as he believed filled his heart with pride  theyre beginnin to find out that im no slouch of a detective after all hey he said in a confidential whisper to bill and the latter replied in a matteroffact tone  i aint certain youd have seen so many of em sam if it hadnt been that they was all in a bunch listenin to the news bout seth bartlett an after hearin it was in good trim for anythin  whats the news bout seth sam asked with mild curiosity  why hes goin into the department  who seth bartlett  yep that is its jest bout the same thing ninetyfours men have found him a job up to headquarters where hell have a chance to learn the business cause theres what you might call a school for firemen up there  sam remained silent fully an instant gazing at his friend in openmouthed astonishment and then he said emphatically if not a trifle viciously  i dont blieve a word of it thats one of seth bartletts yarns  he aint the kind of feller that goes round lyin an it would be a chump trick for him to begin it now cause if he dont flash up in that uniform by tomorrow night well know hes been stuffin us  well maybe theres somethin in it sam replied grudgingly after a brief hesitation but it seems to me the fire department must be pretty hard up when theyll take in a feller like seth  i dont know why he wouldnt make as good a fireman as you will a detective hes been runnin with ninetyfour for moren a year  what does that mount to hes never done anythin sames i have to show that he had the stuff in him  they say he come pretty nigh savin lish daviss life the other night when them storage warehouses burned  oh thats all in your eye dan roberts told the yarn sos to make hisself solid with seth  there was no further opportunity for sam to cast discredit upon seths story because the time was near at hand when he should take his departure and those who had contributed to this important event were eager to hear in what way he proposed to distinguish himself  ill catch jip collins an send him up the river for five or ten years he said in reply to the questions of his friends an then i reckon people will find out whether i mount to anything as a detective or not  are you sure hes over in philadelphy one of the boys asked of sam  course i am  how did you find it out  it wouldnt be any use for me to try to tell cause you couldnt understand it but thats where the detective business comes in ive figgered it all out an in less than half an hour from the time the train strikes the town ill have him rested  some of those who were in the secret smiled but bill dean and his friends refrained from any display of mirth lest sam grown suspicious of his own wisdom should at the last moment refuse to leave the city  the wouldbe detective had desired to purchase his own ticket but to this proposition those who had the matter in charge would not consent and bill dean in response to the suggestion made by several of the party proceeded as he expressed it to ship off sam  that he had spoken the truth when he told of having had a conversation with the railroad officials regarding master barneys departure was proven when he approached the ticketoffice for the clerk recognized him at once and when the money was placed on the ledge in front of him immediately passed out that form of a ticket which would give to jips pursuer a passage to philadelphia  master barneys companions were eager to see him on board the cars but after learning that such pleasure must be purchased by paying for a passage across to jersey city and back the majority of them decided the price was altogether too high  itll cost pretty nigh a dollar for this whole gang to go over dan roberts said after making a hurried calculation an sam aint worth it id like to see how he swings hisself in the cars but dont count on puttin out my good money for it  there were very many of dans opinion in the party and after some discussion it was decided that bill dean and seth bartlett should accompany the detective during this first stage of the journey and these two were instructed to remember all sam said an how he looked sos to tell it to the rest of the crowd when they got back  the wouldbe detective gravely shook hands with his followers and after cautioning those who were to accompany him to remain at a respectable distance lest they interfere with his plans stole on board the ferryboat in a manner well calculated to attract the attention and excite the mirth of every one who saw him  he thinks reglar detectives go snoopin round in that style bill said in a whisper to seth an jest as long as he keeps up such a fool idea hell never mount to anythin i aint sayin but what he might turn out to be quite a feller if he would only act decent  sam appeared to think it necessary that he remain by himself during the short voyage and when the boat arrived at the jersey city slip refused to go on shore until after having satisfied himself in his own grotesque fashion that there were no enemies in the vicinity  he entered the depot much in the same manner and peered into the car fully five minutes before venturing to take a seat after which he said in a tone of satisfaction to his companions  i reckon ive done this thing pretty nigh right so far an if i dont bring jip collins back with me itll be cause some of them philadelphy people spoil my game  are you reckonin on stayin there till you catch him bill asked with a wink at seth and master barney replied confidently  i can put my hands on him within an hour but it may be well stay overnight sos i can bring him into town in the mornin  how are you countin on gettin your ticket to come back seth asked  oh ive got that figgered out you see jest as soon as ive nabbed jip ill go to police headquarters an tell em who he is an of course theyll see that i get back  bill had considerable difficulty in keeping his face straight during this portion of the conversation and fearing lest he might inadvertently betray the secret made short work of the leavetaking  illustration sam going to philadelphia page 146  sam was in the car with the ticket in his hand and it was hardly probable he would do other than proceed to his destination as had been agreed upon therefore bill said in an exceedingly friendly tone  well wed better be goin old man ill see you when you get back  until this moment seth had not realized that by supplying master barney with the means of transportation to philadelphia they were virtually exiling him from his home and his heart misgave him as such phase of the case suddenly presented itself  look here sam sposen it turns out that you dont find jip howll you get home he asked and there was in his mind the thought that he would divide his scanty store of money with the alleged detective but the latter soon made it plain that he was or believed he was able to take care of himself  dont bother your head bout me cause even if you have got a show of gettin into the fire department you aint very well posted on the detective business ill get back without any of your help an ill bring jip with me  all seths sympathy fled and without further attempt at leavetaking the two walked out of the car glancing back from the door an instant at the alleged detective who was looking as important and satisfied as a boy well could look  it was decided between bill and seth during the voyage across the river that after having made a report to those who awaited their coming they would visit jip collins in his retreat at the erie basin  theres only a few of us knows where he is an of course weve got to keep it a secret for a spell so you an dan an i must give the other fellers the slip if we can  seth agreed to this after having been assured that there would be no difficulty in getting back to the enginehouse as mr davis had commanded and once they were on the new york shore bill fulfilled his duty to his friends by giving a detailed account of all sam had said and done  some members of the partyand there were a few who considered master barney one of the most promising young detectives in the citywere fully satisfied with the manner in which he was reported to have borne himself when he set out to bring to a successful close this his first important case but those who believed that sams ability existed only in his own mind were inclined to ridicule his fantastic behavior and one of the company was applauded loudly as he said  if sam cavorts round philadelphy the same way he went on board the ferryboat theyll run him in for a lunatic an well never see him again till he turns over a mighty big leaf  then the wouldbe detectives acquaintances separated each intent on his own business or pleasure and there was nothing to prevent the three who were bent upon aiding jip collins from proceeding on their errand of mercy  now that sam barneys departure was an accomplished fact seth began to reproach himself with having aided in sending the boy so far from home that it might be many weeks before he could return and while walking toward hoboken ferry gave words to these thoughts  bill dean however was not troubled with any pangs of conscience because he had in a certain degree deceived master barney  it aint us who sent him over there he spouted up and told how jip was in philadelphy an we hadnt any call to tell him it wasnt so  but howll he get back  well if i was in that town or any other where the railroad folks only charge seventyfive cents to fetch me home you can bet i wouldnt hang round the streets very long cryin baby id hustle an earn money thats the way sam can get back an the more you feel bad bout him the bigger fool youre makin of yourself i aint stickin up for jip collins cause when he set fire to baxters lumberyard he knew he was doin what would send him to jail but at the same time twixt him an sam i aint certain but id rather give jip a boost  then bill discussed the affair in its different phases laying great stress upon what was apparently to him a fact that by giving sam barney an opportunity of learning that he was not really a detective they were conferring a benefit upon him  as master dean presented the case there had been no deception practised because they could only have convinced sam of his error by betraying jip who had placed himself in the hands of his friends and master barney never once asked for information but instead asserted that he knew where the fugitive was concealed  in this wise was the time spent during what was a reasonably long journey and bill had hardly more than come to the end of his arguments when they arrived at the erie basin  theres where jip is hidin master dean said as he pointed to a dilapidated boat lying at the opposite side of the basin and at that moment dan and seth saw what at first sight appeared to be a darkcolored ball placed in the combing of the companionway hatch  when it suddenly disappeared and a certain portion of it came again into view they understood it was the head of the young gentleman they had journeyed thus far to visit and dan shouted loudly  hi its only us dont get scared  not until he had assured himself by actual survey that there were none other than these three friends in the vicinity did the disconsolatelooking firebug venture to show himself and then he came out on the deck with a certain humility that was in marked contrast with his former swagger  is sam barney still on my trail he asked piteously and that he might not be kept in suspense bill gave a detailed account of the afternoons proceedings so far as the detective was concerned  a longdrawn sigh of relief escaped from the fugitives lips as he said  i was terrible fraid hed find me out up here cause whether hes a detective or not sam has a way of snoopin round an gettin at things that other fellers dont want him to know do you reckon i can show myself downtown now  seth was forced to repeat what lish davis had told him and again a gloom gathered on the firebugs face but it was lightened somewhat when the amateur fireman added  theres no reason jip why you cant come out an earn your livin so longs you walk straight for i dont blieve anybody will try to rest you now sam is away from the city but remember what mr davis said that if you should do anythin more crooked this would all come up against you  look here seth i know i did a mighty mean thing when i set fire to the shed in baxters yard an whether you believe it or not i was terrible sorry the minute the shavins caught fire but dont think i aint been served out its awful to stay all night on this boat i hear all kinds of noises an it seems to me as if the place was reglarly hanted id almost rather go to jail than stay here any longer  but youve got to live somehow jip  it wont be here ive been thinkin if i could get rid of sam barney id go over by the thirtyfourth street ferry nobody knows me there an it ought to be a good place for sellin papers  bill dean thought this a wise plan providing jip could find lodgings round about that locality and then came the question as to how it would be possible for him to start in business again for he confessed that all his money had been spent in the purchase of food  what with helpin sam barney off layin out for a spread last night an gettin money together to pay the roomrent this is kind of a tough week for me dan said thoughtfully but ill be willin to chip in a nickel toward helpin you along jip  bill and seth made the same generous proposition and when the money had been handed to the fugitive it was as if he found it difficult to swallow a certain lump which had arisen in his throat  you fellers have been terrible good to me after i come pretty near killin you an i want you to blieve im goin to be straight ill try to show that i can be decent  of course you can jip seth said soothingly and theres no need of your tellin us bout it jest plug right ahead an do the best you know how then things will come out all right im certain by the time sam gets back well take care he dont meddle with the case an i reckon mr davis will fix the balance when you goin to leave here  jest as soon as i can i made up my mind this noon that id let sam barney lug me off to jail rather than stay any longer  then come with us an therell be time for you to get in some of the evenin trade if we hurry bill an dan will go over with you an see if theres any fellers round the thirtyfourth street ferry that might make trouble an most likely ill see you again tomorrow  at this point dan would have told the firebug of seths good fortune but that the latter checked him believing at such a time the information had best be withheld and the three good samaritans with their penitent friend set out for new york     chapter ix  the uniform   when jip collins and those who had befriended him arrived at the point nearest ninetyfours house on their way to the thirtyfourth street ferry seth halted to take leave of his companions and knowing what he was about to do dan urged that he be allowed to accompany him  youre goin down to get your uniform on an i want to see it the very first thing  so you shall dan but id rather you wouldnt come with me now cause there was nothin said about my bringin anybody keep on with bill an jip an ill go over to our room jest as soon as i get through at the enginehouse  this did not please master roberts but bill dean urged that seth was in the right and was very emphatic in the assertion that it would be way off color to shove in at such a time  therefore dan ceased to insist although it was with a very ill grace that he accepted the situation  as a matter of course once such a conversation was started it became necessary to explain to jip what important business called seth away and he said with a sigh  im glad youre playin in such luck seth for youre mighty square i sposed after what id done nobody would let me come round their houses an as for my gettin into any department why there neverll be a show of such a thing as that  now dont you get down in the dumps jip cause youll soon pull up where you was before all thats needed is to go on straight from this out an show people youre sorry for meddlin in such crooked business  after this attempt at consolation seth parted with his companions and ten minutes later was standing before lish davis on the lower floor of ninetyfours house  well what have you done with your firebug the driver asked and such of the men as were idle gathered around to hear the conversation  weve shipped sam barney an jips gone down thirtyfourth street way sellin papers  do you allow hell run straight after this  im almost certain of it mr davis he feels terrible bad an if sam gives him the chance hell show that he can be a decent feller  i hope so because i hate to see a boy go wrong do you know amateur that whats done while youre young hangs on after you get to be a man then when youre getting along swimmingly up comes somebody and tells of the mean trick you played when you was a kid it always counts against a man now i aint saying that your firebug wont pull out of this but hes taking the chances that itll be thrown up in his face a hundred times twixt now and the next ten years however straight he walks if a boy would only bear that in mind i allow hed be a heap more careful about what he did howsomever you aint here for a lecture of that kind and whats more you dont need one i allow youre counting on that suit of clothes  i sposed that was what you wanted me to come for sir  well it was amateur it was and if youll go upstairs and look on my bed youll find the togs laid out there put em on and come down to show us how you look  are they new clothes sir  of course they are you dont allow that when this ere company takes it into their heads to fit out a kid theyre going to do it on secondhand rigging do you  i only asked the question cause i thought perhaps if they was all new id better wash my face an hands first  thats right amateur fix yourself out the best you know how we want to see what kind of a looking kid weve taken on our hands  instead of immediately acting upon his own suggestion seth hesitated and after a moment the driver asked  what are you hanging in the wind now for got anything on your mind  id like to know sir if im to be allowed to pay for these clothes when i get so i can earn money enough  bless your heart amateur when youre regularly in the department you shall come up and square the bills with ninetyfour if it so be youre inclined if not why what we do comes free as air and were glad to give you a boost all the payment we want is that youll do us credit id like to have the boys up at headquarters when they look at you say to themselves that kid belongs to ninetyfour and in the saying of it id have em think you was way upsomething out of the ordinary run of kids dont you understand amateur  if i can do anything to make you feel proud of me mr davis ill be mighty glad but i promise you shant be ashamed of having sent me there  i aint counting on the possibility of that amateur cause i believe i know you better now get along and put yourself into condition cause theres no knowing how soon we may get a call  before looking at the new clothing seth washed his face and hands with scrupulous care used the comb and brush again and again until positive each single hair was in its proper place and then went to the floor above  he expected to see garments which somewhat resembled those worn by the firemen but was unprepared for that which met his gaze  lish davis if indeed it was he who ordered the uniform had seen to it that each article was a facsimile both as to texture and style of what he himself wore the one difference being that the buttons were plain black instead of gilt with raised letters  during several moments seth stood as if spellbound gazing at this to him first real evidence that he was in a certain degree however remote connected with the department and perhaps never again will he feel the same honest pride which was his at that moment for he knew without being told that he had gotten this far toward the goal he had set himself by straightforward dealing and careful attention to all the duties which might be expected of him  he did not say in so many words that he had earned them but there was in his mind a sense of satisfaction in the knowledge that they would not have been presented unless he had shown himself to be in some degree deserving  after a long survey of the garments he put them on and never was transformation more complete than when he was thus changed from a ragged boy of the street to what in the mirror at least looked almost like a young gentleman  theyre mighty fine he said to himself as he examined first one coatsleeve and then the other theyre mighty fine an itll be a terrible big tumble for me if i cant satisfy em up to headquarters  then came the fear that now having reached the threshold of the department as it were he might fail in his purpose and seth literally trembled with apprehension until lish daviss voice was heard from below ordering him to hurry up  i wont go back on ninetyfours men the boy said to himself resolutely its jest as the driver says all depends on me an knowin whats to be gained im a chump if i cant pull through  then acting on an impulse he slid down one of the poles instead of going by the way of the stairs and suddenly stood before the entire company who were awaiting his appearance  well done amateur well done lish davis cried in a tone of approbation i declare i wouldnt have known who it was if id met you suddenlike on the street why youre a corker amateur a regular corker  i do look pretty nice an thats a fact seth replied complacently whereat the men laughed heartily  then each member of the company in turn came forward and shook him by the hand congratulating him upon his first appearance as a member of the department at the same time that they wished him success in the effort to gain a permanent foothold among them  youre a credit to us amateur and that much i must say the money we spent on the toggery aint been thrown away even if you do get fired out of headquarters after a spell from this time forth youre much the same as a probationary fireman and the bootblack part of it has disappeared except when youre round here where theres no one to know what youre doing though mark you lad im not saying anything against a boys shining boots for a living if you hadnt done it well and taken some pride in your calling seth bartlett wouldnt be standing in that ere suit of blue this minute now that weve launched you as it were amateur i and im speaking for my mates as well want you to understand that its a hard row ahead youve got to work early and late put up with a good many disagreeable things and look pleasant all the while do considerable moren your duty and be always on the jump keep up as weve known you amateur my boy and youll win  when this speechfor it could be called by no other namewas concluded the drivers comrades applauded loudly and then lish stepped back a few paces as if expecting seth to respond  the probationary fireman understood the movement but the words in his mind would not come instead of making what he considered a worthy reply he said and to him it sounded lame and poor  ill do my best sos you wont be ashamed of me  thats all were asking for amateur and tomorrow noon at twelve oclock ive got leave of absence to take you up to headquarters youre your own boss till then and youd better make the most of the holiday cause itll be a long spell before you get another  theres only one thing id like to say sir an that i spose i mustnt think of  do you mean youre hankering to run to a fire with them good clothes on  id like to shift em an go sir for  at that instant the click caused by the opening of the electric circuit in the alarm was heard followed by the striking of the joker  the weight fellthe lever flew upthe horses were released and before seth could have spoken even if he had had anything to say the animals were under the swinging harness while every man stood at his station  get on amateur get on alongside the engineer this may be the last time youll run with ninetyfour for quite a spell and im minded to give you the advantage of it the captain cried as lish davis sprang to his seat snapped into place the catch on his belt and released the harness  almost before the last word was spoken seth had leaped to the side of the engineer and never a boy in new york city was more proud than he when the ponderous engine drawn by the plunging horses left the building with a rattle and roar which could have been heard blocks away  in a uniform hardly to be distinguished from the members of the company the amateur was riding to his first fire in what seemed to him like an official capacity  one portion of his dream was being realized and he said to himself as he clung to the rail swung to and fro by the swaying of the ponderous machine that when the time came for him to be regularly enrolled in the department he would use every effort toward being assigned to ninetyfour  you are our mascot amateur jerry walters who stood next to seth shouted at the full strength of his lungs in order that the words might be heard above the clanging of the gong and rattle of wheels and if youre to bring us good luck we shall get first water tonight  illustration the fireengine going out page 152  seths heart sank for the moment he believed walters was in earnest and knew full well having the location of each signal station in mind that there were two engines whose houses were nearer the call than was ninetyfours  to get first water under such circumstances seemed impossible and timidly seth reminded walters of the fact  i know it amateur and am not counting that well win but if we should and if there be such things as mascots then im free to admit youll be a lucky one for us  perhaps lish davis had in his mind some idea similar to that expressed by walters for although seth had seen him urge his horses to their utmost speed time and again never before had he known him to press them so hard  the mass of steel and iron was drawn over the pavement as if it had been but a feathers weight and lish davis guided the horses without checking their speed in the slightest around a sharp corner so suddenly that seth was nearly overthrown while the clanging of gongs in the distance told of the approach of a second engine  its fiftythree jerry walters shouted in the boys ear its fiftythree and weve got thirty seconds the start of her how about getting first water now amateur  seth pointed straight ahead where could be seen a cloud of sparks arising from the stack of a third engine which was coming directly toward them  yes amateur its her or ninetyfour fiftythree is distanced and ill hold that youre bringing good luck to us if we do no more than beat one of em out  every man of that company however eager he had previously been to be first at the scene of conflict seemed now to outdo himself in activity  a cloud of black smoke issuing from the second floor of a dwelling located the fire and ninetyfours tender was making a run for the nearest hydrant passing the engine just as lish davis slackened speed  joe black had gained the desired spot in advance of his rival and as ninetyfours tender dashed by fifteen or twenty feet of the hose had been run off of the reel  then it was that jerry walters and lish davis gave vent to a loud cry of triumph for joe black had made the connection  ninetyfours tender was stretching in just as the other company reached the hydrant beaten by no more than ten seconds  weve got first water amateur weve got first water jerry walters shouted as if having taken leave of his senses it aint that weve never done such a thing but this time it didnt belong to us and we took it on your first run if that aint being a mascot for ninetyfour i dont know what you will call it  then there was no time for congratulations or further discussion regarding the matter for the men had work to do which could not be delayed and seth was about to follow joe black when lish davis shouted  come back here amateur come back this is no time for you to be gettin points when youre wearing the first decent suit of clothes you ever owned get alongside and behave yourself i didnt allow you was to do any work when the captain let you in on this trick  under other circumstances seth would have been grievously disappointed at being thus commanded to remain where he could see little or nothing of what was being done but now he was so elated at the victory won that all else seemed but slight by comparison  i spose youd have gone in there if you was wearing the finest coat ever made eh the driver asked gravely and seth replied with another question  wouldnt you sir  what id do dont cut any figger amateur its my business to go in there but not yours yet a while when the time comes that youre bound to step up with the foremost im expecting to see you there and wouldnt say a word that might hold you back now youre playing the gentleman and youll stay with me besides it aint going to turn out anything after all a curtain or some such flummery is blazing it cant be much more  in this surmise lish davis was correct  within ten minutes after ninetyfour was ready for work word came to shut off and the men set about disconnecting the hose  so slight had been the fire that only two members of the company were detailed to do the overhaulingthat is to thoroughly go through the building from top to bottom to make certain no spark had been left which might be fanned into a flameand the remainder of the men were ordered back to the house  its what we may call a howling success this first run of yours amateur lish davis said as he drove leisurely homeward weve beat em all out had little work to do and it wasnt much more than good practice with a precious fine record at the bottom of it but dont you get puffed up thinking everything is going your way just cause youve started in easy and slick  theres no reason why i should be puffed up mr davis except that ive had a chance to do what ive been longin forand that is to go out with ninetyfour as if i belonged to her  as if you belonged to her thats what we allow you do amateur from this out unless it so be you turn about wonderfully and go crooked youre one of usan honorary member so to speak  put down on the roll as the official mascot jerry walters cried whereat the remainder of the company laughed heartily and in this jovial mood was ninetyfour returned to her quarters but seth was not allowed to take part in the washingup lest he should soil his fine feathers  im counting on your striking in at headquarters lookin just as fine as silk which you couldnt do if we let you hang round here helping with the dirty work lish davis said when seth would have claimed it as his right to be allowed to assist in the labor youre to toddle straight home now for youve hung round this house long enough stay there till morning come over here for a bit about your usual time and then take a spell at swelling downtown until nigh on to twelve oclock when ill be ready to go with you well why dont you start  i wanted to thank you for lettin me run with ninetyfour the first night i had my uniform on  you neednt do anything of the kind the captain happened to be soft just as the alarm struck else you wouldnt have got away with us now clear out and take care you dont get into mischief  as seth went toward his lodgings he wondered whether the people whom he met in the street were not surprised at seeing him thus clad like a fireman and so intent was he on walking erect with his shoulders thrown well back that he might the better look the part he hoped one day to play that he failed to observe dan roberts until the latter suddenly recognizing his partner shouted shrilly  hi seth do you mean thats really you  dont make such a row on the street dan cause folks will wonder whats the matter but say i do look pretty fine eh  fine why thats no name for it old man youre out of sight where did you get em  this is the uniform i was tellin you bout mr davis gave it to me when i was over to the enginehouse an do you know i hadnt moren got into it when there was an alarm an i rode to the fire on ninetyfour jest as if i belonged to her  no  i did for a fact  well if they let you do that there aint much question bout your gettin into the department  mr davis says it all depends on me now an you can bet ill work mighty hard dan roberts  if you dont youre a bloomin idjut why i wouldnt ever knowed you if id been goin fast i was kinder loafin along wonderin when youd be home an thinkin of jip so had time to look round first off i couldnt make up my mind to holler you looked so bloomin swell now i dont see why i shouldnt go in for somethin sames you did an flash up in sich style but no ill stick to sellin papers thatll be the way with me an think im playin in great luck if i get to own a stand on some corner  you talk as if i was already in the department instead of havin to work my way up to it  i only wish i was as near there by the time youre captain of a company ill jest about get so i can pay my own way with never two cents ahead  now dont begin to jump on yourself cause it seems as if i was gettin along pretty fast but wait an see how i pan out an as for doin nothin but sellin papers why thats cordin to the way you want it there aint any need of stickin to sich business unless you hanker for it  yes there is except im willin to starve dan replied mournfully and to raise him from the depths of despondency into which he had been plunged by a sight of the uniform seth began to ask him questions concerning jip  we left him down at the ferry bill dean struck a feller there who promised to give jip a lift now an then i dont reckon hell have any trouble cause them as are sellin papers down that way dont seem to have much sand to em hes goin to sleep with bills friend an take it all in all i think hes gettin along mighty well considerin it aint a week since he burned us out say goin into the house now or do you count on swellin round a spell first  well go home dan an in the mornin after ive shined for ninetyfours men ill meet you downtown  what you goin to do any more shinin  i am for them in that house an ill keep it up till i get to be reglarly in the department theyve done so much for me dan that if i should spend half my time as long as i live blackin their boots i wouldnt square things  if i counted on bein a fireman id be one i wouldnt black boots for anybody  neither will i when im really in the department but im a long ways from there yet a while come home an tonight ill stand a spread sos to celebrate wearin the new uniform     chapter x  at headquarters   when he first saw seth in his new uniform a certain feeling of envy came into dan robertss heart but he was not a fellow who could give himself up to this kind of thoughts very long and within a few moments all that had passed away leaving in its stead rejoicings that his partner had taken such rapid strides toward the desired end  before they had gained the seclusion of their own room dan was his old self once more and from that moment it is safe to say he was never again envious of seths good fortune but sufficiently wise to profit by his partners example  when they entered the house mrs hanson who must have been informed by lish davis of the expected change in seths condition came to the door to see the boy in his uniform and when she ceased her words of praise his cheeks were glowing red  youll cut a terrible swath downtown tomorrow morning dan said sagely when they were alone heres a woman that never saw either of us till yesterday an she goes pretty nigh crazy over the way you look i reckon sam barney would have a reglar fit if he should run up against you now  to seths mind there was nothing wrong in admiring himself or listening to words of praise from others and he enjoyed to the utmost these speculations of his partner until master roberts wearied of gazing at the amateur fireman hinted broadly that if there was to be a spread set out in honor of the uniform now was the time to start her goin  how much did that layout cost you last night  twentythree cents  thats pretty stiff to pay for one supper but it aint every day i get a uniform an i guess i can stand it this once we shant spread ourselves in the same way agin though seth said thoughtfully speaking half to himself and then taking some coins from his pocket he added you go out and buy the stuff ill wait here  why dont you come with me  im fraid if ninetyfours men should see me theyd think i was runnin round swellin  well sposen they should havent you got the right wouldnt most any feller whos got as near into the department as you have  mr davis said i was to go downtown tomorrow mornin an perhaps thats all he thought i oughter do so ill hang on here instead of goin out agin  dan was not averse to making the purchases and so deeply occupied was seth with pleasant thoughts that it seemed to him master roberts had no more than left the room before he returned laden with packages  as on the previous night he was accompanied by bill dean who exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction as he entered the room  it seems like as if im allers round when you fellers are puttin up swell layouts dont it then getting a full view of seth for the first time he cried in an accent of unquestionable admiration well ill be jiggered dan said you was lookin mighty fine but i never thought you could flash up like this why youre a reglar fireman already  you wouldnt think that if you could hear what ninetyfours men say an besides theres no brass buttons on this uniform you know  i aint certain but it looks better without em anyhow youre way up in g  he oughter know it by this time dan added with a laugh everybody has been tellin him so an he come mighty near paralyzin miss hanson she jest threw up both hands when we opened the door  well i dont wonder but say i didnt come round to sponge off you fellers cause i never thought of your havin two such layouts one right after the other i didnt know but youd like to hear how wed left jip an then agin i wanted to talk bout bunkin in here with you fellers  this is seths spread but youll hold on an get your share of it now youre here and dan began to arrange the food on the table in the most tempting manner possible  of course youll stop seth added an even if youd known we was goin to kind of celebrate what would be the harm in comin round an gettin some  well i dont want you to think im playin it on you thats all but it struck me a little while ago that if we could make a trade with the woman what runs this house it would come easier on all hands now that bed is plenty big enough for three an it aint likely youll be here much of the time except to sleep so why wouldnt it be a good idea to see how much extra shell charge to let me in with you fellers  seth knew of no good reason why bill should not be allowed to share their palatial quarters providing mrs hanson did not object  he knew master dean to be an industrious wellintentioned boy whose company now that he was to be absent from home so much might be desirable to dan and at once signified his willingness that the landlady should be consulted  i reckon dan will be lonesome here when im gone so much an perhaps it would be a good plan spose you two fellers go down an see what shes got to say  why dont you tackle her master roberts suggested shell be so busy lookin at your uniform that perhaps you could make a better trade  seth hesitated only an instant and then went downstairs  when he returned his companions knew from the expression on his face before he made a report that the mission had been successful  she says if we keep quiet an dont have a crowd hangin round or too many visitors that we neednt pay any more for three than we do for two i didnt think that would be jest the square thing an besides we couldnt divide half a dollar up in three parts so i told her wed call it sixty cents an that will make the lodgin come mighty cheap for all hands of us  when are you willin i should come bill dean asked eagerly  whenever you want to  then ill start right in tonight an pay the same as you fellers do for youve only got one day ahead of me  and thus the matter was settled to the manifest delight of the new lodger  the feast was an unusually satisfactory one on this particular evening  seth was as happy as a boy well could be because of the good fortune which had come to him through ninetyfours men bill believed himself unusually lucky in having secured such desirable lodgings at an exceedingly low price and master roberts had suddenly conceived an idea which seemed to him a remarkably happy one  not until his hunger had been appeased did dan give words to his new train of thoughts and then he announced with the air of one who has made a great discovery  if seth hadnt laid himself right out to get into the department an stuck to it whether the fellers were makin fun of him or not he wouldnt be wearin that uniform now would he course not if i keep on sellin papers an dont try to do anything else ill never get some other kind of a job will i course not now ive made up my mind to own a store on third avenoo where ill sell papers an books an sich truck an keep a lot of kids to do the outside work  an you can do it too dan if you stick right at it seth replied confidently  well she goes from this out i shant spend any more money buyin swell grub sames this is an if i dont get downtown every mornin by daylight itll be cause im broke up so bad i cant move  then the feasters discussed this new idea of dans approaching it from every point of view until the third avenue store was to master roberts an accomplished fact nothing stood between it and him save hard work and a strict adherence to his purpose  after this subject was exhausted a certain amount of their attention was given to jip collinss affairs they speculated briefly as to what sam barney might be doing at that particular moment or regarding matters connected with his departure and it was not yet nine oclock when all three were lying comfortably in bed sleeping peacefully  dan awakened shortly after daybreak and strong in his purpose of one day owning a third avenue store lost no time in making ready for business  he and bill dean started downtown before sunrise and seth made his way to ninetyfours house where he busied himself in doing such work as came to his hand  before seven oclock he had blackened the boots of all the men swept the floors and groomed one of the horses  lish davis came down just as this last task was performed and observing what had been done said gravely  look here amateur we dont count on your doing up all the odd jobs round this place else the rest of us will rust out for lack of exercise  i got round pretty early sir an d rather be at work than layin still  after this noon you wont complain of having too much spare time on your hands been to breakfast  yes sir  then clear out an go downtown cause this is likely to be your last day off for quite a spell ill look after the other horses  seth would have been better pleased to remain in the enginehouse two or three hours longer but lish daviss injunctions although given as a permission rather than a command were not to be disobeyed and without protesting he left the building  it is hardly necessary to attempt to describe the reception accorded the amateur fireman when he arrived at printing house square  every bootblack or newsboy in that section of the city had heard from bill or dan the fullest possible particulars regarding the new uniform and all were expecting to see a great change in seths appearance but not prepared for such a decided transformation  during at least two hours business was practically suspended and seth was literally forced to remain on exhibition because of the throng which surrounded him  many times did the policemen in the vicinity disperse the gathering but the admiring ones reassembled immediately afterward regardless of the threats of the officers and thus the society for the admiration of seth bartlett was virtually in continuous session  those who had laughed the loudest because of his ambition were now the most extravagant in their praises and there was not a boy on printing house square who did not realize as never before how much might be accomplished by persistent effort until eleven oclock seth visited with his friends and acquaintances and then made his way up to keep the appointment with lish davis  the driver clad in his best uniform was awaiting the boys arrival and cried goodnaturedly when the latter appeared  well amateur youve spread yourself eh been swelling all the morning till your head is so big that you need to borrow a new cap  theres no danger of that yet a while mr davis ill wait till i see how i get along at headquarters before puffin myself out very much  thats a good idea amateur though at the same time i believe youll pull through in great shape providing you hang on as youve done since i knew you now if it so be youve tended to all your business and are ready to duf into the work well mosey along toward sixtyseventh street  the sooner i get to work the quicker well know whether the folks up there are goin to let me stay seth replied and with words expressive of kindly cheer and friendly wishes ringing in his ears the amateur set out on this his first real step toward a position in the department  i dont want them as youll meet at headquarters to think youre a dummy amateur and its in my mind to give you a little outline so to speak of this ere school after which therell be no need of your showing ignorance by asking questions in the first place it aint counted on that this ere branch of the service is to educate anybody and everybody that may come along its for such men as are admitted to the department on trial probationary firemen chiefly but the old hands have had a deal of good out of it  this plan was started long about 83 for no other reason than to show the men who were then in the service how to use the scaling ladder which had just been introduced and the idea seemed to work so well that it gradually grew kind of swelled out so to speak till it became a reglar school first off before the new headquarters was built the city hired an old sugar warehouse on one hundred and fiftyeighth street and north river where the men were shown how to use scaling ladders and a life net and ive been there when one class counted up sixty scholars all of us old hands at the business remember this amateur youll never be too old to go to school leastways thats what ive found  after the new headquarters building was opened in 87 the sugar warehouse was given up and we firemen had what you might almost call a college theres a yard at the back of the building nigh on to a hundred feet square which is put up in such shape that water can be used the same as you would at a fire and here drills go on like this for instance an alarm is sent out for a certain company when they least expect it and the men find themselves called into headquarters to show what they can do all that youre going to see lad and talking about getting points why you can learn more there in one exhibition drill than you could at forty fires cause youre understanding just how the thing is going to be done  youll find when one of these unexpected drills comes off that the engine is run into the yard hose coupled on to the hydrant dragged up to the top of the building water started and shut off ladders used and in fact the whole business gone through the same as if a hundred lives were in danger  do the men really work as hard there as they do at a fire seth asked  do they amateur well now you can be mighty certain they do cause its owing to what they show at such times that gives them their rating now for instance ninetyfours company is in the first grade eightysix that we bucked up against on that storage warehouse is in the second grade and there aint a great many third grade nowadays cause the men are drilled too well and heres a point i want you to understand amateur in case some man comes along and tries to tell you that the department in this city or that is better than what weve got here stick straight up for the fact that the new york fire department heads the world and you wont be a grain away from the truth taking it all in all im free to say open and above board that you cant find a department anywhere that can beat this and im reckoning pretty strong that you wouldnt find one to equal us taking all things into consideration  now well suppose you was old enough and stout enough and plucky enough and knew enough to pass a civilservice and a physical examination for admission to the department you wouldnt be put into regular service but sent up to headquarters where were going now and drilled in the yard raising ladders tossing em round setting em up and keeping at that kind of work till you could handle one the sames you might a knife or fork now considering the fact that the lightest of em weighs twenty and the heaviest sixtyfive pounds with a length of from fourteen to twenty feet you can see that youve got to be pretty nimble before getting through the first lesson eh  then well allow youve satisfied them as are giving the lesson youll be set at climbing up to the first window to start with after you can do that to the second and so on till youve got to the top of the building by aid of the scaling ladders it aint such a mighty easy thing when you come to do it yourself as it looks while youre watching somebody else about the time youre halfway up the hair on your head will come pretty nigh to standing on end but bless you amateur a man soon gets over that till shinning outside of a building dont seem moren childs play  then theres the drill of building a chainmaking a line of ladders from the roof to the streetand getting from the upper window out over the cornice straddling sills is another lesson youll have to learn till you can get astride of one and by holding on with your knees work as handy as on the ground standing on sills working the lifeline climbing crosswise sos to step from one window and go to the next story on a slant instead of straight up using the life net by jumping down or holding it for others to leap intoand if it so chances that you are ever set to holding one amateur my boy youll find it aint childs play ive heard it said that when a man weighing one hundred and fifty pounds jumps from the sixth floor of a building he strikes the net with a force of nigh on to eighteen hundred pounds and i tell you them as are holding it have to keep scratching  do you reckon ill be allowed to practise with the men mr davis seth asked as the driver paused an instant  im counting on it lad but dont make up your mind itll be right away we of ninetyfours company believe we know what kind of a boy you are because weve tried you so to speak but up here where were going theyve got only our word for it and wont count very much on that till theyve found it out for themselves it may take a long time and then again it maynt but every boy whatever business he goes into is bound to prove himself before hes thought to be of much account itll be the same at headquarters turn to amateur the same as youve done since we knew you and before a year goes by i reckon on seeing you in the drill  are the men always practising  not every minute of the time you know because it comes precious nigh being hard work but you can count on their doing all a man ought to do in the twelve hours when its storming or too cold to work in the yard youll find them ere grownup scholars in the gymnasium on the fifth floor at work coupling or uncoupling hose learning how to fight cellar fires or practising with the tincutters for opening roofs theyre told about batteringrams axes hooks and finally everything that we use until the man who graduates up at headquarters is fit to handle a company all by himself save of course that he lacks experience now if it so happens that one dont learn quick enough or shows he hasnt got a good head for the business hes switched right off and that ends his chance of getting into the department of course kids are never taken on and it aint held out to you that youre going there on probation weve got a job for you as a boy in the building thats all but with what little influence ninetyfours men can use and some thrown in from the other companies that were friendly with the idea is to slip you through on the sly so to speak if you please them at headquarters therell be no voice raised agin your practising now and again with the others and then is the time that everything depends on you  youve run to fires for the sake of getting points but never had a chance to see whether you could carry them out or not now the opportunity is coming if its in you to do the work why when youre sizable we shant have any trouble in getting you taken on probation providing of course you can pass both examinations and about that weve got to talk later i dont want you to think a fireman is a regular idiot when it comes to booklearning the older hands of us may be way off on such things but them as goes through the civilservice examination have got to be pretty well posted an im counting on your working into some nightschool  seth had listened attentively to the old drivers words but there was a cloud on his face when mention was made of the fact that a fireman must have a certain amount of booklearning  i dont know hardly anythin at all mr davis he said in a mournful tone  you can read cant you  yes if the words aint too long  and write  well i wouldnt like to say i really could cause its just puttin down letters same as theyre printed  didnt you ever go to school amateur  no sir  why not  cause ive allers had to hustle for my livin an it never seemed as though i had the time but now since youve begun to talk i know i might have done it evenings instead of hangin round with the fellers or sleepin if id known folks had to go to school before they could be firemen id been studyin these last two years  i believe you my boy and if you had put into the work at books anywhere near as hard as you have on what you call picking up points youd have been pretty well along by this time howsomever we can remedy that though we cant call back lost time jerry walters and ill figger up whats to be done and explain further as soon as weve settled matters cause you see amateur you belong to ninetyfour an we aint of the mind to have you fail in what you set out after  shall i have any chance to see you  bless you lad yes youll be through between six and seven oclock and well be glad to have you drop in any evening till you set about studying then i allow well fix up some place sos you can be away from your partner and his friends we wont have any soft talk after we get inside so ill say it all now keep your upper lip stiff amateur dont get down at the heel if them as are in charge seem to bear on a little too hard remember that all hands of ninetyfours company are counting on you to make good their words and be a man unless we get a call youll see us tonight so there aint need of saying very much more just now  by this time they had arrived at headquarters and lish davis entered the building with the air of one who has no especial interest in whoever may be following him     chapter xi  sams return   it was nearly eight oclock on the evening of the day seth paid his first visit to headquarters and he was greeted warmly by such of the men as were on the lower floor  wheres mr davis he asked  he had twentyfour hours leave an aint likely to flash up before tomorrow noon jerry walters replied how did you get along at headquarters  that i aint quite so certain of seth replied doubtfully  why not anything gone wrong  no but it dont seem as though the men up there had very much to say to me  found you plenty of work eh  oh yes there was enough of that  a little too much i reckon if it kept you till this hour  i was told that i should knock off at six oclock but then i hadnt finished the job i was workin on an so stayed till it was done  how did lish davis swell round  i didnt see anythin of him after we got inside he told a man there who i was an two or three of em hunted round to find work for me  well how do you like it so fars youve gone jerry walters asked with a smile and the remainder of the company gathered around to hear the reply  id like anythin that was givin me a show of gettin into the department of course it aint so pleasant in the house doin all kinds of work as it is out of doors layin still when you want to or talkin with the fellers  then you dont feel like backin out yet  no siree ill never feel like that look here ive got to be up at seven oclock tomorrow mornin an why couldnt i shine your boots tonight  cause then is the time for you to rest amateur dont bother your head about our boots being shined for well tend to that part of it i reckon therell be as much work at headquarters as you can comfortably do so theres no need to come round here except to make a friendly call of course were expectin to see you pretty nigh every evenin sos to have a report of how things are goin but so fars your blackin our boots thats all nonsense and if lish davis was here this minute hed tell you the same  but i want to do it an mr davis promised me i should cause itll make it seem as if i was tryin to square up for what all of you have done for me  jerry walters tried to persuade seth that he had better not attempt to do so much particularly at the outset but it could readily be told from the expression on the boys face that he was not convinced and mr walters refrained from making further efforts in that line  after answering a few more questions and promising to visit the enginehouse on the following evening seth feeling even more tired than he looked set out for home and mr walters said to his comrades  that kid will work himself down to skin an bones for the sake of tryin to show hes thankful for the lift weve given him and as for making his way into the department why there aint a ghost of a show that hell fail  and every member of the company appeared to share jerrys opinion regarding the matter  when seth arrived at mrs hansons he found bill dean and dan making ready to retire and the latter cried in a joyful tone  im mighty glad youve come seth bill an me was jest figgerin that theyd fixed it up to have you sleep there nights  there wasnt anythin said about that and i reckon they dont want boys round the amateur fireman replied gloomily and bill asked in surprise  why whats the matter old man aint gettin discouraged so soon are you  i reckon itll be all right after a spell an i wouldnt want any of ninetyfours men to know that i wasnt jest as chipper as a sparrer but things are different up there from what they are down here they jest set you to work an let you keep hummin without sayin a word i dont believe a single one of em has spoke to me since mr davis went away  what you been doin  cleanin windows an i tell you theyre so big that one of em makes considerable work i hung on to it till id finished all on that floor even though they told me to go home at six oclock  what are you goin to do tomorrow  i dont know anythin that comes up i spose  didnt they give you any lessons in the school  i havent even seen it yet there might have been a hundred men round there practisin for all id know cause i was in the front of the buildin  why i thought youd go right to work learnin to be a fireman dan said in surprise  mr davis never allowed anythin like that he said after a spell when id showed em i could tend to business i might get a show but you see it aint anyways certain that theyll do what ninetyfours men have been countin on ive got to take the chances you know and work my way in  both dan and bill were disappointed by this report they had fancied certain tasks might be required of seth but firmly believed he would be given instructions at once  in fact dan had told his roommate several times during the day that he expected to see seth an enrolled member of the department within a few months adding in support of such belief  when that feller tackles anythin he goes right through with it an if he aint big enough now hes got the nerve in him to grow terribly it seems like he does everythin he starts for  now that seth appeared despondent his comrades believed it their duty to cheer him and during half an hour or more they set about such task in earnest  it seemed to them as if he was already growing more cheerful when the shrill whistling of a peculiar note was heard several times repeated apparently on the sidewalk in front of the dwelling  thats teddy bowser bill dean exclaimed as he leaped to his feet he wanted to come up here tonight but i told him he mustnt cause if the fellers hung round id lose my show for a tony lodgin  go down and see what he wants dan suggested i dont believe wed better let him come in for there are three of us here now an miss hanson might think she was havin too many fellers round for sixty cents a week  bill descended the stairs swiftly but noiselessly returning in less than five minutes with a look of consternation upon his face  say sam barneys got back  got back seth cried in astonishment and dismay why howd he raise the money  thats what teddy didnt know he said sam flashed up bout an hour ago lookin as chipper as you please an with cash in his pocket hes tumbled to our racket an is promenadin round town sayin hell catch jip collins before tomorrow night  the three boys gazed at each other in perplexity and fully a moment elapsed before the almost painful silence was broken  then seth said interrogatively  of course teddy knew what he was talkin bout  oh yes he hasnt made any mistake cause he saw sam and heard him blow bout what a swell time he had in philadelphy  he couldnt have been there very long  i dont understand it and bill plunged his hands deep in his pocket as he looked gloomily around i thought when we shipped him off that wed settled the detective business an now it aint any dead certain thing he wont run right across jip collins cause the poor feller thinks sams so far away theres no danger of meetin him  wheres teddy dan asked  down on the sidewalk  whats he waitin for  i told him hed better hold on a spell cause weve got to do somethin fellers an perhaps he can help us  but if sams here with money in his pocket how shall we stop him from workin up the case dan asked helplessly  first off we must tell jip seth replied promptly tomorrow mornin you an bill will have to see what can be done with sam it wont do to let him keep on the way he was goin before we sent him off  i reckon you cant stop him if hes set on doin it an he likely will be now he finds youre in the department cause he said he was goin to be an outanout detective long before you ever dreamed of gettin a firemans job  if he only knew how little of a fireman i am he wouldnt feel very bad bout it seth said with a sigh and then added more cheerily come on fellers we must find jip an not stay out too late either else miss hanson will raise a row  the three went down the stairs softly crept out on the sidewalk as if their own lives might be in jeopardy if the slightest noise was made and there met teddy bowser  oh yes i saw him teddy said in reply to seths question hes been swingin himself round grand street big as life for moren an hour says he had a great time in philadelphy an aint certain but hell go over there to live after he gets jip in jail sam must have struck some mighty soft snap cause when he left this town he had only sixteen cents to his name  do you spose he could find any one chump enough to lend him money dan asked musingly and seth said almost sharply  it wont pay for us to stand here tryin to figger how hes fixed things cause we must be back mighty soon and it may take quite a spell to find jip  i reckon it will teddy added emphatically i hunted all round the ferry for him  why how did you know where he was  the fellers told me i didnt think it was a secret  it ought to have been and seth looked more distressed than before if all hands know it wont take sam barney a great while to find out  he was talkin bout it when i left said there was no need of goin to the ferry till mornin cause he could put his hands on him when he wanted to some of jips chums must have gone back on him an i wouldnt wonder if i knew who you see denny macey was tellin round that if jip didnt ante up the dime he borrowed two weeks ago hed make trouble for him  dont lets stand here any longer and seth led the way at a rapid pace toward the ferry  beyond speculating as to how the wouldbe detective had been enabled to return from philadelphia those who were seeking to do jip collins an additional favor indulged in little conversation during the hurried journey across the city  as they neared the ferry each kept a sharp watch in the hope of meeting the boy whom he sought but when they stood at the very entrance of the slip no sign of jip had been seen and then the difficulty of the search began to be apparent  master collins was a stranger in this section of the city and they might question a dozen boys without finding one who had so much as heard of him therefore the quest was likely to be a long if not a vain one  itll soon be too late to do anything if we dont hustle seth said when he realized all the possibilities against success let each feller start out alone and therell be jest so many more chances of runnin across him well meet here by the ferry slip in half an hour  this plan was acted upon without delay and each member of the searching party did his best to bring the labor to a speedy and final conclusion but when at the expiration of the time set the four met once more nothing had been discovered  hes turned in bill dean said in a tone of conviction  if its with that chum of yourn it oughter be easy to find him  he wasnt a chum of mine an i dont so much as know his name its a feller ive run across two or three times downtown thats all  then i cant see but what we must call it a bad job for theres no kind of use in foolin round here any longer  but if we dont find him now all sam barneys got to do is to walk over here in the mornin dan said mournfully and bill dean cried emphatically  ill get ahead of that bloomin detective if i have to set up all night you can count on my bein right here at daylight an thats the best anybody can do you ought to get to bed seth cause youve got to turn out pretty early in the mornin  that it was useless to remain in that vicinity any longer with the hope of meeting jip by chance all understood and mournfully they turned their faces homeward teddy bowser suggesting that he might be able to do the repentant firebug a friendly turn by delaying sam a certain length of time next morning  ill ask him to tell me about his detective work an you can bet he wont lose such a chance cause theres nothin in this world he likes to talk about as well as himself  all right you do that teddy an ill snoop over here bill added of course seth cant take a hand in this work on account of havin to go to headquarters but dan will kinder lay round anywhere either to head sam off or find jip  then teddy bowser took his departure for the night and mrs hansons three lodgers returned to their room thoroughly distressed in mind  the greater portion of the night might have been spent by them in discussing this new phase of affairs but for seth who said when his comrades began to hold forth on the subject  you fellers cant do any good talkin ive got to get some sleep if i count on bein up early enough in the mornin to do the work over to the enginehouse an get to my job at seven oclock so spose you quiet down and give me a chance  this was no more than a reasonable request and soon mrs hansons lodgers were enjoying their needed repose despite the troubles which had come upon them  seth whose last thought had been that he must waken early opened his eyes just as the day was dawning and aroused his comrades  you fellers must turn out if you count on helpin jip this mornin an im goin to get right off seems to me it would be a good idea if bill was at the ferry right soon  ill start now master dean replied and since their plans had been fully arranged the night previous there was nothing to prevent seth from going at once to ninetyfours house  the watchman on duty admitted him with a reproof for trying to crowd too much work into one day but made no further objection when the amateur fireman declared that he should feel better if he did the shinin the sames ever  not a man was awake save the one on duty when his work finished seth hurried toward headquarters  when he arrived it lacked twenty minutes of the time set for him to begin work and the first person he met inside the building was a grayhaired man wearing such a uniform as did jerry walters the driver of ninetyfour and all seths particular friends  what are you doing here the official asked in a not very friendly tone  i began to work round this place yesterday noon seth replied in an apologetic manner  oh you did eh you must be the kid lish davis made so much talk about  i am the boy he got the job for sir  well what are you doing here so early seven oclock is the hour  yes sir but i dont spose it can make much difference if im here a little before time cause then ill get more done dont you see  and you were figuring on that same thing when you stayed here until eight oclock last night eh  no sir i stayed cause i wasnt through washin all the windows on the second floor an didnt want to leave the job half done  well in the future youd better go home when the clock strikes six the same as others do what task have they set for you this morning  nothing as yet sir  thats because you did your work too well yesterday i suppose they allowed you had enough to last through the balance of this day  it would be a pretty poor kind of a boy who couldnt do moren wash that many windows in a day an a half seth replied laughingly fancying that this mans gruff manner was no indication of bad temper but rather the reverse  they tell me youre counting on being a fireman one of these days  yes sir seth replied promptly and decisively  you seem to be pretty certain of it  so i am sir cause ill get there after a time if i work hard  you will for a fact my son if you believe it as firmly as you seem to how much have you seen of the building so far  ive only been in the room where i was workin yesterday  come up into the gymnasium with me im running things in that quarter an it might be we can work you in with better profit there than at windowwashing  it was as if seths heart gave a great bound just then for in the gymnasium was begun the first of the firemans lessons and if he should be so fortunate as to be set at work there it seemed that advancement must necessarily be rapid  even though he had had less reason of wishing to be occupied in this portion of the building he could not but have been delighted when he entered the wellappointed place and he gazed around in what was very like an ecstasy of joy until suddenly aroused by the voice of this new acquaintance  do you think you could keep things in proper shape here theres plenty of work to be done and at present we are getting none of the best  id like to have a chance to try sir  very well ill see to the red tape of the business downstairs and in the meanwhile do you set about doing whatever you think is necessary if lish davis wasnt mistaken ill see to it you get all the instruction in this portion of the building that you can stagger under and it may be well put a little more muscle into you twixt now and the next few months  then without having specified what it was he wished seth to busy himself with the grayhaired man turned to leave the gymnasium when he suddenly stopped and asked sharply  have you been to breakfast  no sir i was told that id get my grub here  then why didnt you tend to it when you first came in  cause i met you sir  i suppose you hadnt thought you might be needing something to eat  it would have been no great matter sir ive got along until noon a good many days without anythin an can do it again  theres no need of that here my son remember to get your meals on time for regularity of habitsalthough that will become a luxury if you are ever made a firemanregularity of habits is quite as necessary for the strength and building up of your body as any exercise you can take here so far as possible eat at the same hour each day go to bed early get up early and at all times see to it that your body is properly cared for when did you have a bath last  its been quite a spell since i went in swimmin sir  well you can begin the day with that use plenty of cold water and i reckon the towels are coarse enough then get your breakfast come up here and go to work  at anything special sir  whatever you see thats needed to be done  then this employer who had given him such good advice walked quietly away and seth was left to find the bathroom as best he might  during this day master bartlett worked as industriously as ever but with better heart than while employed about the first task set him at headquarters for he had reason to believe there was at least one in the building who would lend him a helping hand and the future seemed much brighter than it had twentyfour hours previous  this new friend who was spoken of as josh by those who seemed to be best acquainted with him and by others as mr fernald apparently gave no heed to the boy and seth did whatever seemed to him most necessary although there were many times when he was tempted to stop in order to watch the men at their exercises until halfpast five in the afternoon when the man whom he was beginning to look upon as a friend said sharply  get your supper now seth bartlett and tomorrow morning see to it that you have breakfast before coming up here  seth wanted to say goodnight to mr fernald but doubtful as to how such familiarity might be received he departed in silence turning around as soon as he was in the corridor where none could see him to wave his hand in adieu  supper had been eaten and he was on the sidewalk outside of headquarters just as the whistles were blowing for the hour of six  ill have a chance to stop a good while in ninetyfours house tonight an there may another alarm come sos i can go out with her again he said to himself and at that instant teddy bowser appeared from around the corner of the building and cried excitedly  dan roberts an bill dean sent me up here to tell you that sam barneys had jip collins rested this afternoon bout three oclock     chapter xii  the prisoner   it was several moments before seth could bring himself to believe that dan and bill dean had utterly failed in their efforts to save jip collins from the wouldbe detective  during the day he had given the matter comparatively little thought believing that having set out on their mission of mercy at such an early hour his roommates would succeed in their efforts  sam barney was known to all his acquaintances as a boy opposed to rising very early or working very hard and it had been no more than reasonable to suppose jip would be warned in time  teddy bowser could give very little information and that which he did impart only served to heighten the mystery  he stated that he met sam at about seven oclock that morning and talked with him concerning his visit to philadelphia with the purpose as previously agreed upon of delaying him until nearly nine oclock  that then the alleged detective had gone toward fulton market with the avowed intention of meeting a friend and teddy was positive jip had not been arrested until late in the afternoon  where was dan an bill when they sent you to tell me  over by jefferson market thats where jips been jugged  were they to wait there for me  thats what they reckoned on except you thought them firemen of yourn could help out  if jips really been rested i dont believe ninetyfours men could do anything cordin to the way mr davis talks well go right down to the market  during the long journey for neither seth nor teddy could afford to pay ten cents for carfare the latter told as nearly as he could remember sam barneys version of his visit to philadelphy  he says the way he figgered it out at first jip collins oughter been over there but hed found out his mistake soon enough if you fellers hadnt hurried him off  he didnt go for most a day after he acted bout crazy to get away  thats one of his excuses of course im jest givin you the fairy story he flashed up to me he says he wasnt any sooner in the train than he began to work the plan over in his mind sames all the detectives do an it didnt take him a great while to figger how it was at the jump he thought it was mighty queer that bill dean should go round raisin money to send him away an after he was in the cars he tumbled to himself dont you see to hear him tell it youd believe all he had to do was to set down an think over things to find out jest what was what  its a big pity he couldnt think who stole his money seth interrupted cordin to his story hes been after the thief ever since  he says he would have caught him if this case of jips hadnt turned up an seeins it was so much bigger he dropped everything else well after he made up his mind that the fellers what chipped in the money was tryin to run him out of town the train started so of course he had to keep on but hed fixed it with himself that he was bound to come straight back soons he could i reckon he swelled himself round the depot over in philadelphy blew in the sixteen cents he had an give some of the fellers a terrible stiff bout bein a detective till he borrowed money of em to come back the way he tells it is that jest as soon as he got there people knew who he was an give him a great reception he makes out that there was a slat of folks hangin round the station tryin to get a chance to see him but thats all in your eye of course  sam barney must be a fool if he thinks anybody is goin to believe such yarns  he must think it else he wouldnt tell em now cordin to his story some of them fellers was jest loaded with the stuff and they put up the price of a railroad ticket back i dont know what he did with himself while he was in the town cause you cant make out anything by what he says  why didnt he come back on the next train if everybody was ready to lend him money  he says he jest actually couldnt get away from the crowd that wanted to see him an talk to him so he stayed a spell to give em a good time by showin himself then when he got ready he swings on board an over he comes but hes chafin under the collar seth cause the fellers sent him off when he oughter have stayed an thats why hes so down on jip collins  he was jest as bad before bill dean ever begun to raise money to get rid of him else it would have been different i tried to make him promise to let jip alone an he wouldnt listen to any talk at all he thinks itll be a big thing for him in case he puts it through if i couldnt get on in the world except it was by sendin some feller to jail id stick to sellin papers or blackin boots the rest of my life  sam is pretty near green thinkin youve got ahead so fast but says that jest as soon as he has worked the case up against jip hell smash your racket all to pieces  have you seen him since he did this terrible fine piece of detective work  no i hadnt heard anythin bout it till dan hailed me  for some time after this seth remained silent trying to devise a plan by which he could aid the unfortunate firebug but the more he considered the matter the less probable did it seem that either he or his comrades could in any way benefit the prisoner  im fraid jip will go up the river he said at length and teddy replied mournfully  i guess hes a goner for a fact an all on account of sam barneys wantin to show hisself a detective  when the two had come to their journeys end dan and bill dean were seen solemnly pacing to and fro on the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the courtroom looking sadly disheartened  have you done anythin yet seth asked in a low tone as he joined them  theres nothin we can do jips locked up an sam barneys struttin round the streets showin hisself off for a firstclass detective dan replied in a tone of irritation  do you know how he happened to nab him  it must have been that denny macey give him away bill dean replied for i saw jip this mornin early an he greed to keep out er sight  do you spose he stayed on the street after that  denny knew where he slept last night and must have told sam jest as some of the fellers say he threatened to do  well seth said after a brief reflection if you cant help him whats the use of standin here  we was waitin for you i thought an so did dan that perhaps the driver of ninetyfour might cook up some kind of a plan we could work through anyhow it dont seem as though it would do much harm for you to talk with him  of course it wont but if it wasnt that jips likely to be sent to jail for a good many years i wouldnt bother him cause it dont seem the square shake for me to keep runnin there whenever things turn wrong  it would be pretty tough to let jip be sent up for four or five years jest cause you didnt want to bother ninetyfours crew  i know that bill an im goin to talk to mr davis now i was only sayin i wouldnt do it if things wasnt the way they are ill go ahead an you fellers meet me up to the room after i get through cause it wont do for all hands to loaf round in front of the enginehouse  to this proposition those who were ready to sacrifice their own pleasure and interests in order to aid the penitent firebug made no demur and seth set out at full speed leaving the others to follow at a more leisurely pace  hello amateur it seems to me youve knocked off work kinder late tonight lish davis cried as the boy entered the enginehouse  mr fernald the man who runs the gymnasium told me i was to go away every night at six oclock  so josh has taken you in hand as he promised eh  hes given me a chance up in the gymnasium where i cant help seein a good deal of the drillin even when im workin an it seems as though it was a mighty soft snap  josh aint a man wholl make it very soft for any boy youve got to toe the mark pretty straight with him amateur but if it so be you strike him just right things will move along in great shape why didnt you leave headquarters as he told you  i did sir but teddy bowser was waitin outside to tell me that sam barney has had jip collins rested for settin fire to the lumberyard  so so he has eh i thought you shipped that bloomin detective over to philadelphia  thats what we did mr davis but he managed to get back an tumbled to the trick we played on him so the very first thing he does is to get jip pulled  well whether it be boys or men who go wrong sooner or later theyve got to pay the penalty in some fashion and perhaps its just as well this collins chap should square matters now as at any other time  but it seems terrible mr davis to have him sent to jail for nobody knows how many years  itll be a good many if hes convicted on the charge of arson that i can give you as a straight tip  i was in hopes youd feel kind of bad about it mr davis seth said hesitatingly  meaning to say you counted on my trying to help pull him through after he destroyed valuable property and come pretty nigh being the death of you and your partner  well you see hes awful sorry  yes most of em are after the crime has been committed  but i dont blieve jip really meant to do anythin like that hed been blowin bout how hed serve us out an a good many of the fellers told him he didnt dare to so much as raise his hand that kinder started him an if he goes to jail now the shame of it will allers stick to him  then you believe hed work round and be a decently square kind of a boy if he got out of this scrape  im almost certain of it  well look here amateur it aint for a fireman to go here and there trying to defend them as have started a blaze but i wouldnt wonder if we could find some lawyer to take charge of his case perhaps we can get him off on the same plea youre using nowthat it would serve to make a criminal of him rather than work the proper kind of reformation therell be plenty of time lad because you and your partner are bound to be called on as witnesses even on the preliminary examination so until the officers find you two nothing can be done for i dont reckon your imitation detective has any knowledge of what happened  hes heard the rest of the fellers talk bout it  that dont cut any figger all he can testify to is what hes seen himself or something the prisoner may have told him ill turn this thing over in my mind and call on jerry walters and ben dunton for their advice when you come round tomorrow night well be able to say what can be done now tell me everything you did today thats of more interest to us of ninetyfours company than the arrest of the firebug  seth gave a detailed account of his movements from the time he entered headquarters until the hour of leaving and every man on the floor listened eagerly to the narration of unimportant doings which was the best proof they could have given of the deep interest felt in the amateur fireman  i reckon youll pull through all right lish davis said approvingly when seth brought the story to an end and now theres a word to be said about your behavior here this morning youll have plenty of work to do twixt 7 am and 6 pm without hustling over here before daylight and blacking our boots consequently were going to hire another boy sos to remove the temptation from your path  dont do it please dont do it mr davis seth cried imploringly it dont seem like work to me so long as i can be here every mornin an do somethin of the kind it pears as if i belong to the company sposen you get another feller to do the shinin an i come round evenins to tell you whats been goin on why it would only look as if i was a visitor i dont want to give up all my hold here an thats what will happen if somebody else does the shinin  there could be no question but that seth was deeply in earnest and more than one of the men nodded to the driver as if to say that the boy should be allowed to do as he pleased  jerry walters took it upon himself to say very decidedly  i think lish amateur is right an youve got no call to cut him off from what he wants to do specially after its been once agreed upon it aint that im figgering to have my boots shined for nothing but im feeling a good deal as he does id like to have him come round regularly an well be certain of it if theres work to be done  very well very well the driver replied he shall keep on for a spell though it aint to my liking if amateur was a kid that spent his time kiting round the streets it would be different but hes got to have some little amusement and how is it to be had if he starts in at daylight blacking boots works until six oclock at headquarters then spends his evening at the school why itll come nigh to using him up  he aint on at headquarters sunday is he  no but thats only one day in seven and so long as amateur is in our charge so to speak i aint going to have him get an idea that he can spend the sabbath cavorting round as some of his chums do  when i begin to take part in the drill at headquarters i shall have all the sport thats needed seth interrupted and besides even if i go to the nightschool ill get an hour in here between six an seven  and a heap of fun youll have with a lot of old cronies like us lish added with a laugh  id rather be here than anywhere else sir an if you want to give me a good time now and then an i happen to be round when theres an alarm let me go out with ninetyfour thatll be fun enough  lish winked at his comrades as if this remark pleased him exceedingly and put an end to the conversation by saying  look in here tomorrow night lad and well see whether its possible to help out your firebug or not now go home and turn in for you cant get too much sleep while youre young  seth obeyed without delay what was little less than a command and hastening to mrs hansons dwelling repeated to his roommates and teddy bowser all the driver had said to him concerning the possibilities of aiding jip collins  the boys were sadly disappointed because there was no actual promise of assistance  they had come to believe because they hoped it would be so that mr davis could immediately devise some plan whereby jip might be released from prison and since he did not appear to be sympathetic and enthusiastic on the subject they feared he might fail to take any active part  i am certain he will get a lawyer for him anyhow seth said in reply to their complaint an thats what we couldnt do ourselves if it wasnt for goin to headquarters id try to see the poor fellow tomorrow of course i wouldnt be able to do anythin for him but it would make him feel kind of good to know we was willin to help  ill go there tomorrow dan cried pleased at the idea of doing something even though he could not hope to effect any change in jips condition ill tell him what weve tried to do an therell be some satisfaction in that anyhow  then seth proposed that master roberts should hang around outside the department headquarters at about six oclock in the afternoon in order to report the result of the interview after which he would visit mr davis again  with this programme for the coming day thus settled upon the amateur fireman suggested that teddy bowser go home in order that he and his roommates might retire and half an hour later mrs hansons lodgers were sleeping soundly  the sun had not shown his face above the eastern horizon next morning when seth was at work in ninetyfours quarters performing such labor as came to hand and owing to the fact that the company had been fighting fire nearly all night no one save the house watchman was stirring when the amateur set off for his regular duties  at fifteen minutes before the hour of seven ninetyfours kid as some of the clerks at headquarters had already designated seth entered the gymnasium with a bustling air as if the hardest tasks would be no more than a pleasure  had your breakfast mr fernald asked gruffly  yes sir  how long since you turned out  it wasnt quite light when i left the house sir  have you been here all that time  oh no sir you see i go over to ninetyfours quarters to shine the company an it stands me in hand to be out of bed pretty early  what do you do to the company mr fernald asked as an expression of bewilderment came over his face  i shine for all handsblack their boots you know  yes i understand now isnt the work here enough to satisfy you but that you must needs look around for more  but i belong to that company sir an have to see my share of the business is done right up to the mark seth replied proudly and then he explained to mr fernald why he was eager to continue his connection with those who had already done so much to assist him  you seem precious eager to be a fireman  so i am sir an im hopin to get along here so ninetyfours men wont think im a duffer for not pushin ahead  fernald questioned him closely regarding his ambition to belong to the department and without being really aware of the fact seth had soon told him all he knew concerning himself and his desires  i dont say as youve got it in you to be a fireman the old man said thoughtfully but it strikes me you carry a good bit of sand an ive a mind to do even more than i promised lish davis see here my lad supposing you could practise here two or three hours a day would it tire you out so that the regular duties might be slighted  if youll give me the chance sir ill work enough later nights to make up for it all the boy replied eagerly  i guess davis didnt lay it on any too thick when he told me about you now see here youll begin the day with a regular course of training working until nine oclock after which time youll get down to a boys business see  yes sir seth replied trembling so violently with pleasure that only by the greatest exertion could he prevent his voice from quavering  had a bath this morning  no sir  then get one and remember to tumble into cold water the first thing after coming here  seth was off like a flash and when he returned glowing with the healthful exercise josh fernald gave him the first lesson in physical training  before it was concluded ninetyfours kid came to understand that lish davis had only spoken the truth when he said the instructor was not a man who would let up on boys to any extent for seth was forced to exert himself as he never remembered to have done during any previous two hours of his life  then the lesson was concluded and the amateur set about his ordinary duties working unusually hard lest mr fernald should decide that he could not at the same time attend to gymnastics and perform the services for which he was paid by the city  he was thoroughly tired when the hour for supper came around but so happy at having made some slight advancement toward his goal in life that all else was as nothing  that evening he bade mr fernald goodnight and received in reply the caution  dont think youll find any snap here its precious hard work an wont grow easier  ill stick at it sir if you dont get tired showin me how seth cried gleefully and as he walked sturdily toward the staircase holding himself erect and with head thrown well back like some animal glorying in his strength the old instructor gazed after him in almost a friendly manner  seth was so elated with the idea that he could tell ninetyfours men that he had actually begun his training as to have nearly forgotten the appointment made with dan but he soon remembered it when master roberts darted out from a hidingplace near at hand  well ive seen him he cried before seth had time to speak  who  jip collins of course  howd you get in  i was hangin round there lookin for a chance when your lish davis come along with a lawyer an i asked em to let me go in with them  mr davis took a lawyer there seth repeated in astonishment  thats what he did an i tell you seth that fireman is a jim dandy an no mistake  dont you spose i know that after all this time  yes but yet you didnt think hed do so much eh  hes mighty good to everybody how was jip lookin  terrible down youd think he was expectin to be hanged by the way he takes on i felt awful sorry for him even if he did burn us out  what did he say  not much of anythin but kept cryin bout all the time sam barney must be feelin awful good after makin so much trouble  have you seen him seth asked sharply  if i had hed be lookin for a doctor im jest achin to get my hands on that duffer in some side street where the perlice wont come snoopin round  see here dan you mustnt fight if you ever want to get that third avenoo store for i tell you no feller gets ahead by bein a tough what did the lawyer say  i didnt hear him yip but reckon youll know all about it after goin over to ninetyfours house  thats where im bound for now wait outside for me an ill come to you as soon as i can  i dont suppose i could sneak in  id rather you didnt dan cause it would look as if i was gettin mighty fresh to bring my chums along  all right old man ill wait outside  there was so much in seths mind that he could not indulge in conversation at that moment and he walked so rapidly that dan had but little opportunity for speaking however much he might have desired to say  at the enginehouse he found nearly all the company on the lower floor much as if waiting for his report and lish davis greeted him by asking  well amateur nothing but windowwashing today  no siree mr fernald has begun to give me lessons in the gymnasium an im to practise there two hours every day from this outthat is so long as i do it an keep my reglar work up in shape which cordin to my way of thinkin will be every minute i have the chance of stayin there  did josh really put you into physical training as quick as this mr davis asked almost incredulously  thats what he did an though i didnt get many points bout fires itll help me to grow in great shape  then dan waiting near the door on the outside heard ninetyfours crew cheering loudly and he was sadly at a loss to understand the meaning of such merriment when he believed they were discussing poor jips sad situation     chapter xiii  the letter   there could be no question but that ninetyfours company were highly delighted with the news brought by seth regarding his progress  it was as if each man felt personally complimented by mr fernald when he advanced the amateur so rapidly and all united in declaring that josh was a right good fellow  seth was in the highest degree excited he had expected that his friends of ninetyfour would be pleased at learning of his good fortune but never fancied they could be so deeply interested and now he began to understand what a gloom might be cast over the company if he should fail in this attempt to gain a foothold in the department  lish davis would not be content until the boy gave an exhibition of what he had learned in the way of gymnastic exercises during the morning and when this had been brought to a close amid the applause of all present the driver said in a tone of satisfaction  youre getting on in great shape amateur and if nothing happens to give you a pullback oughter be well up in the drill twixt now and a year from today josh fernald has the name of being precious hard on them as comes under him for instruction but ive always allowed hed boost along mighty fast any one who struck his fancy he must have seen that you were in earnest young fellow for when i talked with him the best promise i could get was that hed look you over in the course of a month or two  do they keep you humpin on the odd jobs amateur jerry walters asked solicitously  theres plenty to be done but not enough to kill anybody after i get used to the ways of the place i reckon itll come pretty easy  thats the kind of talk to make young fellow the driver cried approvingly dont allow that your jobs a hard one however tough it may be for a kid never gets any credit when hes always whining bout working to death  not until ten minutes or more had been spent in answering the questions asked by each member of the company including the captain himself was the curiosity of the men satisfied concerning the advancement of their protégé and then seth had an opportunity of inquiring as to the charge against the firebug  dan roberts said you carried a lawyer down to see poor jip mr davis the amateur began and instantly the look of pleasurable excitement faded from lish daviss face  so i did amateur so i did jerry and i allowed we might do that much for the kid even though he aint deserving of any mans attention  will he get out of the scrape  not before having a trial amateur and then all must depend on the judge it seems he owned up to the whole business when they first nabbed him and the only thing he can do now is to plead guilty the evidence that can be given by the kids from brooklyn will be enough to convict him even if he finds somebody to help him make a fight which wouldnt be good sense  then theres nothin for the poor fellow but to go up the river and seths voice was tremulous with sorrow  that aint altogether certain lad the lawyer thinks and jerry and i have the same idee that if he owns up to the whole thing like a little man it may be possible to have sentence suspended during good behavior  what do you mean by that mr davis seth asked in perplexity  why its jest like this when hes put on trial let him tell the truth we of ninetyfour can testify that it was he who sent in the alarm showing he was sorry as soon as the deed had been done then will come the time for the lawyer to get in his fine work hell do a lot of chinning bout the boys being young and that itll most likely make a criminal of him to be sent up in some such way as that the judge may be brought to believe that itll be the wisest course to suspend sentencethat is to say hold the conviction over him but at the same time letting him go free if he behaves himself well and good if not hes brought before the court and sentenced on this same charge at some future time  are you certain that can be done seth asked growing more hopeful  no amateur we aint certain but the chances are it can be fixed that way and well do our best at it if for no other reason than to show how good were feeling because youre doing us so much credit up at headquarters  seth had hoped that the members of ninetyfours company would be able to effect the firebugs release and it was a great disappointment to thus learn that nothing could be done save through the clemency of the judge but as he would have kept silent had it been himself who was in danger he refrained from giving words to his sorrow  understanding what was in his mind lish davis added in a kindly tone  dont take it to heart amateur for well do all that is possible and im allowing itll all come out straight in the end it wouldnt be well if he pulled through too easy  if only he dont have to go to jail for two or three years seth cried and then fearing he might say that which would sound like a complaint he took his leave after promising to report next evening  well i begun to think you was goin to stop there all night master roberts cried irritably when his partner appeared seemed like you was havin a mighty good time along at the first of it  that was when i was tellin how id been gettin on up at headquarters say jip will have to be tried in court  what cant ninetyfours men stop it dan cried in surprise for he had believed the firemen could do whatsoever they would and seth repeated all that lish davis had said adding in conclusion  youd better try to see him again an tell the poor fellow how things stand  hell take it mighty hard  im fraid so but theres nothin else that can be done is bill over to the room  he allowed hed have to stop downtown quite a spell tonight an i agreed to see him there after id met you why not take a spin as far as the postoffice  seth was not opposed to a stroll through the city even though wearied by his labors of the day  his heart was so sore because it would be impossible for him to do anything in jips behalf that he had no inclination to spend the time in his lodgings where he could do nothing save dwell upon the painful situation of the boy who had tried to injure him  after a short time dan succeeded in partially banishing his partners sorrowful thoughts by speaking of his own plans regarding the prospective store on third avenue and broached the subject by paying to seth his share of the roomrent  did you make all that today the amateur asked in surprise  yes an thirtytwo cents more  you must have humped yourself  thats jest what i did do you see if i count on ever ownin that store ive got to work sames you did to get into the department an i never lost a minute this mornin id made a big pile if it hadnt been for goin to see jip  then dan pictured to his partner in words the establishment he intended one day to own giving all the details with such exactness as to prove that he must have spent considerable time reflecting upon the matter  thats what i want he said as he concluded his description of the store but when you come to think that ive only got thirtytwo cents towards it there dont seem much chance ill ever pull through  youll have twice as much tomorrow night an every day itll keep on growin till in a little while youll have a pile thatll make your eyes stick out a feller can do pretty near what he counts on if he sticks right at it  you can bet ill stick at the store part of it though i aint certain as id ever believed it could be done if you hadnt got into the department when you was runnin to fires like as if there might be big money in it i counted it was foolishness but now the thing looks different  at this point the conversation was interrupted by sam barney who suddenly appeared from around a corner much as if he had popped out with the purpose of frightening them  seth would have passed the wouldbe detective without a word for after what had been done he felt no desire to so much as speak with him but now was the hour of master barneys triumph and he did not intend to lose any opportunity of sounding his own praises  well he cried stepping directly in front of the boys what do you think now bout my bein a detective  if you are one nobody knows it but yourself dan replied angrily  didnt i get jip collins arrested  yes an anybody might er done the same thing without startin in by goin to philadelphy it seems you wasnt much of a detective when you figgered that he was over there  if you fellers hadnt been so smart with your railroad ticket id never gone cause it didnt take me very long to see how id made a mistake in figgerin after i put my mind right down to it  i notice you hung round here two days waitin for us to raise the money couldnt you find the mistake before then  i didnt try but when i started in without bein mixed up with a crowd of duffers like you i soon put the thing through  yes it was big detective work to walk over to thirtyfourth street ferry an find him  i snaked him right out er a house where he was hidin  then denny macey was the one who gave jip away an ill have a settlement with that chump some day dan cried angrily  now for the first time seth took part in the conversation by saying curtly to sam  youve got jip in jail an think its goin to be a big thing to brag about but i dont believe youll make any great shakes out of it come on dan we dont want to hang round here any longer  youre feelin mighty fine seth bartlett jest cause youre given the chance to loaf round the fire department headquarters an sweep the floors sam cried angrily i spose you think youre pretty nigh the only feller in this town  come ahead dan and seth would have passed on but that the wouldbe detective barred his way  i dont want any talk with you sam barney an whats more i wont have any  wont eh suppose i slap your face howll it be then  instinctively seth put himself in a posture of defence and instantly afterward realized that he must not be accused of making a disturbance on the street lest it work to his harm in the department  then once again he would have passed master barney  the wouldbe detective was not brave save where he believed he had a decided advantage and the fact that seth seemed eager to avoid an encounter gave him great confidence in his own abilities  he stepped up menacingly brandishing his fists directly under seths nose and dan cried sharply to his partner  why dont you knock his head off  he dont dare to so much as raise his hands except hes up round ninetyfours house where he thinks some of the firemen will back him sam cried derisively as he redoubled his efforts to provoke the amateur  seths cheeks were flaming red and he clenched his fists until the knuckles were white in the effort to restrain himself  if he had been alone there is every probability he might have forgotten his determination to avoid such encounters for the wouldbe detective was doing all he could to provoke a quarrel but dan roberts understanding full well why his partner remained inactive when the temptation to strike at least one blow was very great took it upon himself to put an end to the scene  sam was standing directly in front of seth brandishing his fists and indulging in such epithets as coward and sneak when dan sprang forward suddenly striking the bully a blow under the ear that sent him headlong into the gutter  then after looking quickly around to make certain there were no policemen within earshot he leaped upon the discomfited detective seizing him by the coatcollar in such a manner that it was impossible for sam to raise his head  youre awful keen on havin a row an im goin to give you the chance you knew seth wouldnt put up his hands because he dont count on havin any black marks against him when he goes into the department but i aint figgerin on anythin of that kind an can stand a little bit of a bad name for the sake of servin you out  come on dan come on dont make a row here cause in the first place sam barney aint worth it an then again you mustnt get up a name for fightin  i reckon that dressin this chump down wont set me off very bad an im willin to take the risks now stand up and show what you can do he added as he released his hold of the detectives collar  sam made no effort to rise nor did he so much as reply  you was terrible sharp for a row with seth cause you counted on his not mixing up with sich as you im a good bit smaller than he is an am ready to give you all the fightin thats wanted come on and be funny sames you was a minute ago  i aint got any row with you dan roberts sam muttered  whats the reason you havent got as much of a one with me as you had with seth were partners an he never said half the rough things about you that i have  leave me alone or ill yell for the perlice  i thought you wasnt achin terrible bad for a fight and dan flourished his fists precisely as sam had done while trying to provoke seth yell for the perlice will yer ive a precious good mind to give you a couple of black eyes only that i hate to hit a feller who dont dare to put up his hands  come on dan dont spend your time with him seth cried he wont fight an never would there wouldnt been any bluff made if he hadnt known id promised myself not to get the name of bein a bruiser  dan did as his partner suggested and the wouldbe detective remained quietly in the gutter until the two were half a block away when he arose and cried vindictively  ill get square with you fellers yet well see whether seth bartlett swells round headquarters much longer  dont say a word seth whispered as dan half turned to make some reply all he wants is to get me into a row an itll please the chump too well if we chin with him im sorry you let yourself out  i aint i reckon that much of a fight wont count very hard against the third avenoo store for ill earn jest as big a pile of money tomorrow as if id let him make his bluff but it might er been different with you  seth was by no means pleased with the outcome of this affair although he did not say as much to his partner  it seemed as if he had acted a cowardly part in allowing sam to insult him and then remain passive while dan took up the quarrel  he was positive he ought never to fight simply to please a bully but equally confident that he was not manly to stand still while a fellow like sam barney imposed upon him  it was a matter which he could not settle satisfactorily in his own mind for whatever course he might have pursued seemed to be wrong  ill see what mr davis thinks about it he said to himself and then added to dan it was mighty good of you old man to give sam one clip for me but i cant make out whether i oughter stood still or put up my hands  dont bother your head about it master roberts replied carelessly that chump detective wont fool round us any more an were well rid of him of course hell do a pile of blowin an tellin how hell get square with us but his talk aint anythin moren wind  this assurance did not content seth now his only desire was to go home but dan had no idea of curtailing his enjoyment because of the encounter therefore the amateur felt in duty bound to do as he wished  that night jips friends were informed of what lish davis had said and while the majority regretted the necessity which kept master collins a prisoner all agreed that perhaps it might not be well for him to escape the consequences of his act too easily  when seth returned from headquarters on the following evening with the report that mr fernald had continued his instruction in gymnastics he learned that dan had thanks to the lawyer employed by ninetyfours men been allowed to hold a long and private conversation with the prisoner  jip was still very penitent and declared he deserved all the punishment which the law might inflict upon him but at the same time it could readily be seen according to master robertss statement that he was wonderfully relieved by the hope lish davis held out  from what the lawyer told me dan said when detailing to his partner all that had occurred during the interview itll be quite a spell before jip comes up for trial an so long as he stays in jail i cant see but hes gettin the best of it three square meals every day an at night a bed bettern hes had since he could remember  but hes locked in an thats what makes it hard to stand up under seth suggested whereupon dan cried with no little warmth  id be willin to let em lock me up nights for the sake of havin it as easy as it is for jip nothin to do an livin off the fat of the land  i reckon after one day youd be willin to take less an have a chance to go where you pleased seth replied so emphatically that master roberts did not consider it wise to continue the argument  during the three days which followed the amateur fireman worked so hard to win the approval of his teacher that mr fernald finally told him he was trying to do too much and cut down his tasks nearly one half an act which won for him the unqualified approval of ninetyfours crew  it was on the morning of the fifth day after jip collinss arrest and just as josh fernald was bringing seths lesson to a conclusion that one of the employés entered the gymnasium with a letter and cried in a loud voice  does anybody here know a fellow by the name of seth bartlett  thats me the amateur replied after a moments thought but i dont reckon ive got a letter cause theres nobody whod write to me  heres what the address says and the young man held the envelope in such a manner that both the boy and his instructor could see the superscription  seth bartlett fireman up at headquarters new york  seth made no attempt to take the missive until mr fernald asked quite sharply  why dont you take it theres no other of that name here so far as i know  i never had a letter an it cant be for me  youre the only seth bartlett in the building and it must belong to you the messenger said impatiently whereat he threw the missive toward seth and went his way  not until mr fernald had peremptorily ordered the boy to open the letter in order to see if it was intended for him did the amateur as much as touch the soiled envelope but after having torn it open the expression on his face told that the writer was not a stranger  this is what seth read in illformed letters many of them occupying the depth of two lines some in written and others in printed characters  seth bartlett fireman up at headquarters  deer seth  sam barney struck this town the other day an borrowed a dollar off er me you know my folks stopped here on the way to baltimore an ive been tryin to earn a little money sos to see me threw im in philadelphy an sam cum over here with a big stiff bout how you an bill dean had cent him to hunt for jip collins he was broke an ced if id let him have money enuf to git home you or bill would pay it back its been most a week sence he was here an i aint heard from you why dont you send the good dollar i put up to help you along im livin at 145112 filbert street an want my stuff      yours till deth shal part us      joe carter  so the letter is for you even though you never received one before mr fernald quietly remarked as seth having read the lines after considerable difficulty refolded the paper and returned it to the envelope  yes sir an its from a feller in philadelphy i dont reckon you know who jip collins is but this has got somethin to do with his business  as he spoke seth unfolded the paper and handed it to his instructor who after deciphering it quite naturally asked for an explanation  if you owe this boy money send it to him at once for people who do not pay their bills are in bad odor up here  i never borrowed a cent of him seth cried indignantly and then he told mr fernald the whole story  the old instructor appeared to be amused by the recital and when it was concluded asked if seth wanted leave of absence to straighten the matter out  ill have plenty of time after leaving here tonight but what bothers me is that i may have a row with sam barney cause i aint goin to let him swell round borrowin money on my account  and in that you are perfectly right my boy  he knows i dont dare to fight on the street cause it may give me a black mark in the department an that would never do so i reckon hell be mighty lippy bout it  ask lish davis i cant recommend you to create a disturbance and yet it seems hard you should be imposed upon because of the situation whatever the driver of ninetyfour advises you may do without fear of the consequences for there isnt a more levelheaded man in the department and its only his lack of education that has prevented him from rising in the service  ill see him tonight seth replied as he put the letter in his pocket and then without further delay he set about his regular duties     chapter xiv  the subpoena   impatient though seth was to talk with lish davis and his roommates concerning what had been done by sam barney in the matter of borrowing money on the account of others he made no attempt to leave headquarters a single moment earlier than usual  when the hours of labor had come to an end however he did not linger and with a cheery goodnight to mr fernald for by this time the teacher and his pupil were on excellent terms he set off at full speed for ninetyfours house  unless they were out on duty this particular company since seth went to work at headquarters could always be found on the lower floor of the building at about six oclock in the evening awaiting the arrival of their kid and here master bartlett found them  from the expression on his face all hands understood that something unpleasant had occurred and lish davis asked in a tone of anxiety  whats gone wrong amateur havent been getting into trouble with josh i hope  mr fernald is mighty kind to me he says i shall go in the yard next week for half an hour each day an then you know ill have a great chance to pick up points  once he starts you in there the road is pretty straight up to a job in the department you look so kinder peaked i was afraid something had gone wrong  read that an then i reckon youll think somethin has gone wrong seth exclaimed as he gave the driver joe carters letter unfolding the sheet that there might be no needless time spent in mastering its contents  read it aloud lish jerry walters cried and the driver glanced toward seth as if asking permission to do so  go ahead mr davis of course everybody belongin to this company has a right to know all about my business  davis did as he was requested reading slowly as if enjoying the matter hugely and interrupted now and then by exclamations of surprise or amusement from his comrades  well what do you think of it seth asked angrily when the driver having come to the end remained silent  it begins to look as if your friend the detective could manage to take care of himself by hook or by crook i cant see that either you or bill dean is bound by any such a transaction unless you gave sam permission to borrow money on your account  of course we wasnt such fools as to do that its a reglar swindle thats what it is an if id known bout it when dan and me met him downtown im fraid id punched his head even if it would be fightin on the street  whats that mr davis asked sharply something been going on that we havent heard  i counted on tellin you but it seems as if theres always a bother to talk bout so i waited a spell  then seth gave a detailed account of the encounter with the wouldbe detective and when he had concluded the recital lish davis looked around at his companions as if waiting to hear their comments before he expressed an opinion  you oughter lit right out on him jerry walters cried warmly he thinks you wont fight an will keep on makin trouble for you till he learns that it aint safe  dont listen to such advice seth the captain added quickly you did perfectly right and are to be praised for it more particularly since the temptation must have been very great  then the men began what finally grew into a heated discussion as to how the boy should have acted under such provoking circumstances and not until it was brought to a close did lish davis give his opinion  im allowing that you cant afford to raise a brawl amateur he said deliberately if that imitation detective mounted to anything the case might be different and though im free to say that every man or boy should defend himself when its necessary theres no wisdom in raising a disturbance while its possible to walk on the trouble is that too many of us are apt to think we cant get away from what appears to be a bad scrape without coming to blows but in nine cases out of ten that isnt the truth  but what am i to do bout this money he borrowed from joe carter seth asked as the driver ceased speaking  i cant see that youve got any call to disturb yourself write and tell the boy in philadelphia that the imitation detective had no authority to borrow money in your name and let that settle it  this did not appear to seth the proper course for he felt that he was in a certain sense bound to prevent joe carter from losing anything by being thus confiding but yet he would not have questioned the drivers decision  its mighty aggravating amateur im free to confess lish davis added as he noted the expression on the boys face but you must remember that the poorest way to settle a difficulty is by fighting when youre where its got to be done in order to save yourself from being hurt or robbed then put up your hands like a man first making certain theres no other way out if its all the same to you im counting on toddling down to tenth street tonight  do you mean that im goin to school now  i reckon the time has come when you may as well begin jerry walters and me have made the trade so after youve slicked up a bit drop in here and well start  all right sir seth cried as he hurried away to make ready for what he knew must be a trying ordeal he understood that he was remarkably ignorant for one of his years and had an idea that every pupil in the school would make sport of him  when the amateur fireman arrived at his lodgings he found his roommates awaiting him and in the fewest possible words made known sam barneys misdemeanor producing joe carters letter in proof of his assertion  it can well be imagined that both the boys were angry and surprised by the information and bill insisted that all three set out at once in search of the offender  ive got to start in on school tonight an so i cant go seth replied mournfully  how long are you goin to keep up sich a racket as that dan asked as if personally aggrieved because such a course was to be pursued  cordin to the way mr davis talks ill have to stick at it till im a reglar fireman an perhaps a good bit after that  then id give up tryin to get into the department master roberts replied emphatically i wouldnt do all that funny business if i never mounted to anythin moren a bootblack  its jest what you oughter do dan if you ever expect to own that third avenoo store  id like to know why  now thats a foolish question sposen you got the shop this very minute an wanted to write a letter or figger up how much anythin cost what kind of a fist would you make of it  dan did not reply but changed the subject of conversation by asking bill  what er you goin to do bout sam barney  you an me will hunt him up an by the time were through with the chump he wont borrow money in sich a way agin i reckon wholl write to joe carter bout it  if seth is goin to school he oughter do that much cause itll come right in his line of business  ill do the best i can at it the amateur fireman replied readily and added as his friends turned to leave the room now dont have a reglar row with that chump itll be enough if you show him up to all the fellers as a reglar fraud and then you wont stand any chance of gettin into trouble with the perlice  well tend to the business in proper shape bill replied in a meaning tone and seth was not sadly disturbed in mind as he understood or thought he did that sam barney would spend a very unpleasant evening if these two acquaintances chanced to meet him  when he was alone seth set about making preparations for beginning his pursuit of knowledge and the prospect before him was by no means pleasant  lish davis was awaiting his arrival when he reentered the enginehouse and immediately began laughing heartily at the expression on the boys face  it aint going to be half as bad as youre counting on amateur the driver cried as soon as he could control his mirth and then the two set out  mr davis had but one remark of importance to make during the journey and that impressed seth more than anything which had been said to him that day  if id spent half or even a quarter of my spare time while i was a boy in study instead of being only the driver of ninetyfour i might be her captain at the very least you may have got it into your head that firemen dont know anything except how to use an axe or handle hose but its a big mistake if you want to keep on rising in the department youve got to have more booklearning than i was willing to get  when they arrived at the school lish did not spend very much time in introducing his protégé  heres the kid i was telling you about he said and then seth was left to fight his own battle  that going to school was not as hard as he had fancied was known at the enginehouse when the amateur returned shortly after nine oclock for then he said with an air of relief  i aint so certain but that ill like it after i kinder get the hang of things  course you will amateur course you will but its bound to be hard work and there dont seem to be much chance for play in your life the way weve mapped it out for you all hands of us have been figgering how wed kinder let up on you and its been decided that you shall sleep here every saturday night what calls come in twixt the ending of the school business and midnight youre to answer as if belonging reglarly to the company  seths eyes glistened with delight and when he had gone to his room the driver said in a tone of satisfaction to his comrades  that kid is bound to make his mark in the department some day and well be patting ourselves on the head for having given him a show just think of a boy like him being tickled way up in g when you give him a chance to work at a fire he was reglarly born for the business  when seth arrived at mrs hansons he found his roommates awaiting his arrival  didnt you find sam he asked in surprise that they should have returned so soon  thats what we did met him down by the postoffice where there was a whole crowd of the fellers an by this time i reckon he dont think hes a terrible big man  what did he say bout givin joe carter sich a yarn  first off he tried to say it wasnt so but when we flashed up the letter it was all over an the chump couldnt so much as yip cept to promise to pay the bill with the very first money he could scrape together  then you didnt have any row  not a bit of it  i was fraid you might thump him an the perlice would jump in  we didnt reckon on bein jugged jest cause of him bill replied quietly instead of fightin dan jest shoved him inside the postoffice quicklike an i let him have a couple of mighty good clips alongside the head when he yelled we lit out an come up here if it hadnt been that youre tryin so hard to get into the department we might er had a row with the duffer but seeins anythin of the kind would give you a black eye we kept quiet  dan and master dean both appeared to think they deserved praise for having been so cautious and seth did not believe it would be wise to reproach them for what had been done  after this affair there was nothing out of the ordinary in seths life for ten days or more except during the two saturday nights he slept at ninetyfours house where on each occasion it was his good fortune to go out with the engine  at headquarters mr fernald pushed him along in the drill as rapidly as possible and he was allowed to devote considerably more than two hours each day to the lessons  at school he made as much advancement as could have been expected and really came to look forward with pleasure upon his tasks there for lish daviss remark as to the value of an education had not been forgotten  then came the day when he was summoned from the yard where he had been taking part in a drill with ladders to meet a stranger who handed him a printed document the meaning of which he failed to understand until mr fernald explained that it was a subpoena or in other words a command for him to appear in court on the following morning to give evidence in the case of the state vs jipson collins  the officer who brought the summons stated that he had served a similar document upon dan roberts a few hours previous and cautioned seth against failing to obey  i reckon theyll have to get along without me cause i cant leave here he replied as if believing such an excuse must be accepted by any fairminded judge  then it was mr fernald explained the nature of a subpoena and seth was decidedly surprised at learning that he could and probably would be arrested if he refused to obey  there is no need of your coming here at all tomorrow the old man said no matter how early you may get out of court youre needing a holiday lad and im glad of an excuse for giving you one  not until he returned from school that evening did seth see his roommates and then he found them in a high state of excitement because of the approaching trial  mr davis says he shall be there an the lawyer is to tend right out sos to say a good word for poor jip when the time comes seth hastened to state and from that moment until it seemed absolutely necessary they should retire the boys discussed the probable fate of the firebug  next morning when seth went to the enginehouse to perform his customary task of blacking the mens boots dan set out with him saying as they left mrs hansons  if it wasnt for that third avenoo store i wouldnt go downtown today till it was time for the trial to begin but i cant lose a whole mornins work  thats the way to stick at it seth cried approvingly how much money have you got laid up  three dollars an five cents oh im gettin there old man though cordin to the way things are workin itll take quite a spell  youll strike a rush some day an then itll pile up in great shape stick at it dan  thats what im reckonin on doin an say seth if it dont cost too much im goin to tend out on school sames you do bill has greed to come into the snap an well make it lively all round  it wont cost you a cent mr davis says so  then well begin tonight but i dont want the fellers to know about it cause theyd set up sich a terrible howl  dan did not waste any more time in conversation but hurried away to take advantage of the early demand for papers and lish davis said sagely when seth had repeated the conversation to him  now you can see the result of a good example amateur if you had kicked against going to school your roommates neverd thought of trying the same game and so by helping yourself youve gone a long way towards helping others contrariwise if youd been cutting round town raising rows and getting into all kinds of trouble youd find them as would follow in your track so its a pretty sure thing that a boy is bound to walk straight because of the effect itll have on others even if for no other reason  seth made no reply to this brief lecture he was learning very much of life through his intercourse with ninetyfours men and it seemed to him as if each day some new idea regarding a boys work was to be gained  your firebug has his chance this forenoon eh lish asked after a short pause  yes sir an im hopin mighty hard that hell get off this time  i reckon a good deal depends on you and your partner  how do you mean  if the firebug pleads guilty as his lawyer has advised him to the judge will only call on you two witnesses to tell how it happened sos he can get an idea of about how hard jip oughter be punished  then if we talk smooth he stands a better chance eh  thats bout the size of it amateur  during the remainder of the time he spent in ninetyfours quarters seth was unusually thoughtful and immediately his work was finished he asked the driver if there was any objection to his going downtown  now see here amateur theres no call for you to come round me with a question like that im only too glad youve got a chance to get a holiday and i advise you to spend all the time till the hour for school among your old chums i dont reckon youve got any big pile of money left by this time eh  well i dont need a cent cept for my rent an that aint costin such a terrible pile  have you got enough to buy your breakfast with  ill get whatever i need  see here amateur how much money have you on hand lish asked so sternly that seth could no longer evade the question  well im broke but theres no need of my havin a single cent i aint doin much swellin lately  take this and the driver thrust a dollar in seths hands i aint giving it to you so theres no call to kick youve got to borrow it or go hungry and that im not minded you shall do  i havent done anything of the kind yet a while the amateur replied with a hearty laugh and then he began to speak of jip once more lest lish davis might take it into his head to ask how long he had thus been penniless for it was nearly a week since he had so much as a nickel in his pocket  ill pay back the dollar as soon as i get my months wages he said as his work finished he made ready to go downtown and the driver replied cheerily  im counting on it amateur and im also reckoning that youll come to me again when thats gone else you and me will have a settling that wont be pleasant to one of us  then seth started downtown with a smile on his face as he repeated again and again to himself  folks are mighty good to me mighty good  when he arrived in that locality where he formerly transacted business his old friends welcomed him heartily and every one who claimed the slightest acquaintance had a great many questions to ask concerning his position at headquarters  not until nearly the hour set for the witnesses to be at court did seth find an opportunity of speaking privately with his partner and then he repeated what lish davis had said as to the possible effect their evidence might have in the case  we must be careful to tell the truth dan but theres no need of our rubbin it in very bad  thatll be all right master roberts replied confidently jest wait till the judge begins to pump me an youll see how slick ill make it for jip  dont put it on too thick  see here seth i reckon i know how to run this thing dont you worry bout me but be kinder thinkin up what youll say  i dont spose well have a chance for anything cept to answer questions  ill bet i can sneak in a good word now an then never mind how hard they try to stop me say have you seen sam barney  no is he goin to the court  cordin to the way hes been swellin hisself out this mornin youd think he was countin on runnin the whole thing he told some of the fellers that the trial wouldnt begin if he wasnt there cause hes the only one who can send jip up the river bill wanted me to go in with him for usin the chump so rough he couldnt moren crawl an that would fix things for jip but i was fraid it might make talk in the court sos youd get the worst of it  its better to let him alone though im awful sorry hes so set on this detective business cause if it hadnt been for that jip neverd been rested  at this moment bill dean joined his friends with the information that the wouldbe detective had already started for the courtroom and proposed that they set out at once  im goin to get a seat close to that duffer an let him know hell get his face into trouble if he tells any moren is called for i wonder why he couldnt be yanked up for lyin to joe carter when he borrowed that money if he should have a dose of it in jail i reckon he wouldnt be so hot to see jip sent up  dan was uncertain whether a charge might not have been brought against the wouldbe detective because of what he had done in philadelphia but dismissed the matter without very much study on the ground that it was now too late to render such a course of advantage to the firebug  then the three followed or accompanied by nearly all their acquaintances went toward the courtroom     chapter xv  the trial   the doorkeeper of the court attempted to check the rush which began with the entrance of seth dan and bill but it was impossible because of his delay  he had at first objected to admitting the amateur fireman and his partner but they speedily proved they were entitled to enter by producing the subpoenas and as he stepped aside for them to go in the following came on with a rush as powerful as it was unexpected  the official would have swept down upon the offenders and literally dragged them out but that lish davis who was standing just inside the door said with a laugh  i dont reckon youve got time to sort em mr officer a kid is to be tried for arson this morning and moren likely as not half the crowd has been summoned as witnesses for its only through his acquaintances that anything can be proven  the doorkeeper looked for an instant at the buzzing throng which had settled down upon the front seats and understanding what a difficult task he might be setting himself evidently decided that mr davis was in the right  sam barney already sat on the front row of seats allotted to spectators when mrs hansons lodgers entered and although seth would have been better pleased to remain at a greater distance from the wouldbe detective bill dean forced him along until they were directly behind jips enemy  dont speak to him seth whispered im sorry were so near the duffer  its jest where i counted on gettin bill replied in a tone of satisfaction i wont have any row with the chump but only shake him up a bit  if we make any noise all hands will be fired out  watch an see how quiet ill be master dean replied and then before his companion could check him he had leaned over and whispered in sams ear be mighty careful you tell the truth in this court or ill let out to the judge what you did in philadelphy an then perhaps jip collins wont be the only prisoner round here  master barney turned quickly and an expression of disquiet came over his face as he saw who were directly behind him  he did not venture to make any remark nor did bill think it wise to repeat the threat but he shook his fist warningly which served the same purpose  be quiet seth whispered imploringly it would be terrible if we got into a row here for mr davis is standing close by the door watchin us  i wont do a thing till we get outside unless it happens that i have to tell the judge bout sams borrowin that money master dean replied in a tone sufficiently loud to be heard by the alleged detective  then the attention of all the sidewalk merchants was attracted to the opposite side of the room by dan roberts who whispered loudly pointing with outstretched finger  there he is theres jip  the prisoner was being led in by a burly policeman who kept a firm hold on the boys collar as if fearful he might make some desperate attempt at escape and there was not a person in the courtroom with the probable exception of sam barney who failed to feel a certain sympathy for the frightened lad  thats his lawyerthe little feller with the big nose dan whispered so loudly that not only his friends in the immediate vicinity but all the attorneys within the enclosure set apart for their especial use heard the words and much merriment ensued during which the cause of it looked around in surprise unable to discover the meaning of it  seth and dan who had never before attended the trial of a prisoner expected there would be considerable ceremony in which policemen would play a prominent part therefore the case was begun and gone on with to some extent before they were aware of the fact  it is true they saw jip collins standing up while the clerk read from a paper a quantity of words which had no meaning to them and after a time the prisoner was allowed to sit down again  then the little man with the big nose talked to the judge as if confiding in him some secret after which the clerk called loudly  daniel roberts daniel roberts  seths partner gazed about him curiously never once thinking the clerk referred to him until lish davis coming swiftly down from his station near the door leaned over and pinched dans ear as he asked  why dont you answer to your name  is it me they mean dan asked and at that instant the clerk repeated the call  dan looked about him in perplexity uncertain as to what he should do until lish reached over to seize him by the collar when he cried in a shrill voice  here i be mister  come forward to the witnessstand the official said sharply while the spectators laughed heartily  it was several moments before master roberts could be made to understand exactly where he should go and then assisted by lish davis and the clerk he finally gained the stand where he stood gazing around with the most friendly expression on his face  for some reason no question was asked immediately and after waiting two or three moments dan believing the judge was ready to hear his story began earnestly  you see its jest this way jip he didnt count on doin anything off color an if it hadnt been for sam barney  silence in the court the crier called and dan looked up in surprise at being interrupted so soon  he didnt reckon on bein  dan stopped again as the same voice called loudly for silence in the court and then the attorney employed to defend jip explained matters by saying  you must wait until you are questioned daniel there will be ample opportunity to give your evidence  dan aint goin to let any chance slip him bill dean whispered confidentially to seth and sam barney said in a tone sufficiently loud to be heard by those immediately behind him  hes a reglar chump else hed know enough to behave hisself on the witnessstand  hell behave himself outside on the sidewalk in a way you wont like if you shoot off your mouth too much bill whispered and seth shook his friends arm warningly lest he disturb the court by his threats  lish davis evidently saw that there was bad blood between the alleged detective and seths roommate and at once forced the boys on the front seat to move nearer together until he had room to sit where he could keep all of them under his eye a proceeding which caused the amateur fireman great relief of mind  after what seemed like a long time in waiting jips attorney asked the witness  what is your name  dan appeared surprised at such a question and after some slight hesitation replied  why im the feller you told to come here didnt you hear the man call my name this is where they said i was to stand  the judge rapped smartly on the desk in front of him and dan turned quickly to see what had happened  answer properly the questions asked of you  thats what  the attorney interrupted him by asking as before  what is your name  its dan roberts of course an i was  are you acquainted with the prisoner  do you mean jip why of course i am him an me used to work together when he lived with seth bartlett  answer only the questions asked of you the judge said sternly and for the instant dan was abashed but quickly recovered himself as he remembered what seth had said regarding the possibility of aiding jip by his evidence  where were you when he set fire to the shed in baxters lumberyard  now see here mister jip never d done that  where were you the attorney repeated speaking so sharply that for the moment dan was startled  why in the shed of course we  had you heard the prisoner threaten to set fire to the shed  he didnt mean a word of it did you jip he was  unless you answer the questions which are asked and in a proper manner we shall find some means of punishing you the judge said sternly and jips attorney whispered a few words in the ear of the witness which had the effect of checking him for the time being  he was questioned regarding what he had heard jip say as to burning the shed how many times such threat had been repeated in his presence and what the prisoner had told concerning the crime after it had been committed  it was the last question which set loose the floodgates of his speech and regardless of the judges warnings or the attorneys nervous gestures he said speaking rapidly in order that all might be told before they should check him  jip he was awful sorry cause hed done it an said hed square things if wed let him he wouldnt even put up his hands when i was goin to thump him an if sam barney hadnt wanted to show hisself off for a detective there wouldnt been any fuss like this what does he know bout bein a detective why i wouldnt  by this time the court officials managed to stop the flow of words but not before he had shaken his fist in the direction of sam and caused even the judge to smile  you may step down the clerk said after order had been restored and dan asked innocently  aint you goin to give me a chance to  step down was the stern command and master roberts was forced to obey much to his displeasure  ill bet id fix things if theyd give me a chance he whispered to seth as he took his seat but that lawyer lish davis hired dont mount to a row of pins  then the amateur firemans name was called and he proved a more satisfactory witness to all concerned than had master roberts  he replied briefly to the questions and when the examination was ended the judge asked how jip had behaved after the crime was committed  then it was that seth had an opportunity of telling how penitent the firebug had appeared to be how eager he was to do all in his power toward repairing the wrong and declared he did not believe the prisoner would go crooked again  lish davis next went on the stand and although he could not swear to jips repentance he testified that the prisoner himself had sent in the alarm and succeeded in saying many a good word for the boy  that driver is a dandy dan whispered approvingly i wish the lawyer was half as good  master roberts was better satisfied with the attorney a short time later when he made a plea that sentence be suspended on the prisoner who had promptly confessed his guilt and even at the moment when the crime had been committed did all in his power to repair the mischief  then two or three others had something to say but they appeared to be talking privately with the judge rather than conducting the case and to the great surprise of all the small spectators sam barney was not called to the witnessstand  the fact that he had compassed the arrest of the prisoner was not even mentioned much to the delight of dan and bill dean each of whom leaned forward from time to time to ask in a cautious whisper as to when the big detective work was goin to be showed up  after a time it seemed to those in the front seats as if the prisoner had been forgotten by the court for nothing was said to or about him and bill was on the point of asking seth if the trial was concluded when the judge ordered jip to stand up  then he lectured him severely on the crime of arson explained how many years of his life would be spent in prison if the provisions of the law were carried out to their fullest extent and finally announced that sentence would be suspended during good behavior  at this point lish davis left the courtroom as if he no longer had any interest in the proceedings and after a certain time the attorney led jip out of the building the latters acquaintances following in a body  is it all over dan cried seizing the attorney by the arm in order to hold his attention and before the gentleman could speak sam barney cried vindictively  you can bet it aint all over ive been buncoed by a lot of cheap firemen an dont count on holdin my tongue youll see jip collins in jail again before hes a day older  yes it is all over the attorney said in reply to dans question so long as jip behaves himself nothing more will be done but if he should go wrong sentence for this crime will be pronounced and most likely he will be given the extreme penalty  can sam barney have him arrested dan asked  no one can trouble him on this charge while he lives an honest life  then ill see that that duffer holds his tongue and bill started toward the wouldbe detective in a threatening manner but the latter was not minded to take any chances of an encounter  he turned and fled instantly bill made the advance and did not halt until he was half a block or more away when he shouted  wait an see what ill do to all you chumps who think youre so awful smart  ill give you a chance of seein what ill do an without much waitin if you make any more cheap talk  with this threat bill turned his back on the disappointed sam and seth begged of him to remain quiet  its all right now he replied complacently ive had my say an if sam knows whats good for him hell keep his tongue quiet there aint any reason why i shouldnt fight an hell soon find it out  then seth turned to the attorney who was yet talking with jip and asked  hows he goin to pay you for lookin after him  i dont expect he can the bill was settled by some firemen belonging to ninetyfour engine  with this the lawyer after advising jip to call upon him from time to time went his way and mrs hansons lodgers stood looking at each other as if expecting some important proposition was about to be made  it wont do to take you up to our house jip cause there are three of us already an the boss of the place cant have all the boys in the city runnin in an out there for sixty cents a week seth said hesitatingly wondering what could be done with the lad who had been put on probation  i ain thinkin you could take me there master collins replied promptly now im out ill begin to sell papers down by the ferry again cause ive got fourteen cents left an if sam barney leaves me alone ill pull through all right  if he so much as looks crossways at you ill give him something to remember me by bill cried  its a good thing to get right at your work seth said approvingly stick at it an us fellers will come to see you whenever we get a chance  youve been mighty good to me all three of you an i only wish i could  it was impossible for the penitent firebug to say anything more the tears he had been holding back since he first appeared in court now came out in full force and seated on the curbstone he gave full sway to the sense of loneliness and shame in his heart  mrs hansons lodgers soothed him as best they could and not until he was ready for business once more with a bundle of evening papers under his arm did seth think of leaving him  dan and bill had both equipped themselves for work and promised to have an eye out for jip during the remainder of that day at least therefore seth believed himself at liberty to follow his own inclinations  i want to go up to the enginehouse for a spell but ill be in the room in time to go with you to school he said to dan and the latter replied cheerily  all right well flash up there by dark and you neednt be fraid anybody will get the best of jip while were round  ten minutes later seth was in ninetyfours quarters standing in front of lish davis as the latter asked sternly  why didnt you stay downtown an enjoy yourself thats what i told you to do  i can have more fun up here an i didnt think youd care if i loafed round till it was time to go to school  care of course we dont amateur but you oughter have some change theres no sense in hanging on here all the time  i dont see very much of you an perhaps  youre reckoning that we may get a call and youll have the chance to go out with us  if there was one id like  mr davis interrupted him by saying with mock seriousness  im afraid amateur we shall have to hire a backyard somewhere and keep a little blaze going sos to amuse you  seth laughed heartily at this conceit and then bethinking himself that there was no reason why he should not give the mens boots an extra polish brought his outfit from the chamber above although jerry walters insisted strongly that he should sit still and visit with em  to do this work he had drawn on an old pair of overalls to protect his blue trousers taken off his coat and was in full working costume when a click came from the morse instrument and the men were already on their feet as the alarm began to sound  am i in it seth cried eagerly as the horses dashed out of their stall and lish davis replied while attending to his portion of the work  i reckon we shall have to take you along amateur seeing s this fire seems to have started jest when you got into trim for hard work swing alongside the engineer and well allow youre one of the company  by the time the driver ceased speaking the engine was on its way out of the building and seth swaying to and fro clung for dear life to the guardrail as the mighty machine was drawn swiftly over the pavement  theres no chance of our getting first water this time even if we are taking the mascot with us jerry walters said with a laugh and amateur knew there were no less than three engines stationed nearer the signalbox from which had come this alarm than was ninetyfour  a nasty place for a fire the engineer said as the engine following another an hundred yards or more in advance rolled on toward a block of apartment houses from the centre of which could be seen dense clouds of black smoke ascending  and it seems to have a good start walters added  then ninetyfours hose was coupled on and without attracting the attention of the driver seth followed joe black and jerry as they dragged the nozzle up the steps to the entrance of the threatened building  get back amateur one of them shouted and the boy cried imploringly  please let me go as far as you do its my first chance an ive got my old clothes on  all right but have an eye on yourself and see to it the battalion chief dont spot you joe black replied carelessly and seth congratulated himself that he had gone to ninetyfours quarters instead of spending his time downtown  the fire appeared to have its strongest hold in the shaft of the elevator coming from the basement and the two men whom seth was following joined by ben dunton dragged the long length of hose up one flight of stairs to the landing where tongues of yellow flame were apparently coming through the very floor  once they were in position for battle with the foe directly before them jerry walters ran into the adjoining apartment and shouted through the open window  even where he stood shielding his face with his arm as best he could from the intense heat and blinding smoke seth could hear the cry  ninetyfour start your water start your water  if there was any response those on the landing did not hear it but a few seconds later the leathern hose began to stiffen and round out into shape and then with a mighty rush that threatened to wrest the nozzle from the three strong men who were holding it a jet of water struck the burning floor with a force that would have shattered less substantial timbers  hurrah for ninetyfour and seth sprang to the hose intent on doing a full share of the work even though his face was almost blistered by the heat  get back amateur get back its too hot for you here and ben dunton thrust seth aside with his elbow at the very instant a wild scream was heard on the stairway in the rear of the firemen  turning quickly seth saw dimly through the volume of choking vapor the form of a woman and it seemed to him that ben dunton was trying to force her down the stairs when she shrieked  theres a child on the next floor  jerry walters and joe black could not leave their places of duty but ben dunton sprang forward and almost instinctively seth followed the smoke being so dense at the top of the stairs as to screen his movements from the view of those at the nozzle  for an instant he fancied jerry called his name and then he was groping his way upward halfblinded choking but eager to do what he might toward a rescue  he gained the second landing  here everything was obscured by the black smoke and he could no longer see dunton although now and then a crashing noise as of wood being splintered under heavy blows told as he believed that the brave fireman was intent on the effort to save life even though his own might pay the forfeit  then with a roar the flames burst from the elevator shaft directly in front of him and he staggered on along the hallway hardly knowing in which direction he was going until from behind a door near at hand came that which sounded like the crying of a child  he had only to turn the knob in order to gain an entrance into the apartment which seemed entirely free from smoke as compared with the place he had just left  on the floor near the window sat a child crying piteously and seth caught the little thing in his arms thinking it would be possible to gain the foot of the stairs where he had left black and walters before either he or his charge should receive serious injury  thus laden he ran toward the hallway but only to retreat  the flames were pouring up through the shaft spreading out in every direction and forming such a barrier as he could not hope to pass  he shouted for dunton but no reply came and for the briefest interval of time he despaired  then came into his mind as clearly as if the words were yet being spoken what he had heard said to one of the classes concerning just such peril as he was in at that moment and without delay he returned to the room closing the door behind him to shut out the noisome vapor as nearly as might be  dont cry baby dont cry he said soothingly to the screaming child as he ran here and there looking for something with which to carry into practice the lesson he had received     chapter xvi  winning a medal   the struggles and screams of the child he was trying to save served to confuse seth and the smoke which was growing more stifling each moment bewildered at the same time that it choked him  but for the lectures the boy had heard at headquarters neither he nor the baby would have left the apartment alive  he realized the vital necessity of keeping a grip on himself as josh fernald had expressed it and in order the better to do so repeated again and again the words of the instructor  during the first dozen seconds he tried to soothe the child and then came the thought that the little one would suffocate more quickly by inhaling the smokeladen atmosphere as she gasped and sobbed violently  a garmentperhaps it was a tablecloth or a light blankethung over the back of a chair near at hand and this seth wound around the babys face regardless of its struggles  a clear head is the next best thing to a ladder he said again and again repeating the words of mr fernald and all the while searching for a rope or something which would serve him in its stead  by this time the room was completely filled with smoke and his eyes were blinded smarting burning  near the window was a footstool and seizing this with one hand he hurled it through the glass  fresh air was a necessity now he must have it or speedily succumb to the deadly vapor  holding the child who was apparently in a paroxysm of fear or a spasm caused by pain close against his breast he thrust the upper portion of his body through the aperture regardless of the sharp fragments of glass which cut his flesh cruelly  what a blessed relief was this first indrawing of comparatively fresh air  the clear head was coming to him rapidly and he understood that unless aid could be summoned from below he must make immediate battle with the vapor again for with every moment the flames on the landing were increasing  ninetyfour he shouted at the full strength of his lungs this way ninetyfour  he could hear from below a tumult of shouts and commands but none of them appeared to be an answer to his cry  the roaring of the fire as it came through the elevatorshaft could be clearly distinguished even above all the noise and he knew full well the blaze must soon make its way through the door which presented but a frail barrier against the onrush of flame  ninetyfour here ninetyfour he cried once more without receiving a reply and feeling comparatively strong for another struggle against the smoke he drew the covering more closely around the childs head at the same time stepping back into the suffocating vapor  he made his way by sense of touch rather than sight into the adjoining apartment  it was the kitchen of the suite and at one end stretched across from wall to wall above the range was a cord on which hung several articles of wearing apparel  placing the child who had ceased to struggle on the floor he tore at this apology for a rope with all his strength dragging it from its fastenings and taking up the baby once more ran back to the window from which he had just come  it was but the work of a few seconds to tie one end of the cord under the childs arms but yet it seemed to him half bewildered and suffering as he was that more than five minutes passed before it had been completed  illustration seth rescues the baby page 272  ninetyfour he shouted as he thrust the seemingly lifeless body through the aperture cutting his hands and arms again and again on the sharp points of glass  quickly but at the same time gently he lowered the burden until the cord was at its full length  it did not seem possible this poor substitute for a lifeline extended much below the top of the first story and he dared not let go his hold lest the child should be dashed to death upon the pavement  once more he called for the men who he knew must be close at hand leaning far out of the window in the faint hope he might be seen  his eyes were so blinded that he could distinguish nothing he was unable to say whether the smoke yet enveloped him or if he was in full view of the men below  the sense of suffocation was heavy upon him he tried to repeat josh fernalds words but failed and then came the knowledgedim and unrealthat the cord was slipping or being pulled from his grasp  he made a final effort to retain his hold and at the instant there was in his mind as if he dreamed a fancy that strong arms were around him  after that all was a blank until he opened his eyes to see lish davis bending over him as he had done on that night when jip collins set fire to the shed in baxters lumberyard  wheres the baby he asked attempting to rise but forced back by the deathly faintness which assailed him  his mother has got him by this time amateur and youve made a man of yourself in shorter order than the majority of us are able to do it was a close shave lad and well have no more like it till the time comes when its your duty to take such chances  the drivers voice sounded oddly to the halfstupefied boy usually it was gruff like that of a man in a bad temper but now it quavered as if the speaker was making an unsuccessful effort to control his emotions  seth allowed his head to fall back on a pile of rubber blankets and as his cheeks touched the smooth surface there came to him the thought that once more he was in the patrolwagon  how long he remained apparently unable to speak he had no idea and then he heard the shout from afar off but readily distinguishable above the panting of the engines  how is ninetyfours kid  lish davis rose to his feet and cried in reply  hes got his head again and appears to be all right  at that moment some one stepped to the side of the wagon and asked the driver  shall we send an ambulance  i reckon hell get along without it chief its only the reglar dose as nigh as i can make out  how did he happen to be here instead of at headquarters  it was his day off owing to being a witness in an arson case and hed come up to the house to visit us  we shall have to put him in a straightjacket until he is taken on as a fireman else something serious may happen this would be a case for a medal if he belonged to the department  thats what he does chief he comes as nigh being one of ninetyfours men as i am and if it so be a medal belongs to him well see he gets it  seth heard but did not understand this conversation  he knew it was one of the battalion chiefs who had been talking with mr davis and it was enough for him that his name had been spoken in a friendly tone  the driver leaned over him once more and asked almost tenderly  will i send you up to the house amateur  cant i stay till ninetyfour pulls out  well of all gluttons youre the worst lish davis cried as if in delight dosed way up till you can hardly wink and yet wanting to hold on to the last ben dunton is caring for the team and i reckon you and i had better pull out in this ere hurryup  what about the fire  its under control though im allowing itll be a full two hours before ninetyfour gets the word to leave  then davis left the boy a moment and when he returned the patrolwagon was driven slowly out past the laboring engines through the throng of spectators into the unobstructed streets after which the horses were urged to their full speed  theres no need of takin me back mr davis i aint much worse than i was the time dan an me was burned out  but then it needed a nights rest to put you into shape and im not minded to run any risks ninetyfours kid is getting to be so near a man that we cant afford to take any chances with him  hello amateur in trouble again the house watchman asked when lish davis helped seth into the building and the driver replied proudly  i dont allow hes an amateur any longer bob but fit to be one of us in proper form he saved a baby and came mighty nigh knocking under  how did he get a chance to do anything like that  slipped past me and followed jerry and joe i dont rightly know the whole of it yet the chief allowed it was a medal job though one cant be given except to members of the department  then seth is entitled to it for hes on our rolls as if belongin to us  well see that he gets all hes earned bob lish davis replied and then he conducted the boy upstairs insisting that he should go to bed  ill be all right after a spell seth protested and the driver replied grimly in his usual harsh tone  thats what im going to make certain of kid peel off your clothes and turn in if you dont want to have trouble with me  seth obeyed with a laugh and was equally tractable a few moments later when lish davis brought a glass half full of a certain disagreeable mixture for him to drink  then the boys eyelids grew heavy he said to himself he would remain awake until ninetyfour returned but the thought was hardly more than formed in his mind before slumber overcame him  it was late in the evening when he was awakened by the sound of voices near at hand and on looking around seth saw to his great surprise mr fernald talking with lish davis  hello got your eyes open again eh the old instructor cried and seth would have arisen to his feet but that mr fernalds hand was laid heavily upon his shoulder  im all right now sir an i promised to go to school with bill an dan  its a little late for anything of that kind now my boy seeing that the clock has just struck ten whats all this talk i hear of your showing the members of the department how to effect a rescue  it wasnt me sir i only got the baby out of the window an somebody else must have taken him from there  it was jerry walters who came up the ladder lish davis interrupted  the credit of saving the child belongs to you seth mr fernald said decidedly and i hope therell be no question about its being given tell us how it was done  there isnt much to tell sir i jest heard the baby yellin an went in after it then the smoke made me feel silly an i had to keep sayin to myself what i heard you tellin the class about a clear head bein the next best thing to a ladder else id gone under before i found the rope  now theres the kind of a pupil to have mr fernald cried proudly theres some satisfaction in knowing that what a man says will be remembered when the time comes that it may be of profit you shall go regularly into the class from this out seth bartlett whether the commissioners approve or not and well find some one else to do the odd jobs  do you really think i stand a better chance of gettin into the department because of tryin to pull the kid through seth asked in surprise and josh fernald replied to the great delight of both the boy and mr davis  if i can bring any influence to bear you shall be there very soon my lad and at all events from this time out you will be kept at work on the drill ninetyfours kid is of considerably more importance tonight than he was this morning  after such praise as this it seemed impossible for seth to remain in bed and finally lish davis consented to his going downstairs for a time  the hour which seth spent on the lower floor on this night was the most pleasant he had ever known  the men did not occupy the time in praising him but discussed the rescue again and again and never once was the boy spoken to or of as the amateur  lish davis insisted on his remaining in the enginehouse all night but gave seth distinctly to understand that however many alarms might come in he was not to so much as think of going out with the company  youll be on sick leave till tomorrow morning when josh fernald is expecting you at headquarters and then itll be for him to say when were to see you again  but of course ill sleep at mrs hansons sames ive been doin  i cant say how itll be lad but whatever josh allows must be done will come nigh being right  what between his happiness and the sleep he had indulged in during the early part of the evening seth bartlett was unusually wakeful and until past midnight he lay in a cot near lish daviss bed speculating upon what mr fernald might be able to do in regard to procuring his admission to the school at headquarters  then slumber interfered with his waking dreams and he knew no more until daylight next morning when he crept softly out of bed to perform his customary task  he did the work on the lower floor lest he should disturb those who were yet asleep and was getting well along with it when joe black came down  how are you feelin this mornin kid he asked in an unusually friendly tone  fine as silk that medicine mr davis gave me fixed everything in great shape  i see youre still blackin boots  why shouldnt i be it was the bargain that i could do it till i got into the department  im allowing lish will claim youre so near there now that you must graduate from this kind of work  but of course im not near gettin into the department for they dont make firemen of boys  as a rule they dont but im reckoning therell be something in the way of an exception with you im not allowin youll be allowed to swell around as full member of a company but you are bound to be recognized as belonging to us  seth failed to understand how any immediate change could be effected in his standing save that he might be admitted to the classes at headquarters and before he could ask joe black to make an explanation a shrill voice was heard calling through the halfopened door  say mister is seth bartlett here  it was dan and seth stepped forward to prevent him from coming in when joe black said  theres no reason why you should go out on the sidewalk to talk with your friends youve got the same privileges here that all hands have  by this time dan had stepped inside and catching a glimpse of seth he cried  say old man youre goin it mighty strong but were proud of you the fellers count on givin you a reglar blowout tomorrow if its so you can come downtown  do you mean cause of what was done last night dan seth asked surprised that his roommate should have learned of the affair so soon and joe black gave way to his mirth although why he thought there was anything comical in what had been said neither of the boys understood  course im talkin bout your savin the baby  how did you hear of it so soon  hear of it why its in all the papers look at this and dan unfolded the morning herald as he pointed to an article nearly a column in length which was headed a brave boy  seth made no attempt to read the account and dan cried impatiently as he held the sheet in front of him  why dont you see what it says the fellers downtown are pretty nigh wild cause youve showed the firemen that you aint any slouch even if you did black boots for a livin i reckon sam barney will get green when he sees it an bills hangin round sos to make certain that duffer hears bout it the first thing say cant you come down by the postoffice now  ive got to go up to headquarters same as ever an its most time now  but the fellers are just crazy to see you  theyll have to wait till night seth replied with a laugh cause im bound to be there right on the dot  ill walk up with you  all right im ready now as soon as i put on my coat  seth went to the floor above for the purpose of getting the garment and while he was absent joe black asked dan  what are you boys counting on doing with our kid  were goin to give him one of the biggest blowouts thats ever been seen in this town do you spose wed lay still after hes been an done what he did well show that we believe hes a dandy  what kind of a blowout do you mean  a reglar spread with plenty to eat an it wont cost seth a cent bill an teddy bowser are rushin round seein to it now folks think we fellers dont count for much but some of em will sing a different tune after readin what he did you can bet were reckonin on givin him a great sendoff  look here dan joe black whispered i wouldnt mind seeing how you lads get up a thing of that sort and if youll give me an invite ill chip in a dollar  will you wear your uniform dan asked eagerly  ill put on every button ive got but you are not to tell seth im coming  its a go master roberts replied gravely and then the arrival of seth interrupted the conversation  when they were outside the enginehouse dan insisted that his partner give him the full story of the rescue and he was not satisfied with a general account but demanded every particular from the time ninetyfour left her quarters until josh fernald had taken his departure  well its bound to be a big thing for you he said thoughtfully even if you dont get a medal  see here dan mr davis has said considerable bout medals an i dont understand it  are you claimin to be posted in the fire business an dont know things like that are given to men who save folks from bein burned up  of course i know it but im talkin about myself i cant have a medal cause i aint a fireman yet  if youd read the herald as i wanted youd seen that the printed piece said you earned one  i dont think i did not even if i belonged reglarly to the department it was jerry walters who did the most of the work cause if he hadnt come jest then it would have been all day with mei was mighty near gone  dont you make such talk as that to anybody but me seth bartlett dan cried sharply whats the use of givin anything away when folks are howlin bout your bein so brave a feller is bound to blow his own horn sometimes in this world else hed never get along an thats what you must do now  if i cant get into the department without it ill go back to shinin boots look at sam barney hes always doin that an what does he mount to  oh a feller must have some sand to back him else he wont pull through an you know theres nothin to sam but wind heres where you stop an ill snoop back downtown the fellers are countin on givin you a racket tomorrow night an you must be on hand  see here dan dont you spend good money when youre needin it for the store jest for the sake of puffin me up  i reckon what ill put out wont bust me even if we have greed to whack up fifteen cents apiece bill teddy an me will chip in for jip sos he can have a good time after all his hard luck an well make your eyes stick out before its over  id a good deal rather you didnt do it  theres no use to kick now cause its too late i wouldnt wonder if it was all fixed by this time you see bill an me was fraid youd been hurt seein s you didnt come over to the room last night an the fellers wanted me to find out bout it sos if there was any trouble we could hold off the blowout till youd come round agin so long ill see you tonight and dan was off like a flash  seth watched until his friend was lost to view in the distance and then entered the building  the first man he met shook hands with him in the most friendly manner congratulating him upon the service he had done and so did every one he saw until he was absolutely astounded at the warmth of his reception  for a moment it seemed as if the officials at headquarters were taking as deep an interest in him as did ninetyfours company and there were so many who thus had a kindly word that it was nearly an hour from the time he arrived before it was possible to present himself at the gymnasium  there mr fernald showed him marked attention before those of the class who were assembled and as seth confidentially told lish davis that evening he was afraid hed get a big head if folks didnt let up on his saving the baby  at noon josh fernald held a long conversation with seth the substance of which was that permission had been received to put him under instruction precisely as if he had been appointed a member of the department on probation and he would be taught the entire drill from that day forth  next spring when the bennett stephenson and pulitzer medals are awarded the lifesaving corps will give an exhibition drill at some public place and ive decided that you shall be among them work hard my lad and on that day when the citizens of new york turn out to see those of the force who have distinguished themselves in the way of saving life you can make your appearance in a manner that will give great pleasure to your comrades of ninetyfour  mr fernald did not give seth an opportunity of thanking him but suddenly walked away as if bent on important business at the other end of the room and the boy said to himself with pride and delight  he called ninetyfours men my comrades thats a big stepup for a bootblack to make an i wonder how lish davis will like it     chapter xvii  the blowout   much to dans disappointment seth could not go downtown on this first evening after having distinguished himself in the department  when lish davis heard what mr fernald had said he insisted on having a long and confidential chat with the boy and it was not concluded until a very late hour in the evening  the time has now come kid when youre the same as one of us and we of ninetyfour who counted on giving you such a boost have been cheated out of it by what you did for yourself the driver began gravely and in a tone sufficiently loud for the other members of the company to hear from this out youre in the department and we have no fear but that in due course of time youll be assigned to some companythis one if we can have our way now theres a question of money to come up precious soon for we here have got the idee that the city wont pay wages while youre under instruction  of course we may be in the wrong as to that but if we aint howll you live thats what weve asked ourselves and this is the way we answer it every man in the department looks on you as ninetyfours kid and we cant allow anything that would go against our credit consequently you have got to turn to us for support till youre under wages well assess ourselves so much every month and charge it up to you in reglar fashion so it can be paid back some time now youre to make no kick for weve settled it once and for all  why couldnt i black boots at odd times seth asked pleadingly  because there wont be any odd times in the first place and secondly were not minded to have it said we couldnt see you through cant you understand that were looked on by them as are in the department as your father or guardeen or something of that kind and its our own credit were bound to uphold how would it look for a fireman to be around blackin boots and thats what you are this very minute even though you havent had an appointment  then one member of the company after another gave his views on the subject until it would have been rank ingratitude had seth refused the generous proposition  it was agreed to by all that a strict account should be kept of the amounts advanced and he be allowed to repay the company at the earliest opportunity after he was under salary  when this matter had been settled by seths promise to take such sums of money as he needed and look pleasant about it the men discussed his future and spoke of the time when he would be running with ninetyfour until it did not require a very great stretch of the imagination for the boy to fancy himself already a member of the company  on reaching mrs hansons he found his roommates awake and grumbling because he had not returned sooner  i spose we shant see very much of you now youre gettin so high up in the department eh dan said in a tone of illhumor  youll see me all my spare time providin you an bill still agree to go to school cause ive got to duf into study in great shape now an well be together every evening  got to do it now what else has come up  mr fernald has put me right into the drill an i dont have to tackle the odd jobs any more  are you a fireman already and dan sprang to his feet in astonishment  of course not but im to be drilled the same as if i was an in case i show sand enough youll see me in the exhibition drill thats to be given on the street next spring  neither dan nor bill spoke for several seconds and then the former exclaimed with emphasis  say but youre gettin there with both feet eh  it was midnight before the roommates could afford to retire and then it was understood that on the following evening at seven oclock seth was to be at the main entrance to the postoffice in readiness for the blowout to be given in his honor  in vain he questioned his friends concerning the proposed feast  they would give him no further information on the subject declaring that he would have his eye knocked out before the thing was over  at daylight next morning seth was at ninetyfours house blacking boots despite the fact that lish davis had given orders another boy should be engaged for such work and before the members of the company were astir he departed for headquarters  during this day the new probationer as he was called was kept at work learning how to handle raise and balance ladders and it is safe to say he never did more labor in a single twelve hours before  he was exceedingly tired when suppertime arrived but did his best to prevent mr fernald from suspecting the fact  feeling rather sore the instructor asked as the boy came to say goodnight  i aint played out sir  if such was the case would you admit it  id hate to seth replied with a smile and mr fernald said in a friendly tone as if speaking to a comrade instead of a pupil  it is hard work this learning the trade of a fireman my boy and there may be times when you will feel discouraged but keep a firm grip on yourself at all times live regularly avoid bad habits or in other words keep in rigid training and you will master it  im not afraid of failin so far as im concerned sir but it may be ill tire others out an so get me walkin ticket  you need have no such fear on my account lad so long as you do your level best  seth understood that mr fernald had brought the interview to an end and he set out for the rendezvous at the postoffice wondering not a little what and whom he should find at the blowout  as he neared the business locations of his different friends he was surprised because he failed to meet any whom he knew  it was as if every newsvender and bootblack had suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth although it was not yet so late but that considerable business might have been done  arriving at the postoffice he met there bill and dan alone  he had expected to see a great throng and began to believe that for some good reason the blowout had been postponed  have you given it up he asked in what he intended should be a careless tone for even though he had advised dan not to start the thing it had given him no slight satisfaction because his acquaintances and friends should desire thus to do him honor  give up nothin bill exclaimed aint we here on time  i didnt know from what you said last night but that some of the other fellers were comin  weve fixed everything jest as we want it an shes goin along as smooth as a die master roberts replied in a tone of satisfaction them as dont know their business gets left but we havent got in with that crowd eh william  we shant mildew even if we aint taken in for a considerable spell bill said contentedly and added an instant later now seths come i dont see why we should stand round here any longer  let her go im ready and master roberts set out in advance leading the way toward chat ham street much as if believing every person whom they met knew he was conducting the boy who ran with ninetyfour  where are we goin seth asked of bill believing now that the spread concerning which so much had been said was to be confined strictly to the lodgers in mrs hansons house  youll see when we strike there an if it aint tony enough for a swell from the department you can get out  seth gazed in surprise at his friend but the latters face was expressionless and the guest of the evening began to fear some disaster had overtaken the plans of his roommates  seen sam barney today the probationary fireman asked after a brief time of silence  i struck him mighty heavy yesterday an hes been layin low ever since i made up my mind that he should see the printed stuff about you in the papers an hung round till he flashed up then i acted as if he an me was the best friends in the world an asked if he knowed what kind of a racket youd been on that was enough to make him read the paper i had an you can bet he was sick when he got through teddy bowser hit him up agin bout an hour afterward an from that time till pretty nigh dark we kept him chafin under the collar then he lit out an we havent seen him since  hows jip gettin along  firstclass tendin right out on business an goin to pull through into a decent kind of a feller say you know dan made up his mind to own a store on third avenoo  yes an i hope he wont back down  well i guess not he cant cause ive gone into partners with him an there wont be any funny business were goin to take jip for a clerk  but you havent got the store yet  it aint such a dreadful long ways off weve got most twelve dollars towards it an i know of a man whatll sell out a bangup good place for a hundred an fifty im allowin well get that much before spring  what makes him sell it so cheap  the reason is that hes a duffer wants to lay back smokin an have the dollars come rollin in without his raisin a hair of course he aint gettin along very smart an well soon be ready to take it with two fellers who are willin to work theres a big thing in that place were countin on settin up a bootblackin place with chairs an all such kind of swellin you know its going to be roberts  dean newsdealers an shiners  youll make a go of it bill  course we shall was the complacent reply i knowed it was a good thing jest as soon as dan flashed her up an said id come in before he got half through talkin this ere little blowout is the only thing were goin to spend any money on till we get the shop paid for  its too bad for you to put out good money on me  what were doin tonight wont break us i reckon first off we allowed it would cost fifteen cents apiece but we had an offer of three dollars for that many tickets which comes pretty nigh payin all the bills  three dollars for three tickets seth repeated in perplexity what is it youve been gettin up bill  hold on bout four minutes longer an then the whole thing will be flashed up its great  before the time specified by bill had elapsed dan suddenly turned into a german restaurant walked the length of the lower floor and led the way upstairs  seth felt that already was his eye bein knocked out  he knew there were private supperrooms in some of these chatham street establishments but had never been fortunate enough to see one and now he was to enter as a guest of honor  dan threw open the door at the head of the stairs  seth was conscious of a blaze of light the hum of voices and before it was possible to distinguish anything clearly bill cried  three cheers for ninetyfours kid  then rang out a shout which seemed actually to rock the building to and fro and by the time the tumult had subsided the guest of the evening saw a long table on either side of which were seated all his friends and acquaintances among the sidewalk merchants while at the head lish davis jerry walters and joe black presided with as much gravity as if it had been the swellest of swell functions  now seth understood who had purchased supper tickets at one dollar a plate  the honored guest was shown to a seat near ninetyfours driver  dan and bill took places opposite and the former called in a loud commanding voice for the benefit of teddy bowser who was stationed at the door  let em flash her up were all here  teddy cried to some one below and during the next ten minutes two waiters were kept busy bringing upstairs sandwiches bologna in generous thick slices sauerkraut without stint potato salad and a variety of small cakes plentifully besprinkled with tiny seeds  while this feast was being placed upon the table no one spoke but instantly teddy gave a peculiar sign by crossing his throat and winking one eye dan cried  now pitch in fellers an fill right up were doin this cause seth bartlett has got into the department an the one what dont eat all he oughter will have trouble with me  if master roberts had been a veritable giant seeking whom he might devour the boys could not have shown more fear lest his command should not be obeyed  every fellow present felt that it was his duty to eat a generous portion of each dish before him and he did it hurriedly lest dan might have cause for complaint  nor were the guests who had paid their cold dollars as dan explained idle  all three ate heartily to the evident satisfaction of the others and lish davis even entered so thoroughly into the spirit of the affair as to suggest that they send for another dish of sauerkraut  in ten minutes or less the hunger of the guests was in a measure appeased and as they dallied with the dainties dan set in motion that portion of the entertainment which in his opinion was to be the crowning feature  illustration the blowout page 298  it aint many times that duffers like us has a chance to rub up against ninetyfours men an we want to show em that we know whats what he had said privately to bill the evening previous and now was come the moment when the exhibition should be made  after making certain that all were giving him their attention he rose slowly to his feet looked round as if to collect his thoughts and said in a loud tone much as though repeating something he had committed to memory  fellers an ninetyfours men are in it too we spread ourselves on this ere blowout cause seth bartlett has got into the department owin to havin saved a kid and now if all hands are way up full well have a little speech from mr lish davis driver of ninetyfour engine whos one of the three what gave up a big cold dollar for this lot of stuff  then dan sat down with a complacent smile upon his face as if believing he had said the right thing in the right place and mr davis actually appeared embarrassed  he had come to the feast expecting to enjoy himself by listening to the sidewalk merchants and found that it was himself who would provide a goodly portion of the entertainment  never doubting but that this had been all arranged beforehand seth gazed at the driver wondering why he was so slow in making a response while jerry and joe laughed heartily for they knew that lish had been taken wholly by surprise  however the driver of ninetyfour was not one who would be discomfited by such as dan roberts and he began his speech with considerable hesitation but warming to his subject as he proceeded  i didnt allow that i was to be part of the show when i come here and dan roberts has got one the best of me but yet i aint quite downed the man who couldnt say a good word now never ought to set in anywhere because theres a deal more than something to eat if you boys will only look at it in the right light in the first place youve spread yourself because ninetyfours kid has the same as got into the department and perhaps some of you think hes lucky i tell you kids luck hadnt anything to do with it seth is being made a fireman because whatever he struck he stuck at and never let a living chance go by him when he first came up to ninetyfours house we gave him the cold shoulder but he kept plugging away till we grew to like his pluck yet nobody held out a hand to him till hed hung to his idea so long that we jest couldnt help ourselves he worked in where he wanted to go and so can every one of you i aint holding that all of us are born to be firemen but whatever we count on being weve got to work for and work hard do that and youll pull through in pretty nigh everything you tackle  when lish davis sat down blushing rosy red dan sprang up like a jumpingjack from a box and proposed  three cheers for the driver of ninetyfour  as may be imagined these were given with a will and then master roberts announced  jerry walters will now chip in with something  it was now lish daviss turn to laugh and he enjoyed his comrades confusion mightily for it was several moments before jerry could think of the proper words  joe black was called upon immediately afterward and when he had concluded and been given a round of cheers as in the case of the other speakers the driver said gravely  we who come here to look on have done what we could towards making a success of this here blowout and now according to my way of thinking its time we heard from mr daniel roberts  the suggestion came in the way of a big surprise to dan who while making plans for this entertainment had entirely overlooked the possible fact that he might be asked to do that which he the same as demanded from others  dans friends and acquaintances applauded lish daviss proposition loudly and were so emphatic in their calls for him that the owner of the prospective thirdavenue store was absolutely forced to rise  its what i call a mighty mean trick for you fellers to howl bout my makin a speech cause you know we hadnt figgered that any but the dollar visitors would do that of course lish davis an the rest of the firemen didnt know but pretty nigh every other feller was posted this afternoon but dont think youve got me in a hole though for if makin speeches is only talkin bout seth i can do that an not half try if it hadnt been for him i wouldnt have my thirdavenoo storeand ive got it in my mind all rightnor bill an me wouldnt be thinkin of goin to school or we shouldnt be livin in the toniest lodgins in this ere town an if it hadnt been for him you fellers couldnt be settin here so near filled up that some of you cant do much moren wink now bout this blowout i made a trade with the dutchman what runs the place that we should have all we could eat for four dollars but he held to it that we mustnt stay moren two hours an you cant blame him a bangup shop like this cant be kept goin all night without somebodys chippin in a stack of good money now seein s you fellers cant eat any more an the firemen have all made their speeches i allow wed better skin out  save for this last portion dans speech would undoubtedly have been greeted with the same amount of applause as the others but the guests were not well pleased at being asked to depart at such an early hour  during several moments there was every indication that disagreeable remarks might be made even if nothing more unpleasant occurred and thus the harmony of the meeting would be sadly marred  understanding all this lish davis came to the rescue by saying in a cheery tone  mr daniel roberts has without knowing it done us of ninetyfour a mighty good turn in bringing the meeting to a close wed feel kinder sore to go before it was all over and yet we couldnt stay many minutes longer because we only had leave of absence for three hours and that time is about up so if you fellows will look pleasant well do the same and on the day ninetyfours kid gets appointed to the department ill set out another spread in this same place for every one thats here tonight  this generous proposition could not have failed of its purpose and lish davis was cheered to the echo he and his two comrades taking their departure during the tumult which ensued  the entire company escorted mrs hansons lodgers to their home and before parting gave three hearty cheers and a series of yells in seths honor which aroused if it did not alarm the neighborhood and brought nearly every policeman in the vicinity to the scene of the parting  dan and his partners escaped to their room before the bluecoated guardians of the citys peace arrived and from their window watched the small throng as it scattered in every direction to avoid possible contact with the officers  its what i call a howlin success master roberts said in a tone of satisfaction as he turned from the window after the last of his friends had disappeared it was a big mistake not to have had a lot of newspaper fellers there sos the whole thing would be in the mornin editions  we can fix that straight enough bill replied carelessly as if familiar with such methods i know a feller what helps clean up the herald office where all the stuff is wrote out and ill get him to print a slat about the blowout  this appeared to satisfy master roberts that his mistake could readily be rectified and he gave himself wholly up to a review of the late proceedings until seth suggested that they retire  i had a hard days work an itll be jest as bad if not worse tomorrow so ive got to turn in  its too bad to wind up so soon dan suggested with a sigh but bill finally settled the matter by saying  if you an i ever expect to have that thirdavenoo store weve got to hump ourselves all the time an settin up nights aint the way to do it  two minutes later dan was in bed and as seth extinguished the gas the former raised himself on his elbow to say  well have the store jest bout the time you get into the department old man but you can bet the shop will be shut up when lish davis has his blowout     chapter xviii  the exhibition drill   seth bartlett ceased to be an amateur fireman when he was admitted to the probationary class even though he had not received an appointment and therefore this narrative was concluded or should have been with an account of the blowout designed and arranged by dan roberts  in case some of the readers care to know how ninetyfours kid prospered however a brief account of his doings up to the day when he was honored even above any member of his own particular company shall be given  first however let it be said that dan roberts and bill dean did not abandon the idea of going to school  on the night after the very pleasing entertainment on chatham street they set out with seth and from that time until the thirdavenue store was a reality they were in regular attendance  even after having engaged in what dan called real business the partners continued their pursuit of knowledge by going to school on alternate nights  jip collins gave good proof that he had reformed by attending closely to his work and on the day when messrs roberts  dean purchased the establishment from the gentleman who did not believe in working he was hired as clerk at wages to be proportionate with the sales  sam barney disappeared on the day of the blowout and was not seen by his former acquaintances for nearly eight months when he suddenly showed himself once more and announced that he was partners with a city detective  at first this statement was set down as false but in due course of time it became understood that there was a glimmer of truth in it inasmuch as he was employed now and then by the detective in question to carry messages and it is possible that he may yet compass his desires providing he can bring himself down to hard work and yet harder study  it can well be fancied that seth did not neglect his duties after having been admitted to the probationary class as a matter of fact he worked so hard that more than once was mr fernald forced to insist on his taking matters easier and when this advice did not prevail lish davis was called upon to interfere which he did very effectually by commanding the boys attendance at the house of ninetyfours company at least two hours during every twentyfour  josh fernald for certain reasons which appeared to be a secret between himself and several other members of the department had decided that seth should take part in the exhibition drill to be given by the lifesaving corps on that day when the medals were to be awarded and to such end all his efforts were directed  after the boy had become so familiar with the handling of ladders that they appeared to be little more than playthings to him he was taught as lish davis had explained he would be how to assist in building a chain with a line of ladders from the street to the roof placed in position by a man at each window of the structure  the driver had spoken of straddling sills and this name for the work puzzled seth not a little until it came his turn to receive instructions then he found that it consisted in sitting astride the sill of a window holding himself in place by the pressure of his knees much as though he had been in a saddle drawing up one of the climbing ladders and passing the hook attached to the upper end into the window above  this does not appear by the description thus given to be a very difficult task and yet others beside seth have found that it was a lesson extremely hard to learn but once gained the pupil can readily make his way from the street even to the roof of a building with no other implements than the two ladders  the lesson of standing on sill is always given to the pupils in pairs and before explaining what seth learned in this line it is necessary to describe the belt which is worn by members of the lifesaving corps  it is broad made of thick leather with two stout buckles to hold it in place directly in front is a leathern handle to which a steel snaphook is attached by a stout ring this hook being provided so the fireman may fasten himself to a ladder or any projection while he works and is similar to that worn by the drivers on one side of the belt in a leathern sheet is a hatchet with a heavy square head to be used either as a hammer or an axe as occasion may require  when a pupil is instructed in standing on sills he does exactly as the term implies but on the inside of the building is his mate who holds him in place by means of this belthook in such position he raises the ladder to the window above as when he was astride the sill  another lesson which seth often took is that of coming down a rope alone or bearing a burden it was not difficult and with this particular probationer decidedly exhilarating  a rope is made fast to the roof or window of a building and two turns of it taken round the hook on the firemans belt thus forming a brake to prevent too rapid descent by a pressure of the hand just below the hook it is possible for the operator to control his speed in case of bringing down a burden twice the number of turns are taken  as a matter of course seth was taught to leap from the building into a net and later to aid in holding it in which last exercise he learned that lish davis had not spoken falsely when he declared it was exceedingly hard work  it might not be entertaining to repeat all the lessons which ninetyfours kid took part in but suffice it to say that by the 1st of may mr fernald announced that he was as nearly perfect in the drill as he could be until after having gained greater strength  you will participate in the exhibition my boy and i am expecting a good showing from you  will ninetyfours men be there seth asked eagerly trying hard not to show how delighted he was by this praise  surely they are to take part in the parade and you can see lish davis display his skill at driving there are no lack of spectators at such exhibitions and you will show not only to a vast throng of citizens but the mayor and heads of the department whether you are worthy of receiving an appointment  will that settle matters for me seth asked in surprise  i dont say you will not be able to get the appointment without it but it is an opportunity of making a leap directly into the department and of finding yourself suddenly on equal footing with davis walters or black for they are intending to make a strong effort to have you assigned to their company  seth hardly needed this incentive to labor for he was already doing all a boy of his age could do but it caused him to feel extremely anxious regarding the final result and noting this lish davis said one evening in a fatherly tone  you are working yourself all up into a snarl over the fear of not pulling through and the result will be if you dont have a care that your head wont be of the clearest when the big day comes  im not afraid but that ill be able to go through with our part of the show all right but the trouble is that ill show up for no more than a boy and thats what bothers me  you cant pose for anything else lad seeing as how you are a kid but it wont work against you in face of the record go ahead as if there wasnt a thought in your mind but to show the people how we swarm over a building when the need arises and thats all any man can do  where is the exhibition to be held  on the riverside drive number 38 is the house thats been loaned for the occasion and you lads couldnt have a better building on which to work  do you mean to say were goin to range a decent house therell be considerable damage done if we have the reglar scalin ladders the teeth cant fail to tear away a good bit of the woodwork  youll only use the middle row of windows and over the sills of these will be fastened timber shields or casings so that you can swing your ladders without fear of so much as a pins scratch  where are the medals to be presented  a stand will be built on the drive and there all the swells will sit the mayor does the act and after its over we poor duffers who havent particularly distinguished ourselves will give a parade and drill youll see us respond to a call in great shape its always a high time of the department for its the only day in the year when we have a chance to show what we can do when need comes  the more seth heard regarding the proposed manoeuvres the greater was his eagerness to receive further instruction and had he been allowed to do as he pleased the class would have drilled not less than eighteen hours out of every twentyfour  practise as much as you please seth but you are out of my jurisdiction now for i cant suggest any improvement on your work mr fernald said but the praise did not prevent this particular probationer from spending nearly every moment of his time at the drill  then came the night before the eventful day and seth who was to sleep at headquarters had come down for a chat with his roommates and the members of ninetyfours company  you can bet well be there seth dan roberts said emphatically if it hadnt been for the show youre goin to give wed bought the thirdavenoo store yesterday but bill an me both allowed it couldnt be done till tomorrow cause we aint to be cheated out of seein how much you know bout the fire business well be right in the front row no matter how much the swells crowd for good places  are you goin to act jest like as if you was a reglar fireman bill asked much as if believing that would be impossible  i shall go through the same drill as the others  well old man i hope youll get along all right an it seems as if you oughter after workin so hard look for us when your crowd gets there an you can be certain of havin more cheers than anybody else for well yell ourselves blue in the face but that it shall go in good shape  dont make too much noise seth said pleadingly you know im only a boy an therell be lots of men who can work all round me so it wouldnt be jest the thing for me to be cheered when im the poorest of the lot  we know our business dan said decidedly and you neednt worry but that well do the thing up brown  after giving his friends a general outline of the exhibition as he understood it seth went to ninetyfours house and was there received with an unusually hearty welcome  how are you feeling kid lish davis asked solicitously  all right  little fidgety about tomorrows work  im hopin i wont make a fool of myself of course  you neednt worry josh fernald says youll make as good a showing as any one there and he knows the only chance of your failing will come from borrowing too much trouble remember what you said to yourself the night the baby was saved a clear head is the next best thing to a ladder and there mustnt be any cobwebs in yours dont pay attention to the crowd but keep in mind that youre only going through the drill sos the commissioners can see whether youre ripe for an appointment  what are you counting on wearing jerry walters asked in a peculiar tone  what ive got on of course seem s its all the decent clothes i own an they belong to you of ninetyfour im countin on cleanin em up in great shape an folks cant see where theyve been mended miss hanson fixed the coat so you wouldnt know the sleeve ever had a hole in it  im allowing the others will shine terrible bright  theyve all got new uniforms an are bound to look mighty fine  you dont seem to be sulking on account of having to wear old togs lish davis said with a peculiar twinkle in his eyes  what would be the use i cant have em an ill go through my part of the drill jest the same as if i was covered with brass buttons  its coming kind of tough on ninetyfour eh jerry the driver asked all hands of us swelling and our kid rushing around at the head with patched trousers the boys in the department will think we havent earned much money this year  i dont think you oughter feel bad bout it if i dont seth said trying hard to appear unconcerned people will know you have something else to do with your money than buy swell clothes for me  i aint so certain about that my boy at all events we dont count on taking any chances lish said with a laugh this aint the first time weve talked about a new uniform and somehow or other the tailor happened around this afternoon with one that looks as if it might fit you bring it down jerry  now seth understood why this conversation had been begun and while he was rejoiced by the thought that he would be dressed as well as the other members of the corps there was in his mind a certain uneasiness about accepting such a favor in addition to the many which had been bestowed upon him  im owin ninetyfour so much mr davis that itll be terrible if i dont get an appointment after all an it wouldnt  you can stop right where you are this here uniform that jerry is fetching aint charged up against you nor it never will be we reckon on having the right to give a present the day you graduate and if itll make you feel half as good to wear it as it will us to see you in it well be a mighty jolly crowd tomorrow  by this time jerry had returned with the garments over his arm and seth exclaimed as he saw them  why theres a helmet an youve had brass buttons put on the coat mr davis  sure the helmet belongs to the clothes and on every button youll see the letters n y f d  but only one who was really in the department could wear them  i reckon you can tackle that kind of a job tomorrow and if it so be that you get thrown out because of not being up in the drill it wont take long to cut them off  oh if i should fail and the tears came into seths eyes despite all his efforts to keep them back  you will for a fact if you get nervous over it a clear head forgetfulness of everything but the drill and ninetyfours kid will have an appointment or the promise of one before this time tomorrow night  then lish davis proposed to walk to headquarters with the boy in order to make certain he went directly to bed the new uniform was wrapped carefully in paper for it was not proposed that seth should put it on until the following morning and then every member of the company shook hands with their kid each giving him some bit of good advice  during the walk the old driver cautioned seth again and again not to speculate upon possible failure but to believe he would surely succeed and when the two parted lish davis said feelingly  youre a good boy seth and while every one of ninetyfours crew is your friend youre dearer to me than the whole boiling of them im proud of what you have done and will do tomorrow god love you my lad  then the driver turned away abruptly as if there was some particular reason why he wished to hide his face and as seth wiped the moisture from his eyes lest perchance a tear should fall on the new uniform he whispered to himself  god must love me even if i am sich a terrible duffer else hed never let me run up against ninetyfours company  during the forenoon of the next day seth wandered around the gymnasium trying to act upon the advice given by his friends in the matter of keeping cool and then came the time to put on the new uniform for he had been assured by mr fernald that it was perfectly proper for him to wear the helmet and the brass buttons even though he was not a regular member of the corps  when all was ready for the march to riverside drive something occurred which caused the boy considerable uneasiness for instead of setting out with the members of the corps he with six others were ordered to fall into line by themselves  fifty firemen picked members of the department ranged themselves on either side in advance and behind as an escort and no less a person than chief bonner himself took a station at their head  why he was thus separated from the men with whom he had practised seth could not imagine and there came into his mind as the order to march was given the thought that some serious mistake had been madethat he was in the wrong place and therefore would utterly fail of acting his part properly  his astonishment and uneasiness increased when the squad with their escort having arrived at the drive were stationed in line facing the river with their backs toward seventysixth street the sixtyninth regiment band a short distance behind them  why these men two of whom he had never seen before should with himself be singled out and stationed apart from the others was a mystery which seth failed to unravel speculate as he might  he saw the lifesaving corps in whose ranks he should have been march up and take their station not far from the grand stand which was thronged with spectators  then in line with the other engines he saw ninetyfour with lish davis holding the reins and he fancied the driver winked at him in a most mysterious manner as he passed  a moment later he heard a shrill cry  hi get on to seth whats he standin out there all by his lonesome for  he knew it was dan who had made this remark but could not see him without changing his position therefore he remained motionless  the band was playing gaylydressed people were watching curiously and in many cases admiringly the vast number of bluecoated men who represented the finest department in the world and of all those to be seen seth was perhaps the only person troubled in mind  some order was given the boy did not understand what for he was watching the lifesaving corps in the hope that some of them seeing he was out of position would summon him to their ranks  he saw that some one had arrived at the stand and believed it to be the mayor  the little squad and their escort saluted the gentleman by slowly raising their right hands to their helmets and then as slowly lowering them  mechanically seth copied the example of the men on either side of him and thus fortunately had not neglected his duty  the music of the band was hushed the mayor began to speak and as he went on seth was plunged into even greater bewilderment than before  it is the very pleasantest task of my experience said the mayor to acknowledge the great debt which new york owes to the fire department of the city in our population of two million souls there is no one branch of the municipal service which renders such valuable services as the fire department we are gathered here today to do honor to a few of the firemen who have rendered themselves famous during the year these men have snatched persons from the jaws of death but this is the duty of every fireman the army and navy are called upon to destroy everything but it is your duty to save everything  we are proud today to render you our homage for the magnificent manner in which you have discharged your duty all along the line from the chief down in all perilous moments and especially you who have been selected by the department to receive these medals this is the most pleasing duty i have ever performed  the speech ended seth was more positive than before that he had made a mistake in position and to his yet further bewilderment after the mayor had handed to the chief a medal the latter pinned it to his coatto the uniform which ninetyfours company had presented probably knowing at the time how it would be decorated  while this was being done the mayor described in detail that which seth had done when saving the babys life and as he concluded a great shout went up from the assembled multitude high above which could be heard dans shrill notes  then another medal was given to the chief who pinned it to the coat of the man standing next to the boy in line the mayor meanwhile explaining why it had thus been bestowed and seth began to understand how greatly he was honored  when each of the seven had been decorated and while the throng were cheering themselves hoarse the chief said in a low tone to seth  mr fernald has the official notification of your appointment as substitute fireman and you can get it on your return to headquarters you are assigned to company ninetyfour and will report to their house for duty tomorrow morning  seth could not speak and in fact the chief moved away so quickly that there was no chance but looking up toward where ninetyfour was stationed he saw every member of the company waving his helmet as if indulging in silent cheering  then he knew they were all in the secretthat it would be no news when he told them he was at last really their comrade  illustration presenting the medals page 322  as to what followed immediately after this seth had no very clear idea  he was not even conscious of how he left the squad of men who had just been decorated for their bravery and found himself in his proper station among the lifesaving corps  he hardly heard the order for the drill to be commenced but followed the movements of those nearest him until it was as if he forgot everything else and was once more back at headquarters fitting himself for what had already been accomplished  over the building which had been loaned for this purpose mr fernalds pupils swarmed as if clambering up a smooth surface of brick was a task more simple than the ordinary methods of locomotion and each portion of the drill was gone through with mathematical exactness  concerning it lish davis said to his comrades as ninetyfour was hauled into her quarters that evening  it was a great sight boys and what made it greater was that not a man among them outdid our kid josh fernald himself couldnt go through a drill better and weve reason to be mighty proud of what that little chap has done  after the lifesaving corps had concluded their portion of the exhibition two battalions were paraded by the chief himself ten engines two hook and ladder companies the watertower and the fireboat new yorker taking part therein  the men first marched past the reviewing stand to the music of the band after which in response to an alarm sounded by the mayor the engines and their crews returned along the drive at full tilt with fires lighted whistles blowing and bells ringing as if running to a fire                                       during the early part of the evening after the exhibition on riverside drive a boy clad in the full uniform of a fireman wearing on the left breast of his coat a handsome gold medal suspended by a knot of red ribbon walked rapidly down the street toward the headquarters of ninetyfour engine and a crowd of lads who might have been bootblacks or newsboys gathered on the sidewalk cheered him loudly as he came in view after which the senior member of the firm of roberts  dean shouted shrilly  now lets give three more rousers for the substitute fireman of ninetyfour engine  and the cheers were given with such a hearty will that citizens more than a block away turned hastily to ask one of the other why the police allowed such a disturbance to be made at that hour   the end
