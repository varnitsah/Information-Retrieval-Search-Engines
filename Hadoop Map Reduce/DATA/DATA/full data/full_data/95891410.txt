95891410	riders of the purple sage  by zane grey     chapter i lassiter  a sharp clipcrop of ironshod hoofs deadened and died away and clouds of yellow dust drifted from under the cottonwoods out over the sage  jane withersteen gazed down the wide purple slope with dreamy and troubled eyes a rider had just left her and it was his message that held her thoughtful and almost sad awaiting the churchmen who were coming to resent and attack her right to befriend a gentile  she wondered if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the little village of cottonwoods was to involve her and then she sighed remembering that her father had founded this remotest border settlement of southern utah and that he had left it to her she owned all the ground and many of the cottages withersteen house was hers and the great ranch with its thousands of cattle and the swiftest horses of the sage to her belonged amber spring the water which gave verdure and beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple upland waste she could not escape being involved by whatever befell cottonwoods  that year 1871 had marked a change which had been gradually coming in the lives of the peaceloving mormons of the border glazestone bridgesterling villages to the north had risen against the invasion of gentile settlers and the forays of rustlers there had been opposition to the one and fighting with the other and now cottonwoods had begun to wake and bestir itself and grown hard  jane prayed that the tranquillity and sweetness of her life would not be permanently disrupted she meant to do so much more for her people than she had done she wanted the sleepy quiet pastoral days to last always trouble between the mormons and the gentiles of the community would make her unhappy she was mormonborn and she was a friend to poor and unfortunate gentiles she wished only to go on doing good and being happy and she thought of what that great ranch meant to her she loved it allthe grove of cottonwoods the old stone house the ambertinted water and the droves of shaggy dusty horses and mustangs the sleek cleanlimbed blooded racers and the browsing herds of cattle and the lean sunbrowned riders of the sage  while she waited there she forgot the prospect of untoward change the bray of a lazy burro broke the afternoon quiet and it was comfortingly suggestive of the drowsy farmyard and the open corrals and the green alfalfa fields her clear sight intensified the purple sageslope as it rolled before her low swells of prairielike ground sloped up to the west dark lonely cedartrees few and far between stood out strikingly and at long distances ruins of red rocks farther on up the gradual slope rose a broken wall a huge monument looming dark purple and stretching its solitary mystic way a wavering line that faded in the north here to the westward was the light and color and beauty northward the slope descended to a dim line of canyons from which rose an uphinging of the earth not mountainous but a vast heave of purple uplands with ribbed and fanshaped walls castlecrowned cliffs and gray escarpments over it all crept the lengthening waning afternoon shadows  the rapid beat of hoofs recalled jane withersteen to the question at hand a group of riders cantered up the lane dismounted and threw their bridles they were seven in number and tull the leader a tall dark man was an elder of janes church  did you get my message he asked curtly  yes replied jane  i sent word id give that rider venters half an hour to come down to the village he didnt come  he knows nothing of it said jane i didnt tell him ive been waiting here for you  where is venters  i left him in the courtyard  here jerry called tull turning to his men take the gang and fetch venters out here if you have to rope him  the dustybooted and longspurred riders clanked noisily into the grove of cottonwoods and disappeared in the shade  elder tull what do you mean by this demanded jane if you must arrest venters you might have the courtesy to wait till he leaves my home and if you do arrest him it will be adding insult to injury its absurd to accuse venters of being mixed up in that shooting fray in the village last night he was with me at the time besides he let me take charge of his guns youre only using this as a pretext what do you mean to do to venters  ill tell you presently replied tull but first tell me why you defend this worthless rider  worthless exclaimed jane indignantly hes nothing of the kind he was the best rider i ever had theres not a reason why i shouldnt champion him and every reason why i should its no little shame to me elder tull that through my friendship he has roused the enmity of my people and become an outcast besides i owe him eternal gratitude for saving the life of little fay  ive heard of your love for fay larkin and that you intend to adopt her butjane withersteen the child is a gentile  yes but elder i dont love the mormon children any less because i love a gentile child i shall adopt fay if her mother will give her to me  im not so much against that you can give the child mormon teaching said tull but im sick of seeing this fellow venters hang around you im going to put a stop to it youve so much love to throw away on these beggars of gentiles that ive an idea you might love venters  tull spoke with the arrogance of a mormon whose power could not be brooked and with the passion of a man in whom jealousy had kindled a consuming fire  maybe i do love him said jane she felt both fear and anger stir her heart id never thought of that poor fellow he certainly needs some one to love him  thisll be a bad day for venters unless you deny that returned tull grimly  tulls men appeared under the cottonwoods and led a young man out into the lane his ragged clothes were those of an outcast but he stood tall and straight his wide shoulders flung back with the muscles of his bound arms rippling and a blue flame of defiance in the gaze he bent on tull  for the first time jane withersteen felt venterss real spirit she wondered if she would love this splendid youth then her emotion cooled to the sobering sense of the issue at stake  venters will you leave cottonwoods at once and forever asked tull tensely  why rejoined the rider  because i order it  venters laughed in cool disdain  the red leaped to tulls dark cheek  if you dont go it means your ruin he said sharply  ruin exclaimed venters passionately havent you already ruined me what do you call ruin a year ago i was a rider i had horses and cattle of my own i had a good name in cottonwoods and now when i come into the village to see this woman you set your men on me you hound me you trail me as if i were a rustler ive no more to loseexcept my life  will you leave utah  oh i know went on venters tauntingly it galls you the idea of beautiful jane withersteen being friendly to a poor gentile you want her all yourself youre a wiving mormon you have use for herand withersteen house and amber spring and seven thousand head of cattle  tulls hard jaw protruded and rioting blood corded the veins of his neck  once more will you go  no  then ill have you whipped within an inch of your life replied tull harshly ill turn you out in the sage and if you ever come back youll get worse  venterss agitated face grew coldly set and the bronze changed  jane impulsively stepped forward oh elder tull she cried you wont do that  tull lifted a shaking finger toward her  thatll do from you understand youll not be allowed to hold this boy to a friendship thats offensive to your bishop jane withersteen your father left you wealth and power it has turned your head you havent yet come to see the place of mormon women weve reasoned with you borne with you weve patiently waited weve let you have your fling which is more than i ever saw granted to a mormon woman but you havent come to your senses now once for all you cant have any further friendship with venters hes going to be whipped and hes got to leave utah  oh dont whip him it would be dastardly implored jane with slow certainty of her failing courage  tull always blunted her spirit and she grew conscious that she had feigned a boldness which she did not possess he loomed up now in different guise not as a jealous suitor but embodying the mysterious despotism she had known from childhoodthe power of her creed  venters will you take your whipping here or would you rather go out in the sage asked tull he smiled a flinty smile that was more than inhuman yet seemed to give out of its dark aloofness a gleam of righteousness  ill take it hereif i must said venters but by godtull youd better kill me outright thatll be a dear whipping for you and your praying mormons youll make me another lassiter  the strange glow the austere light which radiated from tulls face might have been a holy joy at the spiritual conception of exalted duty but there was something more in him barely hidden a something personal and sinister a deep of himself an engulfing abyss as his religious mood was fanatical and inexorable so would his physical hate be merciless  elder ii repent my words jane faltered the religion in her the long habit of obedience of humility as well as agony of fear spoke in her voice spare the boy she whispered  you cant save him now replied tull stridently  her head was bowing to the inevitable she was grasping the truth when suddenly there came in inward constriction a hardening of gentle forces within her breast like a steel bar it was stiffening all that had been soft and weak in her she felt a birth in her of something new and unintelligible once more her strained gaze sought the sageslopes jane withersteen loved that wild and purple wilderness in times of sorrow it had been her strength in happiness its beauty was her continual delight in her extremity she found herself murmuring whence cometh my help it was a prayer as if forth from those lonely purple reaches and walls of red and clefts of blue might ride a fearless man neither creedbound nor creedmad who would hold up a restraining hand in the faces of her ruthless people  the restless movements of tulls men suddenly quieted down then followed a low whisper a rustle a sharp exclamation  look said one pointing to the west  a rider  jane withersteen wheeled and saw a horseman silhouetted against the western sky coming riding out of the sage he had ridden down from the left in the golden glare of the sun and had been unobserved till close at hand an answer to her prayer  do you know him does any one know him questioned tull hurriedly  his men looked and looked and one by one shook their heads  hes come from far said one  thets a fine hoss said another  a strange rider  huh he wears black leather added a fourth  with a wave of his hand enjoining silence tull stepped forward in such a way that he concealed venters  the rider reined in his mount and with a lithe forwardslipping action appeared to reach the ground in one long step it was a peculiar movement in its quickness and inasmuch that while performing it the rider did not swerve in the slightest from a square front to the group before him  look hoarsely whispered one of tulls companions he packs two blackbutted gunslow downtheyre hard to seeblack akin them black chaps  a gunman whispered another fellers careful now about movin your hands  the strangers slow approach might have been a mere leisurely manner of gait or the cramped short steps of a rider unused to walking yet as well it could have been the guarded advance of one who took no chances with men  hello stranger called tull no welcome was in this greeting only a gruff curiosity  the rider responded with a curt nod the wide brim of a black sombrero cast a dark shade over his face for a moment he closely regarded tull and his comrades and then halting in his slow walk he seemed to relax  evenin maam he said to jane and removed his sombrero with quaint grace  jane greeting him looked up into a face that she trusted instinctively and which riveted her attention it had all the characteristics of the range ridersthe leanness the red burn of the sun and the set changelessness that came from years of silence and solitude but it was not these which held her rather the intensity of his gaze a strained weariness a piercing wistfulness of keen gray sight as if the man was forever looking for that which he never found janes subtle womans intuition even in that brief instant felt a sadness a hungering a secret  jane withersteen maam he inquired  yes she replied  the water here is yours  yes  may i water my horse  certainly theres the trough  but mebbe if you knew who i was he hesitated with his glance on the listening men mebbe you wouldnt let me water himthough i aint askin none for myself  stranger it doesnt matter who you are water your horse and if you are thirsty and hungry come into my house  thanks maam i cant accept for myselfbut for my tired horse  trampling of hoofs interrupted the rider more restless movements on the part of tulls men broke up the little circle exposing the prisoner venters  mebbe ive kind of hindered somethinfor a few moments perhaps inquired the rider  yes replied jane withersteen with a throb in her voice  she felt the drawing power of his eyes and then she saw him look at the bound venters and at the men who held him and their leader  in this here country all the rustlers an thieves an cutthroats an gunthrowers an allround nogood men jest happen to be gentiles maam which of the nogood class does that young feller belong to  he belongs to none of them hes an honest boy  you know that maam  yesyes  then what has he done to get tied up that way  his clear and distinct question meant for tull as well as for jane withersteen stilled the restlessness and brought a momentary silence  ask him replied jane her voice rising high  the rider stepped away from her moving out with the same slow measured stride in which he had approached and the fact that his action placed her wholly to one side and him no nearer to tull and his men had a penetrating significance  young feller speak up he said to venters  here stranger thiss none of your mix began tull dont try any interference youve been asked to drink and eat thats more than youd have got in any other village of the utah border water your horse and be on your way  easyeasyi aint interferin yet replied the rider the tone of his voice had undergone a change a different man had spoken where in addressing jane he had been mild and gentle now with his first speech to tull he was dry cool biting ive lest stumbled onto a queer deal seven mormons all packin guns an a gentile tied with a rope an a woman who swears by his honesty queer aint that  queer or not its none of your business retorted tull  where i was raised a womans word was law i aint quite outgrowed that yet  tull fumed between amaze and anger  meddler we have a law here something different from womans whimmormon law take care you dont transgress it  to hell with your mormon law  the deliberate speech marked the riders further change this time from kindly interest to an awakening menace it produced a transformation in tull and his companions the leader gasped and staggered backward at a blasphemous affront to an institution he held most sacred the man jerry holding the horses dropped the bridles and froze in his tracks like posts the other men stood watchfuleyed arms hanging rigid all waiting  speak up now young man what have you done to be roped that way  its a damned outrage burst out venters ive done no wrong ive offended this mormon elder by being a friend to that woman  maam is it truewhat he says asked the rider of jane but his quiveringly alert eyes never left the little knot of quiet men  true yes perfectly true she answered  well young man it seems to me that bein a friend to such a woman would be what you wouldnt want to help an couldnt help whats to be done to you for it  they intend to whip me you know what that meansin utah  i reckon replied the rider slowly  with his gray glance cold on the mormons with the restive bitchamping of the horses with jane failing to repress her mounting agitations with venters standing pale and still the tension of the moment tightened tull broke the spell with a laugh a laugh without mirth a laugh that was only a sound betraying fear  come on men he called  jane withersteen turned again to the rider  stranger can you do nothing to save venters  maam you ask me to save himfrom your own people  ask you i beg of you  but you dont dream who youre askin  oh sir i pray yousave him  these are mormons an i  atat any costsave him for ii care for him  tull snarled you lovesick fool tell your secrets therell be a way to teach you what youve never learned come men out of here  mormon the young man stays said the rider  like a shot his voice halted tull  what  wholl keep him hes my prisoner cried tull hotly stranger again i tell youdont mix here youve meddled enough go your way now or  listen he stays  absolute certainty beyond any shadow of doubt breathed in the riders low voice  who are you we are seven here  the rider dropped his sombrero and made a rapid movement singular in that it left him somewhat crouched arms bent and stiff with the big black gunsheaths swung round to the fore  lassiter  it was venterss wondering thrilling cry that bridged the fateful connection between the riders singular position and the dreaded name  tull put out a groping hand the life of his eyes dulled to the gloom with which men of his fear saw the approach of death but death while it hovered over him did not descend for the rider waited for the twitching fingers the downward flash of hand that did not come tull gathering himself together turned to the horses attended by his pale comrades    chapter ii cottonwoods  venters appeared too deeply moved to speak the gratitude his face expressed and jane turned upon the rescuer and gripped his hands her smiles and tears seemingly dazed him presently as something like calmness returned she went to lassiters weary horse  i will water him myself she said and she led the horse to a trough under a huge old cottonwood with nimble fingers she loosened the bridle and removed the bit the horse snorted and bent his head the trough was of solid stone hollowed out mosscovered and green and wet and cool and the clear brown water that fed it spouted and splashed from a wooden pipe  he has brought you far today  yes maam a matter of over sixty miles mebbe seventy  a long ridea ride thatah he is blind  yes maam replied lassiter  what blinded him  some men once roped an tied him an then held whiteiron close to his eyes  oh men you mean devils were they your enemiesmormons  yes maam  to take revenge on a horse lassiter the men of my creed are unnaturally cruel to my everlasting sorrow i confess it they have been driven hated scourged till their hearts have hardened but we women hope and pray for the time when our men will soften  beggin your pardon maamthat time will never come  oh it will lassiter do you think mormon women wicked has your hand been against them too  no i believe mormon women are the best and noblest the most longsufferin and the blindest unhappiest women on earth  ah she gave him a grave thoughtful look then you will break bread with me  lassiter had no ready response and he uneasily shifted his weight from one leg to another and turned his sombrero round and round in his hands maam he began presently i reckon your kindness of heart makes you overlook things perhaps i aint well known hereabouts but back up north theres mormons whod rest uneasy in their graves at the idea of me sittin to table with you  i dare say butwill you do it anyway she asked  mebbe you have a brother or relative who might drop in an be offended an i wouldnt want to  ive not a relative in utah that i know of theres no one with a right to question my actions she turned smilingly to venters you will come in bern and lassiter will come in well eat and be merry while we may  im only wonderin if tull an his menll raise a storm down in the village said lassiter in his last weakening stand  yes hell raise the stormafter he has prayed replied jane come  she led the way with the bridle of lassiters horse over her arm they entered a grove and walked down a wide path shaded by great lowbranching cottonwoods the last rays of the setting sun sent golden bars through the leaves the grass was deep and rich welcome contrast to sagetired eyes twittering quail darted across the path and from a treetop somewhere a robin sang its evening song and on the still air floated the freshness and murmur of flowing water  the home of jane withersteen stood in a circle of cottonwoods and was a flat long redstone structure with a covered court in the center through which flowed a lively stream of ambercolored water in the massive blocks of stone and heavy timbers and solid doors and shutters showed the hand of a man who had builded against pillage and time and in the flowers and mosses lining the stonebedded stream in the bright colors of rugs and blankets on the court floor and the cozy corner with hammock and books and the cleanlinened table showed the grace of a daughter who lived for happiness and the day at hand  jane turned lassiters horse loose in the thick grass you will want him to be near you she said or id have him taken to the alfalfa fields at her call appeared women who began at once to bustle about hurrying to and fro setting the table then jane excusing herself went within  she passed through a huge low ceiled chamber like the inside of a fort and into a smaller one where a bright woodfire blazed in an old open fireplace and from this into her own room it had the same comfort as was manifested in the homelike outer court moreover it was warm and rich in soft hues  seldom did jane withersteen enter her room without looking into her mirror she knew she loved the reflection of that beauty which since early childhood she had never been allowed to forget her relatives and friends and later a horde of mormon and gentile suitors had fanned the flame of natural vanity in her so that at twentyeight she scarcely thought at all of her wonderful influence for good in the little community where her father had left her practically its beneficent landlord but cared most for the dream and the assurance and the allurement of her beauty this time however she gazed into her glass with more than the usual happy motive without the usual slight conscious smile for she was thinking of more than the desire to be fair in her own eyes in those of her friend she wondered if she were to seem fair in the eyes of this lassiter this man whose name had crossed the long wild brakes of stone and plains of sage this gentlevoiced sadfaced man who was a hater and a killer of mormons it was not now her usual halfconscious vain obsession that actuated her as she hurriedly changed her ridingdress to one of white and then looked long at the stately form with its gracious contours at the fair face with its strong chin and full firm lips at the darkblue proud and passionate eyes  if by some means i can keep him here a few days a weekhe will never kill another mormon she mused lassiter i shudder when i think of that name of him but when i look at the man i forget who he isi almost like him i remember only that he saved bern he has suffered i wonder what it wasdid he love a mormon woman once how splendidly he championed us poor misunderstood souls somehow he knowsmuch  jane withersteen joined her guests and bade them to her board dismissing her woman she waited upon them with her own hands it was a bountiful supper and a strange company on her right sat the ragged and halfstarved venters and though blind eyes could have seen what he counted for in the sum of her happiness yet he looked the gloomy outcast his allegiance had made him and about him there was the shadow of the ruin presaged by tull on her left sat blackleathergarbed lassiter looking like a man in a dream hunger was not with him nor composure nor speech and when he twisted in frequent unquiet movements the heavy guns that he had not removed knocked against the tablelegs if it had been otherwise possible to forget the presence of lassiter those telling little jars would have rendered it unlikely and jane withersteen talked and smiled and laughed with all the dazzling play of lips and eyes that a beautiful daring woman could summon to her purpose  when the meal ended and the men pushed back their chairs she leaned closer to lassiter and looked square into his eyes  why did you come to cottonwoods  her question seemed to break a spell the rider arose as if he had just remembered himself and had tarried longer than his wont  maam i have hunted all over the southern utah and nevada forsomethin an through your name i learned where to find ithere in cottonwoods  my name oh i remember you did know my name when you spoke first well tell me where you heard it and from whom  at the little villageglaze i think its calledsome fifty miles or more west of here an i heard it from a gentile a rider who said youd know where to tell me to find  what she demanded imperiously as lassiter broke off  milly ernes grave he answered low and the words came with a wrench  venters wheeled in his chair to regard lassiter in amazement and jane slowly raised herself in white still wonder  milly ernes grave she echoed in a whisper what do you know of milly erne my bestbeloved friendwho died in my arms what were you to her  did i claim to be anythin he inquired i know peoplerelativeswho have long wanted to know where shes buried thats all  relatives she never spoke of relatives except a brother who was shot in texas lassiter milly ernes grave is in a secret buryingground on my property  will you take me there youll be offendin mormons worse than by breakin bread with me  indeed yes but ill do it only we must go unseen tomorrow perhaps  thank you jane withersteen replied the rider and he bowed to her and stepped backward out of the court  will you not staysleep under my roof she asked  no maam an thanks again i never sleep indoors an even if i did theres that gatherin storm in the village below no no ill go to the sage i hope you wont suffer none for your kindness to me  lassiter said venters with a halfbitter laugh my bed too is the sage perhaps we may meet out there  mebbe so but the sage is wide an i wont be near good night  at lassiters low whistle the black horse whinnied and carefully picked his blind way out of the grove the rider did not bridle him but walked beside him leading him by touch of hand and together they passed slowly into the shade of the cottonwoods  jane i must be off soon said venters give me my guns if id had my guns  either my friend or the elder of my church would be lying dead she interposed  tull would besurely  oh you fierceblooded savage youth cant i teach you forebearance mercy bern its divine to forgive your enemies let not the sun go down upon thy wrath  hush talk to me no more of mercy or religionafter today today this strange coming of lassiter left me still a man and now ill die a man give me my guns  silently she went into the house to return with a heavy cartridgebelt and gunfilled sheath and a long rifle these she handed to him and as he buckled on the belt she stood before him in silent eloquence  jane he said in gentler voice dont look so im not going out to murder your churchman ill try to avoid him and all his men but cant you see ive reached the end of my rope jane youre a wonderful woman never was there a woman so unselfish and good only youre blind in one way listen  from behind the grove came the clicking sound of horses in a rapid trot  some of your riders he continued its getting time for the night shift let us go out to the bench in the grove and talk there  it was still daylight in the open but under the spreading cottonwoods shadows were obscuring the lanes venters drew jane off from one of these into a shrublined trail just wide enough for the two to walk abreast and in a roundabout way led her far from the house to a knoll on the edge of the grove here in a secluded nook was a bench from which through an opening in the treetops could be seen the sageslope and the wall of rock and the dim lines of canyons jane had not spoken since venters had shocked her with his first harsh speech but all the way she had clung to his arm and now as he stopped and laid his rifle against the bench she still clung to him  jane im afraid i must leave you  bern she cried  yes it looks that way my position is not a happy onei cant feel rightive lost all  ill give you anything you  listen please when i say loss i dont mean what you think i mean loss of goodwill good namethat which would have enabled me to stand up in this village without bitterness well its too late now as to the future i think youd do best to give me up tull is implacable you ought to see from his intention today thatbut you cant see your blindnessyour damned religion jane forgive meim sore within and something rankles well i fear that invisible hand will turn its hidden work to your ruin  invisible hand bern  i mean your bishop venters said it deliberately and would not release her as she started back hes the law the edict went forth to ruin me well look at me itll now go forth to compel you to the will of the church  you wrong bishop dyer tull is hard i know but then he has been in love with me for years  oh your faith and your excuses you cant see what i knowand if you did see it youd not admit it to save your life thats the mormon of you these elders and bishops will do absolutely any deed to go on building up the power and wealth of their church their empire think of what theyve done to the gentiles here to methink of milly ernes fate  what do you know of her story  i know enoughall perhaps except the name of the mormon who brought her here but i must stop this kind of talk  she pressed his hand in response he helped her to a seat beside him on the bench and he respected a silence that he divined was full of womans deep emotion beyond his understanding  it was the moment when the last ruddy rays of the sunset brightened momentarily before yielding to twilight and for venters the outlook before him was in some sense similar to a feeling of his future and with searching eyes he studied the beautiful purple barren waste of sage here was the unknown and the perilous the whole scene impressed venters as a wild austere and mighty manifestation of nature and as it somehow reminded him of his prospect in life so it suddenly resembled the woman near him only in her there were greater beauty and peril a mystery more unsolvable and something nameless that numbed his heart and dimmed his eye  look a rider exclaimed jane breaking the silence can that be lassiter  venters moved his glance once more to the west a horseman showed dark on the skyline then merged into the color of the sage  it might be but i think notthat fellow was coming in one of your riders more likely yes i see him clearly now and theres another  i see them too  jane your riders seem as many as the bunches of sage i ran into five yesterday way down near the trail to deception pass they were with the white herd  you still go to that canyon bern i wish you wouldnt oldring and his rustlers live somewhere down there  well what of that  tull has already hinted to your frequent trips into deception pass  i know venters uttered a short laugh hell make a rustler of me next but jane theres no water for fifty miles after i leave here and the nearest is in the canyon i must drink and water my horse there i see more riders they are going out  the red herd is on the slope toward the pass  twilight was fast falling a group of horsemen crossed the dark line of low ground to become more distinct as they climbed the slope the silence broke to a clear call from an incoming rider and almost like the peal of a huntinghorn floated back the answer the outgoing riders moved swiftly came sharply into sight as they topped a ridge to show wild and black above the horizon and then passed down dimming into the purple of the sage  i hope they dont meet lassiter said jane  so do i replied venters by this time the riders of the night shift know what happened today but lassiter will likely keep out of their way  bern who is lassiter hes only a name to mea terrible name  who is he i dont know jane nobody i ever met knows him he talks a little like a texan like milly erne did you note that  yes how strange of him to know of her and she lived here ten years and has been dead two bern what do you know of lassiter tell me what he has donewhy you spoke of him to tullthreatening to become another lassiter yourself  jane i only heard things rumors stories most of which i disbelieved at glaze his name was known but none of the riders or ranchers i knew there ever met him at stone bridge i never heard him mentioned but at sterling and villages north of there he was spoken of often ive never been in a village which he had been known to visit there were many conflicting stories about him and his doings some said he had shot up this and that mormon village and others denied it im inclined to believe he has and you know how mormons hide the truth but there was one feature about lassiter upon which all agreethat he was what riders in this country call a gunman hes a man with a marvelous quickness and accuracy in the use of a colt and now that ive seen him i know more lassiter was born without fear i watched him with eyes which saw him my friend ill never forget the moment i recognized him from what had been told me of his crouch before the draw it was then i yelled his name i believe that yell saved tulls life at any rate i know this between tull and death then there was not the breadth of the littlest hair if he or any of his men had moved a finger downward  venters left his meaning unspoken but at the suggestion jane shuddered  the pale afterglow in the west darkened with the merging of twilight into night the sage now spread out black and gloomy one dim star glimmered in the southwest sky the sound of trotting horses had ceased and there was silence broken only by a faint dry pattering of cottonwood leaves in the soft night wind  into this peace and calm suddenly broke the highkeyed yelp of a coyote and from far off in the darkness came the faint answering note of a trailing mate  hello the sagedogs are barking said venters  i dont like to hear them replied jane at night sometimes when i lie awake listening to the long mourn or breaking bark or wild howl i think of you asleep somewhere in the sage and my heart aches  jane you couldnt listen to sweeter music nor could i have a better bed  just think men like lassiter and you have no home no comfort no rest no place to lay your weary heads well let us be patient tulls anger may cool and time may help us you might do some service to the villagewho can tell suppose you discovered the longunknown hidingplace of oldring and his band and told it to my riders that would disarm tulls ugly hints and put you in favor for years my riders have trailed the tracks of stolen cattle you know as well as i how dearly weve paid for our ranges in this wild country oldring drives our cattle down into the network of deceiving canyons and somewhere far to the north or east he drives them up and out to utah markets if you will spend time in deception pass try to find the trails  jane ive thought of that ill try  i must go now and it hurts for now ill never be sure of seeing you again but tomorrow bern  tomorrow surely ill watch for lassiter and ride in with him  good night  then she left him and moved away a white gliding shape that soon vanished in the shadows  venters waited until the faint slam of a door assured him she had reached the house and then taking up his rifle he noiselessly slipped through the bushes down the knoll and on under the dark trees to the edge of the grove the sky was now turning from gray to blue stars had begun to lighten the earlier blackness and from the wide flat sweep before him blew a cool wind fragrant with the breath of sage keeping close to the edge of the cottonwoods he went swiftly and silently westward the grove was long and he had not reached the end when he heard something that brought him to a halt low padded thuds told him horses were coming this way he sank down in the gloom waiting listening much before he had expected judging from sound to his amazement he descried horsemen near at hand they were riding along the border of the sage and instantly he knew the hoofs of the horses were muffled then the pale starlight afforded him indistinct sight of the riders but his eyes were keen and used to the dark and by peering closely he recognized the huge bulk and blackbearded visage of oldring and the lithe supple form of the rustlers lieutenant a masked rider they passed on the darkness swallowed them then farther out on the sage a dark compact body of horsemen went by almost without sound almost like specters and they too melted into the night    chapter iii amber spring  no unusual circumstances was it for oldring and some of his men to visit cottonwoods in the broad light of day but for him to prowl about in the dark with the hoofs of his horses muffled meant that mischief was brewing moreover to venters the presence of the masked rider with oldring seemed especially ominous for about this man there was mystery he seldom rode through the village and when he did ride through it was swiftly riders seldom met by day on the sage but wherever he rode there always followed deeds as dark and mysterious as the mask he wore oldrings band did not confine themselves to the rustling of cattle  venters lay low in the shade of the cottonwoods pondering this chance meeting and not for many moments did he consider it safe to move on then with sudden impulse he turned the other way and went back along the grove when he reached the path leading to janes home he decided to go down to the village so he hurried onward with quick soft steps once beyond the grove he entered the one and only street it was wide lined with tall poplars and under each row of trees inside the footpath were ditches where ran the water from jane withersteens spring  between the trees twinkled lights of cottage candles and far down flared bright windows of the village stores when venters got closer to these he saw knots of men standing together in earnest conversation the usual lounging on the corners and benches and steps was not in evidence keeping in the shadow venters went closer and closer until he could hear voices but he could not distinguish what was said he recognized many mormons and looked hard for tull and his men but looked in vain venters concluded that the rustlers had not passed along the village street no doubt these earnest men were discussing lassiters coming but venters felt positive that tulls intention toward himself that day had not been and would not be revealed  so venters seeing there was little for him to learn began retracing his steps the church was dark bishop dyers home next to it was also dark and likewise tulls cottage upon almost any night at this hour there would be lights here and venters marked the unusual omission  as he was about to pass out of the street to skirt the grove he once more slunk down at the sound of trotting horses presently he descried two mounted men riding toward him he hugged the shadow of a tree again the starlight brighter now aided him and he made out tulls stalwart figure and beside him the short froglike shape of the rider jerry they were silent and they rode on to disappear  venters went his way with busy gloomy mind revolving events of the day trying to reckon those brooding in the night his thoughts overwhelmed him up in that dark grove dwelt a woman who had been his friend and he skulked about her home gripping a gun stealthily as an indian a man without place or people or purpose above her hovered the shadow of grim hidden secret power no queen could have given more royally out of a bounteous store than jane withersteen gave her people and likewise to those unfortunates whom her people hated she asked only the divine right of all womenfreedom to love and to live as her heart willed and yet prayer and her hope were vain  for years ive seen a storm clouding over her and the village of cottonwoods muttered venters as he strode on soon itll burst i dont like the prospects that night the villagers whispered in the streetand nightriding rustlers muffled horsesand tull was at work in secretand out there in the sage hid a man who meant something terriblelassiter  venters passed the black cottonwoods and entering the sage climbed the gradual slope he kept his direction in line with a western star from time to time he stopped to listen and heard only the usual familiar bark of coyote and sweep of wind and rustle of sage presently a low jumble of rocks loomed up darkly somewhat to his right and turning that way he whistled softly out of the rocks glided a dog that leaped and whined about him he climbed over rough broken rock picking his way carefully and then went down here it was darker and sheltered from the wind a white object guided him it was another dog and this one was asleep curled up between a saddle and a pack the animal awoke and thumped his tail in greeting venters placed the saddle for a pillow rolled in his blankets with his face upward to the stars the white dog snuggled close to him the other whined and pattered a few yards to the rise of ground and there crouched on guard and in that wild covert venters shut his eyes under the great white stars and intense vaulted blue bitterly comparing their loneliness to his own and fell asleep  when he awoke day had dawned and all about him was bright steelgray the air had a cold tang arising he greeted the fawning dogs and stretched his cramped body and then gathering together bunches of dead sage sticks he lighted a fire strips of dried beef held to the blaze for a moment served him and the dogs he drank from a canteen there was nothing else in his outfit he had grown used to a scant fire then he sat over the fire palms outspread and waited waiting had been his chief occupation for months and he scarcely knew what he waited for unless it was the passing of the hours but now he sensed action in the immediate present the day promised another meeting with lassiter and lane perhaps news of the rustlers on the morrow he meant to take the trail to deception pass  and while he waited he talked to his dogs he called them ring and whitie they were sheepdogs half collie half deerhound superb in build perfectly trained it seemed that in his fallen fortunes these dogs understood the nature of their value to him and governed their affection and faithfulness accordingly whitie watched him with somber eyes of love and ring crouched on the little rise of ground above kept tireless guard when the sun rose the white dog took the place of the other and ring went to sleep at his masters feet  by and by venters rolled up his blankets and tied them and his meager pack together then climbed out to look for his horse he saw him presently a little way off in the sage and went to fetch him in that country where every rider boasted of a fine mount and was eager for a race where thoroughbreds dotted the wonderful grazing ranges venters rode a horse that was sad proof of his misfortunes  then with his back against a stone venters faced the east and stick in hand and idle blade he waited the glorious sunlight filled the valley with purple fire before him to left to right waving rolling sinking rising like low swells of a purple sea stretched the sage out of the grove of cottonwoods a green patch on the purple gleamed the dull red of jane withersteens old stone house and from there extended the wide green of the village gardens and orchards marked by the graceful poplars and farther down shone the deep dark richness of the alfalfa fields numberless red and black and white dots speckled the sage and these were cattle and horses  so watching and waiting venters let the time wear away at length he saw a horse rise above a ridge and he knew it to be lassiters black climbing to the highest rock so that he would show against the skyline he stood and waved his hat the almost instant turning of lassiters horse attested to the quickness of that riders eye then venters climbed down saddled his horse tied on his pack and with a word to his dogs was about to ride out to meet lassiter when he concluded to wait for him there on higher ground where the outlook was commanding  it had been long since venters had experienced friendly greeting from a man lassiters warmed in him something that had grown cold from neglect and when he had returned it with a strong grip of the iron hand that held his and met the gray eyes he knew that lassiter and he were to be friends  venters lets talk awhile before we go down there said lassiter slipping his bridle i aint in no hurry thems sure fine dogs youve got with a riders eye he took in the points of venters horse but did not speak his thought well did anythin come off after i left you last night  venters told him about the rustlers  i was snug hid in the sage replied lassiter an didnt see or hear no one oldrins got a high hand here i reckon its no news up in utah how he holes in canyons an leaves no track lassiter was silent a moment me an oldrin wasnt exactly strangers some years back when he drove cattle into bostils ford at the head of the rio virgin but he got harassed there an now he drives some place else  lassiter you knew him tell me is he mormon or gentile  i cant say ive knowed mormons who pretended to be gentiles  no mormon ever pretended that unless he was a rustler declared venters  mebbe so  its a hard country for any one but hardest for gentiles did you ever know or hear of a gentile prospering in a mormon community  i never did  well i want to get out of utah ive a mother living in illinois i want to go home its eight years now  the older mans sympathy moved venters to tell his story he had left quincy run off to seek his fortune in the gold fields had never gotten any farther than salt lake city wandered here and there as helper teamster shepherd and drifted southward over the divide and across the barrens and up the rugged plateau through the passes to the last border settlements here he became a rider of the sage had stock of his own and for a time prospered until chance threw him in the employ of jane withersteen  lassiter i neednt tell you the rest  well itd be no news to me i know mormons ive seen their womens strange love en patience en sacrifice an silence en whet i call madness for their idea of god an over against that ive seen the tricks of men they work hand in hand all together an in the dark no man can hold out against them unless he takes to packin guns for mormons are slow to kill thats the only good i ever seen in their religion venters take this from me these mormons aint just right in their minds else could a mormon marry one woman when he already has a wife an call it duty  lassiter you think as i think returned venters  howd it come then that you never throwed a gun on tull or some of them inquired the rider curiously  jane pleaded with me begged me to be patient to overlook she even took my guns from me i lost all before i knew it replied venters with the red color in his face but lassiter listen out of the wreck i saved a winchester two colts and plenty of shells i packed these down into deception pass there almost every day for six months i have practiced with my rifle till the barrel burnt my hands practised the drawthe firing of a colt hour after hour  now thats interestin to me said lassiter with a quick uplift of his head and a concentration of his gray gaze on venters could you throw a gun before you began that practisin  yes and now venters made a lightningswift movement  lassiter smiled and then his bronzed eyelids narrowed till his eyes seemed mere gray slits youll kill tull he did not question he affirmed  i promised jane withersteen id try to avoid tull ill keep my word but sooner or later tull and i will meet as i feel now if he even looks at me ill draw  i reckon so therell be hell down there presently he paused a moment and flicked a sagebrush with his quirt venters seein as youre considerable worked up tell me milly ernes story  venterss agitation stilled to the trace of suppressed eagerness in lassiters query  milly ernes story well lassiter ill tell you what i know milly erne had been in cottonwoods years when i first arrived there and most of what i tell you happened before my arrival i got to know her pretty well she was a slip of a woman and crazy on religion i conceived an idea that i never mentionedi thought she was at heart more gentile than mormon but she passed as a mormon and certainly she had the mormon womans locked lips you know in every mormon village there are women who seem mysterious to us but about milly there was more than the ordinary mystery when she came to cottonwoods she had a beautiful little girl whom she loved passionately milly was not known openly in cottonwoods as a mormon wife that she really was a mormon wife i have no doubt perhaps the mormons other wife or wives would not acknowledge milly such things happen in these villages mormon wives wear yokes but they get jealous well whatever had brought milly to this countrylove or madness of religionshe repented of it she gave up teaching the village school she quit the church and she began to fight mormon upbringing for her baby girl then the mormons put on the screwsslowly as is their way at last the child disappeared lost was the report the child was stolen i know that so do you that wrecked milly erne but she lived on in hope she became a slave she worked her heart and soul and life out to get back her child she never heard of it again then she sank i can see her now a frail thing so transparent you could almost look through herwhite like ashesand her eyes her eyes have always haunted me she had one real friendjane withersteen but jane couldnt mend a broken heart and milly died  for moments lassiter did not speak or turn his head  the man he exclaimed presently in husky accents  i havent the slightest idea who the mormon was replied venters nor has any gentile in cottonwoods  does jane withersteen know  yes but a redhot runningiron couldnt burn that name out of her  without further speech lassiter started off walking his horse and venters followed with his dogs half a mile down the slope they entered a luxuriant growth of willows and soon came into an open space carpeted with grass like deep green velvet the rushing of water and singing of birds filled their ears venters led his comrade to a shady bower and showed him amber spring it was a magnificent outburst of clear amber water pouring from a dark stonelined hole lassiter knelt and drank lingered there to drink again he made no comment but venters did not need words next to his horse a rider of the sage loved a spring and this spring was the most beautiful and remarkable known to the upland riders of southern utah it was the spring that made old withersteen a feudal lord and now enabled his daughter to return the toll which her father had exacted from the toilers of the sage  the spring gushed forth in a swirling torrent and leaped down joyously to make its swift way along a willowskirted channel moss and ferns and lilies overhung its green banks except for the roughhewn stones that held and directed the water this willow thicket and glade had been left as nature had made it  below were artificial lakes three in number one above the other in banks of raised earth and round about them rose the lofty greenfoliaged shafts of poplar trees ducks dotted the glassy surface of the lakes a blue heron stood motionless on a watergate kingfishers darted with shrieking flight along the shady banks a white hawk sailed above and from the trees and shrubs came the song of robins and catbirds it was all in strange contrast to the endless slopes of lonely sage and the wild rock environs beyond venters thought of the woman who loved the birds and the green of the leaves and the murmur of the water  next on the slope just below the third and largest lake were corrals and a wide stone barn and open sheds and coops and pens here were clouds of dust and cracking sounds of hoofs and romping colts and heehawing burros neighing horses trampled to the corral fences and on the little windows of the barn projected bobbing heads of bays and blacks and sorrels when the two men entered the immense barnyard from all around the din increased this welcome however was not seconded by the several men and boys who vanished on sight  venters and lassiter were turning toward the house when jane appeared in the lane leading a horse in ridingskirt and blouse she seemed to have lost some of her statuesque proportions and looked more like a girl rider than the mistress of withersteen she was brightly smiling and her greeting was warmly cordial  good news she announced ive been to the village all is quiet i expectedi dont know what but theres no excitement and tull has ridden out on his way to glaze  tull gone inquired venters with surprise he was wondering what could have taken tull away was it to avoid another meeting with lassiter that he went could it have any connection with the probable nearness of oldring and his gang  gone yes thank goodness replied jane now ill have peace for a while lassiter i want you to see my horses you are a rider and you must be a judge of horseflesh some of mine have arabian blood my father got his best strain in nevada from indians who claimed their horses were bred down from the original stock left by the spaniards  well maam the one youve been ridin takes my eye said lassiter as he walked round the racy cleanlimbed and finepointed roan  where are the boys she asked looking about jerd paul where are you here bring out the horses  the sound of dropping bars inside the barn was the signal for the horses to jerk their heads in the windows to snort and stamp then they came pounding out of the door a file of thoroughbreds to plunge about the barnyard heads and tails up manes flying they halted afar off squared away to look came slowly forward with whinnies for their mistress and doubtful snorts for the strangers and their horses  comecomecome called jane holding out her hands why bellswrangle where are your manners come black starcome night ah you beauties my racers of the sage  only two came up to her those she called night and black star venters never looked at them without delight the first was soft dead black the other glittering black and they were perfectly matched in size both being high and longbodied wide through the shoulders with lithe powerful legs that they were a womans pets showed in the gloss of skin the fineness of mane it showed too in the light of big eyes and the gentle reach of eagerness  i never seen their like was lassiters encomium an in my day ive seen a sight of horses now maam if you was wantin to make a long an fast ride across the sagesay to elope  lassiter ended there with dry humor yet behind that was meaning jane blushed and made arch eyes at him  take care lassiter i might think that a proposal she replied gaily its dangerous to propose elopement to a mormon woman well i was expecting you now will be a good hour to show you milly ernes grave the dayriders have gone and the nightriders havent come in bern what do you make of that need i worry you know i have to be made to worry  well its not usual for the night shift to ride in so late replied venters slowly and his glance sought lassiters cattle are usually quiet after dark still ive known even a coyote to stampede your white herd  i refuse to borrow trouble come said jane  they mounted and with jane in the lead rode down the lane and turning off into a cattle trail proceeded westward venterss dogs trotted behind them on this side of the ranch the outlook was different from that on the other the immediate foreground was rough and the sage more rugged and less colorful there were no darkblue lines of canyons to hold the eye nor any uprearing rock walls it was a long roll and slope into gray obscurity soon jane left the trail and rode into the sage and presently she dismounted and threw her bridle the men did likewise then on foot they followed her coming out at length on the rim of a low escarpment she passed by several little ridges of earth to halt before a faintly defined mound it lay in the shade of a sweeping sagebrush close to the edge of the promontory and a rider could have jumped his horse over it without recognizing a grave  here  she looked sad as she spoke but she offered no explanation for the neglect of an unmarked uncaredfor grave there was a little bunch of pale sweet lavender daisies doubtless planted there by jane  i only come here to remember and to pray she said but i leave no trail  a grave in the sage how lonely this restingplace of milly erne the cottonwoods or the alfalfa fields were not in sight nor was there any rock or ridge or cedar to lend contrast to the monotony gray slopes tinging the purple barren and wild with the wind waving the sage swept away to the dim horizon  lassiter looked at the grave and then out into space at that moment he seemed a figure of bronze  jane touched venterss arm and led him back to the horses  bern cried jane when they were out of hearing suppose lassiter were millys husbandthe father of that little girl lost so long ago  it might be jane let us ride on if he wants to see us again hell come  so they mounted and rode out to the cattle trail and began to climb from the height of the ridge where they had started down venters looked back he did not see lassiter but his glance drawn irresistibly farther out on the gradual slope caught sight of a moving cloud of dust  hello a rider  yes i see said jane  that fellows riding hard jane theres something wrong  oh yes there must be how he rides  the horse disappeared in the sage and then puffs of dust marked his course  hes shortcut on ushes making straight for the corrals  venters and jane galloped their steeds and reined in at the turning of the lane this lane led down to the right of the grove suddenly into its lower entrance flashed a bay horse then venters caught the fast rhythmic beat of pounding hoofs soon his keen eye recognized the swing of the rider in his saddle  its judkins your gentile rider he cried jane when judkins rides like that it means hell    chapter iv deception pass  the rider thundered up and almost threw his foamflecked horse in the sudden stop he was a giant form and with fearless eyes  judkins youre all bloody cried jane in affright oh youve been shot  nothin much miss withersteen i got a nick in the shoulder im some wet an the hosss been throwin lather so all this aint blood  whats up queried venters sharply  rustlers sloped off with the red herd  where are my riders demanded jane  miss withersteen i was alone all night with the herd at daylight this mornin the rustlers rode down they began to shoot at me on sight they chased me hard an far burnin powder all the time but i got away  jud they meant to kill you declared venters  now i wonder returned judkins they wanted me bad an it aint regular for rustlers to waste time chasin one rider  thank heaven you got away said jane but my riderswhere are they  i dont know the nightriders werent there last night when i rode down en this mornin i met no dayriders  judkins bern theyve been set uponkilled by oldrings men  i dont think so replied venters decidedly jane your riders havent gone out in the sage  bern what do you mean jane withersteen turned deathly pale  you remember what i said about the unseen hand  oh impossible  i hope so but i fear venters finished with a shake of his head  bern youre bitter but thats only natural well wait to see whats happened to my riders judkins come to the house with me your wound must be attended to  jane ill find out where oldring drives the herd vowed venters  no no bern dont risk it nowwhen the rustlers are in such shooting mood  im going jud how many cattle in that red herd  twentyfive hundred head  whew what on earth can oldring do with so many cattle why a hundred head is a big steal ive got to find out  dont go implored jane  bern you want a hoss thet can run miss withersteen if its not too bold of me to advise make him take a fast hoss or dont let him go  yes yes judkins he must ride a horse that cant be caught which oneblack starnight  jane i wont take either said venters emphatically i wouldnt risk losing one of your favorites  wrangle then  thets the hoss replied judkins wrangle can outrun black star an night youd never believe it miss withersteen but i know wrangles the biggest en fastest hoss on the sage  oh no wrangle cant beat black star but bern take wrangle if you will go ask jerd for anything you need oh be watchful careful god speed you  she clasped his hand turned quickly away and went down a lane with the rider  venters rode to the barn and leaping off shouted for jerd the boy came running venters sent him for meat bread and dried fruits to be packed in saddlebags his own horse he turned loose into the nearest corral then he went for wrangle the giant sorrel had earned his name for a trait the opposite of amiability he came readily out of the barn but once in the yard he broke from venters and plunged about with ears laid back venters had to rope him and then he kicked down a section of fence stood on his hind legs crashed down and fought the rope jerd returned to lend a hand  wrangle dont git enough work said jerd as the big saddle went on hes unruly when hes corralled an wants to run wait till he smells the sage  jerd this horse is an ironjawed devil i never straddled him but once run say hes swift as wind  when venterss boot touched the stirrup the sorrel bolted giving him the riders flying mount the swing of this fiery horse recalled to venters days that were not really long past when he rode into the sage as the leader of jane withersteens riders wrangle pulled hard on a tight rein he galloped out of the lane down the shady border of the grove and hauled up at the wateringtrough where he pranced and champed his bit venters got off and filled his canteen while the horse drank the dogs ring and whitie came trotting up for their drink then venters remounted and turned wrangle toward the sage  a wide white trail wound away down the slope one keen sweeping glance told venters that there was neither man nor horse nor steer within the limit of his vision unless they were lying down in the sage ring loped in the lead and whitie loped in the rear wrangle settled gradually into an easy swinging canter and venterss thoughts now that the rush and flurry of the start were past and the long miles stretched before him reverted to a calm reckoning of late singular coincidences  there was the night ride of tulls which viewed in the light of subsequent events had a look of his covert machinations oldring and his masked rider and his rustlers riding muffled horses the report that tull had ridden out that morning with his man jerry on the trail to glaze the strange disappearance of jane withersteens riders the unusually determined attempt to kill the one gentile still in her employ an intention frustrated no doubt only by judkins magnificent riding of her racer and lastly the driving of the red herd these events to venterss color of mind had a dark relationship remembering janes accusation of bitterness he tried hard to put aside his rancor in judging tull but it was bitter knowledge that made him see the truth he had felt the shadow of an unseen hand he had watched till he saw its dim outline and then he had traced it to a mans hate to the rivalry of a mormon elder to the power of a bishop to the long farreaching arm of a terrible creed that unseen hand had made its first move against jane withersteen her riders had been called in leaving her without help to drive seven thousand head of cattle but to venters it seemed extraordinary that the power which had called in these riders had left so many cattle to be driven by rustlers and harried by wolves for hand in glove with that power was an insatiate greed they were one and the same  what can oldring do with twentyfive hundred head of cattle muttered venters is he a mormon did he meet tull last night it looks like a black plot to me but tull and his churchmen wouldnt ruin jane withersteen unless the church was to profit by that ruin where does oldring come in im going to find out about these things  wrangle did the twentyfive miles in three hours and walked little of the way when he had gotten warmed up he had been allowed to choose his own gait the afternoon had well advanced when venters struck the trail of the red herd and found where it had grazed the night before then venters rested the horse and used his eyes near at hand were a cow and a calf and several yearlings and farther out in the sage some straggling steers he caught a glimpse of coyotes skulking near the cattle the slow sweeping gaze of the rider failed to find other living things within the field of sight the sage about him was breasthigh to his horse oversweet with its warm fragrant breath gray where it waved to the light darker where the wind left it still and beyond the wonderful hazepurple lent by distance far across that wide waste began the slow lift of uplands through which deception pass cut its tortuous manycanyoned way  venters raised the bridle of his horse and followed the broad cattle trail the crushed sage resembled the path of a monster snake in a few miles of travel he passed several cows and calves that had escaped the drive then he stood on the last high bench of the slope with the floor of the valley beneath the opening of the canyon showed in a break of the sage and the cattle trail paralleled it as far as he could see that trail led to an undiscovered point where oldring drove cattle into the pass and many a rider who had followed it had never returned venters satisfied himself that the rustlers had not deviated from their usual course and then he turned at right angles off the cattle trail and made for the head of the pass  the sun lost its heat and wore down to the western horizon where it changed from white to gold and rested like a huge ball about to roll on its golden shadows down the slope venters watched the lengthening of the rays and bars and marveled at his own leaguelong shadow the sun sank there was instant shading of brightness about him and he saw a kind of cold purple bloom creep ahead of him to cross the canyon to mount the opposite slope and chase and darken and bury the last golden flare of sunlight  venters rode into a trail that he always took to get down into the canyon he dismounted and found no tracks but his own made days previous nevertheless he sent the dog ring ahead and waited in a little while ring returned whereupon venters led his horse on to the break in the ground  the opening into deception pass was one of the remarkable natural phenomena in a country remarkable for vast slopes of sage uplands insulated by gigantic red walls and deep canyons of mysterious source and outlet here the valley floor was level and here opened a narrow chasm a ragged vent in yellow walls of stone the trail down the five hundred feet of sheer depth always tested venterss nerve it was bad going for even a burro but wrangle as venters led him snorted defiance or disgust rather than fear and like a hobbled horse on the jump lifted his ponderous ironshod fore hoofs and crashed down over the first rough step venters warmed to greater admiration of the sorrel and giving him a loose bridle he stepped down foot by foot oftentimes the stones and shale started by wrangle buried venters to his knees again he was hard put to it to dodge a rolling boulder there were times when he could not see wrangle for dust and once he and the horse rode a sliding shelf of yellow weathered cliff it was a trail on which there could be no stops and therefore if perilous it was at least one that did not take long in the descent  venters breathed lighter when that was over and felt a sudden assurance in the success of his enterprise for at first it had been a reckless determination to achieve something at any cost and now it resolved itself into an adventure worthy of all his reason and cunning and keenness of eye and ear  pinyon pines clustered in little clumps along the level floor of the pass twilight had gathered under the walls venters rode into the trail and up the canyon gradually the trees and caves and objects low down turned black and this blackness moved up the walls till night enfolded the pass while day still lingered above the sky darkened and stars began to show at first pale and then bright sharp notches of the rimwall biting like teeth into the blue were landmarks by which venters knew where his camping site lay he had to feel his way through a thicket of slender oaks to a spring where he watered wrangle and drank himself here he unsaddled and turned wrangle loose having no fear that the horse would leave the thick cool grass adjacent to the spring next he satisfied his own hunger fed ring and whitie and with them curled beside him composed himself to await sleep  there had been a time when night in the high altitude of these utah uplands had been satisfying to venters but that was before the oppression of enemies had made the change in his mind as a rider guarding the herd he had never thought of the nights wildness and loneliness as an outcast now when the full silence set in and the deep darkness and trains of radiant stars shone cold and calm he lay with an ache in his heart for a year he had lived as a black fox driven from his kind he longed for the sound of a voice the touch of a hand in the daytime there was riding from place to place and the gun practice to which something drove him and other tasks that at least necessitated action at night before he won sleep there was strife in his soul he yearned to leave the endless sage slopes the wilderness of canyons and it was in the lonely night that this yearning grew unbearable it was then that he reached forth to feel ring or whitie immeasurably grateful for the love and companionship of two dogs  on this night the same old loneliness beset venters the old habit of sad thought and burning unquiet had its way but from it evolved a conviction that his useless life had undergone a subtle change he had sensed it first when wrangle swung him up to the high saddle he knew it now when he lay in the gateway of deception pass he had no thrill of adventure rather a gloomy perception of great hazard perhaps death he meant to find oldrings retreat the rustlers had fast horses but none that could catch wrangle venters knew no rustler could creep upon him at night when ring and whitie guarded his hidingplace for the rest he had eyes and ears and a long rifle and an unerring aim which he meant to use strangely his foreshadowing of change did not hold a thought of the killing of tull it related only to what was to happen to him in deception pass and he could no more lift the veil of that mystery than tell where the trails led to in that unexplored canyon moreover he did not care and at length tired out by stress of thought he fell asleep  when his eyes unclosed day had come again and he saw the rim of the opposite wall tipped with the gold of sunrise a few moments sufficed for the mornings simple camp duties near at hand he found wrangle and to his surprise the horse came to him wrangle was one of the horses that left his viciousness in the home corral what he wanted was to be free of mules and burros and steers to roll in dustpatches and then to run down the wide open windy sageplains and at night browse and sleep in the cool wet grass of a springhole jerd knew the sorrel when he said of him wait till he smells the sage  venters saddled and led him out of the oak thicket and leaping astride rode up the canyon with ring and whitie trotting behind an old grassgrown trail followed the course of a shallow wash where flowed a thin stream of water the canyon was a hundred rods wide its yellow walls were perpendicular it had abundant sage and a scant growth of oak and pinon for five miles it held to a comparatively straight bearing and then began a heightening of rugged walls and a deepening of the floor beyond this point of sudden change in the character of the canyon venters had never explored and here was the real door to the intricacies of deception pass  he reined wrangle to a walk halted now and then to listen and then proceeded cautiously with shifting and alert gaze the canyon assumed proportions that dwarfed those of its first ten miles venters rode on and on not losing in the interest of his wide surroundings any of his caution or keen search for tracks or sight of living thing if there ever had been a trail here he could not find it he rode through sage and clumps of pinon trees and grassy plots where longpetaled purple lilies bloomed he rode through a dark constriction of the pass no wider than the lane in the grove at cottonwoods and he came out into a great amphitheater into which jutted huge towering corners of a confluences of intersecting canyons  venters sat his horse and with a riders eye studied this wild crosscut of huge stone gullies then he went on guided by the course of running water if it had not been for the main stream of water flowing north he would never have been able to tell which of those many openings was a continuation of the pass in crossing this amphitheater he went by the mouths of five canyons fording little streams that flowed into the larger one gaining the outlet which he took to be the pass he rode on again under over hanging walls one side was dark in shade the other light in sun this narrow passageway turned and twisted and opened into a valley that amazed venters  here again was a sweep of purple sage richer than upon the higher levels the valley was miles long several wide and inclosed by unscalable walls but it was the background of this valley that so forcibly struck him across the sageflat rose a strange upflinging of yellow rocks he could not tell which were close and which were distant scrawled mounds of stone like mountain waves seemed to roll up to steep bare slopes and towers  in this plain of sage venters flushed birds and rabbits and when he had proceeded about a mile he caught sight of the bobbing white tails of a herd of running antelope he rode along the edge of the stream which wound toward the western end of the slowly looming mounds of stone the high slope retreated out of sight behind the nearer protection to venters the valley appeared to have been filled in by a mountain of melted stone that had hardened in strange shapes of rounded outline he followed the stream till he lost it in a deep cut therefore venters quit the dark slit which baffled further search in that direction and rode out along the curved edge of stone where it met the sage it was not long before he came to a low place and here wrangle readily climbed up  all about him was ridgy roll of windsmoothed rainwashed rock not a tuft of grass or a bunch of sage colored the dull rustyellow he saw where to the right this uneven flow of stone ended in a blunt wall leftward from the hollow that lay at his feet mounted a gradual slowswelling slope to a great height topped by leaning cracked and ruined crags not for some time did he grasp the wonder of that acclivity it was no less than a mountainside glistening in the sun like polished granite with cedartrees springing as if by magic out of the denuded surface winds had swept it clear of weathered shale and rains had washed it free of dust far up the curved slope its beautiful lines broke to meet the vertical rimwall to lose its grace in a different order and color of rock a stained yellow cliff of cracks and caves and seamed crags and straight before venters was a scene less striking but more significant to his keen survey for beyond a mile of the bare hummocky rock began the valley of sage and the mouths of canyons one of which surely was another gateway into the pass   he got off his horse and giving the bridle to ring to hold he commenced a search for the cleft where the stream ran he was not successful and concluded the water dropped into an underground passage then he returned to where he had left wrangle and led him down off the stone to the sage it was a short ride to the opening canyons there was no reason for a choice of which one to enter the one he rode into was a clear sharp shaft in yellow stone a thousand feet deep with wonderful windworn caves low down and high above buttressed and turreted ramparts farther on venters came into a region where deep indentations marked the line of canyon walls these were huge covelike blind pockets extending back to a sharp corner with a dense growth of underbrush and trees  venters penetrated into one of these offshoots and as he had hoped he found abundant grass he had to bend the oak saplings to get his horse through deciding to make this a hidingplace if he could find water he worked back to the limit of the shelving walls in a little cluster of silver spruces he found a spring this inclosed nook seemed an ideal place to leave his horse and to camp at night and from which to make stealthy trips on foot the thick grass hid his trail the dense growth of oaks in the opening would serve as a barrier to keep wrangle in if indeed the luxuriant browse would not suffice for that so venters leaving whitie with the horse called ring to his side and rifle in hand worked his way out to the open a careful photographing in mind of the formation of the bold outlines of rimrock assured him he would be able to return to his retreat even in the dark  bunches of scattered sage covered the center of the canyon and among these venters threaded his way with the step of an indian at intervals he put his hand on the dog and stopped to listen there was a drowsy hum of insects but no other sound disturbed the warm midday stillness venters saw ahead a turn more abrupt than any yet warily he rounded this corner once again to halt bewildered  the canyon opened fanshaped into a great oval of green and gray growths it was the hub of an oblong wheel and from it at regular distances like spokes ran the outgoing canyons here a dull red color predominated over the fading yellow the corners of wall bluntly rose scarred and scrawled to taper into towers and serrated peaks and pinnacled domes  venters pushed on more heedfully than ever toward the center of this circle the sagebrush grew smaller and farther apart he was about to sheer off to the right where thickets and jumbles of fallen rock would afford him cover when he ran right upon a broad cattle trail like a road it was more than a trail and the cattle tracks were fresh what surprised him more they were wet he pondered over this feature it had not rained the only solution to this puzzle was that the cattle had been driven through water and water deep enough to wet their legs  suddenly ring growled low venters rose cautiously and looked over the sage a band of straggling horsemen were riding across the oval he sank down startled and trembling rustlers he muttered hurriedly he glanced about for a place to hide near at hand there was nothing but sagebrush he dared not risk crossing the open patches to reach the rocks again he peeped over the sage the rustlersfourfiveseveneight in all were approaching but not directly in line with him that was relief for a cold deadness which seemed to be creeping inward along his veins he crouched down with bated breath and held the bristling dog  he heard the click of ironshod hoofs on stone the coarse laughter of men and then voices gradually dying away long moments passed then he rose the rustlers were riding into a canyon their horses were tired and they had several pack animals evidently they had traveled far venters doubted that they were the rustlers who had driven the red herd oldings band had split venters watched these horsemen disappear under a bold canyon wall  the rustlers had come from the northwest side of the oval venters kept a steady gaze in that direction hoping if there were more to see from what canyon they rode a quarter of an hour went by reward for his vigilance came when he descried three more mounted men far over to the north but out of what canyon they had ridden it was too late to tell he watched the three ride across the oval and round the jutting red corner where the others had gone  up that canyon exclaimed venters oldrings den ive found it  a knotty point for venters was the fact that the cattle tracks all pointed west the broad trail came from the direction of the canyon into which the rustlers had ridden and undoubtedly the cattle had been driven out of it across the oval there were no tracks pointing the other way it had been in his mind that oldring had driven the red herd toward the rendezvous and not from it where did that broad trail come down into the pass and where did it lead venters knew he wasted time in pondering the question but it held a fascination not easily dispelled for many years oldrings mysterious entrance and exit to deception pass had been allabsorbing topics to sageriders  all at once the dog put an end to venterss pondering ring sniffed the air turned slowly in his tracks with a whine and then growled venters wheeled two horsemen were within a hundred yards coming straight at him one lagging behind the other was oldrings masked rider  venters cunningly sank slowly trying to merge into sagebrush but guarded as his action was the first horse detected it he stopped short snorted and shot up his ears the rustler bent forward as if keenly peering ahead then with a swift sweep he jerked a gun from its sheath and fired  the bullet zipped through the sagebrush flying bits of wood struck venters and the hot stinging pain seemed to lift him in one leap like a flash the blue barrel of his rifle gleamed level and he shot oncetwice  the foremost rustler dropped his weapon and toppled from his saddle to fall with his foot catching in a stirrup the horse snorted wildly and plunged away dragging the rustler through the sage  the masked rider huddled over his pommel slowly swaying to one side and then with a faint strange cry slipped out of the saddle    chapter v the masked rider  venters looked quickly from the fallen rustlers to the canyon where the others had disappeared he calculated on the time needed for running horses to return to the open if their riders heard shots he waited breathlessly but the estimated time dragged by and no riders appeared venters began presently to believe that the rifle reports had not penetrated into the recesses of the canyon and felt safe for the immediate present  he hurried to the spot where the first rustler had been dragged by his horse the man lay in deep grass dead jaw fallen eyes protrudinga sight that sickened venters the first man at whom he had ever aimed a weapon he had shot through the heart with the clammy sweat oozing from every pore venters dragged the rustler in among some boulders and covered him with slabs of rock then he smoothed out the crushed trail in grass and sage the rustlers horse had stopped a quarter of a mile off and was grazing  when venters rapidly strode toward the masked rider not even the cold nausea that gripped him could wholly banish curiosity for he had shot oldrings infamous lieutenant whose face had never been seen venters experienced a grim pride in the feat what would tull say to this achievement of the outcast who rode too often to deception pass  venterss curious eagerness and expectation had not prepared him for the shock he received when he stood over a slight dark figure the rustler wore the black mask that had given him his name but he had no weapons venters glanced at the drooping horse there were no gunsheaths on the saddle  a rustler who didnt pack guns muttered venters he wears no belt he couldnt pack guns in that rig strange  a low gasping intake of breath and a sudden twitching of body told venters the rider still lived  hes alive ive got to stand here and watch him die and i shot an unarmed man  shrinkingly venters removed the riders wide sombrero and the black cloth mask this action disclosed bright chestnut hair inclined to curl and a white youthful face along the lower line of cheek and jaw was a clear demarcation where the brown of tanned skin met the white that had been hidden from the sun  oh hes only a boy what can he be oldrings masked rider  the boy showed signs of returning consciousness he stirred his lips moved a small brown hand clenched in his blouse  venters knelt with a gathering horror of his deed his bullet had entered the riders right breast high up to the shoulder with hands that shook venters untied a black scarf and ripped open the bloodwet blouse  first he saw a gaping hole dark red against a whiteness of skin from which welled a slender red stream then the graceful beautiful swell of a womans breast  a woman he cried a girl ive killed a girl  she suddenly opened eyes that transfixed venters they were fathomless blue consciousness of death was there a blended terror and pain but no consciousness of sight she did not see venters she stared into the unknown  then came a spasm of vitality she writhed in a torture of reviving strength and in her convulsions she almost tore from ventners grasp slowly she relaxed and sank partly back the ungloved hand sought the wound and pressed so hard that her wrist half buried itself in her bosom blood trickled between her spread fingers and she looked at venters with eyes that saw him  he cursed himself and the unerring aim of which he had been so proud he had seen that look in the eyes of a crippled antelope which he was about to finish with his knife but in her it had infinitely morea revelation of mortal spirit the instinctive bringing to life was there and the divining helplessness and the terrible accusation of the stricken  forgive me i didnt know burst out venters  you shot meyouve killed me she whispered in panting gasps upon her lips appeared a fluttering bloody froth by that venters knew the air in her lungs was mixing with blood oh i knewit wouldcomesome day oh the burn hold meim sinkingits all dark ah god mercy  her rigidity loosened in one long quiver and she lay back limp still white as snow with closed eyes  venters thought then that she died but the faint pulsation of her breast assured him that life yet lingered death seemed only a matter of moments for the bullet had gone clear through her nevertheless he tore sageleaves from a bush and pressing them tightly over her wounds he bound the black scarf round her shoulder tying it securely under her arm then he closed the blouse hiding from his sight that bloodstained accusing breast  whatnow he questioned with flying mind i must get out of here shes dyingbut i cant leave her  he rapidly surveyed the sage to the north and made out no animate object then he picked up the girls sombrero and the mask this time the mask gave him as great a shock as when he first removed it from her face for in the woman he had forgotten the rustler and this black strip of feltcloth established the identity of oldrings masked rider venters had solved the mystery he slipped his rifle under her and lifting her carefully upon it he began to retrace his steps the dog trailed in his shadow and the horse that had stood drooping by followed without a call venters chose the deepest tufts of grass and clumps of sage on his return from time to time he glanced over his shoulder he did not rest his concern was to avoid jarring the girl and to hide his trail gaining the narrow canyon he turned and held close to the wall till he reached his hidingplace when he entered the dense thicket of oaks he was hard put to it to force a way through but he held his burden almost upright and by slipping side wise and bending the saplings he got in through sage and grass he hurried to the grove of silver spruces  he laid the girl down almost fearing to look at her though marble pale and cold she was living venters then appreciated the tax that long carry had been to his strength he sat down to rest whitie sniffed at the pale girl and whined and crept to venterss feet ring lapped the water in the runway of the spring  presently venters went out to the opening caught the horse and leading him through the thicket unsaddled him and tied him with a long halter wrangle left his browsing long enough to whinny and toss his head venters felt that he could not rest easily till he had secured the other rustlers horse so taking his rifle and calling for ring he set out swiftly yet watchfully he made his way through the canyon to the oval and out to the cattle trail what few tracks might have betrayed him he obliterated so only an expert tracker could have trailed him then with many a wary backward glance across the sage he started to round up the rustlers horse this was unexpectedly easy he led the horse to lower ground out of sight from the opposite side of the oval along the shadowy western wall and so on into his canyon and secluded camp  the girls eyes were open a feverish spot burned in her cheeks she moaned something unintelligible to venters but he took the movement of her lips to mean that she wanted water lifting her head he tipped the canteen to her lips after that she again lapsed into unconsciousness or a weakness which was its counterpart venters noted however that the burning flush had faded into the former pallor  the sun set behind the high canyon rim and a cool shade darkened the walls venters fed the dogs and put a halter on the dead rustlers horse he allowed wrangle to browse free this done he cut spruce boughs and made a leanto for the girl then gently lifting her upon a blanket he folded the sides over her the other blanket he wrapped about his shoulders and found a comfortable seat against a sprucetree that upheld the little shack ring and whitie lay near at hand one asleep the other watchful  venters dreaded the nights vigil at night his mind was active and this time he had to watch and think and feel beside a dying girl whom he had all but murdered a thousand excuses he invented for himself yet not one made any difference in his act or his selfreproach  it seemed to him that when night fell black he could see her white face so much more plainly  shell go presently he said and be out of agonythank god  every little while certainty of her death came to him with a shock and then he would bend over and lay his ear on her breast her heart still beat  the early night blackness cleared to the cold starlight the horses were not moving and no sound disturbed the deathly silence of the canyon  ill bury her here thought venters and let her grave be as much a mystery as her life was  for the girls few words the look of her eyes the prayer had strangely touched venters  she was only a girl he soliloquized what was she to oldring rustlers dont have wives nor sisters nor daughters she was badthats all but somehow well she may not have willingly become the companion of rustlers that prayer of hers to god for mercy life is strange and cruel i wonder if other members of oldrings gang are women likely enough but what was his game oldrings mask rider a name to make villagers hide and lock their doors a name credited with a dozen murders a hundred forays and a thousand stealings of cattle what part did the girl have in this it may have served oldring to create mystery  hours passed the white stars moved across the narrow strip of darkblue sky above the silence awoke to the low hum of insects venters watched the immovable white face and as he watched hour by hour waiting for death the infamy of her passed from his mind he thought only of the sadness the truth of the moment whoever she waswhatever she had doneshe was young and she was dying  the afterpart of the night wore on interminably the starlight failed and the gloom blackened to the darkest hour shell die at the gray of dawn muttered venters remembering some old womans fancy the blackness paled to gray and the gray lightened and day peeped over the eastern rim venters listened at the breast of the girl she still lived did he only imagine that her heart beat stronger ever so slightly but stronger he pressed his ear closer to her breast and he rose with his own pulse quickening  if she doesnt die soonshes got a chancethe barest chance to live he said  he wondered if the internal bleeding had ceased there was no more film of blood upon her lips but no corpse could have been whiter opening her blouse he untied the scarf and carefully picked away the sage leaves from the wound in her shoulder it had closed lifting her lightly he ascertained that the same was true of the hole where the bullet had come out he reflected on the fact that clean wounds closed quickly in the healing upland air he recalled instances of riders who had been cut and shot apparently to fatal issues yet the blood had clotted the wounds closed and they had recovered he had no way to tell if internal hemorrhage still went on but he believed that it had stopped otherwise she would surely not have lived so long he marked the entrance of the bullet and concluded that it had just touched the upper lobe of her lung perhaps the wound in the lung had also closed as he began to wash the blood stains from her breast and carefully rebandage the wound he was vaguely conscious of a strange grave happiness in the thought that she might live  broad daylight and a hint of sunshine high on the cliffrim to the west brought him to consideration of what he had better do and while busy with his few camp tasks he revolved the thing in his mind it would not be wise for him to remain long in his present hidingplace and if he intended to follow the cattle trail and try to find the rustlers he had better make a move at once for he knew that rustlers being riders would not make much of a days or nights absence from camp for one or two of their number but when the missing ones failed to show up in reasonable time there would be a search and venters was afraid of that  a good tracker could trail me he muttered and id be cornered here lets see rustlers are a lazy set when theyre not on the ride ill risk it then ill change my hidingplace  he carefully cleaned and reloaded his guns when he rose to go he bent a long glance down upon the unconscious girl then ordering whitie and ring to keep guard he left the camp  the safest cover lay close under the wall of the canyon and here through the dense thickets venters made his slow listening advance toward the oval upon gaining the wide opening he decided to cross it and follow the left wall till he came to the cattle trail he scanned the oval as keenly as if hunting for antelope then stooping he stole from one cover to another taking advantage of rocks and bunches of sage until he had reached the thickets under the opposite wall once there he exercised extreme caution in his surveys of the ground ahead but increased his speed when moving dodging from bush to bush he passed the mouths of two canyons and in the entrance of a third canyon he crossed a wash of swift clear water to come abruptly upon the cattle trail  it followed the low bank of the wash and keeping it in sight venters hugged the line of sage and thicket like the curves of a serpent the canyon wound for a mile or more and then opened into a valley patches of red showed clear against the purple of sage and farther out on the level dotted strings of red led away to the wall of rock  ha the red herd exclaimed venters  then dots of white and black told him there were cattle of other colors in this inclosed valley oldring the rustler was also a rancher venterss calculating eye took count of stock that outnumbered the red herd  what a range went on venters water and grass enough for fifty thousand head and no riders needed  after his first burst of surprise and rapid calculation venters lost no time there but slunk again into the sage on his back trail with the discovery of oldrings hidden cattlerange had come enlightenment on several problems here the rustler kept his stock here was jane withersteens red herd here were the few cattle that had disappeared from the cottonwoods slopes during the last two years until oldring had driven the red herd his thefts of cattle for that time had not been more than enough to supply meat for his men of late no drives had been reported from sterling or the villages north and venters knew that the riders had wondered at oldrings inactivity in that particular field he and his band had been active enough in their visits to glaze and cottonwoods they always had gold but of late the amount gambled away and drunk and thrown away in the villages had given rise to much conjecture oldrings more frequent visits had resulted in new saloons and where there had formerly been one raid or shooting fray in the little hamlets there were now many perhaps oldring had another range farther on up the pass and from there drove the cattle to distant utah towns where he was little known but venters came finally to doubt this and from what he had learned in the last few days a belief began to form in venterss mind that oldrings intimidations of the villages and the mystery of the masked rider with his alleged evil deeds and the fierce resistance offered any trailing riders and the rustling of cattlethese things were only the craft of the rustlerchief to conceal his real life and purpose and work in deception pass  and like a scouting indian venters crawled through the sage of the oval valley crossed trail after trail on the north side and at last entered the canyon out of which headed the cattle trail and into which he had watched the rustlers disappear  if he had used caution before now he strained every nerve to force himself to creeping stealth and to sensitiveness of ear he crawled along so hidden that he could not use his eyes except to aid himself in the toilsome progress through the brakes and ruins of cliffwall yet from time to time as he rested he saw the massive red walls growing higher and wilder more looming and broken he made note of the fact that he was turning and climbing the sage and thickets of oak and brakes of alder gave place to pinyon pine growing out of rocky soil suddenly a low dull murmur assailed his ears at first he thought it was thunder then the slipping of a weathered slope of rock but it was incessant and as he progressed it filled out deeper and from a murmur changed into a soft roar  falling water he said theres volume to that i wonder if its the stream i lost  the roar bothered him for he could hear nothing else likewise however no rustlers could hear him emboldened by this and sure that nothing but a bird could see him he arose from his hands and knees to hurry on an opening in the pinyons warned him that he was nearing the height of slope  he gained it and dropped low with a burst of astonishment before him stretched a short canyon with rounded stone floor bare of grass or sage or tree and with curved shelving walls a broad rippling stream flowed toward him and at the back of the canyon waterfall burst from a wide rent in the cliff and bounding down in two green steps spread into a long white sheet  if venters had not been indubitably certain that he had entered the right canyon his astonishment would not have been so great there had been no breaks in the walls no side canyons entering this one where the rustlers tracks and the cattle trail had guided him and therefore he could not be wrong but here the canyon ended and presumably the trails also  that cattle trail headed out of here venters kept saying to himself it headed out now what i want to know is how on earth did cattle ever get in here  if he could be sure of anything it was of the careful scrutiny he had given that cattle track every hoofmark of which headed straight west he was now looking east at an immense round boxed corner of canyon down which tumbled a thin white veil of water scarcely twenty yards wide somehow somewhere his calculations had gone wrong for the first time in years he found himself doubting his riders skill in finding tracks and his memory of what he had actually seen in his anxiety to keep under cover he must have lost himself in this offshoot of deception pass and thereby in some unaccountable manner missed the canyon with the trails there was nothing else for him to think rustlers could not fly nor cattle jump down thousandfoot precipices he was only proving what the sageriders had long said of this labyrinthine system of deceitful canyons and valleystrails led down into deception pass but no rider had ever followed them  on a sudden he heard above the soft roar of the waterfall an unusual sound that he could not define he dropped flat behind a stone and listened from the direction he had come swelled something that resembled a strange muffled pounding and splashing and ringing despite his nerve the chill sweat began to dampen his forehead what might not be possible in this stonewalled maze of mystery the unnatural sound passed beyond him as he lay gripping his rifle and fighting for coolness then from the open came the sound now distinct and different venters recognized a hobblebell of a horse and the cracking of iron on submerged stones and the hollow splash of hoofs in water  relief surged over him his mind caught again at realities and curiosity prompted him to peep from behind the rock  in the middle of the stream waded a long string of packed burros driven by three superbly mounted men had venters met these darkclothed darkvisaged heavily armed men anywhere in utah let alone in this robbers retreat he would have recognized them as rustlers the discerning eye of a rider saw the signs of a long arduous trip these men were packing in supplies from one of the northern villages they were tired and their horses were almost played out and the burros plodded on after the manner of their kind when exhausted faithful and patient but as if every weary splashing slipping step would be their last  all this venters noted in one glance after that he watched with a thrilling eagerness straight at the waterfall the rustlers drove the burros and straight through the middle where the water spread into a fleecy thin film like dissolving smoke following closely the rustlers rode into this white mist showing in bold black relief for an instant and then they vanished  venters drew a full breath that rushed out in brief and sudden utterance  good heaven of all the holes for a rustler theres a cavern under that waterfall and a passageway leading out to a canyon beyond oldring hides in there he needs only to guard a trail leading down from the sageflat above little danger of this outlet to the pass being discovered i stumbled on it by luck after i had given up and now i know the truth of what puzzled me mostwhy that cattle trail was wet  he wheeled and ran down the slope and out to the level of the sagebrush returning he had no time to spare only now and then between dashes a moment when he stopped to cast sharp eyes ahead the abundant grass left no trace of his trail short work he made of the distance to the circle of canyons he doubted that he would ever see it again he knew he never wanted to yet he looked at the red corners and towers with the eyes of a rider picturing landmarks never to be forgotten  here he spent a panting moment in a slowcircling gaze of the sageoval and the gaps between the bluffs nothing stirred except the gentle wave of the tips of the brush then he pressed on past the mouths of several canyons and over ground new to him now close under the eastern wall this latter part proved to be easy traveling well screened from possible observation from the north and west and he soon covered it and felt safer in the deepening shade of his own canyon then the huge notched bulge of red rim loomed over him a mark by which he knew again the deep cove where his camp lay hidden as he penetrated the thicket safe again for the present his thoughts reverted to the girl he had left there the afternoon had far advanced how would he find her he ran into camp frightening the dogs  the girl lay with wideopen dark eyes and they dilated when he knelt beside her the flush of fever shone in her cheeks he lifted her and held water to her dry lips and felt an inexplicable sense of lightness as he saw her swallow in a slow choking gulp gently he laid her back  whoareyou she whispered haltingly  im the man who shot you he replied  youllnotkill menow  no no  whatwillyoudowith me  when you get betterstrong enoughill take you back to the canyon where the rustlers ride through the waterfall  as with a faint shadow from a flitting wing overhead the marble whiteness of her face seemed to change  donttakemebackthere    chapter vi the millwheel of steers  meantime at the ranch when judkinss news had sent venters on the trail of the rustlers jane withersteen led the injured man to her house and with skilled fingers dressed the gunshot wound in his arm  judkins what do you think happened to my riders  ii d rather not say he replied  tell me whatever youll tell me ill keep to myself im beginning to worry about more than the loss of a herd of cattle venters hinted ofbut tell me judkins  well miss withersteen i think as venters thinksyour riders have been called in  judkins by whom  you know who handles the reins of your mormon riders  do you dare insinuate that my churchmen have ordered in my riders  i aint insinuatin nothin miss withersteen answered judkins with spirit i know what im talking about i didnt want to tell you  oh i cant believe that ill not believe it would tull leave my herds at the mercy of rustlers and wolves just becausebecause no no its unbelievable  yes thet particular things onheard of around cottonwoods but beggin pardon miss withersteen there never was any other rich mormon woman here on the border let alone one thets taken the bit between her teeth  that was a bold thing for the reserved judkins to say but it did not anger her this riders crude hint of her spirit gave her a glimpse of what others might think humility and obedience had been hers always but had she taken the bit between her teeth still she wavered and then with quick spurt of warm blood along her veins she thought of black star when he got the bit fast between his iron jaws and ran wild in the sage if she ever started to run jane smothered the glow and burn within her ashamed of a passion for freedom that opposed her duty  judkins go to the village she said and when you have learned anything definite about my riders please come to me at once  when he had gone jane resolutely applied her mind to a number of tasks that of late had been neglected her father had trained her in the management of a hundred employees and the working of gardens and fields and to keep record of the movements of cattle and riders and beside the many duties she had added to this work was one of extreme delicacy such as required all her tact and ingenuity it was an unobtrusive almost secret aid which she rendered to the gentile families of the village though jane withersteen never admitted so to herself it amounted to no less than a system of charity but for her invention of numberless kinds of employment for which there was no actual need these families of gentiles who had failed in a mormon community would have starved  in aiding these poor people jane thought she deceived her keen churchmen but it was a kind of deceit for which she did not pray to be forgiven equally as difficult was the task of deceiving the gentiles for they were as proud as they were poor it had been a great grief to her to discover how these people hated her people and it had been a source of great joy that through her they had come to soften in hatred at any time this work called for a clearness of mind that precluded anxiety and worry but under the present circumstances it required all her vigor and obstinate tenacity to pin her attention upon her task  sunset came bringing with the end of her labor a patient calmness and power to wait that had not been hers earlier in the day she expected judkins but he did not appear her house was always quiet tonight however it seemed unusually so at supper her women served her with a silent assiduity it spoke what their sealed lips could not utterthe sympathy of mormon women jerd came to her with the key of the great door of the stone stable and to make his daily report about the horses one of his daily duties was to give black star and night and the other racers a tenmile run this day it had been omitted and the boy grew confused in explanations that she had not asked for she did inquire if he would return on the morrow and jerd in mingled surprise and relief assured her he would always work for her jane missed the rattle and trot canter and gallop of the incoming riders on the hard trails dusk shaded the grove where she walked the birds ceased singing the wind sighed through the leaves of the cottonwoods and the running water murmured down its stonebedded channel the glimmering of the first star was like the peace and beauty of the night her faith welled up in her heart and said that all would soon be right in her little world she pictured venters about his lonely campfire sitting between his faithful dogs she prayed for his safety for the success of his undertaking  early the next morning one of janes women brought in word that judkins wished to speak to her she hurried out and in her surprise to see him armed with rifle and revolver she forgot her intention to inquire about his wound  judkins those guns you never carried guns  its high time miss withersteen he replied will you come into the grove it aint jest exactly safe for me to be seen here  she walked with him into the shade of the cottonwoods  what do you mean  miss withersteen i went to my mothers house last night while there some one knocked an a man asked for me i went to the door he wore a mask he said id better not ride any more for jane withersteen his voice was hoarse an strange disguised i reckon like his face he said no more an ran off in the dark  did you know who he was asked jane in a low voice  yes  jane did not ask to know she did not want to know she feared to know all her calmness fled at a single thought  thets why im packin guns went on judkins for ill never quit ridin for you miss withersteen till you let me go  judkins do you want to leave me  do i look thet way give me a hossa fast hoss an send me out on the sage  oh thank you judkins youre more faithful than my own people i ought not accept your loyaltyyou might suffer more through it but what in the world can i do my head whirls the wrong to ventersthe stolen herdthese masks threats this coil in the dark i cant understand but i feel something dark and terrible closing in around me  miss withersteen its all simple enough said judkins earnestly now please listenan beggin your pardonjest

set look thet makes them strange an different to me but i could tell the difference between thet first natural twinge of conscience an the later look of some secret thing an the difference i caught was thet they couldnt help themselves they hadnt no say in the matter they looked as if their bein unfaithful to you was bein faithful to a higher duty an theres the secret why its as plain asas sight of my gun here  plain my herds to wander in the sageto be stolen jane withersteen a poor woman her head to be brought low and her spirit broken why judkins its plain enough  miss withersteen let me get what boys i can gather an hold the white herd its on the slope now not ten miles outthree thousand head an all steers theyre wild an likely to stampede at the pop of a jackrabbits ears well camp right with them en try to hold them  judkins ill reward you some day for your service unless all is taken from me get the boys and tell jerd to give you pick of my horses except black star and night butdo not shed blood for my cattle nor heedlessly risk your lives  jane withersteen rushed to the silence and seclusion of her room and there could not longer hold back the bursting of her wrath she went stoneblind in the fury of a passion that had never before showed its power lying upon her bed sightless voiceless she was a writhing living flame and she tossed there while her fury burned and burned and finally burned itself out  then weak and spent she lay thinking not of the oppression that would break her but of this new revelation of self until the last few days there had been little in her life to rouse passions her forefathers had been vikings savage chieftains who bore no cross and brooked no hindrance to their will her father had inherited that temper and at times like antelope fleeing before fire on the slope his people fled from his red rages jane withersteen realized that the spirit of wrath and war had lain dormant in her she shrank from black depths hitherto unsuspected the one thing in man or woman that she scorned above all scorn and which she could not forgive was hate hate headed a flaming pathway straight to hell all in a flash beyond her control there had been in her a birth of fiery hate and the man who had dragged her peaceful and loving spirit to this degradation was a minister of gods word an elder of her church the counselor of her beloved bishop  the loss of herds and ranges even of amber spring and the old stone house no longer concerned jane withersteen she faced the foremost thought of her life what she now considered the mightiest problemthe salvation of her soul  she knelt by her bedside and prayed she prayed as she had never prayed in all her lifeprayed to be forgiven for her sin to be immune from that dark hot hate to love tull as her minister though she could not love him as a man to do her duty by her church and people and those dependent upon her bounty to hold reverence of god and womanhood inviolate  when jane withersteen rose from that storm of wrath and prayer for help she was serene calm surea changed woman she would do her duty as she saw it live her life as her own truth guided her she might never be able to marry a man of her choice but she certainly never would become the wife of tull her churchmen might take her cattle and horses ranges and fields her corrals and stables the house of withersteen and the water that nourished the village of cottonwoods but they could not force her to marry tull they could not change her decision or break her spirit once resigned to further loss and sure of herself jane withersteen attained a peace of mind that had not been hers for a year she forgave tull and felt a melancholy regret over what she knew he considered duty irrespective of his personal feeling for her first of all tull as he was a man wanted her for himself and secondly he hoped to save her and her riches for his church she did not believe that tull had been actuated solely by his ministers zeal to save her soul she doubted her interpretation of one of his dark sayingsthat if she were lost to him she might as well be lost to heaven jane withersteens common sense took arms against the binding limits of her religion and she doubted that her bishop whom she had been taught had direct communication with godwould damn her soul for refusing to marry a mormon as for tull and his churchmen when they had harassed her perhaps made her poor they would find her unchangeable and then she would get back most of what she had lost so she reasoned true at last to her faith in all men and in their ultimate goodness  the clank of iron hoofs upon the stone courtyard drew her hurriedly from her retirement there beside his horse stood lassiter his dark apparel and the great black gunsheaths contrasting singularly with his gentle smile janes active mind took up her interest in him and her halfdetermined desire to use what charm she had to foil his evident design in visiting cottonwoods if she could mitigate his hatred of mormons or at least keep him from killing more of them not only would she be saving her people but also be leading back this bloodspiller to some semblance of the human  mornin maam he said black sombrero in hand  lassiter im not an old woman or even a madam she replied with her bright smile if you cant say miss withersteencall me jane  i reckon jane would be easier first names are always handy for me  well use mine then lassiter im glad to see you im in trouble  then she told him of judkinss return of the driving of the red herd of venterss departure on wrangle and the callingin of her riders  pears to me youre some smilin an pretty for a woman with so much trouble he remarked  lassiter are you paying me compliments but seriously ive made up my mind not to be miserable ive lost much and ill lose more nevertheless i wont be sour and i hope ill never be unhappyagain  lassiter twisted his hat round and round as was his way and took his time in replying  women are strange to me i got to backtrailin myself from them long ago but id like a game woman might i ask seein as how you take this trouble if youre goin to fight  fight how even if i would i havent a friend except that boy who doesnt dare stay in the village  i make bold to say maamjanethat theres another if you want him  lassiter thank you but how can i accept you as a friend think why youd ride down into the village with those terrible guns and kill my enemieswho are also my churchmen  i reckon i might be riled up to jest about that he replied dryly  she held out both hands to him  lassiter ill accept your friendshipbe proud of itreturn itif i may keep you from killing another mormon  ill tell you one thing he said bluntly as the gray lightning formed in his eyes youre too good a woman to be sacrificed as youre goin to be no i reckon you an me cant be friends on such terms  in her earnestness she stepped closer to him repelled yet fascinated by the sudden transition of his moods that he would fight for her was at once horrible and wonderful  you came here to kill a manthe man whom milly erne  the man who dragged milly erne to hellput it that way jane withersteen yes thats why i came here id tell so much to no other livin soul therere things such a woman as youd never dream ofso dont mention her again not till you tell me the name of the man  tell you i never  i reckon you will an ill never ask you im a man of strange beliefs an ways of thinkin an i seem to see into the future an feel things hard to explain the trail ive been followin for so many years was twisted en tangled but its straightenin out now an jane withersteen you crossed it long ago to ease poor millys agony that whether you want or not makes lassiter your friend but you cross it now strangely to mean somethin to megod knows whatunless by your noble blindness to incite me to greater hatred of mormon men  jane felt swayed by a strength that far exceeded her own in a clash of wills with this man she would go to the wall if she were to influence him it must be wholly through womanly allurement there was that about lassiter which commanded her respect she had abhorred his name face to face with him she found she feared only his deeds his mystic suggestion his foreshadowing of something that she was to mean to him pierced deep into her mind she believed fate had thrown in her way the lover or husband of milly erne she believed that through her an evil man might be reclaimed his allusion to what he called her blindness terrified her such a mistaken idea of his might unleash the bitter fatal mood she sensed in him at any cost she must placate this man she knew the die was cast and that if lassiter did not soften to a womans grace and beauty and wiles then it would be because she could not make him  i reckon youll hear no more such talk from me lassiter went on presently now miss jane i rode in to tell you that your herd of white steers is down on the slope behind them big ridges an i seen somethin goin on thatd be mighty interestin to you if you could see it have you a fieldglass  yes i have two glasses ill get them and ride out with you wait lassiter please she said and hurried within sending word to jerd to saddle black star and fetch him to the court she then went to her room and changed to the ridingclothes she always donned when going into the sage in this male attire her mirror showed her a jaunty handsome rider if she expected some little need of admiration from lassiter she had no cause for disappointment the gentle smile that she liked which made of him another person slowly overspread his face  if i didnt take you for a boy he exclaimed its powerful queer what difference clothes make now ive been some scared of your dignity like when the other night you was all in white but in this rig  black star came pounding into the court dragging jerd half off his feet and he whistled at lassiters black but at sight of jane all his defiant lines seemed to soften and with tosses of his beautiful head he whipped his bridle  down black star down said jane  he dropped his head and slowly lengthening he bent one foreleg then the other and sank to his knees jane slipped her left foot in the stirrup swung lightly into the saddle and black star rose with a ringing stamp it was not easy for jane to hold him to a canter through the grove and like the wind he broke when he saw the sage jane let him have a couple of miles of free running on the open trail and then she coaxed him in and waited for her companion lassiter was not long in catching up and presently they were riding side by side it reminded her how she used to ride with venters where was he now she gazed far down the slope to the curved purple lines of deception pass and involuntarily shut her eyes with a trembling stir of nameless fear  well turn off here lassiter said en take to the sage a mile or so the white herd is behind them big ridges  what are you going to show me asked jane im prepareddont be afraid  he smiled as if he meant that bad news came swiftly enough without being presaged by speech  when they reached the lee of a rolling ridge lassiter dismounted motioning to her to do likewise they left the horses standing bridles down then lassiter carrying the fieldglasses began to lead the way up the slow rise of ground upon nearing the summit he halted her with a gesture  i reckon wed see more if we didnt show ourselves against the sky he said i was here less than an hour ago then the herd was seven or eight miles south an if they aint bolted yet  lassiter bolted  thats what i said now lets see  jane climbed a few more paces behind him and then peeped over the ridge just beyond began a shallow swale that deepened and widened into a valley and then swung to the left following the undulating sweep of sage jane saw the straggling lines and then the great body of the white herd she knew enough about steers even at a distance of four or five miles to realize that something was in the wind bringing her fieldglass into use she moved it slowly from left to right which action swept the whole herd into range the stragglers were restless the more compactly massed steers were browsing jane brought the glass back to the big sentinels of the herd and she saw them trot with quick steps stop short and toss wide horns look everywhere and then trot in another direction  judkins hasnt been able to get his boys together yet said jane but hell be there soon i hope not too late lassiter whats frightening those big leaders  nothin jest on the minute replied lassiter them steers are quietin down theyve been scared but not bad yet i reckon the whole herd has moved a few miles this way since i was here  they didnt browse that distancenot in less than an hour cattle arent sheep  no they jest run it en that looks bad  lassiter what frightened them repeated jane impatiently  put down your glass youll see at first better with a naked eye now look along them ridges on the other side of the herd the ridges where the sun shines bright on the sage thats right now look en look hard en wait  longdrawn moments of straining sight rewarded jane with nothing save the low purple rim of ridge and the shimmering sage  its begun again whispered lassiter and he gripped her arm watch there did you see that  no no tell me what to look for  a white flasha kind of pinpoint of quick lighta gleam as from sun shinin on somethin white  suddenly janes concentrated gaze caught a fleeting glint quickly she brought her glass to bear on the spot again the purple sage magnified in color and size and wave for long moments irritated her with its monotony then from out of the sage on the ridge flew up a broad white object flashed in the sunlight and vanished like magic it was and bewildered jane  what on earth is that  i reckon theres some one behind that ridge throwin up a sheet or a white blanket to reflect the sunshine  why queried jane more bewildered than ever  to stampede the herd replied lassiter and his teeth clicked  ah she made a fierce passionate movement clutched the glass tightly shook as with the passing of a spasm and then dropped her head presently she raised it to greet lassiter with something like a smile my righteous brethren are at work again she said in scorn she had stifled the leap of her wrath but for perhaps the first time in her life a bitter derision curled her lips lassiters cool gray eyes seemed to pierce her i said i was prepared for anything but that was hardly true but why would theyanybody stampede my cattle  thats a mormons godly way of bringin a woman to her knees  lassiter ill die before i ever bend my knees i might be led i wont be driven do you expect the herd to bolt  i dont like the looks of them big steers but you can never tell cattle sometimes stampede as easily as buffalo any little flash or move will start them a rider gettin down an walkin toward them sometimes will make them jump an fly then again nothin seems to scare them but i reckon that white flare will do the biz its a new one on me an ive seen some ridin an rustlin it jest takes one of them godfearin mormons to think of devilish tricks  lassiter might not this trick be done by oldrings men asked jane ever grasping at straws  it might be but it aint replied lassiter oldrings an honest thief he dont skulk behind ridges to scatter your cattle to the four winds he rides down on you an if you dont like it you can throw a gun  jane bit her tongue to refrain from championing men who at the very moment were proving to her that they were little and mean compared even with rustlers  look jane them leadin steers have bolted theyre drawin the stragglers an thatll pull the whole herd  jane was not quick enough to catch the details called out by lassiter but she saw the line of cattle lengthening then like a stream of white bees pouring from a huge swarm the steers stretched out from the main body in a few moments with astonishing rapidity the whole herd got into motion a faint roar of trampling hoofs came to janes ears and gradually swelled low rolling clouds of dust began to rise above the sage  its a stampede an a hummer said lassiter  oh lassiter the herds running with the valley it leads into the canyon theres a straight jumpoff  i reckon theyll run into it too but thats a good many miles yet an jane this valley swings round almost north before it goes east that stampede will pass within a mile of us  the long white bobbing line of steers streaked swiftly through the sage and a funnelshaped dustcloud arose at a low angle a dull rumbling filled janes ears  im thinkin of millin that herd said lassiter his gray glance swept up the slope to the west theres some specks an dust way off toward the village mebbe thats judkins an his boys it aint likely hell get here in time to help youd better hold black star here on this high ridge  he ran to his horse and throwing off saddlebags and tightening the cinches he leaped astride and galloped straight down across the valley  jane went for black star and leading him to the summit of the ridge she mounted and faced the valley with excitement and expectancy she had heard of milling stampeded cattle and knew it was a feat accomplished by only the most daring riders  the white herd was now strung out in a line two miles long the dull rumble of thousands of hoofs deepened into continuous low thunder and as the steers swept swiftly closer the thunder became a heavy roll lassiter crossed in a few moments the level of the valley to the eastern rise of ground and there waited the coming of the herd presently as the head of the white line reached a point opposite to where jane stood lassiter spurred his black into a run  jane saw him take a position on the off side of the leaders of the stampede and there he rode it was like a race they swept on down the valley and when the end of the white line neared lassiters first stand the head had begun to swing round to the west it swung slowly and stubbornly yet surely and gradually assumed a long beautiful curve of moving white to janes amaze she saw the leaders swinging turning till they headed back toward her and up the valley out to the right of these wild plunging steers ran lassiters black and janes keen eye appreciated the fleet stride and surefootedness of the blind horse then it seemed that the herd moved in a great curve a huge halfmoon with the points of head and tail almost opposite and a mile apart but lassiter relentlessly crowded the leaders sheering them to the left turning them little by little and the dustblinded wild followers plunged on madly in the tracks of their leaders this evermoving everchanging curve of steers rolled toward jane and when below her scarce half a mile it began to narrow and close into a circle lassiter had ridden parallel with her position turned toward her then aside and now he was riding directly away from her all the time pushing the head of that bobbing line inward  it was then that jane suddenly understanding lassiters feat stared and gasped at the riding of this intrepid man his horse was fleet and tireless but blind he had pushed the leaders around and around till they were about to turn in on the inner side of the end of that line of steers the leaders were already running in a circle the end of the herd was still running almost straight but soon they would be wheeling then when lassiter had the circle formed how would he escape with jane withersteen prayer was as ready as praise and she prayed for this mans safety a circle of dust began to collect dimly as through a yellow veil jane saw lassiter press the leaders inward to close the gap in the sage she lost sight of him in the dust again she thought she saw the black riderless now rear and drag himself and fall lassiter had been thrownlost then he reappeared running out of the dust into the sage he had escaped and she breathed again  spellbound jane withersteen watched this stupendous millwheel of steers here was the milling of the herd the white running circle closed in upon the open space of sage and the dust circles closed above into a pall the ground quaked and the incessant thunder of pounding hoofs rolled on jane felt deafened yet she thrilled to a new sound as the circle of sage lessened the steers began to bawl and when it closed entirely there came a great upheaval in the center and a terrible thumping of heads and clicking of horns bawling climbing goring the great mass of steers on the inside wrestled in a crashing din heaved and groaned under the pressure then came a deadlock the inner strife ceased and the hideous roar and crash movement went on in the outer circle and that too gradually stilled the white herd had come to a stop and the pall of yellow dust began to drift away on the wind  jane withersteen waited on the ridge with full and grateful heart lassiter appeared making his weary way toward her through the sage and up on the slope judkins rode into sight with his troop of boys for the present at least the white herd would be looked after  when lassiter reached her and laid his hand on black stars mane jane could not find speech  killedmyhoss he panted  oh im sorry cried jane lassiter i know you cant replace him but ill give you any one of my racersbells or night even black star  ill take a fast hoss jane but not one of your favorites he replied onlywill you let me have black star now an ride him over there an head off them fellers who stampeded the herd  he pointed to several moving specks of black and puffs of dust in the purple sage  i can head them off with this hoss an then  then lassiter  theyll never stampede no more cattle  oh no no lassiter i wont let you go  but a flush of fire flamed in her cheeks and her trembling hands shook black stars bridle and her eyes fell before lassiters    chapter vii the daughter of withersteen  lassiter will you be my rider jane had asked him  i reckon so he had replied  few as the words were jane knew how infinitely much they implied she wanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges and save them if that were possible yet though she could not have spoken aloud all she meant she was perfectly honest with herself whatever the price to be paid she must keep lassiter close to her she must shield from him the man who had led milly erne to cottonwoods in her fear she so controlled her mind that she did not whisper this mormons name to her own soul she did not even think it besides beyond this thing she regarded as a sacred obligation thrust upon her was the need of a helper of a friend of a champion in this critical time if she could rule this gunman as venters had called him if she could even keep him from shedding blood what strategy to play his flame and his presence against the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her never would she forget the effect on tull and his men when venters shouted lassiters name if she could not wholly control lassiter then what she could do might put off the fatal day  one of her safe racers was a dark bay and she called him bells because of the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones when jerd led out this slender beautifully built horse lassiter suddenly became all eyes a riders love of a thoroughbred shone in them round and round bells he walked plainly weakening all the time in his determination not to take one of janes favorite racers  lassiter youre half horse and bells sees it already said jane laughing look at his eyes he likes you hell love you too how can you resist him oh lassiter but bells can run its nip and tuck between him and wrangle and only black star can beat him hes too spirited a horse for a woman take him hes yours  i jest am weak where a hosss concerned said lassiter ill take him an ill take your orders maam  well im glad but never mind the maam let it still be jane  from that hour it seemed lassiter was always in the saddle riding early and late and coincident with his part in janes affairs the days assumed their old tranquillity her intelligence told her this was only the lull before the storm but her faith would not have it so  she resumed her visits to the village and upon one of these she encountered tull he greeted her as he had before any trouble came between them and she responsive to peace if not quick to forget met him halfway with manner almost cheerful he regretted the loss of her cattle he assured her that the vigilantes which had been organized would soon rout the rustlers when that had been accomplished her riders would likely return to her  youve done a headstrong thing to hire this man lassiter tull went on severely he came to cottonwoods with evil intent  i had to have somebody and perhaps making him my rider may turn out best in the end for the mormons of cottonwoods  you mean to stay his hand  i doif i can  a woman like you can do anything with a man that would be well and would atone in some measure for the errors you have made  he bowed and passed on jane resumed her walk with conflicting thoughts she resented elder tulls cold impassive manner that looked down upon her as one who had incurred his just displeasure otherwise he would have been the same calm darkbrowed impenetrable man she had known for ten years in fact except when he had revealed his passion in the matter of the seizing of venters she had never dreamed he could be other than the grave reproving preacher he stood out now a strange secretive man she would have thought better of him if he had picked up the threads of their quarrel where they had parted was tull what he appeared to be the question flung itself involuntarily over jane withersteens inhibitive habit of faith without question and she refused to answer it tull could not fight in the open venters had said lassiter had said that her elder shirked fight and worked in the dark just now in this meeting tull had ignored the fact that he had sued exhorted demanded that she marry him he made no mention of venters his manner was that of the minister who had been outraged but who overlooked the frailties of a woman beyond question he seemed unutterably aloof from all knowledge of pressure being brought to bear upon her absolutely guiltless of any connection with secret power over riders with night journeys with rustlers and stampedes of cattle and that convinced her again of unjust suspicions but it was convincement through an obstinate faith she shuddered as she accepted it and that shudder was the nucleus of a terrible revolt  jane turned into one of the wide lanes leading from the main street and entered a huge shady yard here were sweetsmelling clover alfalfa flowers and vegetables all growing in happy confusion and like these fresh green things were the dozens of babies tots toddlers noisy urchins laughing girls a whole multitude of children of one family for collier brandt the father of all this numerous progeny was a mormon with four wives  the big house where they lived was old solid picturesque the lower part built of logs the upper of rough clapboards with vines growing up the outside stone chimneys there were many woodenshuttered windows and one pretentious window of glass proudly curtained in white as this house had four mistresses it likewise had four separate sections not one of which communicated with another and all had to be entered from the outside  in the shade of a wide low vineroofed porch jane found brandts wives entertaining bishop dyer they were motherly women of comparatively similar ages and plainfeatured and just at this moment anything but grave the bishop was rather tall of stout build with irongray hair and beard and eyes of light blue they were merry now but jane had seen them when they were not and then she feared him as she had feared her father  the women flocked around her in welcome  daughter of withersteen said the bishop gaily as he took her hand you have not been prodigal of your gracious self of late a sabbath without you at service i shall reprove elder tull  bishop the guilt is mine ill come to you and confess jane replied lightly but she felt the undercurrent of her words  mormon lovemaking exclaimed the bishop rubbing his hands tull keeps you all to himself  no he is not courting me  what the laggard if he does not make haste ill go acourting myself up to withersteen house  there was laughter and further bantering by the bishop and then mild talk of village affairs after which he took his leave and jane was left with her friend mary brandt  jane youre not yourself are you sad about the rustling of the cattle but you have so many you are so rich  then jane confided in her telling much yet holding back her doubts of fear  oh why dont you marry tull and be one of us  but mary i dont love tull said jane stubbornly  i dont blame you for that but jane withersteen youve got to choose between the love of man and love of god often we mormon women have to do that its not easy the kind of happiness you want i wanted once i never got it nor will you unless you throw away your soul weve all watched your affair with venters in fear and trembling some dreadful thing will come of it you dont want him hanged or shotor treated worse as that gentile boy was treated in glaze for fooling round a mormon woman marry tull its your duty as a mormon youll feel no rapture as his wifebut think of heaven mormon women dont marry for what they expect on earth take up the cross jane remember your father found amber spring built these old houses brought mormons here and fathered them you are the daughter of withersteen  jane left mary brandt and went to call upon other friends they received her with the same glad welcome as had mary lavished upon her the pentup affection of mormon women and let her go with her ears ringing of tull venters lassiter of duty to god and glory in heaven  verily murmured jane i dont know myself when through all this i remain unchangednay more fixed of purpose  she returned to the main street and bent her thoughtful steps toward the center of the village a string of wagons drawn by oxen was lumbering along these sagefreighters as they were called hauled grain and flour and merchandise from sterling and jane laughed suddenly in the midst of her humility at the thought that they were her property as was one of the three stores for which they freighted goods the water that flowed along the path at her feet and turned into each cottageyard to nourish garden and orchard also was hers no less her private property because she chose to give it free yet in this village of cottonwoods which her father had founded and which she maintained she was not her own mistress she was not able to abide by her own choice of a husband she was the daughter of withersteen suppose she proved it imperiously but she quelled that proud temptation at its birth  nothing could have replaced the affection which the village people had for her no power could have made her happy as the pleasure her presence gave as she went on down the street past the stores with their rude platform entrances and the saloons where tired horses stood with bridles dragging she was again assured of what was the bread and wine of life to herthat she was loved dirty boys playing in the ditch clerks teamsters riders loungers on the corners ranchers on dusty horses little girls running errands and women hurrying to the stores all looked up at her coming with glad eyes  janes various calls and wandering steps at length led her to the gentile quarter of the village this was at the extreme southern end and here some thirty gentile families lived in huts and shacks and logcabins and several dilapidated cottages the fortunes of these inhabitants of cottonwoods could be read in their abodes water they had in abundance and therefore grass and fruittrees and patches of alfalfa and vegetable gardens some of the men and boys had a few stray cattle others obtained such intermittent employment as the mormons reluctantly tendered them but none of the families was prosperous many were very poor and some lived only by jane withersteens beneficence  as it made jane happy to go among her own people so it saddened her to come in contact with these gentiles yet that was not because she was unwelcome here she was gratefully received by the women passionately by the children but poverty and idleness with their attendant wretchedness and sorrow always hurt her that she could alleviate this distress more now than ever before proved the adage that it was an ill wind that blew nobody good while her mormon riders were in her employ she had found few gentiles who would stay with her and now she was able to find employment for all the men and boys no little shock was it to have man after man tell her that he dare not accept her kind offer  it wont do said one carson an intelligent man who had seen better days weve had our warning plain and to the point now theres judkins he packs guns and he can use them and so can the daredevil boys hes hired but theyve little responsibility can we risk having our homes burned in our absence  jane felt the stretching and chilling of the skin of her face as the blood left it  carson you and the others rent these houses she asked  you ought to know miss withersteen some of them are yours  i know carson i never in my life took a days labor for rent or a yearling calf or a bunch of grass let alone gold  bivens your storekeeper sees to that  look here carson went on jane hurriedly and now her cheeks were burning you and black and willet pack your goods and move your families up to my cabins in the grove theyre far more comfortable than these then go to work for me and if aught happens to you there ill give you moneygold enough to leave utah  the man choked and stammered and then as tears welled into his eyes he found the use of his tongue and cursed no gentle speech could ever have equaled that curse in eloquent expression of what he felt for jane withersteen how strangely his look and tone reminded her of lassiter  no it wont do he said when he had somewhat recovered himself miss withersteen there are things that you dont know and theres not a soul among us who can tell you  i seem to be learning many things carson well then will you let me aid yousay till better times  yes i will he replied with his face lighting up i see what it means to you and you know what it means to me thank you and if better times ever come ill be only too happy to work for you  better times will come i trust god and have faith in man good day carson  the lane opened out upon the sageinclosed alfalfa fields and the last habitation at the end of that lane of hovels was the meanest formerly it had been a shed now it was a home the broad leaves of a widespreading cottonwood sheltered the sunken roof of weathered boards like an indian hut it had one floor round about it were a few scanty rows of vegetables such as the hand of a weak woman had time and strength to cultivate this little dwellingplace was just outside the village limits and the widow who lived there had to carry her water from the nearest irrigation ditch as jane withersteen entered the unfenced yard a child saw her shrieked with joy and came tearing toward her with curls flying this child was a little girl of four called fay her name suited her for she was an elf a sprite a creature so fairylike and beautiful that she seemed unearthly  muvver sended for oo cried fay as jane kissed her an oo never tome  i didnt know fay but ive come now  fay was a child of outdoors of the garden and ditch and field and she was dirty and ragged but rags and dirt did not hide her beauty the one thin little bedraggled garment she wore half covered her fine slim body red as cherries were her cheeks and lips her eyes were violet blue and the crown of her childish loveliness was the curling golden hair all the children of cottonwoods were jane withersteens friends she loved them all but fay was dearest to her fay had few playmates for among the gentile children there were none near her age and the mormon children were forbidden to play with her so she was a shy wild lonely child  muvvers sick said fay leading jane toward the door of the hut  jane went in there was only one room rather dark and bare but it was clean and neat a woman lay upon a bed  mrs larkin how are you asked jane anxiously  ive been pretty bad for a week but im better now  you havent been here all alonewith no one to wait on you  oh no my women neighbors are kind they take turns coming in  did you send for me  yes several times  but i had no wordno messages ever got to me  i sent the boys and they left word with your women that i was ill and would you please come  a sudden deadly sickness seized jane she fought the weakness as she fought to be above suspicious thoughts and it passed leaving her conscious of her utter impotence that too passed as her spirit rebounded but she had again caught a glimpse of dark underhand domination running its secret lines this time into her own household like a spider in the blackness of night an unseen hand had begun to run these dark lines to turn and twist them about her life to plait and weave a web jane withersteen knew it now and in the realization further coolness and sureness came to her and the fighting courage of her ancestors  mrs larkin youre better and im so glad said jane but may i not do something for youa turn at nursing or send you things or take care of fay  youre so good since my

worn face jane withersteen may heaven bless you ive been deeply grateful to you but because youre a mormon i never felt close to you till now i dont know much about religion as religion but your god and my god are the same    chapter viii surprise valley  back in that strange canyon which venters had found indeed a valley of surprises the wounded girls whispered appeal almost a prayer not to take her back to the rustlers crowned the events of the last few days with a confounding climax that she should not want to return to them staggered venters presently as logical thought returned her appeal confirmed his first impressionthat she was more unfortunate than badand he experienced a sensation of gladness if he had known before that oldrings masked rider was a woman his opinion would have been formed and he would have considered her abandoned but his first knowledge had come when he lifted a white face quivering in a convulsion of agony he had heard gods name whispered by bloodstained lips through her solemn and awful eyes he had caught a glimpse of her soul and just now had come the entreaty to him donttakemebackthere  once for all venterss quick mind formed a permanent conception of this poor girl he based it not upon what the chances of life had made her but upon the revelation of dark eyes that pierced the infinite upon a few pitiful halting words that betrayed failure and wrong and misery yet breathed the truth of a tragic fate rather than a natural leaning to evil  whats your name he inquired  bess she answered  bess what  thats enoughjust bess  the red that deepened in her cheeks was not all the flush of fever venters marveled anew and this time at the tint of shame in her face at the momentary drooping of long lashes she might be a rustlers girl but she was still capable of shame she might be dying but she still clung to some little remnant of honor  very well bess it doesnt matter he said but this matterswhat shall i do with you  areyoua rider she whispered  not now i was once i drove the withersteen herds but i lost my placelost all i ownedand now imim a sort of outcast my names bern venters  you wonttake meto cottonwoodsor glaze id behanged  no indeed but i must do something with you for its not safe for me here i shot that rustler who was with you sooner or later hell be found and then my tracks i must find a safer hidingplace where i cant be trailed  leave mehere  aloneto die  yes  i will not venters spoke shortly with a kind of ring in his voice  whatdo you wantto dowith me her whispering grew difficult so low and faint that venters had to stoop to hear her  why lets see he replied slowly id like to take you some place where i could watch by you nurse you till youre all right  andthen  well itll be time to think of that when youre cured of your wound its a bad one andbess if you dont want to liveif you dont fight for lifeyoull never  oh i wantto live im afraidto die but id ratherdiethan go backtoto  to oldring asked venters interrupting her in turn  her lips moved in an affirmative  i promise not to take you back to him or to cottonwoods or to glaze  the mournful earnestness of her gaze suddenly shone with unutterable gratitude and wonder and as suddenly venters found her eyes beautiful as he had never seen or felt beauty they were as dark blue as the sky at night then the flashing changed to a long thoughtful look in which there was a wistful unconscious searching of his face a look that trembled on the verge of hope and trust  ill tryto live she said the broken whisper just reached his ears do whatyou wantwith me  rest thendont worrysleep he replied  abruptly he arose as if words had been decision for him and with a sharp command to the dogs he strode from the camp venters was conscious of an indefinite conflict of change within him it seemed to be a vague passing of old moods a dim coalescing of new forces a moment of inexplicable transition he was both cast down and uplifted he wanted to think and think of the meaning but he resolutely dispelled emotion his imperative need at present was to find a safe retreat and this called for action  so he set out it still wanted several hours before dark this trip he turned to the left and wended his skulking way southward a mile or more to the opening of the valley where lay the strange scrawled rocks he did not however venture boldly out into the open sage but clung to the righthand wall and went along that till its perpendicular line broke into the long incline of bare stone  before proceeding farther he halted studying the strange character of this slope and realizing that a moving black object could be seen far against such background before him ascended a gradual swell of smooth stone it was hard polished and full of pockets worn by centuries of eddying rainwater a hundred yards up began a line of grotesque cedartrees and they extended along the slope clear to its most southerly end beyond that end venters wanted to get and he concluded the cedars few as they were would afford some cover  therefore he climbed swiftly the trees were farther up than he had estimated though he had from long habit made allowance for the deceiving nature of distances in that country when he gained the cover of cedars he paused to rest and look and it was then he saw how the trees sprang from holes in the bare rock ages of rain had run down the slope circling eddying in depressions wearing deep round holes there had been dry seasons accumulations of dust windblown seeds and cedars rose wonderfully out of solid rock but these were not beautiful cedars they were gnarled twisted into weird contortions as if growth were torture dead at the tops shrunken gray and old theirs had been a bitter fight and venters felt a strange sympathy for them this country was hard on treesand men  he slipped from cedar to cedar keeping them between him and the open valley as he progressed the belt of trees widened and he kept to its upper margin he passed shady pockets half full of water and as he marked the location for possible future need he reflected that there had been no rain since the winter snows from one of these shady holes a rabbit hopped out and squatted down laying its ears flat  venters wanted fresh meat now more than when he had only himself to think of but it would not do to fire his rifle there so he broke off a cedar branch and threw it he crippled the rabbit which started to flounder up the slope venters did not wish to lose the meat and he never allowed crippled game to escape to die lingeringly in some covert so after a careful glance below and back toward the canyon he began to chase the rabbit  the fact that rabbits generally ran uphill was not new to him but it presently seemed singular why this rabbit that might have escaped downward chose to ascend the slope venters knew then that it had a burrow higher up more than once he jerked over to seize it only in vain for the rabbit by renewed effort eluded his grasp thus the chase continued on up the bare slope the farther venters climbed the more determined he grew to catch his quarry at last panting and sweating he captured the rabbit at the foot of a steeper grade laying his rifle on the bulge of rising stone he killed the animal and slung it from his belt  before starting down he waited to catch his breath he had climbed far up that wonderful smooth slope and had almost reached the base of yellow cliff that rose skyward a huge scarred and cracked bulk it frowned down upon him as if to forbid further ascent venters bent over for his rifle and as he picked it up from where it leaned against the steeper grade he saw several little nicks cut in the solid stone  they were only a few inches deep and about a foot apart venters began to count themonetwothreefouron up to sixteen that number carried his glance to the top of his first bulging bench of cliffbase above after a more level offset was still steeper slope and the line of nicks kept on to wind round a projecting corner of wall  a casual glance would have passed by these little dents if venters had not known what they signified he would never have bestowed upon them the second glance but he knew they had been cut there by hand and though ageworn he recognized them as steps cut in the rock by the cliffdwellers with a pulse beginning to beat and hammer away his calmness he eyed that indistinct line of steps up to where the buttress of wall hid further sight of them he knew that behind the corner of stone would be a cave or a crack which could never be suspected from below chance that had sported with him of late now directed him to a probable hidingplace again he laid aside his rifle and removing boots and belt he began to walk up the steps like a mountain goat he was agile surefooted and he mounted the first bench without bending to use his hands the next ascent took grip of fingers as well as toes but he climbed steadily swiftly to reach the projecting corner and slipped around it here he faced a notch in the cliff at the apex he turned abruptly into a ragged vent that split the ponderous wall clear to the top showing a narrow streak of blue sky  at the base this vent was dark cool and smelled of dry musty dust it zigzagged so that he could not see ahead more than a few yards at a time he noticed tracks of wildcats and rabbits in the dusty floor at every turn he expected to come upon a huge cavern full of little square stone houses each with a small aperture like a staring dark eye the passage lightened and widened and opened at the foot of a narrow steep ascending chute  venters had a moments notice of the rock which was of the same smoothness and hardness as the slope below before his gaze went irresistibly upward to the precipitous walls of this wide ladder of granite these were ruined walls of yellow sandstone and so split and splintered so overhanging with great sections of balancing rim so impending with tremendous crumbling crags that venters caught his breath sharply and appalled he instinctively recoiled as if a step upward might jar the ponderous cliffs from their foundation indeed it seemed that these ruined cliffs were but awaiting a breath of wind to collapse and come tumbling down venters hesitated it would be a foolhardy man who risked his life under the leaning waiting avalanches of rock in that gigantic split yet how many years had they leaned there without falling at the bottom of the incline was an immense heap of weathered sandstone all crumbling to dust but there were no huge rocks as large as houses such as rested so lightly and frightfully above waiting patiently and inevitably to crash down slowly split from the parent rock by the weathering process and carved and sculptured by ages of wind and rain they waited their moment venters felt how foolish it was for him to fear these broken walls to fear that after they had endured for thousands of years the moment of his passing should be the one for them to slip yet he feared it  what a place to hide muttered venters ill climbill see where this thing goes if only i can find water  with teeth tight shut he essayed the incline and as he climbed he bent his eyes downward this however after a little grew impossible he had to look to obey his eager curious mind he raised his glance and saw light between row on row of shafts and pinnacles and crags that stood out from the main wall some leaned against the cliff others against each other many stood sheer and alone all were crumbling cracked rotten it was a place of yellow ragged ruin the passage narrowed as he went up it became a slant hard for him to stick on it was smooth as marble finally he surmounted it surprised to find the walls still several hundred feet high and a narrow gorge leading down on the other side this was a divide between two inclines about twenty yards wide at one side stood an enormous rock venters gave it a second glance because it rested on a pedestal it attracted closer attention it was like a colossal pear of stone standing on its stem around the bottom were thousands of little nicks just distinguishable to the eye they were marks of stone hatchets the cliffdwellers had chipped and chipped away at this boulder till it rested its tremendous bulk upon a mere pinpoint of its surface venters pondered why had the little stonemen hacked away at that big boulder it bore no semblance to a statue or an idol or a godhead or a sphinx instinctively he put his hands on it and pushed then his shoulder and heaved the stone seemed to groan to stir to grate and then to move it tipped a little downward and hung balancing for a long instant slowly returned rocked slightly groaned and settled back to its former position  venters divined its significance it had been meant for defense the cliffdwellers driven by dreaded enemies to this last stand had cunningly cut the rock until it balanced perfectly ready to be dislodged by strong hands just below it leaned a tottering crag that would have toppled starting an avalanche on an acclivity where no sliding mass could stop crags and pinnacles splintered cliffs and leaning shafts and monuments would have thundered down to block forever the outlet to deception pass  that was a narrow shave for me said venters soberly a balancing rock the cliffdwellers never had to roll it they died vanished and here the rock stands probably little changed but it might serve another lonely dweller of the cliffs ill hide up here somewhere if i can only find water  he descended the gorge on the other side the slope was gradual the space narrow the course straight for many rods a gloom hung between the upsweeping walls in a turn the passage narrowed to scarce a dozen feet and here was darkness of night but light shone ahead another abrupt turn brought day again and then wide open space  above venters loomed a wonderful arch of stone bridging the canyon rims and through the enormous round portal gleamed and glistened a beautiful valley shining under sunset gold reflected by surrounding cliffs he gave a start of surprise the valley was a cove a mile long half that wide and its enclosing walls were smooth and stained and curved inward forming great caves he decided that its floor was far higher than the level of deception pass and the intersecting canyons no purple sage colored this valley floor instead there were the white of aspens streaks of branch and slender trunk glistening from the green of leaves and the darker green of oaks and through the middle of this forest from wall to wall ran a winding line of brilliant green which marked the course of cottonwoods and willows  theres water hereand this is the place for me said venters only birds can peep over those walls ive gone oldring one better  venters waited no longer and turned swiftly to retrace his steps he named the canyon surprise valley and the huge boulder that guarded the outlet balancing rock going down he did not find himself attended by such fears as had beset him in the climb still he was not easy in mind and could not occupy himself with plans of moving the girl and his outfit until he had descended to the notch there he rested a moment and looked about him the pass was darkening with the approach of night at the corner of the wall where the stone steps turned he saw a spur of rock that would serve to hold the noose of a lasso he needed no more aid to scale that place as he intended to make the move under cover of darkness he wanted most to be able to tell where to climb up so taking several small stones with him he stepped and slid down to the edge of the slope where he had left his rifle and boots he placed the stones some yards apart he left the rabbit lying upon the bench where the steps began then he addressed a keensighted remembering gaze to the rimwall above it was serrated and between two spears of rock directly in line with his position showed a zigzag crack that at night would let through the gleam of sky this settled he put on his belt and boots and prepared to descend some consideration was necessary to decide whether or not to leave his rifle there on the return carrying the girl and a pack it would be added encumbrance and after debating the matter he left the rifle leaning against the bench as he went straight down the slope he halted every few rods to look up at his mark on the rim it changed but he fixed each change in his memory when he reached the first cedartree he tied his scarf upon a dead branch and then hurried toward camp having no more concern about finding his trail upon the return trip  darkness soon emboldened and lent him greater speed it occurred to him as he glided into the grassy glade near camp and head the whinny of a horse that he had forgotten wrangle the big sorrel could not be gotten into surprise valley he would have to be left here  venters determined at once to lead the other horses out through the thicket and turn them loose the farther they wandered from this canyon the better it would suit him he easily descried wrangle through the gloom but the others were not in sight venters whistled low for the dogs and when they came trotting to him he sent them out to search for the horses and followed it soon developed that they were not in the glade nor the thicket venters grew cold and rigid at the thought of rustlers having entered his retreat but the thought passed for the demeanor of ring and whitie reassured him the horses had wandered away  under the clump of silver spruces a denser mantle of darkness yet not so thick that venters nightpracticed eyes could not catch the white oval of a still face he bent over it with a slight suspension of breath that was both caution lest he frighten her and chill uncertainty of feeling lest he find her dead but she slept and he arose to renewed activity  he packed his saddlebags the dogs were hungry they whined about him and nosed his busy hands but he took no time to feed them nor to satisfy his own hunger he slung the saddlebags over his shoulders and made them secure with his lasso then he wrapped the blankets closer about the girl and lifted her in his arms wrangle whinnied and thumped the ground as venters passed him with the dogs the sorrel knew he was being left behind and was not sure whether he liked it or not venters went on and entered the thicket here he had to feel his way in pitch blackness and to wedge his progress between the close saplings time meant little to him now that he had started and he edged along with slow side movement till he got clear of the thicket ring and whitie stood waiting for him taking to the open aisles and patches of the sage he walked guardedly careful not to stumble or step in dust or strike against spreading sagebranches  if he were burdened he did not feel it from time to time when he passed out of the black lines of shade into the wan starlight he glanced at the white face of the girl lying in his arms she had not awakened from her sleep or stupor he did not rest until he cleared the black gate of the canyon then he leaned against a stone breasthigh to him and gently released the girl from his hold his brow and hair and the palms of his hands were wet and there was a kind of nervous contraction of his muscles they seemed to ripple and string tense he had a desire to hurry and no sense of fatigue a wind blew the scent of sage in his face the first early blackness of night passed with the brightening of the stars somewhere back on his trail a coyote yelped splitting the dead silence venterss faculties seemed singularly acute  he lifted the girl again and pressed on the valley better traveling than the canyon it was lighter freer of sage and there were no rocks soon out of the pale gloom shone a still paler thing and that was the low swell of slope venters mounted it and his dogs walked beside him once upon the stone he slowed to snail pace straining his sight to avoid the pockets and holes foot by foot he went up the weird cedars like great demons and witches chained to the rock and writhing in silent anguish loomed up with wide and twisting naked arms venters crossed this belt of cedars skirted the upper border and recognized the tree he had marked even before he saw his waving scarf  here he knelt and deposited the girl gently feet first and slowly laid her out full length what he feared was to reopen one of her wounds if he gave her a violent jar or slipped and fell but the supreme confidence so strangely felt that night admitted no such blunders  the slope before him seemed to swell into obscurity to lose its definite outline in a misty opaque cloud that shaded into the overshadowing wall he scanned the rim where the serrated points speared the sky and he found the zigzag crack it was dim only a shade lighter than the dark ramparts but he distinguished it and that served  lifting the girl he stepped upward closely attending to the nature of the path under his feet after a few steps he stopped to mark his line with the crack in the rim the dogs clung closer to him while chasing the rabbit this slope had appeared interminable to him now burdened as he was he did not think of length or height or toil he remembered only to avoid a misstep and to keep his direction he climbed on with frequent stops to watch the rim and before he dreamed of gaining the bench he bumped his knees into it and saw in the dim gray light his rifle and the rabbit he had come straight up without mishap or swerving off his course and his shut teeth unlocked  as he laid the girl down in the shallow hollow of the little ridge with her white face upturned she opened her eyes wide staring black at once like both the night and the stars they made her face seem still whiter  isityou she asked faintly  yes replied venters  oh whereare we  im taking you to a safe place where no one will ever find you i must climb a little here and call the dogs dont be afraid ill soon come for you  she said no more her eyes watched him steadily for a moment and then closed venters pulled off his boots and then felt for the little steps in the rock the shade of the cliff above obscured the point he wanted to gain but he could see dimly a few feet before him what he had attempted with care he now went at with surpassing lightness buoyant rapid sure he attained the corner of wall and slipped around it here he could not see a hand before his face so he groped along found a little flat space and there removed the saddlebags the lasso he took back with him to the corner and looped the noose over the spur of rock  ringwhitiecome he called softly  low whines came up from below  here come whitiering he repeated this time sharply  then followed scraping of claws and pattering of feet and out of the gray gloom below him swiftly climbed the dogs to reach his side and pass beyond  venters descended holding to the lasso he tested its strength by throwing all his weight upon it then he gathered the girl up and holding her securely in his left arm he began to climb at every few steps jerking his right hand upward along the lasso it sagged at each forward movement he made but he balanced himself lightly during the interval when he lacked the support of a taut rope he climbed as if he had wings the strength of a giant and knew not the sense of fear the sharp corner of cliff seemed to cut out of the darkness he reached it and the protruding shelf and then entering the black shade of the notch he moved blindly but surely to the place where he had left the saddlebags he heard the dogs though he could not see them once more he carefully placed the girl at his feet then on hands and knees he went over the little flat space feeling for stones he removed a number and scraping the deep dust into a heap he unfolded the outer blanket from around the girl and laid her upon this bed then he went down the slope again for his boots rifle and the rabbit and bringing also his lasso with him he made short work of that trip  areyouthere the girls voice came low from the blackness  yes he replied and was conscious that his laboring breast made speech difficult  are wein a cave  yes  oh listen the waterfall i hear it youve brought me back  venters heard a murmuring moan that one moment swelled to a pitch almost softly shrill and the next lulled to a low almost inaudible sigh  thatswind blowingin thecliffs he panted youre far from oldringscanyon  the effort it cost him to speak made him conscious of extreme lassitude following upon great exertion it seemed that when he lay down and drew his blanket over him the action was the last before utter prostration he stretched inert wet hot his body one great strife of throbbing stinging nerves and bursting veins and there he lay for a long while before he felt that he had begun to rest  rest came to him that night but no sleep sleep he did not want the hours of strained effort were now as if they had never been and he wanted to think earlier in the day he had dismissed an inexplicable feeling of change but now when there was no longer demand on his cunning and strength and he had time to think he could not catch the illusive thing that had sadly perplexed as well as elevated his spirit  above him through a vshaped cleft in the dark rim of the cliff shone the lustrous stars that had been his lonely accusers for a long long year tonight they were different he studied them larger whiter more radiant they seemed but that was not the difference he meant gradually it came to him that the distinction was not one he saw but one he felt in this he divined as much of the baffling change as he thought would be revealed to him then and as he lay there with the singing of the cliffwinds in his ears the white stars above the dark bold vent the difference which he felt was that he was no longer alone    chapter ix silver spruce and aspens  the rest of that night seemed to venters only a few moments of starlight a dark overcasting of sky an hour or so of gray gloom and then the lighting of dawn  when he had bestirred himself feeding the hungry dogs and breaking his long fast and had repacked his saddlebags it was clear daylight though the sun had not tipped the yellow wall in the east he concluded to make the climb and descent into surprise valley in one trip to that end he tied his blanket upon ring and gave whitie the extra lasso and the rabbit to carry then with the rifle and saddlebags slung upon his back he took up the girl she did not awaken from heavy slumber  that climb up under the rugged menacing brows of the broken cliffs in the face of a grim leaning boulder that seemed to be weary of its agelong wavering was a tax on strength and nerve that venters felt equally with something sweet and strangely exulting in its accomplishment he did not pause until he gained the narrow divide and there he rested balancing rock loomed huge cold in the gray light of dawn a thing without life yet it spoke silently to venters i am waiting to plunge down to shatter and crash roar and boom to bury your trail and close forever the outlet to deception pass  on the descent of the other side venters had easy going but was somewhat concerned because whitie appeared to have succumbed to temptation and while carrying the rabbit was also chewing on it and ring evidently regarded this as an injury to himself especially as he had carried the heavier load presently he snapped at one end of the rabbit and refused to let go but his action prevented whitie from further misdoing and then the two dogs pattered down carrying the rabbit between them  venters turned out of the gorge and suddenly paused stockstill astounded at the scene before him the curve of the great stone bridge had caught the sunrise and through the magnificent arch burst a glorious stream of gold that shone with a long slant down into the center of surprise valley only through the arch did any sunlight pass so that all the rest of the valley lay still asleep dark green mysterious shadowy merging its level into walls as misty and soft as morning clouds  venters then descended passing through the arch looking up at its tremendous height and sweep it spanned the opening to surprise valley stretching in almost perfect curve from rim to rim even in his hurry and concern venters could not but feel its majesty and the thought came to him that the cliffdwellers must have regarded it as an object of worship  down down down venters strode more and more feeling the weight of his burden as he descended and still the valley lay below him as all other canyons and coves and valleys had deceived him so had this deep nestling oval at length he passed beyond the slope of weathered stone that spread fanshape from the arch and encountered a grassy terrace running to the right and about on a level with the tips of the oaks and cottonwoods below scattered here and there upon this shelf were clumps of aspens and he walked through them into a glade that surpassed in beauty and adaptability for a wild home any place he had ever seen silver spruces bordered the base of a precipitous wall that rose loftily caves indented its surface and there were no detached ledges or weathered sections that might dislodge a stone the level ground beyond the spruces dropped down into a little ravine this was one dense line of slender aspens from which came the low splashing of water and the terrace lying open to the west afforded unobstructed view of the valley of green treetops  for his camp venters chose a shady grassy plot between the silver spruces and the cliff here in the stone wall had been wonderfully carved by wind or washed by water several deep caves above the level of the terrace they were clean dry roomy  he cut spruce boughs and made a bed in the largest cave and laid the girl there the first intimation that he had of her being aroused from sleep or lethargy was a low call for water  he hurried down into the ravine with his canteen it was a shallow grassgreen place with aspens growing up everywhere to his delight he found a tiny brook of swiftrunning water its faint tinge of amber reminded him of the spring at cottonwoods and the thought gave him a little shock the water was so cold it made his fingers tingle as he dipped the canteen having returned to the cave he was glad to see the girl drink thirstily this time he noted that she could raise her head slightly without his help  you were thirsty he said its good water ive found a fine place tell mehow do you feel  theres painhere she replied and moved her hand to her left side  why thats strange your wounds are on your right side i believe youre hungry is the pain a kind of dull achea gnawing  its likethat  then its hunger venters laughed and suddenly caught himself with a quick breath and felt again the little shock when had he laughed its hunger he went on ive had that gnaw many a time ive got it now but you mustnt eat you can have all the water you want but no food just yet  wont istarve  no people dont starve easily ive discovered that you must lie perfectly still and rest and sleepfor days  my handsare dirty my face feelsso hot and sticky my boots hurt it was her longest speech as yet and it trailed off in a whisper  well im a fine nurse  it annoyed him that he had never thought of these things but then awaiting her death and thinking of her comfort were vastly different matters he unwrapped the blanket which covered her what a slender girl she was no wonder he had been able to carry her miles and pack her up that slippery ladder of stone her boots were of soft fine leather reaching clear to her knees he recognized the make as one of a bootmaker in sterling her spurs that he had stupidly neglected to remove consisted of silver frames and gold chains and the rowels large as silver dollars were fancifully engraved the boots slipped off rather hard she wore heavy woollen riders stockings half length and these were pulled up over the ends of her short trousers venters took off the stockings to note her little feet were red and swollen he bathed them then he removed his scarf and bathed her face and hands  i must see your wounds now he said gently  she made no reply but watched him steadily as he opened her blouse and untied the bandage his strong fingers trembled a little as he removed it if the wounds had reopened a chill struck him as he saw the angry red bulletmark and a tiny stream of blood winding from it down her white breast very carefully he lifted her to see that the wound in her back had closed perfectly then he washed the blood from her breast bathed the wound and left it unbandaged open to the air  her eyes thanked him  listen he said earnestly ive had some wounds and ive seen many i know a little about them the hole in your back has closed if you lie still three days the one in your breast will close and youll be safe the danger from hemorrhage will be over  he had spoken with earnest sincerity almost eagerness  whydo youwant meto get well she asked wonderingly  the simple question seemed unanswerable except on grounds of humanity but the circumstances under which he had shot this strange girl the shock and realization the waiting for death the hope had resulted in a condition of mind wherein venters wanted her to live more than he had ever wanted anything yet he could not tell why he believed the killing of the rustler and the subsequent excitement had disturbed him for how else could he explain the throbbing of his brain the heat of his blood the undefined sense of full hours charged vibrant with pulsating mystery where once they had dragged in loneliness  i shot you he said slowly and i want you to get well so i shall not have killed a woman butfor your own sake too  a terrible bitterness darkened her eyes and her lips quivered  hush said venters youve talked too much already  in her unutterable bitterness he saw a darkness of mood that could not have been caused by her present weak and feverish state she hated the life she had led that she probably had been compelled to lead she had suffered some unforgivable wrong at the hands of oldring with that conviction venters felt a shame throughout his body and it marked the rekindling of fierce anger and ruthlessness in the past long year he had nursed resentment he had hated the wildernessthe loneliness of the uplands he had waited for something to come to pass it had come like an indian stealing horses he had skulked into the recesses of the canyons he had found oldrings retreat he had killed a rustler he had shot an unfortunate girl then had saved her from this unwitting act and he meant to save her from the consequent wasting of blood from fever and weakness starvation he had to fight for her and for himself where he had been sick at the letting of blood now he remembered it in grim cold calm and as he lost that softness of nature so he lost his fear of men he would watch for oldring biding his time and he would kill this great blackbearded rustler who had held a girl in bondage who had used her to his infamous ends  venters surmised this much of the change in himidleness had passed keen fierce vigor flooded his mind and body all that had happened to him at cottonwoods seemed remote and hard to recall the difficulties and perils of the present absorbed him held him in a kind of spell  first then he fitted up the little cave adjoining the girls room for his own comfort and use his next work was to build a fireplace of stones and to gather a store of wood that done he spilled the contents of his saddlebags upon the grass and took stock his outfit consisted of a smallhandled axe a huntingknife a large number of cartridges for rifle or revolver a tin plate a cup and a fork and spoon a quantity of dried beef and dried fruits and small canvas bags containing tea sugar salt and pepper for him alone this supply would have been bountiful to begin a sojourn in the wilderness but he was no longer alone starvation in the uplands was not an unheardof thing he did not however worry at all on that score and feared only his possible inability to supply the needs of a woman in a weakened and extremely delicate condition  if there was no game in the valleya contingency he doubtedit would not be a great task for him to go by night to oldrings herd and pack out a calf the exigency of the moment was to ascertain if there were game in surprise valley whitie still guarded the dilapidated rabbit and ring slept near by under a spruce venters called ring and went to the edge of the terrace and there halted to survey the valley  he was prepared to find it larger than his unstudied glances had made it appear for more than a casual idea of dimensions and a hasty conception of oval shape and singular beauty he had not had time again the felicity of the name he had given the valley struck him forcibly around the red perpendicular walls except under the great arc of stone ran a terrace fringed at the cliffbase by silver spruces below that first terrace sloped another wider one densely overgrown with aspens and the center of the valley was a level circle of oaks and alders with the glittering green line of willows and cottonwood dividing it in half venters saw a number and variety of birds flitting among the trees to his left facing the stone bridge an enormous cavern opened in the wall and low down just above the treetops he made out a long shelf of cliffdwellings with little black staring windows or doors like eyes they were and seemed to watch him the few cliffdwellings he had seenall ruinshad left him with haunting memory of age and solitude and of something past he had come in a way to be a cliffdweller himself and those silent eyes would look down upon him as if in surprise that after thousands of years a man had invaded the valley venters felt sure that he was the only white man who had ever walked under the shadow of the wonderful stone bridge down into that wonderful valley with its circle of caves and its terraced rings of silver spruce and aspens  the dog growled below and rushed into the forest venters ran down the declivity to enter a zone of light shade streaked with sunshine the oaktrees were slender none more than half a foot thick and they grew close together intermingling their branches ring came running back with a rabbit in his mouth venters took the rabbit and holding the dog near him stole softly on there were fluttering of wings among the branches and quick birdnotes and rustling of dead leaves and rapid patterings venters crossed wellworn trails marked with fresh tracks and when he had stolen on a little farther he saw many birds and running quail and more rabbits than he could count he had not penetrated the forest of oaks for a hundred yards had not approached anywhere near the line of willows and cottonwoods which he knew grew along a stream but he had seen enough to know that surprise valley was the home of many wild creatures  venters returned to camp he skinned the rabbits and gave the dogs the one they had quarreled over and the skin of this he dressed and hung up to dry feeling that he would like to keep it it was a particularly rich furry pelt with a beautiful white tail venters remembered that but for the bobbing of that white tail catching his eye he would not have espied the rabbit and he would never have discovered surprise valley little incidents of chance like this had turned him here and there in deception pass and now they had assumed to him the significance and direction of destiny  his good fortune in the matter of game at hand brought to his mind the necessity of keeping it in the valley therefore he took the axe and cut bundles of aspens and willows and packed them up under the bridge to the narrow outlet of the gorge here he began fashioning a fence by driving aspens into the ground and lacing them fast with willows trip after trip he made down for more building material and the afternoon had passed when he finished the work to his satisfaction wildcats might scale the fence but no coyote could come in to search for prey and no rabbits or other small game could escape from the valley  upon returning to camp he set about getting his supper at ease around a fine fire without hurry or fear of discovery after hard work that had definite purpose this freedom and comfort gave him peculiar satisfaction he caught himself often as he kept busy round the campfire stopping to glance at the quiet form in the cave and at the dogs stretched cozily near him and then out across the beautiful valley the present was not yet real to him  while he ate the sun set beyond a dip in the rim of the curved wall as the morning sun burst wondrously through a grand arch into this valley in a golden slanting shaft so the evening sun at the moment of setting shone through a gap of cliffs sending down a broad red burst to brighten the oval with a blaze of fire to venters both sunrise and sunset were unreal  a cool wind blew across the oval waving the tips of oaks and while the light lasted fluttering the aspen leaves into millions of facets of red and sweeping the graceful spruces then with the wind soon came a shade and a darkening and suddenly the valley was gray night came there quickly after the sinking of the sun venters went softly to look at the girl she slept and her breathing was quiet and slow he lifted ring into the cave with stern whisper for him to stay there on guard then he drew the blanket carefully over her and returned to the campfire  though exceedingly tired he was yet loath to yield to lassitude but this night it was not from listening watchful vigilance it was from a desire to realize his position the details of his wild environment seemed the only substance of a strange dream he saw the darkening rims the gray oval turning black the undulating surface of forest like a rippling lake and the spearpointed spruces he heard the flutter of aspen leaves and the soft continuous splash of falling water the melancholy note of a canyon bird broke clear and lonely from the high cliffs venters had no name for this night singer and he had never seen one but the few notes always pealing out just at darkness were as familiar to him as the canyon silence then they ceased and the rustle of leaves and the murmur of water hushed in a growing sound that venters fancied was not of earth neither had he a name for this only it was inexpressibly wild and sweet the thought came that it might be a moan of the girl in her last outcry of life and he felt a tremor shake him but no this sound was not human though it was like despair he began to doubt his sensitive perceptions to believe that he halfdreamed what he thought he heard then the sound swelled with the strengthening of the breeze and he realized it was the singing of the wind in the cliffs  by and by a drowsiness overcame him and venters began to nod half asleep with his back against a spruce rousing himself and calling whitie he went to the cave the girl lay barely visible in the dimness ring crouched beside her and the patting of his tail on the stone assured venters that the dog was awake and faithful to his duty venters sought his own bed of fragrant boughs and as he lay back somehow grateful for the comfort and safety the night seemed to steal away from him and he sank softly into intangible space and rest and slumber  venters awakened to the sound of melody that he imagined was only the haunting echo of dream music he opened his eyes to another surprise of this valley of beautiful surprises out of his cave he saw the exquisitely fine foliage of the silver spruces crossing a round space of blue morning sky and in this lacy leafage fluttered a number of gray birds with black and white stripes and long tails they were mockingbirds and they were singing as if they wanted to burst their throats venters listened one long silvertipped branch dropped almost to his cave and upon it within a few yards of him sat one of the graceful birds venters saw the swelling and quivering of its throat in song he arose and when he slid down out of his cave the birds fluttered and flew farther away  venters stepped before the opening of the other cave and looked in the girl was awake with wide eyes and listening look and she had a hand on rings neck  mockingbirds she said  yes replied venters and i believe they like our company  where are we  never mind now after a little ill tell you  the birds woke me when i heard themand saw the shiny treesand the blue skyand then a blaze of gold dropping downi wondered  she did not complete her fancy but venters imagined he understood her meaning she appeared to be wandering in mind venters felt her face and hands and found them burning with fever he went for water and was glad to find it almost as cold as if flowing from ice that water was the only medicine he had and he put faith in it she did not want to drink but he made her swallow and then he bathed her face and head and cooled her wrists  the day began with the heightening of the fever venters spent the time reducing her temperature cooling her hot cheeks and temples he kept close watch over her and at the least indication of restlessness that he knew led to tossing and rolling of the body he held her tightly so no violent move could reopen her wounds hour after hour she babbled and laughed and cried and moaned in delirium but whatever her secret was she did not reveal it attended by something somber for venters the day passed at night in the cool winds the fever abated and she slept  the second day was a repetition of the first on the third he seemed to see her wither and waste away before his eyes that day he scarcely went from her side for a moment except to run for fresh cool water and he did not eat the fever broke on the fourth day and left her spent and shrunken a slip of a girl with life only in her eyes they hung upon venters with a mute observance and he found hope in that  to rekindle the spark that had nearly flickered out to nourish the little life and vitality that remained in her was venterss problem but he had little resource other than the meat of the rabbits and quail and from these he made broths and soups as best he could and fed her with a spoon it came to him that the human body like the human soul was a strange thing and capable of recovering from terrible shocks for almost immediately she showed faint signs of gathering strength there was one more waiting day in which he doubted and spent long hours by her side as she slept and watched the gentle swell of her breast rise and fall in breathing and the wind stir the tangled chestnut curls on the next day he knew that she would live  upon realizing it he abruptly left the cave and sought his accustomed seat against the trunk of a big spruce where once more he let his glance stray along the sloping terraces she would live and the somber gloom lifted out of the valley and he felt relief that was pain then he roused to the call of action to the many things he needed to do in the way of making camp fixtures and utensils to the necessity of hunting food and the desire to explore the valley  but he decided to wait a few more days before going far from camp because he fancied that the girl rested easier when she could see him near at hand and on the first day her languor appeared to leave her in a renewed grip of life she awoke stronger from each short slumber she ate greedily and she moved about in her bed of boughs and always it seemed to venters her eyes followed him he knew now that her recovery would be rapid she talked about the dogs about the caves the valley about how hungry she was till venters silenced her asking her to put off further talk till another time she obeyed but she sat up in her bed and her eyes roved to and fro and always back to him  upon the second morning she sat up when he awakened her and would not permit him to bathe her face and feed her which actions she performed for herself she spoke little however and venters was quick to catch in her the first intimations of thoughtfulness and curiosity and appreciation of her situation he left camp and took whitie out to hunt for rabbits upon his return he was amazed and somewhat anxiously concerned to see his invalid sitting with her back to a corner of the cave and her bare feet swinging out hurriedly he approached intending to advise her to lie down again to tell her that perhaps she might overtax her strength the sun shone upon her glinting on the little head with its tangle of bright hair and the small oval face with its pallor and darkblue eyes underlined by darkblue circles she looked at him and he looked at her in that exchange of glances he imagined each saw the other in some different guise it seemed impossible to venters that this frail girl could be oldrings masked rider it flashed over him that he had made a mistake which presently she would explain  help me down she said  butare you well enough he protested waita little longer  im weakdizzy but i want to get down  he lifted herwhat a light burden nowand stood her upright beside him and supported her as she essayed to walk with halting steps she was like a stripling of a boy the bright small head scarcely reached his shoulder but now as she clung to his arm the riders costume she wore did not contradict as it had done at first his feeling of her femininity she might be the famous masked rider of the uplands she might resemble a boy but her outline her little hands and feet her hair her big eyes and tremulous lips and especially a something that venters felt as a subtle essence rather than what he saw proclaimed her sex  she soon tired he arranged a comfortable seat for her under the spruce that overspread the campfire  now tell meeverything she said  he recounted all that had happened from the time of his discovery of the rustlers in the canyon up to the present moment  you shot meand now youve saved my life  yes after almost killing you ive pulled you through  are you glad  i should say so  her eyes were unusually expressive and they regarded him steadily she was unconscious of that mirroring of her emotions and they shone with gratefulness and interest and wonder and sadness  tell meabout yourself she asked  he made this a briefer story telling of his coming to utah his various occupations till he became a rider and then how the mormons had practically driven him out of cottonwoods an outcast  then no longer able to withstand his own burning curiosity he questioned her in turn  are you oldrings masked rider  yes she replied and dropped her eyes  i knew iti recognized your figureand mask for i saw you once yet i cant believe it but you never were really that rustler as we riders knew him a thiefa maraudera kidnapper of womena murderer of sleeping riders  no i never stoleor harmed any onein all my life i only rode and rode  but whywhy he burst out why the name i understand oldring made you ride but the black maskthe mysterythe things laid to your handsthe threats in your infamous namethe nightriding credited to youthe evil deeds deliberately blamed on you and acknowledged by rustlerseven oldring himself why tell me why  i never knew that she answered low her drooping head straightened and the large eyes larger now and darker met venterss with a clear steadfast gaze in which he read truth it verified his own conviction  never knew thats strange are you a mormon  no  is oldring a mormon  no  do youcare for him  yes i hate his menhis lifesometimes i almost hate him  venters paused in his rapidfire questioning as if to brace him self to ask for a truth that would be abhorrent for him to confirm but which he seemed driven to hear  what arewhat were you to oldring  like some delicate thing suddenly exposed to blasting heat the girl wilted her head dropped and into her white wasted cheeks crept the red of shame  venters would have given anything to recall that question it seemed so differenthis thought when spoken yet her shame established in his mind something akin to the respect he had strangely been hungering to feel for her  dn that questionforget it he cried in a passion of pain for her and anger at himself but once and for alltell mei know it yet i want to hear you say soyou couldnt help yourself  oh no  well that makes it all right with me he went on honestly ii want you to feel that you seeweve been thrown togetherandand i want to help younot hurt you i thought life had been cruel to me but when i think of yours i feel mean and little for my complaining anyway i was a lonely outcast and now i dont see very clearly what it all means only we are heretogether weve got to stay here for long surely till you are well but youll never go back to oldring and im sure helping you will help me for i was sick in mind theres something now for me to do and if i can win back your strengththen get you away out of this wild countryhelp you somehow to a happier lifejust think how good thatll be for me    chapter x love  during all these waiting days venters with the exception of the afternoon when he had built the gate in the gorge had scarcely gone out of sight of camp and never out of hearing his desire to explore surprise valley was keen and on the morning after his long talk with the girl he took his rifle and calling ring made a move to start the girl lay back in a rude chair of boughs he had put together for her she had been watching him and when he picked up the gun and called the dog venters thought she gave a nervous start  im only going to look over the valley he said  will you be gone long  no he replied and started off the incident set him thinking of his former impression that after her recovery from fever she did not seem at ease unless he was close at hand it was fear of being alone due he concluded most likely to her weakened condition he must not leave her much alone  as he strode down the sloping terrace rabbits scampered before him and the beautiful valley quail as purple in color as the sage on the uplands ran fleetly along the ground into the forest it was pleasant under the trees in the goldflecked shade with the whistle of quail and twittering of birds everywhere soon he had passed the limit of his former excursions and entered new territory here the woods began to show open glades and brooks running down from the slope and presently he emerged from shade into the sunshine of a meadow the shaking of the high grass told him of the running of animals what species he could not tell but from rings manifest desire to have a chase they were evidently some kind wilder than rabbits venters approached the willow and cottonwood belt that he had observed from the height of slope he penetrated it to find a considerable stream of water and great halfsubmerged mounds of brush and sticks and all about him were old and new gnawed circles at the base of the cottonwoods  beaver he exclaimed by all thats lucky the meadows full of beaver how did they ever get here  beaver had not found a way into the valley by the trail of the cliffdwellers of that he was certain and he began to have more than curiosity as to the outlet or inlet of the stream when he passed some dead water which he noted was held by a beaver dam there was a current in the stream and it flowed west following its course he soon entered the oak forest again and passed through to find himself before massed and jumbled ruins of cliff wall there were tangled thickets of wild plumtrees and other thorny growths that made passage extremely laborsome he found innumerable tracks of wildcats and foxes rustlings in the thick undergrowth told him of stealthy movements of these animals at length his further advance appeared futile for the reason that the stream disappeared in a split at the base of immense rocks over which he could not climb to his relief he concluded that though beaver might work their way up the narrow chasm where the water rushed it would be impossible for men to enter the valley there  this western curve was the only part of the valley where the walls had been split asunder and it was a wildly rough and inaccessible corner going back a little way he leaped the stream and headed toward the southern wall once out of the oaks he found again the low terrace of aspens and above that the wide open terrace fringed by silver spruces this side of the valley contained the wind or water worn caves as he pressed on keeping to the upper terrace cave after cave opened out of the cliff now a large one now a small one then yawned quite suddenly and wonderfully above him the great cavern of the cliffdwellers  it was still a goodly distance and he tried to imagine if it appeared so huge from where he stood what it would be when he got there he climbed the terrace and then faced a long gradual ascent of weathered rock and dust which made climbing too difficult for attention to anything else at length he entered a zone of shade and looked up he stood just within the hollow of a cavern so immense that he had no conception of its real dimensions the curved roof stained by ages of leakage with buff and black and rustcolored streaks swept up and loomed higher and seemed to soar to the rim of the cliff here again was a magnificent arch such as formed the grand gateway to the valley only in this instance it formed the dome of a cave instead of the span of a bridge  venters passed onward and upward the stones he dislodged rolled down with strange hollow crack and roar he had climbed a hundred rods inward and yet he had not reached the base of the shelf where the cliffdwellings rested a long halfcircle of connected stone house with little dark holes that he had fancied were eyes at length he gained the base of the shelf and here found steps cut in the rock these facilitated climbing and as he went up he thought how easily this vanished race of men might once have held that stronghold against an army there was only one possible place to ascend and this was narrow and steep  venters had visited cliffdwellings before and they had been in ruins and of no great character or size but this place was of proportions that stunned him and it had not been desecrated by the hand of man nor had it been crumbled by the hand of time it was a stupendous tomb it had been a city it was just as it had been left by its builders the little houses were there the smokeblackened stains of fires the pieces of pottery scattered about cold hearths the stone hatchets and stone pestles and mealingstones lay beside round holes polished by years of grinding maizelay there as if they had been carelessly dropped yesterday but the cliffdwellers were gone  dust they were dust on the floor or at the foot of the shelf and their habitations and utensils endured venters felt the sublimity of that marvelous vaulted arch and it seemed to gleam with a glory of something that was gone how many years had passed since the cliffdwellers gazed out across the beautiful valley as he was gazing now how long had it been since women ground grain in those polished holes what time had rolled by since men of an unknown race lived loved fought and died there had an enemy destroyed them had disease destroyed them or only that greatest destroyertime venters saw a long line of bloodred hands painted low down upon the yellow roof of stone here was strange portent if not an answer to his queries the place oppressed him it was light but full of a transparent gloom it smelled of dust and musty stone of age and disuse it was sad it was solemn it had the look of a place where silence had become master and was now irrevocable and terrible and could not be broken yet at the moment from high up in the carved crevices of the arch floated down the low strange wail of winda knell indeed for all that had gone  venters sighing gathered up an armful of pottery such pieces as he thought strong enough and suitable for his own use and bent his steps toward camp he mounted the terrace at an opposite point to which he had left he saw the girl looking in the direction he had gone his footsteps made no sound in the deep grass and he approached close without her being aware of his presence whitie lay on the ground near where she sat and he manifested the usual actions of welcome but the girl did not notice them she seemed to be oblivious to everything near at hand she made a pathetic figure drooping there with her sunny hair contrasting so markedly with her white wasted cheeks and her hands listlessly clasped and her little bare feet propped in the framework of the rude seat venters could have sworn and laughed in one breath at the idea of the connection between this girl and oldrings masked rider she was the victim of more than accident of fatea victim to some deep plot the mystery of which burned him as he stepped forward with a halfformed thought that she was absorbed in watching for his return she turned her head and saw him a swift start a change rather than rush of blood under her white cheeks a flashing of big eyes that fixed their glance upon him transformed her face in that single instant of turning and he knew she had been watching for him that his return was the one thing in her mind she did not smile she did not flush she did not look glad all these would have meant little compared to her indefinite expression venters grasped the peculiar vivid vital something that leaped from her face it was as if she had been in a dead hopeless clamp of inaction and feeling and had been suddenly shot through and through with quivering animation almost it was as if she had returned to life  and venters thought with lightning swiftness ive saved herive unlinked her from that old lifeshe was watching as if i were all she had left on earthshe belongs to me the thought was startlingly new like a blow it was in an unprepared moment the cheery salutation he had ready for her died unborn and he tumbled the pieces of pottery awkwardly on the grass while some unfamiliar deepseated emotion mixed with pity and glad assurance of his power to succor her held him dumb  what a load you had she said why theyre pots and crocks where did you get them  venters laid down his rifle and filling one of the pots from his canteen he placed it on the smoldering campfire  hope itll hold water he said presently why theres an enormous cliffdwelling just across here i got the pottery there dont you think we needed something that tin cup of mine has served to make tea broth soupeverything  i noticed we hadnt a great deal to cook in  she laughed it was the first time he liked that laugh and though he was tempted to look at her he did not want to show his surprise or his pleasure  will you take me over there and all around in the valleypretty soon when im well she added  indeed i shall its a wonderful place rabbits so thick you cant step without kicking one out and quail beaver foxes wildcats were in a regular den buthavent you ever seen a cliffdwelling  no ive heard about them though thethe men say the pass is full of old houses and ruins  why i should think youd have run across one in all your riding around said venters he spoke slowly choosing his words carefully and he essayed a perfectly casual manner and pretended to be busy assorting pieces of pottery she must have no cause again to suffer shame for curiosity of his yet never in all his days had he been so eager to hear the details of anyones life  when i rodei rode like the wind she replied and never had time to stop for anything  i remember that day ii met you in the passhow dusty you were how tired your horse looked were you always riding  oh no sometimes not for months when i was shut up in the cabin  venters tried to subdue a hot tingling  you were shut up then he asked carelessly  when oldring went away on his long tripshe was gone for months sometimeshe shut me up in the cabin  what for  perhaps to keep me from running away i always threatened that mostly though because the men got drunk at the villages but they were always good to me i wasnt afraid  a prisoner that must have been hard on you  i liked that as long as i can remember ive been locked up there at times and those times were the only happy ones i ever had its a big cabin high up on a cliff and i could look out then i had dogs and pets i had tamed and books there was a spring inside and food stored and the men brought me fresh meat once i was there one whole winter  it now required deliberation on venterss part to persist in his unconcern and to keep at work he wanted to look at her to volley questions at her  as long as you can rememberyouve lived in deception pass he went on  ive a dim memory of some other place and women and children but i cant make anything of it sometimes i think till im weary  then you can readyou have books  oh yes i can read and write too pretty well oldring is educated he taught me and years ago an old rustler lived with us and he had been something different once he was always teaching me  so oldring takes long trips mused venters do you know where he goes  no every year he drives cattle north of sterlingthen does not return for months i heard him accused once of living two livesand he killed the man that was at stone bridge  venters dropped his apparent task and looked up with an eagerness he no longer strove to hide  bess he said using her name for the first time i suspected oldring was something besides a rustler tell me whats his purpose here in the pass i believe much that he has done was to hide his real work here  youre right hes more than a rustler in fact as the men say his rustling cattle is now only a bluff theres gold in the canyons  ah  yes theres gold not in great quantities but gold enough for him and his men they wash for gold week in and week out then they drive a few cattle and go into the villages to drink and shoot and killto bluff the riders  drive a few cattle but bess the withersteen herd the red herdtwentyfive hundred head thats not a few and i tracked them into a valley near here  oldring never stole the red herd he made a deal with mormons the riders were to be called in and oldring was to drive the herd and keep it till a certain timei wont know whenthen drive it back to the range what his share was i didnt hear  did you hear why that deal was made queried venters  no but it was a trick of mormons theyre full of tricks ive heard oldrings men tell about mormons maybe the withersteen woman wasnt minding her halter i saw the man who made the deal he was a little queershaped man all humped up he sat his horse well i heard one of our men say afterward there was no better rider on the sage than this fellow what was the name i forget  jerry card suggested venters  thats it i rememberits a name easy to rememberand jerry card appeared to be on fair terms with oldrings men  i shouldnt wonder replied venters thoughtfully verification of his suspicions in regard to tulls underhand workfor the deal with oldring made by jerry card assuredly had its inception in the mormon elders brain and had been accomplished through his ordersrevived in venters a memory of hatred that had been smothered by press of other emotions only a few days had elapsed since the hour of his encounter with tull yet they had been forgotten and now seemed far off and the interval one that now appeared large and profound with incalculable change in his feelings hatred of tull still existed in his heart but it had lost its white heat his affection for jane withersteen had not changed in the least nevertheless he seemed to view it from another angle and see it as another thingwhat he could not exactly define the recalling of these two feelings was to venters like getting glimpses into a self that was gone and the wonder of themperhaps the change which was too illusive for himwas the fact that a strange irritation accompanied the memory and a desire to dismiss it from mind and straightway he did dismiss it to return to thoughts of his significant present  bess tell me one more thing he said havent you known any womenany young people  sometimes there were women with the men but oldring never let me know them and all the young people i ever saw in my life was when i rode fast through the villages  perhaps that was the most puzzling and thoughtprovoking thing she had yet said to venters he pondered more curious the more he learned but he curbed his inquisitive desires for he saw her shrinking on the verge of that shame the causing of which had occasioned him such selfreproach he would ask no more still he had to think and he found it difficult to think clearly this sadeyed girl was so utterly different from what it would have been reason to believe such a remarkable life would have made her on this day he had found her simple and frank as natural as any girl he had ever known about her there was something sweet her voice was low and well modulated he could not look into her face meet her steady unabashed yet wistful eyes and think of her as the woman she had confessed herself oldrings masked rider sat before him a girl dressed as a man she had been made to ride at the head of infamous forays and drives she had been imprisoned for many months of her life in an obscure cabin at times the most vicious of men had been her companions and the vilest of women if they had not been permitted to approach her had at least cast their shadows over her butbut in spite of all thisthere thundered at venters some truth that lifted its voice higher than the clamoring facts of dishonor some truth that was the very life of her beautiful eyes and it was innocence  in the days that followed venters balanced perpetually in mind this haunting conception of innocence over against the cold and sickening fact of an unintentional yet actual gift how could it be possible for the two things to be true he believed the latter to be true and he would not relinquish his conviction of the former and these conflicting thoughts augmented the mystery that appeared to be a part of bess in those ensuing days however it became clear as clearest light that bess was rapidly regaining strength that unless reminded of her long association with oldring she seemed to have forgotten it that like an indian who lives solely from moment to moment she was utterly absorbed in the present  day by day venters watched the white of her face slowly change to brown and the wasted cheeks fill out by imperceptible degrees there came a time when he could just trace the line of demarcation between the part of her face once hidden by a mask and that left exposed to wind and sun when that line disappeared in clear bronze tan it was as if she had been washed clean of the stigma of oldrings masked rider the suggestion of the mask always made venters remember now that it was gone he seldom thought of her past occasionally he tried to piece together the several stages of strange experience and to make a whole he had shot a masked outlaw the very sight of whom had been ill omen to riders he had carried off a wounded woman whose bloody lips quivered in prayer he had nursed what seemed a frail shrunken boy and now he watched a girl whose face had become strangely sweet whose darkblue eyes were ever upon him without boldness without shyness but with a steady grave and growing light many times venters found the clear gaze embarrassing to him yet like wine it had an exhilarating effect what did she think when she looked at him so almost he believed she had no thought at all all about her and the present there in surprise valley and the dim yet subtly impending future fascinated venters and made him thoughtful as all his lonely vigils in the sage had not  chiefly it was the present that he wished to dwell upon but it was the call of the future which stirred him to action no idea had he of what that future had in store for bess and him he began to think of improving surprise valley as a place to live in for there was no telling how long they would be compelled to stay there venters stubbornly resisted the entering into his mind of an insistent thought that clearly realized might have made it plain to him that he did not want to leave surprise valley at all but it was imperative that he consider practical matters and whether or not he was destined to stay long there he felt the immediate need of a change of diet it would be necessary for him to go farther afield for a variety of meat and also that he soon visit cottonwoods for a supply of food  it occurred again to venters that he could go to the canyon where oldring kept his cattle and at little risk he could pack out some beef he wished to do this however without letting bess know of it till after he had made the trip presently he hit upon the plan of going while she was asleep  that very night he stole out of camp climbed up under the stone bridge and entered the outlet to the pass the gorge was full of luminous gloom balancing rock loomed dark and leaned over the pale descent transformed in the shadowy light it took shape and dimensions of a spectral god waitingwaiting for the moment to hurl himself down upon the tottering walls and close forever the outlet to deception pass at night more than by day venters felt something fearful and fateful in that rock and that it had leaned and waited through a thousand years to have somehow to deal with his destiny  old man if you must roll wait till i get back to the girl and then roll he said aloud as if the stones were indeed a god  and those spoken words in their grim note to his ear as well as contents to his mind told venters that he was all but drifting on a current which he had not power nor wish to stem  venters exercised his usual care in the matter of hiding tracks from the outlet yet it took him scarcely an hour to reach oldrings cattle here sight of many calves changed his original intention and instead of packing out meat he decided to take a calf out alive he roped one securely tied its feet and swung it over his shoulder here was an exceedingly heavy burden but venters was powerfulhe could take up a sack of grain and with ease pitch it over a packsaddleand he made long distance without resting the hardest work came in the climb up to the outlet and on through to the valley when he had accomplished it he became fired with another idea that again changed his intention he would not kill the calf but keep it alive he would go back to oldrings herd and pack out more calves thereupon he secured the calf in the best available spot for the moment and turned to make a second trip  when venters got back to the valley with another calf it was close upon daybreak he crawled into his cave and slept late bess had no inkling that he had been absent from camp nearly all night and only remarked solicitously that he appeared to be more tired than usual and more in the need of sleep in the afternoon venters built a gate across a small ravine near camp and here corralled the calves and he succeeded in completing his task without bess being any the wiser  that night he made two more trips to oldrings range and again on the following night and yet another on the next with eight calves in his corral he concluded that he had enough but it dawned upon him then that he did not want to kill one ive rustled oldrings cattle he said and laughed he noted then that all the calves were red red he exclaimed from the red herd ive stolen jane withersteens cattle thats about the strangest thing yet  one more trip he undertook to oldrings valley and this time he roped a yearling steer and killed it and cut out a small quarter of beef the howling of coyotes told him he need have no apprehension that the work of his knife would be discovered he packed the beef back to camp and hung it upon a sprucetree then he sought his bed  on the morrow he was up bright and early glad that he had a surprise for bess he could hardly wait for her to come out presently she appeared and walked under the spruce then she approached the campfire there was a tinge of healthy red in the bronze of her cheeks and her slender form had begun to round out in graceful lines  bess didnt you say you were tired of rabbit inquired venters and quail and beaver  indeed i did  what would you like  im tired of meat but if we have to live on it id like some beef  well how does that strike you venters pointed to the quarter hanging from the sprucetree well have fresh beef for a few days then well cut the rest into strips and dry it  where did you get that asked bess slowly  i stole that from oldring  you went back to the canyonyou risked while she hesitated the tinge of bloom faded out of her cheeks  it wasnt any risk but it was hard work  im sorry i said i was tired of rabbit why howwhen did you get that beef  last night  while i was asleep  yes  i woke last night sometimebut i didnt know  her eyes were widening darkening with thought and whenever they did so the steady watchful seeing gaze gave place to the wistful light in the former she saw as the primitive woman without thought in the latter she looked inward and her gaze was the reflection of a troubled mind for long venters had not seen that dark change that deepening of blue which he thought was beautiful and sad but now he wanted to make her think  ive done more than pack in that beef he said for five nights ive been working while you slept ive got eight calves corralled near a ravine eight calves all alive and doing fine  you went five nights  all that venters could make of the dilation of her eyes her slow pallor and her exclamation was fearfear for herself or for him  yes i didnt tell you because i knew you were afraid to be left alone  alone she echoed his word but the meaning of it was nothing to her she had not even thought of being left alone it was not then fear for herself but for him this girl always slow of speech and action now seemed almost stupid she put forth a hand that might have indicated the groping of her mind suddenly she stepped swiftly to him with a look and touch that drove from him any doubt of her quick intelligence or feeling  oldring has men watch the herdsthey would kill you you must never go again  when she had spoken the strength and the blaze of her died and she swayed toward venters  bess ill not go again he said catching her  she leaned against him and her body was limp and vibrated to a long wavering tremble her face was upturned to his womans face womans eyes womans lipsall acutely and blindly and sweetly and terribly truthful in their betrayal but as her fear was instinctive so was her clinging to this one and only friend  venters gently put her from him and steadied her upon her feet and all the while his blood raced wild and a thrilling tingle unsteadied his nerve and somethingthat he had seen and felt in herthat he could not understandseemed very close to him warm and rich as a fragrant breath sweet as nothing had ever before been sweet to him  with all his will venters strove for calmness and thought and judgment unbiased by pity and reality unswayed by sentiment besss eyes were still fixed upon him with all her soul bright in that wistful light swiftly resolutely he put out of mind all of her life except what had been spent with him he scorned himself for the intelligence that made him still doubt he meant to judge her as she had judged him he was face to face with the inevitableness of life itself he saw destiny in the dark straight path of her wonderful eyes here was the simplicity the sweetness of a girl contending with new and strange and enthralling emotions here the living truth of innocence here the blind terror of a woman confronted with the thought of death to her savior and protector all this venters saw but besides there was in besss eyes a slowdawning consciousness that seemed about to break out in glorious radiance  bess are you thinking he asked  yesoh yes  do you realize we are here aloneman and woman  yes  have you thought that we may make our way out to civilization or we may have to stay herealonehidden from the world all our lives  i never thoughttill now  well whats your choiceto goor to stay herealone with me  stay newborn thought of self ringing vibrantly in her voice gave her answer singular power  venters trembled and then swiftly turned his gaze from her facefrom her eyes he knew what she had only half divinedthat she loved him    chapter xi faith and unfaith  at jane withersteens home the promise made to mrs larkin to care for little fay had begun to be fulfilled like a gleam of sunlight through the cottonwoods was the coming of the child to the gloomy house of withersteen the big silent halls echoed with childish laughter in the shady court where jane spent many of the hot july days fays tiny feet pattered over the stone flags and splashed in the amber stream she prattled incessantly what difference jane thought a child made in her home it had never been a real home she discovered even the tidiness and neatness she had so observed and upon which she had insisted to her women became in the light of fays smile habits that now lost their importance fay littered the court with janes books and papers and other toys her fancy improvised and many a strange craft went floating down the little brook  and it was owing to fays presence that jane withersteen came to see more of lassiter the rider had for the most part kept to the sage he rode for her but he did not seek her except on business and jane had to acknowledge in pique that her overtures had been made in vain fay however captured lassiter the moment he first laid eyes on her  jane was present at the meeting and there was something about it which dimmed her sight and softened her toward this foe of her people the rider had clanked into the court a tired yet wary man always looking for the attack upon him that was inevitable and might come from any quarter and he had walked right upon little fay the child had been beautiful even in her rags and amid the surroundings of the hovel in the sage but now in a pretty white dress with her shining curls brushed and her face clean and rosy she was lovely she left her play and looked up at lassiter  if there was not an instinct for all three of them in that meeting an unreasoning tendency toward a closer intimacy then jane withersteen believed she had been subject to a queer fancy she imagined any child would have feared lassiter and fay larkin had been a lonely a solitary elf of the sage not at all an ordinary child and exquisitely shy with strangers she watched lassiter with great round grave eyes but showed no fear the rider gave jane a favorable report of cattle and horses and as he took the seat to which she invited him little fay edged as much as half an inch nearer jane replied to his look of inquiry and told fays story the riders gray earnest gaze troubled her then he turned to fay and smiled in a way that made jane doubt her sense of the true relation of things how could lassiter smile so at a child when he had made so many children fatherless but he did smile and to the gentleness she had seen a few times he added something that was infinitely sad and sweet janes intuition told her that lassiter had never been a father but if life ever so blessed him he would be a good one fay also must have found that smile singularly winning for she edged closer and closer and then by way of feminine capitulation went to jane from whose side she bent a beautiful glance upon the rider  lassiter only smiled at her  jane watched them and realized that now was the moment she should seize if she was ever to win this man from his hatred but the step was not easy to take the more she saw of lassiter the more she respected him and the greater her respect the harder it became to lend herself to mere coquetry yet as she thought of her great motive of tull and of that other whose name she had schooled herself never to think of in connection with milly ernes avenger she suddenly found she had no choice and her creed gave her boldness far beyond the limit to which vanity would have led her  lassiter i see so little of you now she said and was conscious of heat in her cheeks  ive been riding hard he replied  but you cant live in the saddle you come in sometimes wont you come here to see meoftener  is that an order  nonsense i simply ask you to come to see me when you find time  why  the query once heard was not so embarrassing to jane as she might have imagined moreover it established in her mind a fact that there existed actually other than selfish reasons for her wanting to see him and as she had been bold so she determined to be both honest and brave  ive reasonsonly one of which i need mention she answered if its possible i want to change you toward my people and on the moment i can conceive of little i wouldnt do to gain that end  how much better and freer jane felt after that confession she meant to show him that there was one mormon who could play a game or wage a fight in the open  i reckon said lassiter and he laughed  it was the best in her if the most irritating that lassiter always aroused  will you come she looked into his eyes and for the life of her could not quite subdue an imperiousness that rose with her spirit i never asked so much of any manexcept bern venters  pears to me that youd run no risk or venters either but mebbe that doesnt hold good for me  you mean it wouldnt be safe for you to be often here you look for ambush in the cottonwoods  not that so much  at this juncture little fay sidled over to lassiter  has oo a little dirl she inquired  no lassie replied the rider  whatever fay seemed to be searching for in lassiters sunreddened face and quiet eyes she evidently found oo tan tom to see me she added and with that shyness gave place to friendly curiosity first his sombrero with its leather band and silver ornaments commanded her attention next his quirt and then the clinking silver spurs these held her for some time but presently true to childish fickleness she left off playing with them to look for something else she laughed in glee as she ran her little hands down the slippery shiny surface of lassiters leather chaps soon she discovered one of the hanging gunsheaths and she dragged it up and began tugging at the huge black handle of the gun jane withersteen repressed an exclamation what significance there was to her in the little girls efforts to dislodge that heavy weapon jane withersteen saw fays play and her beauty and her love as most powerful allies to her own womans part in a game that suddenly had acquired a strange zest and a hint of danger and as for the rider he appeared to have forgotten jane in the wonder of this lovely child playing about him at first he was much the shyer of the two gradually her confidence overcame his backwardness and he had the temerity to stroke her golden curls with a great hand fay rewarded his boldness with a smile and when he had gone to the extreme of closing that great hand over her little brown one she said simply i like oo  sight of his face then made jane oblivious for the time to his character as a hater of mormons out of the mother longing that swelled her breast she divined the child hunger in lassiter  he returned the next day and the next and upon the following he came both at morning and at night upon the evening of this fourth day jane seemed to feel the breaking of a brooding struggle in lassiter during all these visits he had scarcely a word to say though he watched her and played absentmindedly with fay jane had contented herself with silence soon little fay substituted for the expression of regard i like oo a warmer and more generous one i love oo  thereafter lassiter came oftener to see jane and her little protegee daily he grew more gentle and kind and gradually developed a quaintly merry mood in the morning he lifted fay upon his horse and let her ride as he walked beside her to the edge of the sage in the evening he played with the child at an infinite variety of games she invented and then oftener than not he accepted janes invitation to supper no other visitor came to withersteen house during those days so that in spite of watchfulness he never forgot lassiter began to show he felt at home there after the meal they walked into the grove of cottonwoods or up by the lakes and little fay held lassiters hand as much as she held janes thus a strange relationship was established and jane liked it at twilight they always returned to the house where fay kissed them and went in to her mother lassiter and jane were left alone  then if there were anything that a good woman could do to win a man and still preserve her selfrespect it was something which escaped the natural subtlety of a woman determined to allure janes vanity that after all was not great was soon satisfied with lassiters silent admiration and her honest desire to lead him from his dark bloodstained path would never have blinded her to what she owed herself but the driving passion of her religion and its call to save mormons lives one life in particular bore jane withersteen close to an infringement of her womanhood in the beginning she had reasoned that her appeal to lassiter must be through the senses with whatever means she possessed in the way of adornment she enhanced her beauty and she stooped to artifices that she knew were unworthy of her but which she deliberately chose to employ she made of herself a girl in every variable mood wherein a girl might be desirable in those moods she was not above the methods of an inexperienced though natural flirt she kept close to him whenever opportunity afforded and she was forever playfully yet passionately underneath the surface fighting him for possession of the great black guns these he would never yield to her and so in that manner their hands were often and long in contact the more of simplicity that she sensed in him the greater the advantage she took  she had a trick of changingand it was not altogether voluntaryfrom this gay thoughtless girlish coquettishness to the silence and the brooding burning mystery of a womans mood the strength and passion and fire of her were in her eyes and she so used them that lassiter had to see this depth in her this haunting promise more fitted to her years than to the flaunting guise of a wilful girl  the july days flew by jane reasoned that if it were possible for her to be happy during such a time then she was happy little fay completely filled a long aching void in her heart in fettering the hands of this lassiter she was accomplishing the greatest good of her life and to do good even in a small way rendered happiness to jane withersteen she had attended the regular sunday services of her church otherwise she had not gone to the village for weeks it was unusual that none of her churchmen or friends had called upon her of late but it was neglect for which she was glad judkins and his boy riders had experienced no difficulty in driving the white herd so these warm july days were free of worry and soon jane hoped she had passed the crisis and for her to hope was presently to trust and then to believe she thought often of venters but in a dreamy abstract way she spent hours teaching and playing with little fay and the activity of her mind centered around lassiter the direction she had given her will seemed to blunt any branching off of thought from that straight line the mood came to obsess her  in the end when her awakening came she learned that she had builded better than she knew lassiter though kinder and gentler than ever had parted with his quaint humor and his coldness and his tranquillity to become a restless and unhappy man whatever the power of his deadly intent toward mormons that passion now had a rival the one equally burning and consuming jane withersteen had one moment of exultation before the dawn of a strange uneasiness what if she had made of herself a lure at tremendous cost to him and to her and all in vain  that night in the moonlit grove she summoned all her courage and turning suddenly in the path she faced lassiter and leaned close to him so that she touched him and her eyes looked up to his  lassiter will you do anything for me  in the moonlight she saw his dark worn face change and by that change she seemed to feel him immovable as a wall of stone  jane slipped her hands down to the swinging gunsheaths and when she had locked her fingers around the huge cold handles of the guns she trembled as with a chilling ripple over all her body  may i take your guns  why he asked and for the first time to her his voice carried a harsh note jane felt his hard strong hands close round her wrists it was not wholly with intent that she leaned toward him for the look of his eyes and the feel of his hands made her weak  its no trifleno womans whimits deepas my heart let me take them  why  i want to keep you from killing more menmormons you must let me save you from more wickednessmore wanton bloodshed then the truth forced itself falteringly from her lips you mustlethelp me to keep my vow to milly erne i swore to heras she lay dyingthat if ever any one came here to avenge heri swore i would stay his hand perhaps ii alone can save thethe man whowhooh lassiter i feel that i cant change youthen soon youll be out to killand youll kill by instinctand among the mormons you kill will be the onewho lassiter if you care a little for melet mefor my sakelet me take your guns  as if her hands had been those of a child he unclasped their clinging grip from the handles of his guns and pushing her away he turned his gray face to her in one look of terrible realization and then strode off into the shadows of the cottonwoods  when the first shock of her futile appeal to lassiter had passed jane took his cold silent condemnation and abrupt departure not so much as a refusal to her entreaty as a hurt and stunned bitterness for her attempt at his betrayal upon further thought and slow consideration of lassiters past actions she believed he would return and forgive her the man could not be hard to a woman and she doubted that he could stay away from her but at the point where she had hoped to find him vulnerable she now began to fear he was proof against all persuasion the iron and stone quality that she had early suspected in him had actually cropped out as an impregnable barrier nevertheless if lassiter remained in cottonwoods she would never give up her hope and desire to change him she would change him if she had to sacrifice everything dear to her except hope of heaven passionately devoted as she was to her religion she had yet refused to marry a mormon but a situation had developed wherein self paled in the great white light of religious duty of the highest order that was the leading motive the divinely spiritual one but there were other motives which like tentacles aided in drawing her will to the acceptance of a possible abnegation and through the watches of that sleepless night jane withersteen in fear and sorrow and doubt came finally to believe that if she must throw herself into lassiters arms to make him abide by thou shalt not kill she would yet do well  in the morning she expected lassiter at the usual hour but she was not able to go at once to the court so she sent little fay mrs larkin was ill and required attention it appeared that the mother from the time of her arrival at withersteen house had relaxed and was slowly losing her hold on life jane had believed that absence of worry and responsibility coupled with good nursing and comfort would mend mrs larkins broken health such however was not the case  when jane did get out to the court fay was there alone and at the moment embarking on a dubious voyage down the stonelined amber stream upon a craft of two brooms and a pillow fay was as delightfully wet as she could possibly wish to get  clatter of hoofs distracted fay and interrupted the scolding she was gleefully receiving from jane the sound was not the lightspirited trot that bells made when lassiter rode him into the outer court this was slower and heavier and jane did not recognize in it any of her other horses the appearance of bishop dyer startled jane he dismounted with his rapid jerky motion flung the bridle and as he turned toward the inner court and stalked up on the stone flags his boots rang in his authoritative front and in the red anger unmistakably flaming in his face he reminded jane of her father  is that the larkin pauper he asked bruskly without any greeting to jane  its mrs larkins little girl replied jane slowly  i hear you intend to raise the child  yes  of course you mean to give her mormon bringingup  no  his questions had been swift she was amazed at a feeling that some one else was replying for her  ive come to say a few things to you he stopped to measure her with stern speculative eye  jane withersteen loved this man from earliest childhood she had been taught to revere and love bishops of her church and for ten years bishop dyer had been the closest friend and counselor of her father and for the greater part of that period her own friend and scriptural teacher her interpretation of her creed and her religious activity in fidelity to it her acceptance of mysterious and holy mormon truths were all invested in this bishop bishop dyer as an entity was next to god he was gods mouthpiece to the little mormon community at cottonwoods god revealed himself in secret to this mortal  and jane withersteen suddenly suffered a paralyzing affront to her consciousness of reverence by some strange irresistible twist of thought wherein she saw this bishop as a man and the train of thought hurdled the rising crying protests of that other self whose poise she had lost it was not her bishop who eyed her in curious measurement it was a man who tramped into her presence without removing his hat who had no greeting for her who had no semblance of courtesy in looks as in action he made her think of a bull stamping crossgrained into a corral she had heard of bishop dyer forgetting the minister in the fury of a common man and now she was to feel it the glance by which she measured him in turn momentarily veiled the divine in the ordinary he looked a rancher he was booted spurred and covered with dust he carried a gun at his hip and she remembered that he had been known to use it but during the long moment while he watched her there was nothing commonplace in the slowgathering might of his wrath  brother tull has talked to me he began it was your fathers wish that you marry tull and my order you refused him  yes  you would not give up your friendship with that tramp venters  no  but youll do as i order he thundered why jane withersteen you are in danger of becoming a heretic you can thank your gentile friends for that you face the damning of your soul to perdition  in the flux and reflux of the whirling torture of janes mind that new daring spirit of hers vanished in the old habitual order of her life she was a mormon and the bishop regained ascendance  its well i got you in time jane withersteen what would your father have said to these goingson of yours he would have put you in a stone cage on bread and water he would have taught you something about mormonism remember youre a born mormon there have been mormons who turned hereticdamn their soulsbut no born mormon ever left us yet ah i see your shame your faith is not shaken you are only a wild girl the bishops tone softened well its enough that i got to you in time now tell me about this lassiter i hear strange things  what do you wish to know queried jane  about this man you hired him  yes hes riding for me when my riders left me i had to have any one i could get  is it true what i hearthat hes a gunman a mormonhater steeped in blood  trueterribly true i fear  but whats he doing here in cottonwoods this place isnt notorious enough for such a man sterling and the villages north where theres universal gunpacking and fights every daywhere there are more men like him it seems to me they would attract him most were only a wild lonely border settlement its only recently that the rustlers have made killings here nor have there been saloons till lately nor the drifting in of outcasts has not this gunman some special mission here  jane maintained silence  tell me ordered bishop dyer sharply  yes she replied  do you know what it is  yes  tell me that  bishop dyer i dont want to tell  he waved his hand in an imperative gesture of command the red once more leaped to his face and in his steelblue eyes glinted a pinpoint of curiosity  that first day whispered jane lassiter said he came here to findmilly ernes grave  with downcast eyes jane watched the swift flow of the amber water she saw it and tried to think of it of the stones of the ferns but like her body her mind was in a leaden vise only the bishops voice could release her seemingly there was silence of longer duration than all her former life  for whatelse when bishop dyers voice did cleave the silence it was high curiously shrill and on the point of breaking it released janes tongue but she could not lift her eyes  to kill the man who persuaded milly erne to abandon her home and her husbandand her god  with wonderful distinctness jane withersteen heard her own clear voice she heard the water murmur at her feet and flow on to the sea she heard the rushing of all the waters in the world they filled her ears with low unreal murmuringsthese sounds that deadened her brain and yet could not break the long and terrible silence then from somewherefrom an immeasurable distancecame a slow guarded clinking clanking step into her it shot electrifying life it released the weight upon her numbed eyelids lifting her eyes she sawashen shaken strickennot the bishop but the man and beyond him from round the corner came that soft silvery step a long black boot with a gleaming spur swept into sightand then lassiter bishop dyer did not see did not hear he stared at jane in the throes of sudden revelation  ah i understand he cried in hoarse accents thats why you made love to this lassiterto bind his hands  it was janes gaze riveted upon the rider that made bishop dyer turn then clear sight failed her dizzily in a blur she saw the bishops hand jerk to his hip she saw gleam of blue and spout of red in her ears burst a thundering report the court floated in darkening circles around her and she fell into utter blackness  the darkness lightened turned to slowdrifting haze and lifted through a thin film of blue smoke she saw the roughhewn timbers of the court roof a cool damp touch moved across her brow she smelled powder and it was that which galvanized her suspended thought she moved to see that she lay prone upon the stone flags with her head on lassiters knee and he was bathing her brow with water from the stream the same swift glance shifting low brought into range of her sight a smoking gun and splashes of blood  ahh she moaned and was drifting sinking again into darkness when lassiters voice arrested her  its all right jane its all right  didyoukillhim she whispered  who that fat party who was here no i didnt kill him  oh lassiter  say it was queer for you to faint i thought you were such a strong woman not faintish like that youre all right nowonly some pale i thought youd never come to but im awkward round women folks i couldnt think of anythin  lassiter the gun there the blood  so thats troublin you i reckon it neednt you see it was this way i come round the house an seen that fat party an heard him talkin loud then he seen me an very impolite goes straight for his gun he oughtnt have tried to throw a gun on mewhatever his reason was for thats meetin me on my own grounds ive seen runnin molasses that was quicker n him now i didnt know who he was visitor or friend or relation of yours though i seen he was a mormon all over an i couldnt get serious about shootin so i winged himput a bullet through his arm as he was pullin at his gun an he dropped the gun there an a little blood i told him hed introduced himself sufficient an to please move out of my vicinity an he went  lassiter spoke with slow cool soothing voice in which there was a hint of levity and his touch as he continued to bathe her brow was gentle and steady his impassive face and the kind gray eyes further stilled her agitation  he drew on you first and you deliberately shot to cripple himyou wouldnt kill himyoulassiter  thats about the size of it  jane kissed his hand  all that was calm and cool about lassiter instantly vanished  dont do that i wont stand it an i dont care a damn who that fat party was  he helped jane to her feet and to a chair then with the wet scarf he had used to bathe her face he wiped the blood from the stone flags and picking up the gun he threw it upon a couch with that he began to pace the court and his silver spurs jangled musically and the great gunsheaths softly brushed against his leather chaps  soits truewhat i heard him say lassiter asked presently halting before her you made love to meto bind my hands  yes confessed jane it took all her womans courage to meet the gray storm of his glance  all these days that youve been so friendly an like a pardnerall these evenins that have been so bewilderin to meyour beautyanan the way you looked an came close to methey were womans tricks to bind my hands  yes  an your sweetness that seemed so natural an your throwin little fay an me so much togetherto make me love the childall that was for the same reason  yes  lassiter flung his armsa strange gesture for him  mebbe it wasnt much in your mormon thinkin for you to play that game but to ring the child inthat was hellish  janes passionate unheeding zeal began to loom darkly  lassiter whatever my intention in the beginning fay loves you dearlyand iive grown toto like you  thats powerful kind of you now he said sarcasm and scorn made his voice that of a stranger an you sit there an look me straight in the eyes youre a wonderful strange woman jane withersteen  im not ashamed lassiter i told you id try to change you  would you mind tellin me just what you tried  i tried to make you see beauty in me and be softened by it i wanted you to care for me so that i could influence you it wasnt easy at first you were stoneblind then i hoped youd love little fay and through that come to feel the horror of making children fatherless  jane withersteen either youre a fool or noble beyond my understandin mebbe youre both i know youre blind what you meant is one thingwhat you did was to make me love you  lassiter  i reckon im a human bein though i never loved any one but my sister milly erne that was long  oh are you millys brother  yes i was an i loved her there never was any one but her in my life till now didnt i tell you that long ago i backtrailed myself from women

very word if i were free  but youre not free not free of mormonism an in playin this game with me youve been unfaithful  unfaithful faltered jane  yes i said unfaithful youre faithful to your bishop an unfaithful to yourself youre false to your womanhood an true to your religion but for a savin innocence youd have made yourself low an vilebetrayin yourself betrayin meall to bind my hands an keep me from snuffin out mormon life its your damned mormon blindness  is it vileis it blindis it only mormonism to save human life no lassiter thats gods law divine universal for all christians  the blindness i mean is blindness that keeps you from seein the truth ive known many good mormons but some are blacker than hell you wont see that even when you know it else why all this blind passion to save the life of thatthat  jane shut out the light and the hands she held over her eyes trembled and quivered against her face  blindyes en let me make it clear en simple to you lassiter went on his voice losing its tone of anger take for instance that idea of yours last night when you wanted my guns it was good an beautiful an showed your heartbutwhy jane it was crazy mind im assumin that life to me is as sweet as to any other man an to preserve that life is each mans first an closest thought where would any man be on this border without guns where especially would lassiter be well id be under the sage with thousands of other men now livin an sure better men than me gunpackin in the west since the civil war has growed into a kind of moral law an out here on this border its the difference between a man an somethin not a man look what your takin venterss guns from him all but made him why your churchmen carry guns tull has killed a man an drawed on others your bishop has shot a half dozen men an it wasnt through prayers of his that they recovered an today hed have shot me if hed been quick enough on the draw could i walk or ride down into cottonwoods without my guns this is a wild time jane withersteen this year of our lord eighteen seventyone  no timefor a woman exclaimed jane brokenly oh lassiter i feel helplesslostand dont know where to turn if i am blindtheni need some onea friendyou lassitermore than ever  well i didnt say nothin about goin back on you did i    chapter xii the invisible hand  jane received a letter from bishop dyer not in his own handwriting which stated that the abrupt termination of their interview had left him in some doubt as to her future conduct a slight injury had incapacitated him from seeking another meeting at present the letter went on to say and ended with a request which was virtually a command that she call upon him at once  the reading of the letter acquainted jane withersteen with the fact that something within her had all but changed she sent no reply to bishop dyer nor did she go to see him on sunday she remained absent from the servicefor the second time in yearsand though she did not actually suffer there was a deadlock of feelings deep within her and the waiting for a balance to fall on either side was almost as bad as suffering she had a gloomy expectancy of untoward circumstances and with it a keenedged curiosity to watch developments she had a halfformed conviction that her future conductas related to her churchmenwas beyond her control and would be governed by their attitude toward her something was changing in her forming waiting for decision to make it a real and fixed thing she had told lassiter that she felt helpless and lost in the fateful tangle of their lives and now she feared that she was approaching the same chaotic condition of mind in regard to her religion it appalled her to find that she questioned phases of that religion absolute faith had been her serenity though leaving her faith unshaken her serenity had been disturbed and now it was broken by open war between her and her ministers that something within hera whisperwhich she had tried in vain to hush had become a ringing voice and it called to her to wait she had transgressed no laws of god her churchmen however invested with the power and the glory of a wonderful creed however they sat in inexorable judgment of her must now practice toward her the simple common christian virtue they professed to preach do unto others as you would have others do unto you  jane withersteen waiting in darkness of mind remained faithful still but it was darkness that must soon be pierced by light if her faith were justified if her churchmen were trying only to intimidate her the fact would soon be manifest as would their failure and then she would redouble her zeal toward them and toward what had been the best work of her lifework for the welfare and happiness of those among whom she lived mormon and gentile alike if that secret intangible power closed its coils round her again if that great invisible hand moved here and there and everywhere slowly paralyzing her with its mystery and its inconceivable sway over her affairs then she would know beyond doubt that it was not chance nor jealousy nor intimidation nor ministerial wrath at her revolt but a cold and calculating policy thought out long before she was born a dark immutable will of whose empire she and all that was hers was but an atom  then might come her ruin then might come her fall into black storm yet she would rise again and to the light god would be merciful to a driven woman who had lost her way  a week passed little fay played and prattled and pulled at lassiters big black guns the rider came to withersteen house oftener than ever jane saw a change in him though it did not relate to his kindness and gentleness he was quieter and more thoughtful while playing with fay or conversing with jane he seemed to be possessed of another self that watched with cool roving eyes that listened listened always as if the murmuring amber stream brought messages and the moving leaves whispered something lassiter never rode bells into the court any more nor did he come by the lane or the paths when he appeared it was suddenly and noiselessly out of the dark shadow of the grove  i left bells out in the sage he said one day at the end of that week i must carry water to him  why not let him drink at the trough or here asked jane quickly  i reckon itll be safer for me to slip through the grove ive been watched when i rode in from the sage  watched by whom  by a man who thought he was well hid but my eyes are pretty sharp an jane he went on almost in a whisper i reckon itd be a good idea for us to talk low youre spied on here by your women  lassiter she whispered in turn thats hard to believe my women love me  what of that he asked of course they love you but theyre mormon women  janes old rebellious loyalty clashed with her doubt  i wont believe it she replied stubbornly  well then just act natural an talk natural an pretty soongive them time to hear uspretend to go over there to the table en then quicklike make a move for the door en open it  i will said jane with heightened color lassiter was right he never made mistakes he would not have told her unless he positively knew yet jane was so tenacious of faith that she had to see with her own eyes and so constituted that to employ even such small deceit toward her women made her ashamed and angry for her shame as well as theirs then a singular thought confronted her that made her hold up this simple rusewhich hurt her though it was well justifiedagainst the deceit she had wittingly and eagerly used toward lassiter the difference was staggering in its suggestion of that blindness of which he had accused her fairness and justice and mercy that she had imagined were anchorcables to hold fast her soul to righteousness had not been hers in the strange biased duty that had so exalted and confounded her  presently jane began to act her little part to laugh and play with fay to talk of horses and cattle to lassiter then she made deliberate mention of a book in which she kept records of all pertaining to her stock and she walked slowly toward the table and when near the door she suddenly whirled and thrust it open her sharp action nearly knocked down a woman who had undoubtedly been listening  hester said jane sternly you may go home and you need not come back  jane shut the door and returned to lassiter standing unsteadily she put her hand on his arm she let him see that doubt had gone and how this stab of disloyalty pained her  spies my own women oh miserable she cried with flashing tearful eyes  i hate to tell you he replied by that she knew he had long spared her its begun againthat work in the dark  nay lassiterit never stopped  so bitter certainty claimed her at last and trust fled withersteen house and fled forever the women who owed much to jane withersteen changed not in love for her nor in devotion to their household work but they poisoned both by a thousand acts of stealth and cunning and duplicity jane broke out once and caught them in strange stonefaced unhesitating falsehood thereafter she broke out no more she forgave them because they were driven poor fettered and sealed hagars how she pitied them what terrible thing bound them and locked their lips when they showed neither consciousness of guilt toward their benefactress nor distress at the slow wearing apart of longestablished and dear ties  the blindness again cried jane withersteen in my sisters as in me o god  there came a time when no words passed between jane and her women silently they went about their household duties and secretly they went about the underhand work to which they had been bidden the gloom of the house and the gloom of its mistress which darkened even the bright spirit of little fay did not pervade these women happiness was not among them but they were aloof from gloom they spied and listened they received and sent secret messengers and they stole janes books and records and finally the papers that were deeds of her possessions through it all they were silent rapt in a kind of trance then one by one without leave or explanation or farewell they left withersteen house and never returned  coincident with this disappearance janes gardeners and workers in the alfalfa fields and stable men quit her not even asking for their wages of all her mormon employees about the great ranch only jerd remained he went on with his duty but talked no more of the change than if it had never occurred  jerd said jane what stock you cant take care of turn out in the sage let your first thought be for black star and night keep them in perfect condition run them every day and watch them always  though jane withersteen gave them such liberality she loved her possessions she loved the rich green stretches of alfalfa and the farms and the grove and the old stone house and the beautiful everfaithful amber spring and every one of a myriad of horses and colts and burros and fowls down to the smallest rabbit that nipped her vegetables but she loved best her noble arabian steeds in common with all riders of the upland sage jane cherished two material thingsthe cold sweet brown water that made life possible in the wilderness and the horses which were a part of that life when lassiter asked her what lassiter would be without his guns he was assuming that his horse was part of himself so jane loved black star and night because it was her nature to love all beautiful creaturesperhaps all living things and then she loved them because she herself was of the sage and in her had been born and bred the riders instinct to rely on his fourfooted brother and when jane gave jerd the order to keep her favorites trained down to the day it was a halfconscious admission that presaged a time when she would need her fleet horses  jane had now however no leisure to brood over the coils that were closing round her mrs larkin grew weaker as the august days began she required constant care there was little fay to look after and such household work as was imperative lassiter put bells in the stable with the other racers and directed his efforts to a closer attendance upon jane she welcomed the change he was always at hand to help and it was her fortune to learn that his boast of being awkward around women had its root in humility and was not true  his great brown hands were skilled in a multiplicity of ways which a woman might have envied he shared janes work and was of especial help to her in nursing mrs larkin the woman suffered most at night and this often broke janes rest so it came about that lassiter would stay by mrs larkin during the day when she needed care and jane would make up the sleep she lost in nightwatches mrs larkin at once took kindly to the gentle lassiter and without ever asking who or what he was praised him to jane hes a good man and loves children she said how sad to hear this truth spoken of a man whom jane thought lost beyond all redemption yet ever and ever lassiter towered above her and behind or through his black sinister figure shone something luminous that strangely affected jane good and evil began to seem incomprehensibly blended in her judgment it was her belief that evil could not come forth from good yet here was a murderer who dwarfed in gentleness patience and love any man she had ever known  she had almost lost track of her more outside concerns when early one morning judkins presented himself before her in the courtyard  thin hard burnt bearded with the dust and sage thick on him with his leather wristbands shining from use and his boots worn through on the stirrup side he looked the rider of riders he wore two guns and carried a winchester  jane greeted him with surprise and warmth set meat and bread and drink before him and called lassiter out to see him the men exchanged glances and the meaning of lassiters keen inquiry and judkinss bold reply both unspoken was not lost upon jane  wheres your hoss asked lassiter aloud  left him down the slope answered judkins i footed it in a ways an slept last night in the sage i went to the place you told me you moss always slept but didnt strike you  i moved up some near the spring an now i go there nights  judkinsthe white herd queried jane hurriedly  miss withersteen i make proud to say ive not lost a steer fer a good while after thet stampede lassiter milled we hed no trouble why even the sage dogs left us but its begun aginthet flashin of lights over ridge tips an queer puffin of smoke en then at night strange whistles en noises but the herds acted magnificent an my boys say miss withersteen theyre only kids but i ask no better riders i got the laugh in the village fer takin them out theyre a wild lot an you know boys hev more nerve than grown men because they dont know what danger is im not denyin theres danger but they glory in it an mebbe i like it myselfanyway well stick were goin to drive the herd on the far side of the first break of deception pass theres a great round valley over there an no ridges or piles of rocks to aid these stampeders the rains are due well hev plenty of water fer a while an we can hold thet herd from anybody except oldrin i come in fer supplies ill pack a couple of burros an drive out after dark tonight  judkins take what you want from the storeroom lassiter will help you ii cant thank you enough butwait  jane went to the room that had once been her fathers and from a secret chamber in the thick stone wall she took a bag of gold and carrying it back to the court she gave it to the rider  there judkins and understand that i regard it as little for your loyalty give what is fair to your boys and keep the rest hide it perhaps that would be wisest  oh miss withersteen ejaculated the rider i couldnt earn so much inin ten years its not righti oughtnt take it  judkins you know im a rich woman i tell you ive few faithful friends ive fallen upon evil days god only knows what will become of me and mine so take the gold  she smiled in understanding of his speechless gratitude and left him with lassiter presently she heard him speaking low at first then in louder accents emphasized by the thumping of his rifle on the stones as infernal a job as even you lassiter ever heerd of  why son was lassiters reply this breakin of miss withersteen may seem bad to you but it aint badyet some of these walleyed fellers who look jest as if they was walkin in the shadow of christ himself right down the sunny road now they can think of things en do things that are really hellbent  jane covered her ears and ran to her own room and there like caged lioness she paced to and fro till the coming of little fay reversed her dark thoughts  the following day a warm and muggy one threatening rain awhile jane was resting in the court a horseman clattered through the grove and up to the hitchingrack he leaped off and approached jane with the manner of a man determined to execute difficult mission yet fearful of its reception in the gaunt wiry figure and the lean brown face jane recognized one of her mormon riders blake it was he of whom judkins had long since spoken of all the riders ever in her employ blake owed her the most and as he stepped before her removing his hat and making manly efforts to subdue his emotion he showed that he remembered  miss withersteen mothers dead he said  ohblake exclaimed jane and she could say no more  she died free from pain in the end and shes buriedresting at last thank god ive come to ride for you again if youll have me dont think i mentioned mother to get your sympathy when she was living and your riders quit i had to also i was afraid of what might be donesaid to her miss withersteen we cant talk ofof

wouldnt if i were you and ii mustsomething makes me tell you the worst is yet to come thats all i absolutely cant say more will you take me backlet me ride for youshow everybody what i mean  blake it makes me happy to hear you how my riders hurt me when they quit jane felt the hot tears well to her eyes and splash down upon her hands i thought so much of themtried so hard to be good to them and not one was true youve made it easy to forgive perhaps many of them really feel as you do but dare not return to me still blake i hesitate to take you back yet i want you so much  do it then if youre going to make your life a lesson to mormon women let me make mine a lesson to the men right is right i believe in you and heres my life to prove it  you hint it may mean your life said jane breathless and low  we wont speak of that i want to come back i want to do what every rider aches in his secret heart to do for you miss withersteen i hoped itd not be necessary to tell you that my mother on her deathbed told me to have courage she knew how the thing galled meshe told me to come back will you take me  god bless you blake yes ill take you back and will youwill you accept gold from me  miss withersteen  i just gave judkins a bag of gold ill give you one if you will not take it you must not come back you might ride for me a few monthsweeksdays till the storm breaks then youd have nothing and be in disgrace with your people well forearm you against poverty and me against endless regret ill give you gold which you can hidetill some future time  well if it pleases you replied blake but you know i never thought of pay now miss withersteen one thing more i want to see this man lassiter is he here  yes but blakewhatneed you see him why asked jane instantly worried i can speak to himtell him about you  that wont do i want toive got to tell him myself where is he  lassiter is with mrs larkin she is ill ill call him answered jane and going to the door she softly called for the rider a faint musical jingle preceded his stepthen his tall form crossed the threshold  lassiter heres blake an old rider of mine he has come back to me and he wishes to speak to you  blakes brown face turned exceedingly pale  yes i had to speak to you he said swiftly my names blake im a mormon and a rider lately i quit miss withersteen ive come to beg her to take me back now i dont know you but i knowwhat you are so ive this to say to your face it would never occur to this woman to imaginelet alone suspect me to be a spy she couldnt think it might just be a low plot to come here and shoot you in the back jane withersteen hasnt that kind of a mind well ive not come for that i want to help herto pull a bridle along with judkins andand you the thing isdo you believe me  i reckon i do replied lassiter how this slow cool speech contrasted with blakes hot impulsive words you might have saved some of your breath see here blake cinch this in your mind lassiter has met some square mormons an mebbe  blake interrupted jane nervously anxious to terminate a colloquy that she perceived was an ordeal for him go at once and fetch me a report of my horses  miss withersteen you mean the big drovedown in the sagecleared fields  of course replied jane my horses are all there except the blooded stock i keep here  havent you heardthen  heard no whats happened to them  theyre gone miss withersteen gone these ten days past dorn told me and i rode down to see for myself  lassiterdid you know asked jane whirling to him  i reckon so but what was the use to tell you  it was lassiter turning away his face and blake studying the stone flags at his feet that brought jane to the understanding of what she betrayed she strove desperately but she could not rise immediately from such a blow  my horses my horses whats become of them  dorn said the riders report another drive by oldring and i trailed the horses miles down the slope toward deception pass  my red herds gone my horses gone the white herd will go next i can stand that but if i lost black star and night it would be like parting with my own flesh and blood lassiterblakeam i in danger of losing my racers  a rustleroror anybody stealin hosses of yours would most of all want the blacks said lassiter his evasive reply was affirmative enough the other rider nodded gloomy acquiescence  oh oh jane withersteen choked with violent utterance  let me take charge of the blacks asked blake one more rider wont be any great help to judkins but i might hold black star and night if you put such store on their value  value blake i love my racers besides theres another reason why i mustnt lose them you go to the stables go with jerd every day when he runs the horses and dont let them out of your sight if you would please mewin my gratitude guard my black racers  when blake had mounted and ridden out of the court lassiter regarded jane with the smile that was becoming rarer as the days sped by  pears to me as blake says you do put some store on them hosses now i aint gainsayin that the arabians are the handsomest hosses i ever seen but bells can beat night an run neck en neck with black star  lassiter dont tease me now im miserablesick bells is fast but he cant stay with the blacks and you know it only wrangle can do that  ill bet that big rawboned brute can moren show his heels to your black racers jane out there in the sage on a long chase wrangle could kill your favorites  no no replied jane impatiently lassiter why do you say that so often i know youve teased me at times and i believe its only kindness youre always trying to keep my mind off worry but you mean more by this repeated mention of my racers  i reckon so lassiter paused and for the thousandth time in her presence moved his black sombrero round and round as if counting the silver pieces on the band well jane ive sort of read a little thats passin in your mind  you think i might fly from my homefrom cottonwoodsfrom the utah border  i reckon an if you ever do an get away with the blacks i wouldnt like to see wrangle left here on the sage wrangle could catch you i know venters had him but you can never tell mebbe he hasnt got him now besidesthings are happenin an somethin of the same queer nature might have happened to venters  god knows youre right poor bern how long hes gone in my trouble ive been forgetting him but lassiter ive little fear for him ive heard my riders say hes as keen as a wolf as to your reading my thoughtswell your suggestion makes an actual thought of what was only one of my dreams i believe i dreamed of flying from this wild borderland lassiter ive strange dreams im not always practical and thinking of my many duties as you said once for instanceif i daredif i dared id ask you to saddle the blacks and ride away with meand hide me  jane  the riders sunburnt face turned white a few times jane had seen lassiters cool calm brokenwhen he had met little fay when he had learned how and why he had come to love both child and mistress when he had stood beside milly ernes grave but one and all they could not be considered in the light of his present agitation not only did lassiter turn whitenot only did he grow tense not only did he lose his coolness but also he suddenly violently hungrily took her into his arms and crushed her to his breast  lassiter cried jane trembling it was an action for which she took sole blame instantly as if dazed weakened he released her forgive me went on jane im always forgetting youryour feelings i thought of you as my faithful friend im always making you out more than human only let me sayi meant thatabout riding away im wretched sick of thisthisoh something bitter and black grows on my heart  jane the hellof it he replied with deep intake of breath is you cant ride away mebbe realizin it accounts for my grabbin youthat way as much as the crazy boys rapture your words gave me i dont understand myself but the hell of this game isyou cant ride away  lassiter what on earth do you mean im an absolutely free woman  you aint absolutely anythin of the kind i reckon ive got to tell you  tell me all its uncertainty that makes me a coward its faith and hopeblind love if you will that makes me miserable every day i awake believingstill believing the day grows and with it doubts fears and that black bat hate that bites hotter and hotter into my heart then comes nighti prayi pray for all and for myselfi sleepand i awake free once more trustful faithful to believeto hope then o my god i grow and live a thousand years till night again but if you want to see me a woman tell me why i cant ride awaytell me what more im to losetell me the worst  jane youre watched theres no single move of yours except when youre hid in your house that aint seen by sharp eyes the cottonwood groves full of creepin crawlin men like indians in the grass when you rode which wasnt often lately the sage was full of sneakin men at night they crawl under your windows into the court an i reckon into the house jane withersteen you know never locked a door this here groves a hummin beehive of mysterious happenins jane it aint so much that these soles keep out of my way as me keepin out of theirs theyre goin to try to kill me thats plain but mebbe im as hard to shoot in the back as in the face so far ive seen fit to watch only this all means jane that youre a marked woman you cant get awaynot now mebbe later when youre broken you might but thats sure doubtful jane youre to lose the cattle thats leftyour home en ranchen amber spring you cant even hide a sack of gold for it couldnt be slipped out of the house day or night an hid or buried let alone be rid off with you may lose all im tellin you jane hopin to prepare you if the worst does come i told you once before about that strange power ive got to feel things  lassiter what can i do  nothin i reckon except know whats comin an wait an be game if youd let me make a call on tull an a longdeferred call on  hush hush she whispered  well even that wouldnt help you any in the end  what does it mean oh what does it mean i am my fathers daughtera mormon yet i cant see ive not failed in religionin duty for years ive given with a free and full heart when my father died i was rich if im still rich its because i couldnt find enough ways to become poor what am i what are my possessions to set in motion such intensity of secret oppression  jane the mind behind it all is an empire builder  but lassiter i would give freelyall i own to avert thisthis wretched thing if i gavethat would leave me with faith still surely mymy churchmen think of my soul if i lose my trust in them  child be still said lassiter with a dark dignity that had in it something of pity you are a woman fine en big an strong an your heart matches your size but in mind youre a child ill say a little morethen im done ill never mention this again among many thousands of women youre one who has bucked against your churchmen they tried you out an failed of persuasion an finally of threats you meet now the cold steel of a will as far from christlike as the universe is wide youre to be broken your bodys to be held given to some man made if possible to bring children into the world but your soul what do they care for your soul    chapter xiii solitude and storm  in his hidden valley venters awakened from sleep and his ears rang with innumerable melodies from fullthroated mockingbirds and his eyes opened wide upon the glorious golden shaft of sunlight shining through the great stone bridge the circle of cliffs surrounding surprise valley lay shrouded in morning mist a dim blue low down along the terraces a creamy moving cloud along the ramparts the oak forest in the center was a plumed and tufted oval of gold  he saw bess under the spruces upon her complete recovery of strength she always rose with the dawn at the moment she was feeding the quail she had tamed and she had begun to tame the mockingbirds they fluttered among the branches overhead and some left off their songs to flit down and shyly hop near the twittering quail little gray and white rabbits crouched in the grass now nibbling now laying long ears flat and watching the dogs  venterss swift glance took in the brightening valley and bess and her pets and ring and whitie it swept over all to return again and rest upon the girl she had changed to the dark trousers and blouse she had added moccasins of her own make but she no longer resembled a boy no eye could have failed to mark the rounded contours of a woman the change had been to grace and beauty a glint of warm gold gleamed from her hair and a tint of red shone in the clear dark brown of cheeks the haunting sweetness of her lips and eyes that earlier had been illusive a promise had become a living fact she fitted harmoniously into that wonderful setting she was like surprise valleywild and beautiful  venters leaped out of his cave to begin the day  he had postponed his journey to cottonwoods until after the passing of the summer rains the rains were due soon but until their arrival and the necessity for his trip to the village he sequestered in a far corner of mind all thought of peril of his past life and almost that of the present it was enough to live he did not want to know what lay hidden in the dim and distant future surprise valley had enchanted him in this home of the cliffdwellers there were peace and quiet and solitude and another thing wondrous as the golden morning shaft of sunlight that he dared not ponder over long enough to understand  the solitude he had hated when alone he had now come to love he was assimilating something from this valley of gleams and shadows from this strange girl he was assimilating more  the day at hand resembled many days gone before as venters had no tools with which to build or to till the terraces he remained idle beyond the cooking of the simple fare there were no tasks and as there were no tasks there was no system he and bess began one thing to leave it to begin another to leave that and then do nothing but lie under the spruces and watch the great cloudsails majestically move along the ramparts and dream and dream the valley was a golden sunlit world it was silent the sighing wind and the twittering quail and the singing birds even the rare and seldomoccurring hollow crack of a sliding weathered stone only thickened and deepened that insulated silence  venters and bess had vagrant minds  bess did i tell you about my horse wrangle inquired venters  a hundred times she replied  oh have i id forgotten i want you to see him hell carry us both  id like to ride him can he run  run hes a demon swiftest horse on the sage i hope hell stay in that canyon  hell stay  they left camp to wander along the terraces into the aspen ravines under the gleaming walls ring and whitie wandered in the fore often turning often trotting back openmouthed and solemneyed and happy venters lifted his gaze to the grand archway over the entrance to the valley and bess lifted hers to follow his and both were silent sometimes the bridge held their attention for a long time today a soaring eagle attracted them  how he sails exclaimed bess i wonder where his mate is  shes at the nest its on the bridge in a crack near the top i see her often shes almost white  they wandered on down the terrace into the shady sunflecked forest a brown bird fluttered crying from a bush bess peeped into the leaves look a nest and four little birds theyre not afraid of us see how they open their mouths theyre hungry  rabbits rustled the dead brush and pattered away the forest was full of a drowsy hum of insects little darts of purple that were running quail crossed the glades and a plaintive sweet peeping came from the coverts besss soft step disturbed a sleeping lizard that scampered away over the leaves she gave chase and caught it a slim creature of nameless color but of exquisite beauty  jewel eyes she said its like a rabbitafraid we wont eat you therego  murmuring water drew their steps down into a shallow shaded ravine where a brown brook brawled softly over mossy stones multitudes of strange gray frogs with white spots and black eyes lined the rocky bank and leaped only at close approach then venterss eye descried a very thin very long green snake coiled round a sapling they drew closer and closer till they could have touched it the snake had no fear and watched them with scintillating eyes  its pretty said bess how tame i thought snakes always ran  no even the rabbits didnt run here till the dogs chased them  on and on they wandered to the wild jumble of massed and broken fragments of cliff at the west end of the valley the roar of the disappearing stream dinned in their ears into this maze of rocks they threaded a tortuous way climbing descending halting to gather wild plums and great lavender lilies and going on at the will of fancy idle and keen perceptions guided them equally  oh let us climb there cried bess pointing upward to a small space of terrace left green and shady between huge abutments of broken cliff and they climbed to the nook and rested and looked out across the valley to the curling column of blue smoke from their campfire but the cool shade and the rich grass and the fine view were not what they had climbed for they could not have told although whatever had drawn them was wellsatisfying light surefooted as a mountain goat bess pattered down at venterss heels and they went on calling the dogs eyes dreamy and wide listening to the wind and the bees and the crickets and the birds  part of the time ring and whitie led the way then venters then bess and the direction was not an object they left the sunstreaked shade of the oaks brushed the long grass of the meadows entered the green and fragrant swaying willows to stop at length under the huge old cottonwoods where the beavers were busy  here they rested and watched a dam of brush and logs and mud and stones backed the stream into a little lake the round rough beaver houses projected from the water like the rabbits the beavers had become shy gradually however as venters and bess knelt low holding the dogs the beavers emerged to swim with logs and gnaw at cottonwoods and pat mud walls with their paddlelike tails and glossy and shiny in the sun to go on with their strange persistent industry they were the builders the lake was a mudhole and the immediate environment a scarred and dead region but it was a wonderful home of wonderful animals  look at that onehe puddles in the mud said bess and there see him dive hear them gnawing id think theyd break their teeth hows it they can stay out of the water and under the water  and she laughed  then venters and bess wandered farther and perhaps not all unconsciously this time wended their slow steps to the cave of the cliffdwellers where she liked best to go  the tangled thicket and the long slant of dust and little chips of weathered rock and the steep bench of stone and the worn steps all were arduous work for bess in the climbing but she gained the shelf gasping hot of cheek glad of eye with her hand in venterss here they rested the beautiful valley glittered below with its millions of windturned leaves brightfaced in the sun and the mighty bridge towered heavenward crowned with blue sky bess however never rested for long soon she was exploring and venters followed she dragged forth from corners and shelves a multitude of crudely fashioned and painted pieces of pottery and he carried them they peeped down into the dark holes of the kivas and bess gleefully dropped a stone and waited for the longcoming hollow sound to rise they peeped into the little globular houses like mudwasp nests and wondered if these had been storeplaces for grain or baby cribs or what and they crawled into the larger houses and laughed when they bumped their heads on the low roofs and they dug in the dust of the floors and they brought from dust and darkness armloads of treasure which they carried to the light flints and stones and strange curved sticks and pottery they found and twisted grass rope that crumbled in their hands and bits of whitish stone which crushed to powder at a touch and seemed to vanish in the air  that white stuff was bone said venters slowly bones of a cliffdweller  no exclaimed bess  heres another piece look whew dry powdery smoke thats bone  then it was that venterss primitive childlike mood like a savages seeing yet unthinking gave way to the encroachment of civilized thought the world had not been made for a single days play or fancy or idle watching the world was old nowhere could be gotten a better idea of its age than in this gigantic silent tomb the gray ashes in venterss hand had once been bone of a human being like himself the pale gloom of the cave had shadowed people long ago he saw that bess had received the same shockcould not in moments such as this escape her feeling living thinking destiny  bern people have lived here she said with wide thoughtful eyes  yes he replied  how long ago  a thousand years and more  what were they  cliffdwellers men who had enemies and made their homes high out of reach  they had to fight  yes  they fought forwhat  for life for their homes food children parentsfor their women  has the world changed any in a thousand years  i dont knowperhaps a little  have men  i hope soi think so  things crowd into my mind she went on and the wistful light in her eyes told venters the truth of her thoughts ive ridden the border of utah ive seen peopleknow how they livebut they must be few of all who are living i had my books and i studied them but all that doesnt help me any more i want to go out into the big world and see it yet i want to stay here more whats to become of us are we cliffdwellers were alone here im happy when i dont think thesethese bones that fly into dustthey make me sick and a little afraid did the people who lived here once have the same feelings as we have what was the good of their living at all theyre gone whats the meaning of it allof us  bess you ask more than i can tell its beyond me only there was laughter here onceand now theres silence there was lifeand now theres death men cut these little steps made these arrowheads and mealingstones plaited the ropes we found and left their bones to crumble in our fingers as far as time is concerned it might all have been yesterday were here today maybe were higher in the scale of human beingsin intelligence but who knows we cant be any higher in the things for which life is lived at all  what are they  whyi suppose relationship friendshiplove  love  yes love of man for womanlove of woman for man thats the nature the meaning the best of life itself  she said no more wistfulness of glance deepened into sadness  come let us go said venters  action brightened her beside him holding his hand she slipped down the shelf ran down the long steep slant of sliding stones out of the cloud of dust and likewise out of the pale gloom  we beat the slide she cried  the miniature avalanche cracked and roared and rattled itself into an inert mass at the base of the incline yellow dust like the gloom of the cave but not so changeless drifted away on the wind the roar clapped in echo from the cliff returned went back and came again to die in the hollowness down on the sunny terrace there was a different atmosphere ring and whitie leaped around bess once more she was smiling gay and thoughtless with the dreammood in the shadow of her eyes  bess i havent seen that since last summer look said venters pointing to the scalloped edge of rolling purple clouds that peeped over the western wall were in for a storm  oh i hope not im afraid of storms  are you why  have you ever been down in one of these walledup pockets in a bad storm  no now i think of it i havent  well its terrible every summer i get scared to death and hide somewhere in the dark storms up on the sage are bad but nothing to what they are down here in the canyons and in this little valleywhy echoes can rap back and forth so quick theyll split our ears  were perfectly safe here bess  i know but that hasnt anything to do with it the truth is im afraid of lightning and thunder and thunderclaps hurt my head if we have a bad storm will you stay close to me  yes  when they got back to camp the afternoon was closing and it was exceedingly sultry not a breath of air stirred the aspen leaves and when these did not quiver the air was indeed still the darkpurple clouds moved almost imperceptibly out of the west  what have we for supper asked bess  rabbit  bern cant you think of another new way to cook rabbit went on bess with earnestness  what do you think i ama magician retorted venters  i wouldnt dare tell you but bern do you want me to turn into a rabbit  there was a darkblue merry flashing of eyes and a parting of lips then she laughed in that moment she was naive and wholesome  rabbit seems to agree with you replied venters you are well and strongand growing very pretty  anything in the nature of compliment he had never before said to her and just now he responded to a sudden curiosity to see its effect bess stared as if she had not heard aright slowly blushed and completely lost her poise in happy confusion  id better go right away he continued and fetch supplies from cottonwoods  a startlingly swift change in the nature of her agitation made him reproach himself for his abruptness  no no dont go she said i didnt meanthat about the rabbit ii was only trying to befunny dont leave me all alone  bess i must go sometime  wait then wait till after the storms  the purple cloudbank darkened the lower edge of the setting sun crept up and up obscuring its fiery red heart and finally passed over the last ruddy crescent of its upper rim  the intense dead silence awakened to a long low rumbling roll of thunder  oh cried bess nervously  weve had big black clouds before this without rain said venters but theres no doubt about that thunder the storms are coming im glad every rider on the sage will hear that thunder with glad ears  venters and bess finished their simple meal and the few tasks around the camp then faced the open terrace the valley and the west to watch and await the approaching storm  it required keen vision to see any movement whatever in the purple clouds by infinitesimal degrees the dark cloudline merged upward into the goldenred haze of the afterglow of sunset a shadow lengthened from under the western wall across the valley as straight and rigid as steel rose the delicate spearpointed silver spruces the aspen leaves by nature pendant and quivering hung limp and heavy no slender blade of grass moved a gentle splashing of water came from the ravine then again from out of the west sounded the low dull and rumbling roll of thunder  a wave a ripple of light a trembling and turning of the aspen leaves like the approach of a breeze on the water crossed the valley from the west and the lull and the deadly stillness and the sultry air passed away on a cool wind  the night bird of the canyon with clear and melancholy notes announced the twilight and from all along the cliffs rose the faint murmur and moan and mourn of the wind singing in the caves the bank of clouds now swept hugely out of the western sky its front was purple and black with gray between a bulging mushrooming vast thing instinct with storm it had a dark angry threatening aspect as if all the power of the winds were pushing and piling behind it rolled ponderously across the sky a red flare burned out instantaneously flashed from the west to east and died then from the deepest black of the purple cloud burst a boom it was like the bowling of a huge boulder along the crags and ramparts and seemed to roll on and fall into the valley to bound and bang and boom from cliff to cliff  oh cried bess with her hands over her ears what did i tell you  why bess be reasonable said venters  im a coward  not quite that i hope its strange youre afraid i love a storm  i tell you a storm down in these canyons is an awful thing i know oldring hated storms his men were afraid of them there was one who went deaf in a bad storm and never could hear again  maybe ive lots to learn bess ill lose my guess if this storm isnt bad enough were going to have heavy wind first then lightning and thunder then the rain lets stay out as long as we can  the tips of the cottonwoods and the oaks waved to the east and the rings of aspens along the terraces twinkled their myriad of bright faces in fleet and glancing gleam a low roar rose from the leaves of the forest and the spruces swished in the rising wind it came in gusts with light breezes between as it increased in strength the lulls shortened in length till there was a strong and steady blow all the time and violent puffs at intervals and sudden whirling currents the clouds spread over the valley rolling swiftly and low and twilight faded into a sweeping darkness then the singing of the wind in the caves drowned the swift roar of rustling leaves then the song swelled to a mourning moaning wail then with the gathering power of the wind the wail changed to a shriek steadily the wind strengthened and constantly the strange sound changed  the last bit of blue sky yielded to the onsweep of clouds like angry surf the pale gleams of gray amid the purple of that scudding front swept beyond the eastern rampart of the valley the purple deepened to black broad sheets of lightning flared over the western wall there were not yet any ropes or zigzag streaks darting down through the gathering darkness the storm center was still beyond surprise valley  listen listen cried bess with her lips close to venterss ear youll hear oldrings knell  whats that  oldrings knell when the wind blows a gale in the caves it makes what the rustlers call oldrings knell they believe it bodes his death i think he believes so too its not like any sound on earth its beginning listen  the gale swooped down with a hollow unearthly howl it yelled and pealed and shrilled and shrieked it was made up of a thousand piercing cries it was a rising and a moving sound beginning at the western break of the valley it rushed along each gigantic cliff whistling into the caves and cracks to mount in power to bellow a blast through the great stone bridge gone as into an engulfing roar of surging waters it seemed to shoot back and begin all over again  it was only wind thought venters here sped and shrieked the sculptor that carved out the wonderful caves in the cliffs it was only a gale but as venters listened as his ears became accustomed to the fury and strife out of it all or through it or above it pealed low and perfectly clear and persistently uniform a strange sound that had no counterpart in all the sounds of the elements it was not of earth or of life it was the grief and agony of the gale a knell of all upon which it blew  black night enfolded the valley venters could not see his companion and knew of her presence only through the tightening hold of her hand on his arm he felt the dogs huddle closer to him suddenly the dense black vault overhead split asunder to a bluewhite dazzling streak of lightning the whole valley lay vividly clear and luminously bright in his sight upreared vast and magnificent the stone bridge glimmered like some grand god of storm in the lightnings fire then all flashed black againblacker than pitcha thick impenetrable coalblackness and there came a ripping crashing report instantly an echo resounded with clapping crash the initial report was nothing to the echo it was a terrible living reverberating detonating crash the wall threw the sound across and could have made no greater roar if it had slipped in avalanche from cliff to cliff the echo went in crashing retort and banged in lessening power and boomed in thinner volume and clapped weaker and weaker till a final clap could not reach across the waiting cliff  in the pitchy darkness venters led bess and groping his way by feel of hand found the entrance to her cave and lifted her up on the instant a blinding flash of lightning illumined the cave and all about him he saw besss face white now with dark frightened eyes he saw the dogs leap up and he followed suit the golden glare vanished all was black then came the splitting crack and the infernal din of echoes  bess shrank closer to him and closer found his hands and pressed them tightly over her ears and dropped her face upon his shoulder and hid her eyes  then the storm burst with a succession of ropes and streaks and shafts of lightning playing continuously filling the valley with a broken radiance and the cracking shots followed each other swiftly till the echoes blended in one fearful deafening crash  venters looked out upon the beautiful valleybeautiful now as never beforemystic in its transparent luminous gloom weird in the quivering golden haze of lightning the dark spruces were tipped with glimmering lights the aspens bent low in the winds as waves in a tempest at sea the forest of oaks tossed wildly and shone with gleams of fire across the valley the huge cavern of the cliffdwellers yawned in the glare every little black window as clear as at noonday but the night and the storm added to their tragedy flung arching to the black clouds the great stone bridge seemed to bear the brunt of the storm it caught the full fury of the rushing wind it lifted its noble crown to meet the lightnings venters thought of the eagles and their lofty nest in a niche under the arch a driving pall of rain black as the clouds came sweeping on to obscure the bridge and the gleaming walls and the shining valley the lightning played incessantly streaking down through opaque darkness of rain the roar of the wind with its strange knell and the recrashing echoes mingled with the roar of the flooding rain and all seemingly were deadened and drowned in a world of sound  in the dimming pale light venters looked down upon the girl she had sunk into his arms upon his breast burying her face she clung to him he felt the softness of her and the warmth and the quick heave of her breast he saw the dark slender graceful outline of her form a woman lay in his arms and he held her closer he who had been alone in the sad silent watches of the night was not now and never must be again alone he who had yearned for the touch of a hand felt the long tremble and the heartbeat of a woman by what strange chance had she come to love him by what changeby what marvel had she grown into a treasure  no more did he listen to the rush and roar of the thunderstorm for with the touch of clinging hands and the throbbing bosom he grew conscious of an inward stormthe tingling of new chords of thought strange music of unheard joyous bells sad dreams dawning to wakeful delight dissolving doubt resurging hope force fire and freedom unutterable sweetness of desire a storm in his breasta storm of real love    chapter xiv west wind  when the storm abated venters sought his own cave and late in the night as his blood cooled and the stir and throb and thrill subsided he fell asleep  with the breaking of dawn his eyes unclosed the valley lay drenched and bathed a burnished oval of glittering green the rainwashed walls glistened in the morning light waterfalls of many forms poured over the rims one a broad lacy sheet thin as smoke slid over the western notch and struck a ledge in its downward fall to bound into broader leap to burst far below into white and gold and rosy mist  venters prepared for the day knowing himself a different man  its a glorious morning said bess in greeting  yes after the storm the west wind he replied  last night was ivery much of a baby she asked watching him  pretty much  oh i couldnt help it  im glad you were afraid  why she asked in slow surprise  ill tell you some day he answered soberly then around the campfire and through the morning meal he was silent afterward he strolled thoughtfully off alone along the terrace he climbed a great yellow rock raising its crest among the spruces and there he sat down to face the valley and the west  i love her  aloud he spokeunburdened his heartconfessed his secret for an instant the golden valley swam before his eyes and the walls waved and all about him whirled with tumult within  i love her i understand now  reviving memory of jane withersteen and thought of the complications of the present amazed him with proof of how far he had drifted from his old life he discovered that he hated to take up the broken threads to delve into dark problems and difficulties in this beautiful valley he had been living a beautiful dream tranquillity had come to him and the joy of solitude and interest in all the wild creatures and crannies of this incomparable valleyand love under the shadow of the great stone bridge god had revealed himself to venters  the world seems very far away he muttered but its thereand im not yet done with it perhaps i never shall be onlyhow glorious it would be to live here always and never think again  whereupon the resurging reality of the present as if in irony of his wish steeped him instantly in contending thought out of it all he presently evolved these things he must go to cottonwoods he must bring supplies back to surprise valley he must cultivate the soil and raise corn and stock and most imperative of all he must decide the future of the girl who loved him and whom he loved the first of these things required tremendous effort the last one concerning bess seemed simply and naturally easy of accomplishment he would marry her suddenly as from roots of poisonous fire flamed up the forgotten truth concerning her it seemed to wither and shrivel up all his joy on its hot tearing way to his heart she had been oldrings masked rider to venterss question what were you to oldring she had answered with scarlet shame and drooping head  what do i care who she is or what she was he cried passionately and he knew it was not his old self speaking it was this softer gentler man who had awakened to new thoughts in the quiet valley tenderness masterful in him now matched the absence of joy and blunted the knifeedge of entering jealousy strong and passionate effort of will surprising to him held back the poison from piercing his soul  wait wait he cried as if calling his hand pressed his breast and he might have called to the pang there wait its all so strangeso wonderful anything can happen who am i to judge her ill glory in my love for her but i cant tell itcant give up to it  certainly he could not then decide her future marrying her was impossible in surprise valley and in any village south of sterling even without the mask she had once worn she would easily have been recognized as oldrings rider no man who had ever seen her would forget her regardless of his ignorance as to her sex then more poignant than all other argument was the fact that he did not want to take her away from surprise valley he resisted all thought of that he had brought her to the most beautiful and wildest place of the uplands he had saved her nursed her back to strength watched her bloom as one of the valley lilies he knew her life there to be pure and sweetshe belonged to him and he loved her still these were not all the reasons why he did not want to take her away where could they go he feared the rustlershe feared the ridershe feared the mormons and if he should ever succeed in getting bess safely away from these immediate perils he feared the sharp eyes of women and their tongues the big outside world with its problems of existence he must wait to decide her future which after all was deciding his own but between her future and his something hung impending like balancing rock which waited darkly over the steep gorge ready to close forever the outlet to deception pass that nameless thing as certain yet intangible as fate must fall and close forever all doubts and fears of the future  ive dreamed muttered venters as he rose well why not to dream is happiness but let me just once see this clearly wholly then i can go on dreaming till the thing falls ive got to tell jane withersteen ive dangerous trips to take ive work here to make comfort for this girl shes mine ill fight to keep her safe from that old life ive already seen her forget it i love her and if a beast ever rises in me ill burn my hand off before i lay it on her with shameful intent and by god sooner or later ill kill the man who hid her and kept her in deception pass  as he spoke the west wind softly blew in his face it seemed to soothe his passion that west wind was fresh cool fragrant and it carried a sweet strange burden of faroff thingstidings of life in other climes of sunshine asleep on other wallsof other places where reigned peace it carried too sad truth of human hearts and mysteryof promise and hope unquenchable surprise valley was only a little niche in the wide world whence blew that burdened wind bess was only one of millions at the mercy of unknown motive in nature and life content had come to venters in the valley happiness had breathed in the slow warm air love as bright as light had hovered over the walls and descended to him and now on the west wind came a whisper of the eternal triumph of faith over doubt  how much better i am for what has come to me he exclaimed ill let the future take care of itself whatever falls ill be ready  venters retraced his steps along the terrace back to camp and found bess in the old familiar seat waiting and watching for his return  i went off by myself to think a little he explained  you never looked that way before whatwhat is it wont you tell me  well bess the fact is ive been dreaming a lot this valley makes a fellow dream so i forced myself to think we cant live this way much longer soon ill simply have to go to cottonwoods we need a whole pack train of supplies i can get  can you go safely she interrupted  why im sure of it ill ride through the pass at night i havent any fear that wrangle isnt where i left him and once on himbess just wait till you see that horse  oh i want to see himto ride him butbut bern this is what troubles me she said willwill you come back  give me four days if im not back in four days youll know im dead for that only shall keep me  oh  bess ill come back theres dangeri wouldnt lie to youbut i can take care of myself  bern im sureoh im sure of it all my life ive watched hunted men i can tell whats in them and i believe you can ride and shoot and see with any rider of the sage its notnot that ifear  well what is it then  whywhywhy should you come back at all  i couldnt leave you here alone  you might change your mind when you get to the villageamong old friends  i wont change my mind as for old friends he uttered a short expressive laugh  thentherethere must be aa woman dark red mantled the clear tan of temple and cheek and neck her eyes were eyes of shame upheld a long moment by intense straining search for the verification of her fear suddenly they drooped her head fell to her knees her hands flew to her hot cheeks  besslook here said venters with a sharpness due to the violence with which he checked his quick surging emotion  as if compelled against her willanswering to an irresistible voicebess raised her head looked at him with sad dark eyes and tried to whisper with tremulous lips  theres no woman went on venters deliberately holding her glance with his nothing on earth barring the chances of life can keep me away  her face flashed and flushed with the glow of a leaping joy but like the vanishing of a gleam it disappeared to leave her as he had never beheld her  i am nothingi am losti am nameless  do you want me to come back he asked with sudden stern coldness maybe you want to go back to oldring  that brought her erect trembling and ashy pale with dark proud eyes and mute lips refuting his insinuation  bess i beg your pardon i shouldnt have said that but you angered me i intend to workto make a home for you hereto be aa brother to you as long as ever you need me and you must forget what you arewerei mean and be happy when you remember that old life you are bitter and it hurts me  i was happyi shall be very happy oh youre so good thatthat it kills me if i think i cant believe it i grow sick with wondering why im only a let me say itonly a lost namelessgirl of the rustlers oldrings girl they called me that you should save mebe so good and kindwant to make me happywhy its beyond belief no wonder im wretched at the thought of your leaving me but ill be wretched and bitter no more i promise you if only i could repay you even a little  youve repaid me a hundredfold will you believe me  believe you i couldnt do else  then listen saving you i saved myself living here in this valley with you ive found myself ive learned to think while i was dreaming i never troubled myself about god but god or some wonderful spirit has whispered to me here i absolutely deny the truth of what you say about yourself i cant explain it there are things too deep to tell whatever the terrible wrongs youve suffered god holds you blameless i see thatfeel that in you every moment you are near me ive a mother and a sister way back in illinois if i could id take you to themtomorrow  if it were true oh i mighti might lift my head she cried  lift it thenyou child for i swear its true  she did lift her head with the singular wild grace always a part of her actions with that old unconscious intimation of innocence which always tortured venters but now with something morea spirit rising from the depths that linked itself to his brave words  ive been thinkingtoo she cried with quivering smile and swelling breast ive discovered myselftoo im youngim aliveim so fulloh im a woman  bess i believe i can claim credit of that last discoverybefore you venters said and laughed  oh theres moretheres something i must tell you  tell it then  when will you go to cottonwoods  as soon as the storms are past or the worst of them  ill tell you before you go i cant now i dont know how i shall then but it must be told id never let you leave me without knowing for in spite of what you say theres a chance you mightnt come back  day after day the west wind blew across the valley day after day the clouds clustered gray and purple and black the cliffs sang and the caves rang with oldrings knell and the lightning flashed the thunder rolled the echoes crashed and crashed and the rains flooded the valley wild flowers sprang up everywhere swaying with the lengthening grass on the terraces smiling wanly from shady nooks peeping wondrously from yeardry crevices of the walls the valley bloomed into a paradise every single moment from the breaking of the gold bar through the bridge at dawn on to the reddening of rays over the western wall was one of colorful change the valley swam in thick transparent haze golden at dawn warm and white at noon purple in the twilight at the end of every storm a rainbow curved down into the leafbright forest to shine and fade and leave lingeringly some faint essence of its rosy iris in the air  venters walked with bess once more in a dream and watched the lights change on the walls and faced the wind from out of the west  always it brought softly to him strange sweet tidings of faroff things it blew from a place that was old and whispered of youth it blew down the grooves of time it brought a story of the passing hours it breathed low of fighting men and praying women it sang clearly the song of love that ever was the burden of its tidingsyouth in the shady woods waders through the wet meadows boy and girl at the hedgerow stile bathers in the booming surf sweet idle hours on grassy windy hills long strolls down moonlit laneseverywhere in faroff lands fingers locked and bursting hearts and longing lipsfrom all the world tidings of unquenchable love  often in these hours of dreams he watched the girl and asked himself of what was she dreaming for the changing light of the valley reflected its gleam and its color and its meaning in the changing light of her eyes he saw in them infinitely more than he saw in his dreams he saw thought and soul and naturestrong vision of life all tidings the west wind blew from distance and age he found deep in those darkblue depths and found them mysteries solved under their wistful shadow he softened and in the softening felt himself grow a sadder a wiser and a better man  while the west wind blew its tidings filling his heart full teaching him a mans part the days passed the purple clouds changed to white and the storms were over for that summer  i must go now he said  when she asked  at oncetonight  im glad the time has come it dragged at me gofor youll come back the sooner  late in the afternoon as the ruddy sun split its last flame in the ragged notch of the western wall bess walked with venters along the eastern terrace up the long weathered slope under the great stone bridge they entered the narrow gorge to climb around the fence long before built there by venters farther than this she had never been twilight had already fallen in the gorge it brightened to waning shadow in the wider ascent he showed her balancing rock of which he had often told her and explained its sinister leaning over the outlet shuddering she looked down the long pale incline with its closedin toppling walls  what an awful trail did you carry me up here  i did surely replied he  it frightens me somehow yet i never was afraid of trails id ride anywhere a horse could go and climb where he couldnt but theres something fearful here i feel asas if the place was watching me  look at this rock its balanced herebalanced perfectly you know i told you the cliffdwellers cut the rock and why but theyre gone and the rock waits cant you seefeel how it waits here i moved it once and ill never dare again a strong heave would start it then it would fall and bang and smash that crag and jar the walls and close forever the outlet to deception pass  ah when you come back ill steal up here and push and push with all my might to roll the rock and close forever the outlet to the pass she said it lightly but in the undercurrent of her voice was a heavier note a ring deeper than any ever given mere play of words  bess you cant dare me wait till i come back with suppliesthen roll the stone  iwasinfun her voice now throbbed low always you must be free to go when you will go now this place presses on mestifles me  im goingbut you had something to tell me  yes will youcome back  ill come if i live  butbut you mightnt come  thats possible of course itll take a good deal to kill

must tell you  she lost her voice her pale face her great glowing earnest eyes seemed to stand alone out of the gloom of the gorge the dog whined breaking the silence  i must tell youbecause you mightnt come back she whispered you must know whatwhat i think of your goodnessof you always ive been tonguetied i seemed not to be grateful it was deep in my heart even nowif i were other than i ami couldnt tell you but im nothingonly a rustlers girlnamelessinfamous youve saved meand imim yours to do with as you like with all my heart and souli love you    chapter xv shadows on the sageslope  in the cloudy threatening waning summer days shadows lengthened down the sageslope and jane withersteen likened them to the shadows gathering and closing in around her life  mrs larkin died and little fay was left an orphan with no known relative janes love redoubled it was the saving brightness of a darkening hour fay turned now to jane in childish worship and jane at last found full expression for the motherlonging in her heart upon lassiter too mrs larkins death had some subtle reaction before he had often without explanation advised jane to send fay back to any gentile family that would take her in passionately and reproachfully and wonderingly jane had refused even to entertain such an idea and now lassiter never advised it again grew sadder and quieter in his contemplation of the child and infinitely more gentle and loving sometimes jane had a cold inexplicable sensation of dread when she saw lassiter watching fay what did the rider see in the future why did he day by day grow more silent calmer cooler yet sadder in prophetic assurance of something to be  no doubt jane thought the rider in his almost superhuman power of foresight saw behind the horizon the dark lengthening shadows that were soon to crowd and gloom over him and her and little fay jane withersteen awaited the longdeferred breaking of the storm with a courage and embittered calm that had come to her in her extremity hope had not died doubt and fear subservient to her will no longer gave her sleepless nights and tortured days love remained all that she had loved she now loved the more she seemed to feel that she was defiantly flinging the wealth of her love in the face of misfortune and of hate no day passed but she prayed for alland most fervently for her enemies it troubled her that she had lost or had never gained the whole control of her mind in some measure reason and wisdom and decision were locked in a chamber of her brain awaiting a key power to think of some things was taken from her meanwhile abiding a day of judgment she fought ceaselessly to deny the bitter drops in her cup to tear back the slow the intangibly slow growth of a hot corrosive lichen eating into her heart  on the morning of august 10th jane while waiting in the court for lassiter heard a clear ringing report of a rifle it came from the grove somewhere toward the corrals jane glanced out in alarm the day was dull windless soundless the leaves of the cottonwoods drooped as if they had foretold the doom of withersteen house and were now ready to die and drop and decay never had jane seen such shade she pondered on the meaning of the report revolver shots had of late cracked from different parts of the grovespies taking snapshots at lassiter from a cowardly distance but a rifle report meant more riders seldom used rifles judkins and venters were the exceptions she called to mind had the men who hounded her hidden in her grove taken to the rifle to rid her of lassiter her last friend it was probableit was likely and she did not share his cool assumption that his death would never come at the hands of a mormon long had she expected it his constancy to her his singular reluctance to use the fatal skill for which he was famedboth now plain to all mormonslaid him open to inevitable assassination yet what charm against ambush and aim and enemy he seemed to bear about him no jane reflected it was not charm only a wonderful training of eye and ear and sense of impending peril nevertheless that could not forever avail against secret attack  that moment a rustling of leaves attracted her attention then the familiar clinking accompaniment of a slow soft measured step and lassiter walked into the court  jane theres a fellow out there with a long gun he said and removing his sombrero showed his head bound in a bloody scarf  i heard the shot i knew it was meant for you let me seeyou cant be badly injured  i reckon not but mebbe it wasnt a close call ill sit here in this corner where nobody can see me from the grove he untied the scarf and removed it to show a long bleeding furrow above his left temple  its only a cut said jane but how it bleeds hold your scarf over it just a moment till i come back  she ran into the house and returned with bandages and while she bathed and dressed the wound lassiter talked  that fellow had a good chance to get me but he must have flinched when he pulled the trigger as i dodged down i saw him run through the trees he had a rifle ive been expectin that kind of gun play i reckon now ill have to keep a little closer hid myself these fellers all seem to get chilly or shaky when they draw a bead on me but one of them might jest happen to hit me  wont you go awayleave cottonwoods as ive begged you tobefore some one does happen to hit you she appealed to him  i reckon ill stay  but oh lassiteryour blood will be on my hands  see here lady look at your hands now right now arent they fine firm white hands arent they bloody now lassiters blood thats a queer thing to stain your beautiful hands but if you could only see deeper youd find a redder color of blood heart color jane  oh my friend  no jane im not one to quit when the game grows hot no more than you this game though is new to me an i dont know the moves yet else i wouldnt have stepped in front of that bullet  have you no desire to hunt the man who fired at youto find himandand kill him  well i reckon i havent any great hankerin for that  oh the wonder of it i knewi prayedi trusted lassiter i almost gaveall myself to soften you to mormons thank god and thank you my friend but selfish woman that i am this is no great test whats the life of one of those sneaking cowards to such a man as you i think of your great hate toward him whoi think of your lifes implacable purpose can it be  wait listen he whispered i hear a hoss  he rose noiselessly with his ear to the breeze suddenly he pulled his sombrero down over his bandaged head and swinging his gunsheaths round in front he stepped into the alcove  its a hosscomin fast he added  janes listening ear soon caught a faint rapid rhythmic beat of hoofs it came from the sage it gave her a thrill that she was at a loss to understand the sound rose stronger louder then came a clear sharp difference when the horse passed from the sage trail to the hardpacked ground of the grove it became a ringing runswift in its belllike clatterings yet singular in longer pause than usual between the hoofbeats of a horse  its wrangle its wrangle cried jane withersteen id know him from a million horses  excitement and thrilling expectancy flooded out all jane withersteens calm a tight band closed round her breast as she saw the giant sorrel flit in reddishbrown flashes across the openings in the green then he was pounding down the lanethundering into the courtcrashing his great ironshod hoofs on the stone flags wrangle it was surely but shaggy and wildeyed and sagestreaked with dustcaked lather staining his flanks he reared and crashed down and plunged the rider leaped off threw the bridle and held hard on a lasso looped round wrangles head and neck janets heart sank as she tried to recognize venters in the rider something familiar struck her in the lofty stature in the sweep of powerful shoulders but this bearded longhaired unkempt man who wore ragged clothes patched with pieces of skin and boots that showed bare legs and feetthis dusty dark and wild rider could not possibly be venters  whoa wrangle old boy come down easy now sososo youre home old boy and presently you can have a drink of water youll remember  in the voice jane knew the rider to be venters he tied wrangle to the hitchingrack and turned to the court  oh bern you wild man she exclaimed  janejane its good to see you hello lassiter yes its venters  like rough iron his hard hand crushed janes in it she felt the difference she saw in him wild rugged unshornyet how splendid he had gone away a boyhe had returned a man he appeared taller wider of shoulder deeperchested more powerfully built but was that only her fancyhe had always been a young giantwas the change one of spirit he might have been absent for years proven by fire and steel grown like lassiter strong and cool and sure his eyeswere they keener more flashing than beforemet hers with clear frank warm regard in which perplexity was not nor discontent nor pain  look at me long as you like he said with a laugh im not much to look at and jane neither you nor lassiter can brag youre paler than i ever saw you lassiter here he wears a bloody bandage under his hat that reminds me some one took a flying shot at me down in the sage it made wrangle run some well perhaps youve more to tell me than ive got to tell you  briefly in few words jane outlined the circumstances of her undoing in the weeks of his absence  under his beard and bronze she saw his face whiten in terrible wrath  lassiterwhat held you back  no time in the long period of fiery moments and sudden shocks had jane withersteen ever beheld lassiter as calm and serene and cool as then  jane had gloom enough without my addin to it by shootin up the village he said  as strange as lassiters coolness was venterss curious intent scrutiny of them both and under it jane felt a flaming tide wave from bosom to temples  wellyoure right he said with slow pause it surprises me a little thats all  jane sensed then a slight alteration in venters and what it was in her own confusion she could not tell it had always been her intention to acquaint him with the deceit she had fallen to in her zeal to move lassiter she did not mean to spare herself yet now at the moment before these riders it was an impossibility to explain  venters was speaking somewhat haltingly without his former frankness i found oldrings hidingplace and your red herd i learnedi knowim sure there was a deal between tull and oldring he paused and shifted his position and his gaze he looked as if he wanted to say something that he found beyond him sorrow and pity and shame seemed to contend for mastery over him then he raised himself and spoke with effort jane ive cost you too much youve almost ruined yourself for me it was wrong for im not worth it i never deserved such friendship well maybe its not too late you must give me up mind i havent changed i am just the same as ever ill see tull while im here and tell him to his face  bern its too late said jane  ill make him believe cried venters violently  you ask me to break our friendship  yes if you dont i shall  forever  forever  jane sighed another shadow had lengthened down the sage slope to cast further darkness upon her a melancholy sweetness pervaded her resignation the boy who had left her had returned a man nobler stronger one in whom she divined something unbending as steel there might come a moment later when she would wonder why she had not fought against his will but just now she yielded to it she liked him as wellnay more she thought only her emotions were deadened by the long menacing wait for the bursting storm  once before she had held out her hand to himwhen she gave it now she stretched it tremblingly forth in acceptance of the decree circumstance had laid upon them venters bowed over it kissed it pressed it hard and half stifled a sound very like a sob certain it was that when he raised his head tears glistened in his eyes  somewomenhave a hard lot he said huskily then he shook his powerful form and his rags lashed about him ill say a few things to tullwhen i meet him  bernyoull not draw on tull oh that must not be promise me  i promise you this he interrupted in stern passion that thrilled while it terrorized her if you say one more word for that plotter ill kill him as i would a mad coyote  jane clasped her hands was this fireeyed man the one whom she had once made as wax to her touch had venters become lassiter and lassiter venters  illsay no more she faltered  jane lassiter once called you blind said venters it must be true but i wont upbraid you only dont rouse the devil in me by praying for tull ill try to keep cool when i meet him thats all now theres one more thing i want to ask of youthe last ive found a valley down in the pass its a wonderful place i intend to stay there its so hidden i believe no one can find it theres good water and browse and game i want to raise corn and stock i need to take in supplies will you give them to me  assuredly the more you take the better youll please meand perhaps the less mymy enemies will get  venters i reckon youll have trouble packin anythin away put in lassiter  ill go at night  mebbe that wouldnt be best youd sure be stopped youd better go early in the morninsay just after dawn thats the safest time to move round here  lassiter ill be hard to stop returned venters darkly  i reckon so  bern said jane go first to the riders quarters and get yourself a complete outfit youre aa sight then help yourself to whatever else you needburros packs grain dried fruits and meat you must take coffee and sugar and flourall kinds of supplies dont forget corn and seeds i remember how you used to starve pleaseplease take all you can pack away from here ill make a bundle for you which you mustnt open till youre in your valley how id like to see it to judge by you and wrangle how wild it must be  jane walked down into the outer court and approached the sorrel upstarting he laid back his ears and eyed her  wrangledear old wrangle she said and put a caressing hand on his matted mane oh hes wild but he knows me bern can he run as fast as ever  run jane hes done sixty miles since last night at dark and i could make him kill black star right now in a tenmile race  he never could protested jane he couldnt even if he was fresh  i reckon mebbe the best hossll prove himself yet said lassiter an jane if it ever comes to that race id like you to be on wrangle  id like that too rejoined venters but jane maybe lassiters hint is extreme bad as your prospects are youll surely never come to the running point  who knows she replied with mournful smile  no no jane it cant be so bad as all that soon as i see tull therell be a change in your fortunes ill hurry down to the village now dont worry  jane retired to the seclusion of her room lassiters subtle forecasting of disaster venterss forced optimism neither remained in mind material loss weighed nothing in the balance with other losses she was sustaining she wondered dully at her sitting there hands folded listlessly with a kind of numb deadness to the passing of time and the passing of her riches she thought of venterss friendship she had not lost that but she had lost him lassiters friendshipthat was more than loveit would endure but soon he too would be gone little fay slept dreamlessly upon the bed her golden curls streaming over the pillow jane had the childs worship would she lose that too and if she did what then would be left conscience thundered at her that there was left her religion conscience thundered that she should be grateful on her knees for this baptism of fire that through misfortune sacrifice and suffering her soul might be fused pure gold but the old spontaneous rapturous spirit no more exalted her she wanted to be a womannot a martyr like the saint of old who mortified his flesh jane withersteen had in her the temper for heroic martyrdom if by sacrificing herself she could save the souls of others but here the damnable verdict blistered her that the more she sacrificed herself the blacker grew the souls of her churchmen there was something terribly wrong with her soul something terribly wrong with her churchmen and her religion in the whirling gulf of her thought there was yet one shining light to guide her to sustain her in her hope and it was that despite her errors and her frailties and her blindness she had one absolute and unfaltering hold on ultimate and supreme justice that was love love your enemies as yourself was a divine word entirely free from any church or creed  janes meditations were disturbed by lassiters soft tinkling step in the court always he wore the clinking spurs always he was in readiness to ride she passed out and called him into the huge dim hall  i think youll be safer here the court is too open she said  i reckon replied lassiter an its cooler here the days sure muggy well i went down to the village with venters  already where is he queried jane in quick amaze  hes at the corrals blakes helpin him get the burros an packs ready that blake is a good fellow  diddid bern meet tull  i guess he did answered lassiter and he laughed dryly  tell me oh you exasperate me youre so cool so calm for heavens sake tell me what happened  first time ive been in the village for weeks went on lassiter mildly i reckon there aint been more of a show for a long time me an venters walkin down the road it was funny i aint sayin anybody was particular glad to see us im not much thought of hereabouts an venters he sure looks like what you called him a wild man well there was some runnin of folks before we got to the stores then everybody vamoosed except some surprised rustlers in front of a saloon venters went right in the stores an saloons an of course i went along i dont know which tickled me the mostthe actions of many fellers we met or venterss nerve jane i was downright glad to be along you see that sort of thing is my element an ive been away from it for a spell but we didnt find tull in one of them places some gentile feller at last told venters hed find tull in that long buildin next to parsonss store its a kind of meetinroom and sure enough when we peeped in it was half full of men  venters yelled dont anybody pull guns we aint come for that then he tramped in an i was some put to keep alongside him there was a hard scrapin sound of feet a loud cry an then some whisperin an after that stillness you could cut with a knife tull was there an that fat party who once tried to throw a gun on me an other importantlookin men en that little froglegged feller who was with tull the day i rode in here i wish you could have seen their faces specially tulls an the fat partys but there aint no use of me tryin to tell you how they looked  well venters an i stood there in the middle of the room with that batch of men all in front of us en not a blamed one of them winked an eyelash or moved a finger it was natural of course for me to notice many of them packed guns thats a way of mine first noticin them things venters spoke up an his voice sort of chilled an cut en he told tull he had a few things to say  here lassiter paused while he turned his sombrero round and round in his familiar habit and his eyes had the look of a man seeing over again some thrilling spectacle and under his red bronze there was strange animation  like a shot then venters told tull that the friendship between you an him was all over an he was leaving your place he said youd both of you broken off in the hope of propitiatin your people but you hadnt changed your mind otherwise an never would  next he spoke up for you i aint goin to tell you what he said onlyno other woman who ever lived ever had such tribute you had a champion jane an never fear that those thickskulled men dont know you now it couldnt be otherwise he spoke the ringin lightnin truth then he accused tull of the underhand miserable robbery of a helpless woman he told tull where the red herd was of a deal made with oldrin that jerry card had made the deal i thought tull was goin to drop an that little froglegged cuss he looked some limp an white but venterss voice would have kept anybodys legs from bucklin i was stiff myself he went on an called tullcalled him every bad name ever known to a rider an then some he cursed tull i never hear a man get such a cursin he laughed in scorn at the idea of tull bein a minister he said tull an a few more dogs of hell builded their empire out of the hearts of such innocent an godfearin women as jane withersteen he called tull a binder of women a callous beast who hid behind a mock mantle of righteousnessan the last an lowest coward on the face of the earth to prey on weak women through their religionthat was the last unspeakable crime  then he finished an by this time hed almost lost his voice but his whisper was enough tull he said she begged me not to draw on you today she would pray for you if you burned her at the stake but listen i swear if you and i ever come face to face again ill kill you  we backed out of the door then an up the road but nobody follered us  jane found herself weeping passionately she had not been conscious of it till lassiter ended his story and she experienced exquisite pain and relief in shedding tears long had her eyes been dry her grief deep long had her emotions been dumb lassiters story put her on the rack the appalling nature of venterss act and speech had no parallel as an outrage it was worse than bloodshed men like tull had been shot but had one ever been so terribly denounced in public overmounting her horror an uncontrollable quivering passion shook her very soul it was sheer human glory in the deed of a fearless man it was hot primitive instinct to liveto fight it was a kind of mad joy in venterss chivalry it was close to the wrath that had first shaken her in the beginning of this war waged upon her  well well jane dont take it that way said lassiter in evident distress i had to tell you theres some things a feller jest cant keep its strange you give up on hearin that when all this long time youve been the gamest woman i ever seen but i dont know women mebbe theres reason for you to cry i know thisnothin ever rang in my soul an so filled it as what venters did id like to have done it butim only good for throwin a gun en it seems you hate that well ill be goin now  where  venters took wrangle to the stable the sorrels shy a shoe an ive got to help hold the big devil an put on another  tell bern to come for the pack i want to give himandand to say goodby called jane as lassiter went out  jane passed the rest of that day in a vain endeavor to decide what and what not to put in the pack for venters this task was the last she would ever perform for him and the gifts were the last she would ever make him so she picked and chose and rejected and chose again and often paused in sad revery and began again till at length she filled the pack  it was about sunset and she and fay had finished supper and were sitting in the court when venterss quick steps rang on the stones she scarcely knew him for he had changed the tattered garments and she missed the dark beard and long hair still he was not the venters of old as he came up the steps she felt herself pointing to the pack and heard herself speaking words that were meaningless to her he said goodby he kissed her released her and turned away his tall figure blurred in her sight grew dim through dark streaked vision and then he vanished  twilight fell around withersteen house and dusk and night little fay slept but jane lay with strained aching eyes she heard the wind moaning in the cottonwoods and mice squeaking in the walls the night was interminably long yet she prayed to hold back the dawn what would another day bring forth the blackness of her room seemed blacker for the sad entering gray of morning light she heard the chirp of awakening birds and fancied she caught a faint clatter of hoofs then low dull distant throbbed a heavy gunshot she had expected it was waiting for it nevertheless an electric shock checked her heart froze the very living fiber of her bones that viselike hold on her faculties apparently did not relax for a long time and it was a voice under her window that released her  jane jane softly called lassiter  she answered somehow  its all right venters got away i thought mebbe youd heard that shot en i was worried some  what was itwho fired  wellsome fool feller tried to stop venters out there in the sagean he only stopped lead i think itll be all right i havent seen or heard of any other fellers round ventersll go through safe an jane ive got bells saddled an im going to trail venters mind i wont show myself unless he falls foul of somebody an needs me i want to see if this place where hes goin is safe for him he says nobody can track him there i never seen the place yet i couldnt track a man to now jane you stay indoors while im gone an keep close watch on fay will you  yes oh yes  an another thing jane he continued then paused for longanother thingif you aint here when i come backif youre gonedont fear ill trail youill find you out  my dear lassiter where could i be goneas you put it asked jane in curious surprise  i reckon you might be somewhere mebbe tied in an old barnor corralled in some gulchor chained in a cave milly erne wastill she give in mebbe thats news to you well if youre gone ill hunt for you  no lassiter she replied sadly and low if im gone just forget the unhappy woman whose blinded selfish deceit you repaid with kindness and love  she heard a deep muttering curse under his breath and then the silvery tinkling of his spurs as he moved away  jane entered upon the duties of that day with a settled gloomy calm disaster hung in the dark clouds in the shade in the humid west wind blake when he reported appeared without his usual cheer and jerd wore a harassed look of a worn and worried man and when judkins put in appearance riding a lame horse and dismounted with the cramp of a rider his dustcovered figure and his darkly grim almost dazed expression told jane of dire calamity she had no need of words  miss withersteen i have to reportloss of thewhite herd said judkins hoarsely  come sit down you look played out replied jane solicitously she brought him brandy and food and while he partook of refreshments of which he appeared badly in need she asked no questions  no one ridercould hev done moremiss withersteen he went on presently  judkins dont be distressed youve done more than any other rider ive long expected to lose the white herd its no surprise its in line with other things that are happening im grateful for your service  miss withersteen i knew how youd take it but if anythin that makes it harder to tell you see a feller wants to do so much fer you an id got fond of my job we led the herd a ways off to the north of the break in the valley there was a big level an pools of water an tiptop browse but the cattle was in a high nervous condition wildas wild as antelope you see theyd been so scared they never slept i aint agoin to tell you of the many tricks that were pulled off out there in the sage but there wasnt a day for weeks thet the herd didnt get started to run we allus managed to ride em close an drive em back an keep em bunched honest miss withersteen them steers was thin they was thin when water and grass was everywhere thin at this seasonthetll tell you how your steers was pestered fer instance one night a strange runnin streak of fire run right through the herd that streak was a coyotewith an oiled an blazin tail fer i shot it an found out we had hell with the herd that night an if the sage an grass hadnt been wetwe hosses steers an all would hev burned up but i said i wasnt goin to tell you any of the tricks strange now miss withersteen when the stampede did come it was from natural causejest a whirlin devil of dust youve seen the like often an this wasnt no big whirl fer the dust was mostly settled it had dried out in a little swale an ordinarily no steer would ever hev run fer it but the herd was nervous en wild an jest as lassiter said when that bunch of white steers got to movin they was as bad as buffalo ive seen some buffalo stampedes back in nebraska an this bolt of the steers was the same kind  i tried to mill the herd jest as lassiter did but i wasnt equal to it miss withersteen i dont believe the rider lives who could hev turned thet herd we kept along of the herd fer miles an more n one of my boys tried to get the steers amillin it wasnt no use we got off level ground goin down an then the steers ran somethin fierce we left the little gullies an washes levelfull of dead steers finally i saw the herd was makin to pass a kind of low pocket between ridges there was a hogbackas we used to call ema pile of rocks stickin up and i saw the herd was goin to split round it or swing out to the left an i wanted em to go to the right so mebbe wed be able to drive em into the pocket so with all my boys except three i rode hard to turn the herd a little to the right we couldnt budge em they went on en split round the rocks en the most of em was turned sharp to the left by a deep wash we hednt seenhed no chance to see  the other three boysjimmy vail joe willis an thet little cairns boya nervy kid they with cairns leadin tried to buck thet herd round to the pocket it was a wild fool idee i couldnt do nothin the boys got hemmed in between the steers an the washthet they hednt no chance to see either vail an willis was run down right before our eyes an cairns who rode a fine hoss he did some ridin i never seen equaled en would hev beat the steers if thered been any room to run in i was high up an could see how the steers kept spillin by twos an threes over into the wash cairns put his hoss to a place thet was too wide fer any hoss an broke his neck an the hosss too we found that out after an as fer vail an willistwo thousand steers ran over the poor boys there wasnt much left to pack home fer burying an miss withersteen thet all happened yesterday en i believe if the white herd didnt run over the wall of the pass its runnin yet  on the morning of the second day after judkinss recital during which time jane remained indoors a prey to regret and sorrow for the boy riders and a new and now strangely insistent fear for her own person she again heard what she had missed more than she dared honestly confessthe soft jingling step of lassiter almost overwhelming relief surged through her a feeling as akin to joy as any she could have been capable of in those gloomy hours of shadow and one that suddenly stunned her with the significance of what lassiter had come to mean to her she had begged him for his own sake to leave cottonwoods she might yet beg that if her weakening courage permitted her to dare absolute loneliness and helplessness but she realized now that if she were left alone her life would become one long hideous nightmare  when his soft steps clinked into the hall in answer to her greeting and his tall blackgarbed form filled the door she felt an inexpressible sense of immediate safety in his presence she lost her fear of the dim passageways of withersteen house and of every sound always it had been that when he entered the court or the hall she had experienced a distinctly sickening but gradually lessening shock at sight of the huge black guns swinging at his sides this time the sickening shock again visited her it was however because a revealing flash of thought told her that it was not alone lassiter who was thrillingly welcome but also his fatal weapons they meant so much how she had fallenhow broken and spiritless must she beto have still the same old horror of lassiters guns and his name yet feel somehow a cold shrinking protection in their law and might and use  did you trail ventersfind his wonderful valley she asked eagerly  yes an i reckon its sure a wonderful place  is he safe there  thats been botherin me some i tracked him an part of the trail was the hardest i ever tackled mebbe theres a rustler or somebody in this country whos as good at trackin as i am if thats so venters aint safe  welltell me all about bern and his valley  to janes surprise lassiter showed disinclination for further talk about his trip he appeared to be extremely fatigued jane reflected that one hundred and twenty miles with probably a great deal of climbing on foot all in three days was enough to tire any rider moreover it presently developed that lassiter had returned in a mood of singular sadness and preoccupation she put it down to a moodiness over the loss of her white herd and the now precarious condition of her fortune  several days passed and as nothing happened janes spirits began to brighten once in her musings she thought that this tendency of hers to rebound was as sad as it was futile meanwhile she had resumed her walks through the grove with little fay  one morning she went as far as the sage she had not seen the slope since the beginning of the rains and now it bloomed a rich deep purple there was a high wind blowing and the sage tossed and waved and colored beautifully from light to dark clouds scudded across the sky and their shadows sailed darkly down the sunny slope  upon her return toward the house she went by the lane to the stables and she had scarcely entered the great open space with its corrals and sheds when she saw lassiter hurriedly approaching fay broke from her and running to a corral fence began to pat and pull the long hanging ears of a drowsy burro  one look at lassiter armed her for a blow  without a word he led her across the wide yard to the rise of the ground upon which the stable stood  janelook he said and pointed to the ground  jane glanced down and again and upon steadier vision made out splotches of blood on the stones and broad smooth marks in the dust leading out toward the sage  what made these she asked  i reckon somebody has dragged dead or wounded men out to where there was hosses in the sage  deadorwoundedmen  i reckonjane are you strong can you bear up  his hands were gently holding hers and his eyessuddenly she could no longer look into them strong she echoed trembling ii will be  up on the stoneflag drive nicked with the marks made by the ironshod hoofs of her racers lassiter led her his grasp ever growing firmer  wheres blakeandand jerb she asked haltingly  i dont know where jerb is bolted most likely replied lassiter as he took her through the stone door but blakepoor blake hes gone forever be prepared jane  with a cold prickling of her skin with a queer thrumming in her ears with fixed and staring eyes jane saw a gun lying at her feet with chamber swung and empty and discharged shells scattered near  outstretched upon the stable floor lay blake ghastly whitedeadone hand clutching a gun and the other twisted in his bloody blouse  whoever the thieves were whether your people or rustlersblake killed some of them said lassiter  thieves whispered jane  i reckon hossthieves look lassiter waved his hand toward the stalls  the first stallbellss stallwas empty all the stalls were empty no racer whinnied and stamped greeting to her night was gone black star was gone    chapter xvi gold  as lassiter had reported to jane venters went through safely and after a toilsome journey reached the peaceful shelter of surprise valley when finally he lay wearily down under the silver spruces resting from the strain of dragging packs and burros up the slope and through the entrance to surprise valley he had leisure to think and a great deal of the time went in regretting that he had not been frank with his loyal friend jane withersteen  but he kept continually recalling when he had stood once more face to face with her and had been shocked at the change in her and had heard the details of her adversity he had not had the heart to tell her of the closer interest which had entered his life he had not lied yet he had kept silence  bess was in transports over the stores of supplies and the outfit he had packed from cottonwoods he had certainly brought a hundred times more than he had gone for enough surely for years perhaps to make permanent home in the valley he saw no reason why he need ever leave there again  after a day of rest he recovered his strength and shared besss pleasure in rummaging over the endless packs and began to plan for the future and in this planning his trip to cottonwoods with its revived hate of tull and consequent unleashing of fierce passions soon faded out of mind by slower degrees his friendship for jane withersteen and his contrition drifted from the active preoccupation of his present thought to a place in memory with more and more infrequent recalls  and as far as the state of his mind was concerned upon the second day after his return the valley with its golden hues and purple shades the speaking west wind and the cool silent night and besss watching eyes with their wonderful light so wrought upon venters that he might never have left them at all  that very afternoon he set to work only one thing hindered him upon beginning though it in no wise checked his delight and that in the multiplicity of tasks planned to make a paradise out of the valley he could not choose the one with which to begin he had to grow into the habit of passing from one dreamy pleasure to another like a bee going from flower to flower in the valley and he found this wandering habit likely to extend to his labors nevertheless he made a start  at the outset he discovered bess to be both a considerable help in some ways and a very great hindrance in others her excitement and joy were spurs inspirations but she was utterly impracticable in her ideas and she flitted from one plan to another with bewildering vacillation moreover he fancied that she grew more eager youthful and sweet and he marked that it was far easier to watch her and listen to her than it was to work therefore he gave her tasks that necessitated her going often to the cave where he had stored his packs  upon the last of these trips when he was some distance down the terrace and out of sight of camp he heard a scream and then the sharp barking of the dogs  for an instant he straightened up amazed danger for her had been absolutely out of his mind she had seen a rattlesnakeor a wildcat still she would not have been likely to scream at sight of either and the barking of the dogs was ominous dropping his work he dashed back along the terrace upon breaking through a clump of aspens he saw the dark form of a man in the camp cold then hot venters burst into frenzied speed to reach his guns he was cursing himself for a thoughtless fool when the mans tall form became familiar and he recognized lassiter then the reversal of emotions changed his run to a walk he tried to call out but his voice refused to carry when he reached camp there was lassiter staring at the whitefaced girl by that time ring and whitie had recognized him  hello venters im makin you a visit said lassiter slowly an im some surprised to see youve aa young feller for company  one glance had sufficed for the keen rider to read besss real sex and for once his cool calm had deserted him he stared till the white of besss cheeks flared into crimson that if it were needed was the concluding evidence of her femininity for it went fittingly with her suntinted hair and darkened dilated eyes the sweetness of her mouth and the striking symmetry of her slender shape  heavens lassiter panted venters when he caught his breath what reliefits only you howin the name of all thats wonderfuldid you ever get here  i trailed you wei wanted to know where you was if you had a safe place so i trailed you  trailed me cried venters bluntly  i reckon it was some of a job after i got to them smooth rocks i was all day trackin you up to them little cut steps in the rock the rest was easy  wheres your hoss i hope you hid him  i tied him in them queer cedars down on the slope he cant be seen from the valley  thats good well well im completely dumfounded it was my idea that no man could track me in here  i reckon but if theres a tracker in these uplands as good as me he can find you  thats bad thatll worry me but lassiter now youre here im glad to see you andand my companion here is not a young fellow bess this is a friend of mine he saved my life once  the embarrassment of the moment did not extend to lassiter almost at once his manner as he shook hands with bess relieved venters and put the girl at ease after venterss words and one quick look at lassiter her agitation stilled and though she was shy if she were conscious of anything out of the ordinary in the situation certainly she did not show it  i reckon ill only stay a little while lassiter was saying an if you dont mind troublin im hungry i fetched some biscuits along but theyre gone venters this place is sure the wonderfullest ever seen them cut steps on the slope that outlet into the gorge an its like climbin up through hell into heaven to climb through that gorge into this valley theres a queerlookin rock at the top of the passage i didnt have time to stop im wonderin how you ever found this place its sure interestin  during the preparation and eating of dinner lassiter listened mostly as was his wont and occasionally he spoke in his quaint and dry way venters noted however that the rider showed an increasing interest in bess he asked her no questions and only directed his attention to her while she was occupied and had no opportunity to observe his scrutiny it seemed to venters that lassiter grew more and more absorbed in his study of bess and that he lost his coolness in some strange softening sympathy then quite abruptly he arose and announced the necessity for his early departure he said goodby to bess in a voice gentle and somewhat broken and turned hurriedly away venters accompanied him and they had traversed the terrace climbed the weathered slope and passed under the stone bridge before either spoke again  then lassiter put a great hand on venterss shoulder and wheeled him to meet a smoldering fire of gray eyes  lassiter i couldnt tell jane i couldnt burst out venters reading his friends mind i tried but i couldnt she wouldnt understand and she has troubles enough and i love the girl  venters i reckon this beats me ive seen some queer things in my time too this girlwho is she  i dont know  dont know what is she then  i dont know that either oh its the strangest story you ever heard i must tell you but youll never believe  venters women were always puzzles to me but for all that if this girl aint a child an as innocent im no fit person to think of virtue an goodness in anybody are you goin to be square with her  i amso help me god  i reckoned so mebbe my temper oughtnt led me to make sure but man shes a woman in all but years shes sweeter n the sage  lassiter i know i know and the hell of it is that in spite of her innocence and charm shesshes not what she seems  i wouldnt want toof course i couldnt call you a liar venters said the older man  whats more she was oldrings masked rider  venters expected to floor his friend with that statement but he was not in any way prepared for the shock his words gave for an instant he was astounded to see lassiter stunned then his own passionate eagerness to unbosom himself to tell the wonderful story precluded any other thought  son tell me all about this presently said lassiter as he seated himself on a stone and wiped his moist brow  thereupon venters began his narrative at the point where he had shot the rustler and oldrings masked rider and he rushed through it telling all not holding back even besss unreserved avowal of her love or his deepest emotions  thats the story he said concluding i love her though ive never told her if i did tell her id be ready to marry her and that seems impossible in this country id be afraid to risk taking her anywhere so i intend to do the best i can for her here  the longer i live the stranger life is mused lassiter with downcast eyes im reminded of somethin you once said to jane about hands in her game of life theres that unseen hand of power an tulls black hand an my red one an your indifferent one an the girls little brown helpless one an venters theres another one thats allwise an allwonderful thats the hand guidin jane withersteens game of life your storys one to daze a far clearer head than mine i cant offer no advice even if you asked for it mebbe i can help you anyway ill hold oldrin up when he comes to the village an find out about this girl i knew the rustler years ago hell remember me  lassiter if i ever meet oldring ill kill him cried venters with sudden intensity  i reckon thatd be perfectly natural replied the rider  make him think bess is deadas she is to him and that old life  sure sure son cool down now if youre goin to begin pullin guns on tull an oldin you want to be cool i reckon though youd better keep hid here well i must be leavin  one thing lassiter youll not tell jane about bess please dont  i reckon not but i wouldnt be afraid to bet that after shed got over anger at your secrecyventers shed be furious once in her lifeshed think more of you i dont mind sayin for myself that i think youre a good deal of a man  in the further ascent venters halted several times with the intention of saying goodby yet he changed his mind and kept on climbing till they reached balancing rock lassiter examined the huge rock listened to venterss idea of its position and suggestion and curiously placed a strong hand upon it  hold on cried venters i heaved at it once and have never gotten over my scare  well you do seem uncommon nervous replied lassiter much amused now as for me why i always had the funniest notion to roll stones when i was a kid i did it an the bigger i got the bigger stones id roll aint that funny honesteven now i often get off my hoss just to tumble a big stone over a precipice en watch it drop en listen to it bang an boom ive started some slides in my time an dont you forget it i never seen a rock i wanted to roll as bad as this one wouldnt there jest be roarin crashin hell down that trail  youd close the outlet forever exclaimed venters well goodby lassiter keep my secret and dont forget me and be mighty careful how you get out of the valley below the rustlers canyon isnt more than three miles up the pass now youve tracked me here ill never feel safe again  in his descent to the valley venterss emotion roused to stirring pitch by the recital of his love story quieted gradually and in its place came a sober thoughtful mood all at once he saw that he was serious because he would never more regain his sense of security while in the valley what lassiter could do another skilful tracker might duplicate among the many riders with whom venters had ridden he recalled no one who could have taken his trail at cottonwoods and have followed it to the edge of the bare slope in the pass let alone up that glistening smooth stone lassiter however was not an ordinary rider instead of hunting cattle tracks he had likely spent a goodly portion of his life tracking men it was not improbable that among oldrings rustlers there was one who shared lassiters gift for trailing and the more venters dwelt on this possibility the more perturbed he grew  lassiters visit moreover had a disquieting effect upon bess and venters fancied that she entertained the same thought as to future seclusion the breaking of their solitude though by a wellmeaning friend had not only dispelled all its dream and much of its charm but had instilled a canker of fear both had seen the footprint in the sand  venters did no more work that day sunset and twilight gave way to night and the canyon bird whistled its melancholy notes and the wind sang softly in the cliffs and the campfire blazed and burned down to red embers to venters a subtle difference was apparent in all of these or else the shadowy change had been in him he hoped that on the morrow this slight depression would have passed away  in that measure however he was doomed to disappointment furthermore bess reverted to a wistful sadness that he had not observed in her since her recovery his attempt to cheer her out of it resulted in dismal failure and consequently in a darkening of his own mood hard work relieved him still when the day had passed his unrest returned then he set to deliberate thinking and there came to him the startling conviction that he must leave surprise valley and take bess with him as a rider he had taken many chances and as an adventurer in deception pass he had unhesitatingly risked his life but now he would run no preventable hazard of besss safety and happiness and he was too keen not to see that hazard it gave him a pang to think of leaving the beautiful valley just when he had the means to establish a permanent and delightful home there one flashing thought tore in hot temptation through his mindwhy not climb up into the gorge roll balancing rock down the trail and close forever the outlet to deception pass that was the beast in meshowing his teeth muttered venters scornfully ill just kill him good and quick ill be fair to this girl if its the last thing i do on earth  another day went by in which he worked less and pondered more and all the time covertly watched bess her wistfulness had deepened into downright unhappiness and that made his task to tell her all the harder he kept the secret another day hoping by some chance she might grow less moody and to his exceeding anxiety she fell into far deeper gloom out of his own secret and the torment of it he divined that she too had a secret and the keeping of it was torturing her as yet he had no plan thought out in regard to how or when to leave the valley but he decided to tell her the necessity of it and to persuade her to go furthermore he hoped his speaking out would induce her to unburden her own mind  bess whats wrong with you he asked  nothing she answered with averted face  venters took hold of her gently though masterfully forced her to meet his eyes  you cant look at me and lie he said nowwhats wrong with you youre keeping something from me well ive got a secret too and i intend to tell it presently  ohi have a secret i was crazy to tell you when you came back thats why i was so silly about everything i kept holding my secret backgloating over it but when lassiter came i got an ideathat changed my mind then i hated to tell you  are you going to now  yesyes i was coming to it i tried yesterday but you were so cold i was afraid i couldnt keep it much longer  very well most mysterious lady tell your wonderful secret  you neednt laugh she retorted with a first glimpse of reviving spirit i can take the laugh out of you in one second  its a go  she ran through the spruces to the cave and returned carrying something which was manifestly heavy upon nearer view he saw that whatever she held with such evident importance had been bound up in a black scarf he well remembered that alone was sufficient to make him tingle with curiosity  have you any idea what i did in your absence she asked  i imagine you lounged about waiting and watching for me he replied smiling ive my share of conceit you know  youre wrong i worked look at my hands she dropped on her knees close to where he sat and carefully depositing the black bundle she held out her hands the palms and inside of her fingers were white puckered and worn  why bess youve been fooling in the water he said  fooling look here with deft fingers she spread open the black scarf and the bright sun shone upon a dull glittering heap of gold  gold he ejaculated  yes gold see pounds of gold i found itwashed it out of the streampicked it out grain by grain nugget by nugget  gold he cried  yes nownow laugh at my secret  for a long minute venters gazed then he stretched forth a hand to feel if the gold was real  gold he almost shouted bess there are hundredsthousands of dollars worth here  he leaned over to her and put his hand strong and clenching now on hers  is there more where this came from he whispered  plenty of it all the way up the stream to the cliff you know ive often washed for gold then ive heard the men talk i think theres no great quantity of gold here but enough forfor a fortune for you  thatwasyoursecret  yes i hate gold for it makes men mad ive seen them drunk with joy and dance and fling themselves around ive seen them curse and rave ive seen them fight like dogs and roll in the dust ive seen them kill each other

while i knew we must go i was distracted over how to go and what to do now weve gold once beyond sterling well be safe from rustlers weve no others to fear  oh listen bess venters now heard his voice

as my wife    chapter xvii wrangles race run  the plan eventually decided upon by the lovers was for venters to go to the village secure a horse and some kind of a disguise for bess or at least less striking apparel than her present garb and to return posthaste to the valley meanwhile she would add to their store of gold then they would strike the long and perilous trail to ride out of utah in the event of his inability to fetch back a horse for her they intended to make the giant sorrel carry double the gold a little food saddle blankets and venterss guns were to compose the light outfit with which they would make the start  i love this beautiful place said bess its hard to think of leaving it  hard well i should think so replied venters maybein years but he did not complete in words his thought that might be possible to return after many years of absence and change  once again bess bade venters farewell under the shadow of balancing rock and this time it was with whispered hope and tenderness and passionate trust long after he had left her all down through the outlet to the pass the clinging clasp of her arms the sweetness of her lips and the sense of a new and exquisite birth of character in her remained hauntingly and thrillingly in his mind the girl who had sadly called herself nameless and nothing had been marvelously transformed in the moment of his avowal of love it was something to think over something to warm his heart but for the present it had absolutely to be forgotten so that all his mind could be addressed to the trip so fraught with danger  he carried only his rifle revolver and a small quantity of bread and meat and thus lightly burdened he made swift progress down the slope and out into the valley darkness was coming on and he welcomed it stars were blinking when he reached his old hidingplace in the split of canyon wall and by their aid he slipped through the dense thickets to the grassy enclosure wrangle stood in the center of it with his head up and he appeared black and of gigantic proportions in the dim light venters whistled softly began a slow approach and then called the horse snorted and plunging away with dull heavy sound of hoofs he disappeared in the gloom wilder than ever muttered venters he followed the sorrel into the narrowing split between the walls and presently had to desist because he could not see a foot in advance as he went back toward the open wrangle jumped out of an ebony shadow of cliff and like a thunderbolt shot huge and black past him down into the starlit glade deciding that all attempts to catch wrangle at night would be useless venters repaired to the shelving rock where he had hidden saddle and blanket and there went to sleep  the first peep of day found him stirring and as soon as it was light enough to distinguish objects he took his lasso off his saddle and went out to rope the sorrel he espied wrangle at the lower end of the cove and approached him in a perfectly natural manner when he got near enough wrangle evidently recognized him but was too wild to stand he ran up the glade and on into the narrow lane between the walls this favored venterss speedy capture of the horse so coiling his noose ready to throw he hurried on wrangle let venters get to within a hundred feet and then he broke but as he plunged by rapidly getting into his stride venters made a perfect throw with the rope he had time to brace himself for the shock nevertheless wrangle threw him and dragged him several yards before halting  you wild devil said venters as he slowly pulled wrangle up dont you know me come nowold fellowsoso  wrangle yielded to the lasso and then to venterss strong hand he was as straggly and wildlooking as a horse left to roam free in the sage he dropped his long ears and stood readily to be saddled and bridled but he was exceedingly sensitive and quivered at every touch and sound venters led him to the thicket and bending the close saplings to let him squeeze through at length reached the open sharp survey in each direction assured him of the usual lonely nature of the canyon then he was in the saddle riding south  wrangles long swinging canter was a wonderful groundgainer his stride was almost twice that of an ordinary horse and his endurance was equally remarkable venters pulled him in occasionally and walked him up the stretches of rising ground and along the soft washes wrangle had never yet shown any indication of distress while venters rode him nevertheless there was now reason to save the horse therefore venters did not resort to the hurry that had characterized his former trip he camped at the last water in the pass what distance that was to cottonwoods he did not know he calculated however that it was in the neighborhood of fifty miles  early in the morning he proceeded on his way and about the middle of the forenoon reached the constricted gap that marked the southerly end of the pass and through which led the trail up to the sagelevel he spied out lassiters tracks in the dust but no others and dismounting he straightened out wrangles bridle and began to lead him up the trail the short climb more severe on beast than on man necessitated a rest on the level above and during this he scanned the wide purple reaches of slope  wrangle whistled his pleasure at the smell of the sage remounting venters headed up the white trail with the fragrant wind in his face he had proceeded for perhaps a couple of miles when wrangle stopped with a suddenness that threw venters heavily against the pommel  whats wrong old boy called venters looking down for a loose shoe or a snake or a foot lamed by a pickedup stone unrewarded he raised himself from his scrutiny wrangle stood stiff head high with his long ears erect thus guided venters swiftly gazed ahead to make out a dustclouded dark group of horsemen riding down the slope if they had seen him it apparently made no difference in their speed or direction  wonder who they are exclaimed venters he was not disposed to run his cool mood tightened under grip of excitement as he reflected that whoever the approaching riders were they could not be friends he slipped out of the saddle and led wrangle behind the tallest sagebrush it might serve to conceal them until the riders were close enough for him to see who they were after that he would be indifferent to how soon they discovered him  after looking to his rifle and ascertaining that it was in working order he watched and as he watched slowly the force of a bitter fierceness long dormant gathered ready to flame into life if those riders were not rustlers he had forgotten how rustlers looked and rode on they came a small group so compact and dark that he could not tell their number how unusual that their horses did not see wrangle but such failure venters decided was owing to the speed with which they were traveling they moved at a swift canter affected more by rustlers than by riders venters grew concerned over the possibility that these horsemen would actually ride down on him before he had a chance to tell what to expect when they were within three hundred yards he deliberately led wrangle out into the trail  then he heard shouts and the hard scrape of sliding hoofs and saw horses rear and plunge back with upflung heads and flying manes several little white puffs of smoke appeared sharply against the black background of riders and horses and shots rang out bullets struck far in front of venters and whipped up the dust and then hummed low into the sage the range was great for revolvers but whether the shots were meant to kill or merely to check advance they were enough to fire that waiting ferocity in venters slipping his arm through the bridle so that wrangle could not get away venters lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger twice  he saw the first horseman lean sideways and fall he saw another lurch in his saddle and heard a cry of pain then wrangle plunging in fright lifted venters and nearly threw him he jerked the horse down with a powerful hand and leaped into the saddle wrangle plunged again dragging his bridle that venters had not had time to throw in place bending over with a swift movement he secured it and dropped the loop over the pommel then with grinding teeth he looked to see what the issue would be  the band had scattered so as not to afford such a broad mark for bullets the riders faced venters some with redbelching guns he heard a sharper report and just as wrangle plunged again he caught the whim of a leaden missile that would have hit him but for wrangles sudden jump a swift hot wave turning cold passed over venters deliberately he picked out the one rider with a carbine and killed him wrangle snorted shrilly and bolted into the sage venters let him run a few rods then with iron arm checked him  five riders surely rustlers were left one leaped out of the saddle to secure his fallen comrades carbine a shot from venters which missed the man but sent the dust flying over him made him run back to his horse then they separated the crippled rider went one way the one frustrated in his attempt to get the carbine rode another venters thought he made out a third rider carrying a strangeappearing bundle and disappearing in the sage but in the rapidity of action and vision he could not discern what it was two riders with three horses swung out to the right afraid of the long riflea burdensome weapon seldom carried by rustlers or ridersthey had been put to rout  suddenly venters discovered that one of the two men last noted was riding jane withersteens horse bellsthe beautiful bay racer she had given to lassiter venters uttered a savage outcry then the small wiry froglike shape of the second rider and the ease and grace of his seat in the saddlethings so strikingly incongruousgrew more and more familiar in venterss sight  jerry card cried venters  it was indeed tulls righthand man such a white hot wrath inflamed venters that he fought himself to see with clearer gaze  its jerry card he exclaimed instantly and hes riding black star and leading night  the longkindling stormy fire in venterss heart burst into flame he spurred wrangle and as the horse lengthened his stride venters slipped cartridges into the magazine of his rifle till it was once again full card and his companion were now half a mile or more in advance riding easily down the slope venters marked the smooth gait and understood it when wrangle galloped out of the sage into the broad cattle trail down which venters had once tracked jane withersteens red herd this hardpacked trail from years of use was as clean and smooth as a road venters saw jerry card look back over his shoulder the other rider did likewise then the three racers lengthened their stride to the point where the swinging canter was ready to break into a gallop  wrangle the races on said venters grimly well canter with them and gallop with them and run with them well let them set the pace  venters knew he bestrode the strongest swiftest most tireless horse ever ridden by any rider across the utah uplands recalling jane withersteens devoted assurance that night could run neck and neck with wrangle and black star could show his heels to him venters wished that jane were there to see the race to recover her blacks and in the unqualified superiority of the giant sorrel then venters found himself thankful that she was absent for he meant that race to end in jerry cards death the first flush the raging of venterss wrath passed to leave him in sullen almost cold possession of his will it was a deadly mood utterly foreign to his nature engendered fostered and released by the wild passions of wild men in a wild country the strength in him thenthe thing rife in him that was not hate but something as remorselessmight have been the fiery fruition of a whole lifetime of vengeful quest nothing could have stopped him  venters thought out the race shrewdly the rider on bells would probably drop behind and take to the sage what he did was of little moment to venters to stop jerry card his evil hidden career as well as his present flight and then to catch the blacksthat was all that concerned venters the cattle trail wound for miles and miles down the slope venters saw with a riders keen vision ten fifteen twenty miles of clear purple sage there were no oncoming riders or rustlers to aid card his only chance to escape lay in abandoning the stolen horses and creeping away in the sage to hide in ten miles wrangle could run black star and night off their feet and in fifteen he could kill them outright so venters held the sorrel in letting card make the running it was a long race that would save the blacks  in a few miles of that swinging canter wrangle had crept appreciably closer to the three horses jerry card turned again and when he saw how the sorrel had gained he put black star to a gallop night and bells on either side of him swept into his stride  venters loosened the rein on wrangle and let him break into a gallop the sorrel saw the horses ahead and wanted to run but venters restrained him and in the gallop he gained more than in the canter bells was fast in that gait but black star and night had been trained to run slowly wrangle closed the gap down to a quarter of a mile and crept closer and closer  jerry card wheeled once more venters distinctly saw the red flash of his red face this time he looked long venters laughed he knew what passed in cards mind the rider was trying to make out what horse it happened to be that thus gained on jane withersteens peerless racers wrangle had so long been away from the village that not improbably jerry had forgotten besides whatever jerrys qualifications for his fame as the greatest rider of the sage certain it was that his best point was not farsightedness he had not recognized wrangle after what must have been a searching gaze he got his comrade to face about this action gave venters amusement it spoke so surely of the facts that neither card nor the rustler actually knew their danger yet if they kept to the trailand the last thing such men would do would be to leave itthey were both doomed  this comrade of cards whirled far around in his saddle and he even shaded his eyes from the sun he too looked long then all at once he faced ahead again and bending lower in the saddle began to fling his right arm up and down that flinging venters knew to be the lashing of bells jerry also became active and the three racers lengthened out into a run  now wrangle cried venters run you big devil run  venters laid the reins on wrangles neck and dropped the loop over the pommel the sorrel needed no guiding on that smooth trail he was surerfooted in a run than at any other fast gait and his running gave the impression of something devilish he might now have been actuated by venterss spirit undoubtedly his savage running fitted the mood of his rider venters bent forward swinging with the horse and gripped his rifle his eye measured the distance between him and jerry card  in less than two miles of running bells began to drop behind the blacks and wrangle began to overhaul him venters anticipated that the rustler would soon take to the sage yet he did not not improbably he reasoned that the powerful sorrel could more easily overtake bells in the heavier going outside of the trail soon only a few hundred yards lay between bells and wrangle turning in his saddle the rustler began to shoot and the bullets beat up little whiffs of dust venters raised his rifle ready to take snap shots and waited for favorable opportunity when bells was out of line with the forward horses venters had it in him to kill these men as if they were skunkbitten coyotes but also he had restraint enough to keep from shooting one of janes beloved arabians  no great distance was covered however before bells swerved to the left out of line with black star and night then venters aiming high and waiting for the pause between wrangles great strides began to take snap shots at the rustler the fleeing rider presented a broad target for a rifle but he was moving swiftly forward and bobbing up and down moreover shooting from wrangles back was shooting from a thunderbolt and added to that was the danger of a lowplaced bullet taking effect on bells yet despite these considerations making the shot exceedingly difficult venterss confidence like his implacability saw a speedy and fatal termination of that rustlers race on the sixth shot the rustler threw up his arms and took a flying tumble off his horse he rolled over and over hunched himself to a halferect position fell and then dragged himself into the sage as venters went thundering by he peered keenly into the sage but caught no sign of the man bells ran a few hundred yards slowed up and had stopped when wrangle passed him  again venters began slipping fresh cartridges into the magazine of his rifle and his hand was so sure and steady that he did not drop a single cartridge with the eye of a rider and the judgment of a marksman he once more measured the distance between him and jerry card wrangle had gained bringing him into rifle range venters was hard put to it now not to shoot but thought it better to withhold his fire jerry who in anticipation of a running fusillade had huddled himself into a little twisted ball on black stars neck now surmising that this pursuer would make sure of not wounding one of the blacks rose to his natural seat in the saddle  in his mind perhaps as certainly as in venterss this moment was the beginning of the real race  venters leaned forward to put his hand on wrangles neck then backward to put it on his flank under the shaggy dusty hair trembled and vibrated and rippled a wonderful muscular activity but wrangles flesh was still cold what a coldblooded brute thought venters and felt in him a love for the horse he had never given to any other it would not have been humanly possible for any rider even though clutched by hate or revenge or a passion to save a loved one or fear of his own life to be astride the sorrel to swing with his swing to see his magnificent stride and hear the rapid thunder of his hoofs to ride him in that race and not glory in the ride  so with his passion to kill still keen and unabated venters lived out that ride and drank a riders sagesweet cup of wildness to the dregs  when wrangles long mane lashing in the wind stung venters in the cheek the sting added a beat to his flying pulse he bent a downward glance to try to see wrangles actual stride and saw only twinkling darting streaks and the white rush of the trail he watched the sorrels savage head pointed level his mouth still closed and dry but his nostrils distended as if he were snorting unseen fire wrangle was the horse for a race with death upon each side venters saw the sage merged into a sailing colorless wall in front sloped the lay of ground with its purple breadth split by the white trail the wind blowing with heavy steady blast into his face sickened him with enduring sweet odor and filled his ears with a hollow rushing roar  then for the hundredth time he measured the width of space separating him from jerry card wrangle had ceased to gain the blacks were proving their fleetness venters watched jerry card admiring the little riders horsemanship he had the incomparable seat of the upland rider born in the saddle it struck venters that card had changed his position or the position of the horses presently venters remembered positively that jerry had been leading night on the righthand side of the trail the racer was now on the side to the left noit was black star but venters argued in amaze jerry had been mounted on black star another clearer keener gaze assured venters that black star was really riderless night now carried jerry card  hes changed from one to the other ejaculated venters realizing the astounding feat with unstinted admiration changed at full speed jerry card thats what youve done unless im drunk on the smell of sage but ive got to see the trick before i believe it  thenceforth while wrangle sped on venters glued his eyes to the little rider jerry card rode as only he could ride of all the daring horsemen of the uplands jerry was the one rider fitted to bring out the greatness of the blacks in that long race he had them on a dead run but not yet at the last strained and killing pace from time to time he glanced backward as a wise general in retreat calculating his chances and the power and speed of pursuers and the moment for the last desperate burst no doubt card with his life at stake gloried in that race perhaps more wildly than venters for he had been born to the sage and the saddle and the wild he was more than half horse not until the last callthe sudden upflashing instinct of selfpreservationwould he lose his skill and judgment and nerve and the spirit of that race venters seemed to read jerrys mind that little crimestained rider was actually thinking of his horses husbanding their speed handling them with knowledge of years glorying in their beautiful swift racing stride and wanting them to win the race when his own life hung suspended in quivering balance again jerry whirled in his saddle and the sun flashed red on his face turning he drew black star closer and closer toward night till they ran side by side as one horse then card raised himself in the saddle slipped out of the stirrups and somehow twisting himself leaped upon black star he did not even lose the swing of the horse like a leech he was there in the other saddle and as the horses separated his right foot that had been apparently doubled under him shot down to catch the stirrup the grace and dexterity and daring of that riders act won something more than admiration from venters  for the distance of a mile jerry rode black star and then changed back to night but all jerrys skill and the running of the blacks could avail little more against the sorrel  venters peered far ahead studying the lay of the land straightaway for five miles the trail stretched and then it disappeared in hummocky ground to the right some few rods venters saw a break in the sage and this was the rim of deception pass across the dark cleft gleamed the red of the opposite wall venters imagined that the trail went down into the pass somewhere north of those ridges and he realized that he must and would overtake jerry card in this straight course of five miles  cruelly he struck his spurs into wrangles flanks a light touch of spur was sufficient to make wrangle plunge and now with a ringing wild snort he seemed to double up in muscular convulsions and to shoot forward with an impetus that almost unseated venters the sage blurred by the trail flashed by and the wind robbed him of breath and hearing jerry card turned once more and the way he shifted to black star showed he had to make his last desperate running venters aimed to the side of the trail and sent a bullet puffing the dust beyond jerry venters hoped to frighten the rider and get him to take to the sage but jerry returned the shot and his ball struck dangerously close in the dust at wrangles flying feet venters held his fire then while the rider emptied his revolver for a mile with black star leaving night behind and doing his utmost wrangle did not gain for another mile he gained little if at all in the third he caught up with the now galloping night and began to gain rapidly on the other black  only a hundred yards now stretched between black star and wrangle the giant sorrel thundered onand onand on in every yard he gained a foot he was whistling through his nostrils wringing wet flying lather and as hot as fire savage as ever strong as ever fast as ever but each tremendous stride jarred venters out of the saddle wrangles power and spirit and momentum had begun to run him off his legs wrangles great race was nearly wonand run venters seemed to see the expanse before him as a vast sheeted purple plain sliding under him black star moved in it as a blur the rider jerry card appeared a mere dot bobbing dimly wrangle thundered ononon venters felt the increase in quivering straining shock after every leap flecks of foam flew into venterss eyes burning him making him see all the sage as red but in that red haze he saw or seemed to see black star suddenly riderless and with broken gait wrangle thundered on to change his pace with a violent break then venters pulled him hard from run to gallop gallop to canter canter to trot trot to walk and walk to stop the great sorrel ended his race  venters looked back black star stood riderless in the trail jerry card had taken to the sage far up the white trail night came trotting faithfully down venters leaped off still half blind reeling dizzily in a moment he had recovered sufficiently to have a care for wrangle rapidly he took off the saddle and bridle the sorrel was reeking heaving whistling shaking but he had still the strength to stand and for him venters had no fears  as venters ran back to black star he saw the horse stagger on shaking legs into the sage and go down in a heap upon reaching him venters removed the saddle and bridle black star had been killed on his legs venters thought he had no hope for the stricken horse black star lay flat covered with bloody froth mouth wide tongue hanging eyes glaring and all his beautiful body in convulsions  unable to stay there to see janes favorite racer die venters hurried up the trail to meet the other black on the way he kept a sharp lookout for jerry card venters imagined the rider would keep well out of range of the rifle but as he would be lost on the sage without a horse not improbably he would linger in the vicinity on the chance of getting back one of the blacks night soon came trotting up hot and wet and run out venters led him down near the others and unsaddling him let him loose to rest night wearily lay down in the dust and rolled proving himself not yet spent  then venters sat down to rest and think whatever the risk he was compelled to stay where he was or comparatively near for the night the horses must rest and drink he must find water he was now seventy miles from cottonwoods and he believed close to the canyon where the cattle trail must surely turn off and go down into the pass after a while he rose to survey the valley  he was very near to the ragged edge of a deep canyon into which the trail turned the ground lay in uneven ridges divided by washes and these sloped into the canyon following the canyon line he saw where its rim was broken by other intersecting canyons and farther down red walls and yellow cliffs leading toward a deep blue cleft that he made sure was deception pass walking out a few rods to a promontory he found where the trail went down the descent was gradual along a stonewalled trail and venters felt sure that this was the place where oldring drove cattle into the pass there was however no indication at all that he ever had driven cattle out at this point oldring had many holes to his burrow  in searching round in the little hollows venters much to his relief found water he composed himself to rest and eat some bread and meat while he waited for a sufficient time to elapse so that he could safely give the horses a drink he judged the hour to be somewhere around noon wrangle lay down to rest and night followed suit so long as they were down venters intended to make no move the longer they rested the better and the safer it would be to give them water by and by he forced himself to go over to where black star lay expecting to find him dead instead he found the racer partially if not wholly recovered there was recognition even fire in his big black eyes venters was overjoyed he sat by the black for a long time black star presently labored to his feet with a heave and a groan shook himself and snorted for water venters repaired to the little pool he had found filled his sombrero and gave the racer a drink black star gulped it at one draught as if it were but a drop and pushed his nose into the hat and snorted for more venters now led night down to drink and after a further time black star also then the blacks began to graze  the sorrel had wandered off down the sage between the trail and the canyon once or twice he disappeared in little swales finally venters concluded wrangle had grazed far enough and taking his lasso he went to fetch him back in crossing from one ridge to another he saw where the horse had made muddy a pool of water it occurred to venters then that wrangle had drunk his fill and did not seem the worse for it and might be anything but easy to catch and true enough he could not come within roping reach of the sorrel he tried for an hour and gave up in disgust wrangle did not seem so wild as simply perverse in a quandary venters returned to the other horses hoping much yet doubting more that when wrangle had grazed to suit himself he might be caught  as the afternoon wore away venterss concern diminished yet he kept close watch on the blacks and the trail and the sage there was no telling of what jerry card might be capable venters sullenly acquiesced to the idea that the rider had been too quick and too shrewd for him strangely and doggedly however venters clung to his foreboding of cards downfall  the wind died away the red sun topped the far distant western rise of slope and the long creeping purple shadows lengthened the rims of the canyons gleamed crimson and the deep clefts appeared to belch forth blue smoke silence enfolded the scene  it was broken by a horrid longdrawn scream of a horse and the thudding of heavy hoofs venters sprang erect and wheeled south along the canyon rim near the edge came wrangle once more in thundering flight  venters gasped in amazement had the wild sorrel gone mad his head was high and twisted in a most singular position for a running horse suddenly venters descried a froglike shape clinging to wrangles neck jerry card somehow he had straddled wrangle and now stuck like a huge burr but it was his strange position and the sorrels wild scream that shook venterss nerves wrangle was pounding toward the turn where the trail went down he plunged onward like a blind horse more than one of his leaps took him to the very edge of the precipice  jerry card was bent forward with his teeth fast in the front of wrangles nose venters saw it and there flashed over him a memory of this trick of a few desperate riders he even thought of one rider who had worn off his teeth in this terrible hold to break or control desperate horses wrangle had indeed gone mad the marvel was what guided him was it the halfbrute the more than halfhorse instinct of jerry card whatever the mystery it was true and in a few more rods jerry would have the sorrel turning into the trail leading down into the canyon  nojerry whispered venters stepping forward and throwing up the rifle he tried to catch the little humped froglike shape over the sights it was moving too fast it was too small yet venters shot once twice the third time four times five all wasted shots and precious seconds  with a deepmuttered curse venters caught wrangle through the sights and pulled the trigger plainly he heard the bullet thud wrangle uttered a horrible strangling sound in swift death action he whirled and with one last splendid leap he cleared the canyon rim and he whirled downward with the little froglike shape clinging to his neck  there was a pause which seemed never ending a shock and an instant s silence  then up rolled a heavy crash a long roar of sliding rocks dying away in distant echo then silence unbroken  wrangles race was run    chapter xviii oldrings knell  some forty hours or more later venters created a commotion in cottonwoods by riding down the main street on black star and leading bells and night he had come upon bells grazing near the body of a dead rustler the only incident of his quick ride into the village  nothing was farther from venterss mind than bravado no thought came to him of the defiance and boldness of riding jane withersteens racers straight into the archplotters stronghold he wanted men to see the famous arabians he wanted men to see them dirty and dusty bearing all the signs of having been driven to their limit he wanted men to see and to know that the thieves who had ridden them out into the sage had not ridden them back venters had come for that and for morehe wanted to meet tull face to face if not tull then dyer if not dyer then anyone in the secret of these master conspirators such was venterss passion the meeting with the rustlers the unprovoked attack upon him the spilling of blood the recognition of jerry card and the horses the race and that last plunge of mad wrangleall these things fuel on fuel to the smoldering fire had kindled and swelled and leaped into living flame he could have shot dyer in the midst of his religious services at the altar he could have killed tull in front of wives and babes  he walked the three racers down the broad greenbordered village road he heard the murmur of running water from amber spring bitter waters for jane withersteen men and women stopped to gaze at him and the horses all knew him all knew the blacks and the bay as well as if it had been spoken venters read in the faces of men the intelligence that jane withersteens arabians had been known to have been stolen venters reined in and halted before dyers residence it was a low long stone structure resembling withersteen house the spacious front yard was green and luxuriant with grass and flowers gravel walks led to the huge porch a welltrimmed hedge of purple sage separated the yard from the church grounds birds sang in the trees water flowed musically along the walks and there were glad careless shouts of children for venters the beauty of this home and the serenity and its apparent happiness all turned red and black for venters a shade overspread the lawn the flowers the old vineclad stone house in the music of the singing birds in the murmur of the running water he heard an ominous sound quiet beautysweet musicinnocent laughter by what monstrous abortion of fate did these abide in the shadow of dyer  venters rode on and stopped before tulls cottage women stared at him with white faces and then flew from the porch tull himself appeared at the door bent low craning his neck his dark face flashed out of sight the door banged a heavy bar dropped with a hollow sound  then venters shook black stars bridle and sharply trotting led the other horses to the center of the village here at the intersecting streets and in front of the stores he halted once more the usual lounging atmosphere of that prominent corner was not now in evidence riders and ranchers and villagers broke up what must have been absorbing conversation there was a rush of many feet and then the walk was lined with faces  venterss glance swept down the line of silent stonefaced men he recognized many riders and villagers but none of those he had hoped to meet there was no expression in the faces turned toward him all of them knew him most were inimical but there were few who were not burning with curiosity and wonder in regard to the return of jane withersteens racers yet all were silent here were the familiar characteristicsmasked feelingstrange secretivenessexpressionless expression of mystery and hidden power  has anybody here seen jerry card queried venters in a loud voice  in reply there came not a word not a nod or shake of head not so much as dropping eye or twitching lipnothing but a quiet stony stare  been under the knife youve a fine knifewielder hereone tull i believe maybe youve all had your tongues cut out  this passionate sarcasm of venters brought no response and the stony calm was as oil on the fire within him  i see some of you pack guns too he added in biting scorn in the long tense pause strung keenly as a tight wire he sat motionless on black star all right he went on then let some of you take this message to tull tell him ive seen jerry card  tell him jerry card will never return  thereupon in the same dead calm venters backed black star away from the curb into the street and out of range he was ready now to ride up to withersteen house and turn the racers over to jane  hello venters a familiar voice cried hoarsely and he saw a man running toward him it was the rider judkins who came up and gripped venterss hand venters i could hev dropped when i seen them hosses but thet sight aint a marker to the looks of you whats wrong hev you gone crazy you must be crazy to ride in here this waywith them hossestalkie thet way about tull en jerry card  jud im not crazyonly mad clean through replied venters  mad now bern im glad to hear some of your old self in

 lordbern dont ask me thet im all muddled now tryin to figure things  venters told of the fight and the race with jerry card and its tragic conclusion  i knowed it i knowed all along that wrangle was

vigilante bunch hev taken to bein bodyguard for tull an dyer too  hasnt lassiter made a break yet inquired venters curiously  naw replied judkins scornfully jane turned his head hes mad in love over herfollers her like a dog he aint no more lassiter hes lost his nerve he doesnt look like the same feller its village talk everybody knows it he hasnt thrown a gun an he wont  jud ill bet he does

seemed to me the queerest these men stood to the bar alone an so close their big gunhilts butted together i seen oldrin was some surprised at first an lassiter was cool as ice they talked an presently at somethin lassiter said the rustler bawled out a curse an then he jest fell up against the bar an sagged there the gang in the saloon looked around an laughed an thets about all finally oldrin turned and it was easy to see somethin hed shook him yes sir thet big rustleryou know hes as broad as he is long an the powerfulest build of a manyes sir the nerve had been taken out of him then after a little he began to talk an said a lot to lassiter an by an by it didnt take much of an eye to see thet lassiter was gittin hit hard i never seen him anyway but cooler n icetill then he seemed to be hit harder n oldrin only he didnt roar out thet way he jest kind of sunk in an looked an looked an he didnt see a livin soul in thet saloon then he sort of come to an shakin handsmind you shakin hands with oldrinhe went out i couldnt help thinkin how easy even a boy could hev dropped the great gunman then wal the rustler stood at the bar fer a long time en he was seein things far off too then he

rustlers hev a pile of gold if it was gold dust or nugget gold id hev reason to think but its new coin gold as if it had jest come from the united states treasury an the coins genuine thets all been proved the truth is oldrins on a rampage a while back he lost his masked rider an they say hes wild about thet im wonderin if lassiter could hev told the rustler anythin about thet little masked hardridin devil ride he was most as good as jerry card an bern ive been wonderin if you know  judkins youre a good fellow interrupted venters some day ill tell you a story ive no time now take the horses to jane  judkins stared and then muttering to himself he mounted bells and stared again at venters and then leading the other horses he rode into the grove and disappeared  once long before on the night venters had carried bess through the canyon and up into surprise valley he had experienced the strangeness of faculties singularly tinglingly acute and now the same sensation recurred but it was different in that he felt cold frozen mechanical incapable of free thought and all about him seemed unreal aloof remote he hid his rifle in the sage marking its exact location with extreme care then he faced down the lane and strode toward the center of the village perceptions flashed upon him the faint cold touch of the breeze a cold silvery tinkle of flowing water a cold sun shining out of a cold sky song of birds and laugh of children coldly distant cold and intangible were all things in earth and heaven colder and tighter stretched the skin over his face colder and harder grew the polished butts of his guns colder and steadier became his hands as he wiped the clammy sweat from his face or reached low to his gunsheaths men meeting him in the walk gave him wide berth in front of bevins store a crowd melted apart for his passage and their faces and whispers were faces and whispers of a dream he turned a corner to meet tull face to face eye to eye as once before he had seen this man pale to a ghastly livid white so again he saw the change tull stopped in his tracks with right hand raised and shaking suddenly it dropped and he seemed to glide aside to pass out of venterss sight next he saw many horses with bridles downall cleanlimbed dark bays or blacksrustlers horses loud voices and boisterous laughter rattle of dice and scrape of chair and clink of gold burst in mingled din from an open doorway he stepped inside  with the sight of smokehazed room and drinking cursing gambling darkvisaged men reality once more dawned upon venters  his entrance had been unnoticed and he bent his gaze upon the drinkers at the bar darkclothed darkfaced men they all were burned by the sun bowlegged as were most riders of the sage but neither lean nor gaunt then venterss gaze passed to the tables and swiftly it swept over the hardfeatured gamesters to alight upon the huge shaggy black head of the rustler chief  oldring he cried and to him his voice seemed to split a bell in his ears  it stilled the din  that silence suddenly broke to the scrape and crash of oldrings chair as he rose and then while he passed a great gloomy figure again the thronged room stilled in silence yet deeper  oldring a word with you continued venters  ho whats this boomed oldring in frowning scrutiny  come outside alone a word for youfrom your masked rider  oldring kicked a chair out of his way and lunged forward with a stamp of heavy boot that jarred the floor he waved down his muttering rising men  venters backed out of the door and waited hearing as no sound had ever before struck into his soul the rapid heavy steps of the rustler  oldring appeared and venters had one glimpse of his great breadth and bulk his goldbuckled belt with hanging guns his hightop boots with gold spurs in that moment venters had a strange unintelligible curiosity to see oldring alive the rustlers broad brow his large black eyes his sweeping beard as dark as the wing of a raven his enormous width of shoulder and depth of chest his whole splendid presence so wonderfully charged with vitality and force and strength seemed to afford venters an unutterable fiendish joy because for that magnificent manhood and life he meant cold and sudden death  oldring bess is alive but shes dead to youdead to the life you made her leaddead as you will be in one second  swift as lightning venterss glance dropped from oldrings rolling eyes to his hands one of them the right swept out then toward his gunand venters shot him through the heart  slowly oldring sank to his knees and the hand dragging at the gun fell away venterss strangely acute faculties grasped the meaning of that limp arm of the swaying hulk of the gasp and heave of the quivering beard but was that awful spirit in the black eyes only one of vitality  manwhydidntyouwait besswas oldrings whisper died under his beard and with a heavy lurch he fell forward  bounding swiftly away venters fled around the corner across the street and leaping a hedge he ran through yard orchard and garden to the sage here under cover of the tall brush he turned west and ran on to the place where he had hidden his rifle securing that he again set out into a run and circling through the sage came up behind jane withersteens stable and corrals with laboring dripping chest and pain as of a knife thrust in his side he stopped to regain his breath and while resting his eyes roved around in search of a horse doors and windows of the stable were open wide and had a deserted look one dejected lonely burro stood in the near corral strange indeed was the silence brooding over the once happy noisy home of jane withersteens pets  he went into the corral exercising care to leave no tracks and led the burro to the wateringtrough venters though not thirsty drank till he could drink no more then leading the burro over hard ground he struck into the sage and down the slope  he strode swiftly turning from time to time to scan the slope for riders his head just topped the level of sagebrush and the burro could not have been seen at all slowly the green of cottonwoods sank behind the slope and at last a wavering line of purple sage met the blue of sky  to avoid being seen to get away to hide his trailthese were the sole ideas in his mind as he headed for deception pass and he directed all his acuteness of eye and ear and the keenness of a riders judgment for distance and ground to stern accomplishment of the task he kept to the sage far to the left of the trail leading into the pass he walked ten miles and looked back a thousand times always the graceful purple wave of sage remained wide and lonely a clear undotted waste coming to a stretch of rocky ground he took advantage of it to cross the trail and then continued down on the right at length he persuaded himself that he would be able to see riders mounted on horses before they could see him on the little burro and he rode bareback  hour by hour the tireless burro kept to his faithful steady trot the sun sank and the long shadows lengthened down the slope moving veils of purple twilight crept out of the hollows and mustering and forming on the levels soon merged and shaded into night venters guided the burro nearer to the trail so that he could see its white line from the ridges and rode on through the hours  once down in the pass without leaving a trail he would hold himself safe for the time being when late in the night he reached the break in the sage he sent the burro down ahead of him and started an avalanche that all but buried the animal at the bottom of the trail bruised and battered as he was he had a moments elation for he had hidden his tracks once more he mounted the burro and rode on the hour was the blackest of the night when he made the thicket which inclosed his old camp here he turned the burro loose in the grass near the spring and then lay down on his old bed of leaves  he felt only vaguely as outside things the ache and burn and throb of the muscles of his body but a dammedup torrent of emotion at last burst its bounds and the hour that saw his release from immediate action was one that confounded him in the reaction of his spirit he suffered without understanding why he caught glimpses into himself into unlit darkness of soul the fire that had blistered him and the cold which had frozen him now united in one torturing possession of his mind and heart and like a fiery steed with iceshod feet ranged his being ran rioting through his blood trampling the resurging good dragging ever at the evil  out of the subsiding chaos came a clear question what had happened he had left the valley to go to cottonwoods why it seemed that he had gone to kill a manoldring the name riveted his consciousness upon the one man of all men upon earth whom he had wanted to meet he had met the rustler venters recalled the smoky haze of the saloon the darkvisaged men the huge oldring he saw him step out of the door a splendid specimen of manhood a handsome giant with purpleblack and sweeping beard he remembered inquisitive gaze of falcon eyes he heard himself repeating oldring bess is alive but shes dead to you and he felt himself jerk and his ears throbbed to the thunder of a gun and he saw the giant sink slowly to his knees was that only the vitality of himthat awful light in the eyesonly the harddying life of a tremendously powerful brute a broken whisper strange as death manwhydidntyou wait besswas and oldring plunged face forward dead  i killed him cried venters in remembering shock but it wasnt that ah the look in his eyes and his whisper  herein lay the secret that had clamored to him through all the tumult and stress of his emotions what a look in the eyes of a man shot through the heart it had been neither hate nor ferocity nor fear of men nor fear of death it had been no passionate glinting spirit of a fearless foe willing shot for shot life for life but lacking physical power distinctly recalled now never to be forgotten venters saw in oldrings magnificent eyes the rolling of great glad surprisesoftnesslove then came a shadow and the terrible superhuman striving of his spirit to speak oldring shot through the heart had fought and forced back death not for a moment in which to shoot or curse but to whisper strange words  what words for a dying man to whisper why had not venters waited for what that was no plea for life it was regret that there was not a moment of life left in which to speak bess washerein lay renewed torture for venters what had bess been to oldring the old question like a specter stalked from its grave to haunt him he had overlooked he had forgiven he had loved and he had forgotten and now out of the mystery of a dying mans whisper rose again that perverse unsatisfied jealous uncertainty bess had loved that splendid blackcrowned giantby her own confession she had loved him and in venterss soul again flamed up the jealous hell then into the clamoring hell burst the shot that had killed oldring and it rang in a wild fiendish gladness a hateful vengeful joy that passed to the memory of the love and light in oldrings eyes and the mystery in his whisper so the changing swaying emotions fluctuated in venterss heart  this was the climax of his year of suffering and the crucial struggle of his life and when the gray dawn came he rose a gloomy almost heartbroken man but victor over evil passions he could not change the past and even if he had not loved bess with all his soul he had grown into a man who would not change the future he had planned for her only and once for all he must know the truth know the worst stifle all these insistent doubts and subtle hopes and jealous fancies and kill the past by knowing truly what bess had been to oldring for that matter he knewhe had always known but he must hear it spoken then when they had safely gotten out of that wild country to take up a new and an absorbing life she would forget she would be happy and through that in the years to come he could not but find life worth living  all day he rode slowly and cautiously up the pass taking time to peer around corners to pick out hard ground and grassy patches and to make sure there was no one in pursuit in the night sometime he came to the smooth scrawled rocks dividing the valley and here set the burro at liberty he walked beyond climbed the slope and the dim starlit gorge then weary to the point of exhaustion he crept into a shallow cave and fell asleep  in the morning when he descended the trail he found the sun was pouring a golden stream of light through the arch of the great stone bridge surprise valley like a valley of dreams lay mystically soft and beautiful awakening to the golden flood which was rolling away its slumberous bands of mist brightening its walled faces  while yet far off he discerned bess moving under the silver spruces and soon the barking of the dogs told him that they had seen him he heard the mockingbirds singing in the trees and then the twittering of the quail ring and whitie came bounding toward him and behind them ran bess her hands outstretched  bern youre back youre back she cried in joy that rang of her loneliness  yes im back he said as she rushed to meet him  she had reached out for him when suddenly as she saw him closely something checked her and as quickly all her joy fled and with it her color leaving her pale and trembling  oh whats happened  a good deal has happened bess i dont need to tell you what and im played out worn out in mind more than body  dearyou look strange to me faltered bess  never mind that im all right theres nothing for you to be scared about things are going to turn out just as we have planned as soon as im rested well make a break to get out of the country only now right now i must know the truth about you  truth about me echoed bess shrinkingly she seemed to be casting back into her mind for a forgotten key venters himself as he saw her received a pang  yesthe truth bess dont misunderstand i havent changed that way i love you still ill love you more afterward life will be just as sweetsweeter to us well bebe married as soon as ever we can well be happybut theres a devil in me a perverse jealous devil then ive queer fancies i forgot for a long time now all those fiendish little whispers of doubt and faith and fear and hope come torturing me again ive got to kill them with the truth  ill tell you anything you want to know she replied frankly  then by heaven well have it over and done with bessdid oldring love you  certainly he did  diddid you love him  of course i told you so  how can you tell it so lightly cried venters passionately havent you any sense ofof he choked back speech he felt the rush of pain and passion he seized her in rude strong hands and drew her close he looked straight into her darkblue eyes they were shadowing with the old wistful light but they were as clear as the limpid water of the spring they were earnest solemn in unutterable love and faith and abnegation venters shivered he knew he was looking into her soul he knew she could not lie in that moment but that she might tell the truth looking at him with those eyes almost killed his belief in purity  what arewhat were you toto oldring he panted fiercely  i am his daughter she replied instantly  venters slowly let go of her there was a violent break in the force of his feelingthen creeping blankness  whatwas ityou said he asked in a kind of dull wonder  i am his daughter  oldrings daughter queried venters with life gathering in his voice  yes  with a passionately awakening start he grasped her hands and drew her close  all the timeyouve been oldrings daughter  yes of course all the timealways  but bess you told meyou let me thinki made out you wereasoso ashamed  it is my shame she said with voice deep and full and now the scarlet fired her cheek i told youim nothingnamelessjust bess oldrings girl  i knowi remember but i never thought he went on hurriedly huskily that timewhen you lay dyingyou prayedyousomehow i got the idea you were bad  bad she asked with a little laugh  she looked up with a faint smile of bewilderment and the absolute unconsciousness of a child venters gasped in the gathering might of the truth she did not understand his meaning  bess bess he clasped her in his arms hiding her eyes against his breast she must not see his face in that moment and he held her while he looked out across the valley in his dim and blinded sight in the blur of golden light and moving mist he saw oldring she was the rustlers nameless daughter oldring had loved her he had so guarded her so kept her from women and men and knowledge of life that her mind was as a childs that was part of the secretpart of the mystery that was the wonderful truth not only was she not bad but good pure innocent above all innocence in the worldthe innocence of lonely girlhood  he saw oldrings magnificent eyes inquisitive searching softening he saw them flare in amaze in gladness with love then suddenly strain in terrible effort of will he heard oldring whisper and saw him sway like a log and fall then a million bellowing thundering voicesgunshots of conscience thunderbolts of remorsedinned horribly in his ears he had killed besss father then a rushing wind filled his ears like a moan of wind in the cliffs a knell indeedoldrings knell  he dropped to his knees and hid his face against bess and grasped her with the hands of a drowning man  my god my god oh bess forgive me never mind what ive donewhat ive thought but forgive me ill give you my life ill live for you ill love you oh i do love you as no man ever loved a woman i want you to knowto remember that i fought a fight for youhowever blind i was i thoughti thoughtnever mind what i thoughtbut i loved youi asked you to marry me let thatlet me have that to hug to my heart oh bess i was driven and i might have known i could not rest nor sleep till i had this mystery solved god how things work out  bern youre weaktremblingyou talk wildly cried bess youve overdone your strength theres nothing to forgive theres no mystery except your love for me you have come back to me  and she clasped his head tenderly in her arms and pressed it closely to her throbbing breast    chapter xix fay  at the home of jane withersteen little fay was climbing lassiters knee  does oo love me she asked  lassiter who was as serious with fay as he was gentle and loving assured her in earnest and elaborate speech that he was her devoted subject fay looked thoughtful and appeared to be debating the duplicity of men or searching for a supreme test to prove this cavalier  does oo love my new mower she asked with bewildering suddenness  jane withersteen laughed and for the first time in many a day she felt a stir of her pulse and warmth in her cheek  it was a still drowsy summer of afternoon and the three were sitting in the shade of the

on lovelove of religion an duty an churchmen an riders an poor families an poor children yet you cant see what love ishow it changes a person listen an in tellin you milly ernes story ill show you how love changed her  milly an me was children when our family moved from missouri to texas an we growed up in texas ways same as if wed been born there we had been poor an there we prospered in time the little village where we went became a town an strangers an new families kept movin in milly was the belle them days i can see her now a little girl no bigger n a bird an as pretty she had the finest eyes dark blueblack when she was excited an beautiful all the time you remember millys eyes an she had lightbrown hair with streaks of gold an a mouth that every feller wanted to kiss  an about the time milly was the prettiest an the sweetest along came a young minister who began to ride some of a race with the other fellers for milly an he won milly had always been strong on religion an when she met frank erne she went in heart an soul for the salvation of souls fact was milly through study of the bible an attendin church an revivals went a little out of her head it didnt worry the old folks none an the only worry to me was millys everlastin prayin an workin to save my soul she never converted me but we was the best of comrades an i reckon no brother an sister ever loved each other better well frank erne an me hit up a great friendship he was a strappin feller good to look at an had the most pleasin ways his religion never bothered me for he could hunt an fish an ride an be a good feller after buffalo once he come pretty near to savin my life we got to be thick as brothers an he was the only man i ever seen who i thought was good enough for milly an the day they were married i got drunk for the only time in my life  soon after that i left homeit seems milly was the only one who could keep me homean i went to the bad as to prosperin i saw some pretty hard life in the pan handle an then i went north in them days kansas an nebraska was as bad come to think of it as these days right here on the border of utah i got to be pretty handy with guns an there wasnt many riders as could beat me ridin an i can say all modestlike that i never seen the white man who could track a hoss or a steer or a man with me afore i knowed it two years slipped by an all at once i got homesick en purled a bridle south  things at home had changed i never got over that homecomin mother was dead an in her grave father was a silent broken man killed already on his feet frank erne was a ghost of his old self through with workin through with preachin almost through with livin an milly was gone it was a long time before i got the story father had no mind left an frank erne was afraid to talk so i had to pick up whet d happened from different people  it pears that soon after i left home another preacher come to the little town an he an frank become rivals this feller was different from frank he preached some other kind of religion and he was quick an passionate where frank was slow an mild he went after people women specially in looks he couldnt compare to frank erne but he had power over women he had a voice an he talked an talked an preached an preached milly fell under his influence she became mightily interested in his religion frank had patience with her as was his way an let her be as interested as she liked all religions were devoted to one god he said an it wouldnt hurt milly none to study a different point of view so the new preacher often called on milly an sometimes in franks absence frank was a cattleman between sundays  along about this time an incident come off that i couldnt get much light on a stranger come to town an was seen with the preacher this stranger was a big man with an eye like blue ice an a beard of gold he had money an he peered a man of mystery an the town went to buzzin when he disappeared about the same time as a young woman known to be mightily interested in the new preachers religion then presently along comes a man from somewheres in illinois en he up an spots this preacher as a famous mormon proselyter that riled frank erne as nothin ever before an from rivals they come to be bitter enemies an it ended in frank goin to the meetinhouse where milly was listenin en before her en everybody else he called that preachercalled him well almost as hard as venters called tull here sometime back an frank followed up that call with a hosswhippin en he drove the proselyter out of town  people noticed so twas said that millys sweet disposition changed some said it was because she would soon become a mother en others said she was pinin after the new religion an there was women who said right out that she was pinin after the mormon anyway one mornin frank rode in from one of his trips to find milly gone he had no real near neighborslivin a little out of townbut those who was nearest said a wagon had gone by in the night an they though it stopped at her door well tracks always tell an there was the wagon tracks an hoss tracks an man tracks the news spread like wildfire that milly had run off from her husband everybody but frank believed it an wasnt slow in tellin why she run off mother had always hated that strange streak of millys takin up with the new religion as she had an she believed milly ran off with the mormon that hastened mothers death an she died unforgivin father wasnt the kind to bow down under disgrace or misfortune but he had surpassin love for milly an the loss of her broke him  from the minute i heard of millys disappearance i never believed she went off of her own free will i knew milly an i knew she couldnt have done that i stayed at home awhile tryin to make frank erne talk but if he knowed anythin then he wouldnt tell it so i set out to find milly an i tried to get on the trail of that proselyter i knew if i ever struck a town hed visited that id get a trail i knew too that nothin short of hell would stop his proselytin an i rode from town to town i had a blind faith that somethin was guidin me an as the weeks an months went by i growed into a strange sort of a man i guess anyway people were afraid of me two years after that way over in a corner of texas i struck a town where my man had been hed jest left people said he came to that town without a woman i backtrailed my man through arkansas an mississippi an the old trail got hot again in texas i found the town where he first went after leavin home an here i got track of milly i found a cabin where she had given birth to her baby there was no way to tell whether shed been kept a prisoner or not the feller who owned the place was a mean silent sort of a skunk an as i was leavin i jest took a chance an left my mark on him then i went home again  it was to find i hadnt any home no more father had been dead a year frank erne still lived in the house where milly had left him i stayed with him awhile an i grew old watchin him his farm had gone to weed his cattle had strayed or been rustled his house weathered till it wouldnt keep out rain nor wind an frank set on the porch and whittled sticks an day by day wasted away there was times when he ranted about like a crazy man but mostly he was always sittin an starin with eyes that made a man curse i figured frank had a secret fear that i needed to know an when i told him id trailed milly for near three years an had got trace of her an saw where shed had her baby i thought he would drop dead at my feet an when hed come round more naturallike he begged me to give up the trail but he wouldnt explain so i let him alone an watched him day en night  an i found there was one thing still precious to him an it was a little drawer where he kept his papers this was in the room where he slept an it peered he seldom slept but after bein patient i got the contents of that drawer an found two letters from milly one was a long letter written a few months after her disappearance she had been bound an gagged an dragged away from her home by three men an she named themhurd metzger slack they was strangers to her she was taken to the little town where i found trace of her two years after but she didnt send the letter from that town there she was penned in peared that the proselytes who had of course come on the scene was not runnin any risks of losin her she went on to say that for a time she was out of her head an when she got right again all that kept her alive was the baby it was a beautiful baby she said an all she thought an dreamed of was somehow to get baby back to its father an then shed thankfully lay down and die an the letter ended abrupt in the middle of a sentence en it wasnt signed  the second letter was written more than two years after the first it was from salt lake city it simply said that milly had heard her brother was on her trail she asked frank to tell her brother to give up the search because if he didnt she would suffer in a way too horrible to tell she didnt beg she just stated a fact an made the simple request an she ended that letter by sayin she would soon leave salt lake city with the man she had come to love en would never be heard of again  i recognized millys handwritin an i recognized her way of puttin things but that second letter told me of some great change in her ponderin over it i felt at last shed either come to love that feller an his religion or some terrible fear made her lie an say so i couldnt be sure which but of course i meant to find out ill say here if id known mormons then as i do now id left milly to her fate for mebbe she was right about what shed suffer if i kept on her trail but i was young an wild them days first i went to the town where shed first been taken an i went to the place where shed been kept i got that skunk who owned the place an took him out in the woods an made him tell all he knowed that wasnt much as to length but it was pure hellsfire in substance this time i left him some incapacitated for any more skunk work short of hell then i hit the trail for utah  that was fourteen years ago i saw the incomin of most of the mormons it was a wild country an a wild time i rode from town to town village to village ranch to ranch camp to camp i never stayed long in one place i never had but one idea i never rested four years went by an i knowed every trail in northern utah i kept on an as time went by an id begun to grow old in my search i had firmer blinder faith in whatever was guidin me once i read about a feller who sailed the seven seas an traveled the world an he had a story to tell an whenever he seen the man to whom he must tell that story he knowed him on sight i was like that only i had a question to ask an always i knew the man of whom i must ask so i never really lost the trail though for many years it was the dimmest trail ever followed by any man  then come a change in my luck along in central utah i rounded up hurd an i whispered somethin in his ear an watched his face an then throwed a gun against his bowels an he died with his teeth so tight shut i couldnt have pried them open with a knife slack an metzger that same year both heard me whisper the same question an neither would they speak a word when they lay dyin long before id learned no man of this breed or classor god knows whatwould give up any secrets i had to see in a mans fear of death the connections with milly ernes fate an as the years passed at long intervals i would find such a man  so as i drifted on the long trail down into southern utah my name preceded me an i had to meet a people prepared for me an ready with guns they made me a gunman an that suited me in all this time signs of the proselyter an the giant with the blueice eyes an the gold beard seemed to fade dimmer out of the trail only twice in ten years did i find a trace of that mysterious man who had visited the proselyter at my home village what he had to do with millys fate was beyond all hope for me to learn unless my guidin spirit led me to him as for the other man i knew as sure as i breathed en the stars shone en the wind blew that id meet him some day  eighteen years ive been on the trail an it led me to the last lonely villages of the utah border eighteen years i feel pretty old now i was only twenty when i hit that trail well as i told you back here a ways a gentile said jane withersteen could tell me about milly erne an show me her grave  the low voice ceased and lassiter slowly turned his sombrero round and round and appeared to be counting the silver ornaments on the band jane leaning toward him sat as if petrified listening intently waiting to hear more she could have shrieked but power of tongue and lips were denied her she saw only this sad gray passionworn man and she heard only the faint rustling of the leaves  well i came to cottonwoods went on lassiter an you showed me millys grave an though your teeth have been shut tighter n them of all the dead men lyin back along that trail jest the same you told me the secret ive lived these eighteen years to hear jane i said youd tell me without ever me askin i didnt need to ask my question here the day you remember when that fat party throwed a gun on me in your court an  oh hush whispered jane blindly holding up her hands  i seen in your face that dyer now a bishop was the proselyter who ruined milly erne  for an instant jane withersteens brain was a whirling chaos and she recovered to find herself grasping at lassiter like one drowning and as if by a lightning stroke she sprang from her dull apathy into exquisite torture  its a lie lassiter no no she moaned i swearyoure wrong  stop youd perjure yourself but ill spare you that you poor woman still blind still faithful listen i know let that settle it an i give up my purpose  what is ityou say  i give up my purpose ive come to see an feel differently i cant help poor milly an ive

speak now  i reckon i dont want to hear no more said lassiter  jane leaned against him as if some pentup force had rent its way out she fell into a paroxysm of weeping lassiter held her in silent sympathy by degrees she regained composure and she was rising sensible of being relieved of a weighty burden when a sudden start on lassiters part alarmed her  i heard hosseshosses with muffled hoofs he said and he got up guardedly  wheres fay asked jane hurriedly glancing round the shady knoll the brighthaired child who had appeared to be close all the time was not in sight  fay called jane  no answering shout of glee no patter of flying feet jane saw lassiter stiffen  fayohfay jane almost screamed  the leaves quivered and rustled a lonesome cricket chirped in the grass a bee hummed by the silence of the waning afternoon breathed hateful portent it terrified jane when had silence been so infernal  shesonlystrayedoutof earshot faltered jane looking at lassiter  pale rigid as a statue the rider stood not in listening searching posture but in one of doomed certainty suddenly he grasped jane with an iron hand and turning his face from her gaze he strode with her from the knoll  seefay played here lasta house of stones an sticks an heres a corral of pebbles with leaves for hosses said lassiter stridently and pointed to the ground back an forth she trailed here see shes buried somethina dead grasshoppertheres a tombstone here she went chasin a lizardsee the tiny streaked trail she pulled bark off this cottonwood look in the dust of the paththe letters you taught hershes drawn pictures of birds en hosses an people look a cross oh jane your cross  lassiter dragged jane on and as if from a book read the meaning of little fays trail all the way down the knoll through the shrubbery round and round a cottonwood fays vagrant fancy left records of her sweet musings and innocent play long had she lingered round a birdnest to leave therein the gaudy wing of a butterfly long had she played beside the running stream sending adrift vessels freighted with pebbly cargo then she had wandered through the deep grass her tiny feet scarcely turning a fragile blade and she had dreamed beside some old faded flowers thus her steps led her into the broad lane the little dimpled imprints of her bare feet showed cleancut in the dust they went a little way down the lane and then at a point where they stopped the great tracks of a man led out from the shrubbery and returned    chapter xx lassiters way  footprints told the story of little fays abduction in anguish jane withersteen turned speechlessly to lassiter and confirming her fears she saw him grayfaced aged all in a moment stricken as if by a mortal blow  then all her life seemed to fall about her in wreck and ruin  its all over she heard her voice whisper its ended im goingim going  where demanded lassiter suddenly looming darkly over her  toto those cruel men  speak names thundered lassiter  to bishop dyerto tull went on jane shocked into obedience  wellwhat for  i want little fay i cant live without her theyve stolen her as they stole milly ernes child i must have little fay i want only her i give up ill go and tell bishop dyerim broken ill tell him im ready for the yokeonly give me back fayandand ill marry tull  never hissed lassiter  his long arm leaped at her almost running he dragged her under the cottonwoods across the court into the huge hall of withersteen house and he shut the door with a force that jarred the heavy walls black star and night and bells since their return had been locked in this hall and now they stamped on the stone floor  lassiter released jane and like a dizzy man swayed from her with a hoarse cry and leaned shaking against a table where he kept his riders accoutrements he began to fumble in his saddlebags his action brought a clinking metallic soundthe rattling of guncartridges his fingers trembled as he slipped cartridges into an extra belt but as he buckled it over the one he habitually wore his hands became steady this second belt contained two guns smaller than the black ones swinging low and he slipped them round so that his coat hid them then he fell to swift action jane withersteen watched him fascinated but uncomprehending and she saw him rapidly saddle black star and night then he drew her into the light of the huge windows standing over her gripping her arm with fingers like cold steel  yes jane its endedbut youre not goin to dyer im goin instead  looking at himhe was so terrible of aspectshe could not comprehend his words who was this man with the face gray as death with eyes that would have made her shriek had she the strength with the strange ruthlessly bitter lips where was the gentle lassiter what was this presence in the hall about him about herthis cold invisible presence  yes its ended jane he was saying so awfully quiet and cool and implacable an im goin to make a little call ill lock you in here an when i get back have the saddlebags full of meat an bread an be ready to ride  lassiter cried jane  desperately she tried to meet his gray eyes in vain desperately she tried again fought herself as feeling and thought resurged in torment and she succeeded and then she knew  nonono she wailed you said youd foregone your vengeance you promised not to kill bishop dyer  if you want to talk to me about himleave off the bishop i dont understand that name or its use  oh hadnt you foregone your vengeance onon dyer  yes  butyour actionsyour wordsyour gunsyour terrible looks they dont seem foregoing vengeance

fays  no  ohfor whose  for yours  his blood on my soul whispered jane and she fell to her knees this was the longpending hour of fruition and the habit of yearsthe religious passion of her lifeleaped from lethargy and the long months of gradual drifting to doubt were as if they had never been if you spill his blood itll be on my souland on my fathers listen and she clasped his knees and clung there as he tried to raise her listen am i nothing to you  womandont trifle at words i love you an ill soon prove it  ill give myself to youill ride away with youmarry you if only youll spare him  his answer was a cold ringing terrible laugh  lassiterill love you spare him  no  she sprang up in despairing breaking spirit and encircled his neck with her arms and held him in an embrace that he strove vainly to loosen lassiter would you kill me im fighting my last fight for the principles of my youthlove of religion love of father you dont knowyou cant guess the truth and i cant speak ill im losing all im changing all ive gone through is nothing to this hour pity mehelp me in my weakness youre strong againoh so cruelly coldly strong youre killing me i see youfeel you as some other lassiter my master be mercifulspare him  his answer was a ruthless smile  she clung the closer to him and leaned her panting breast on him and lifted her face to his lassiter i do love you its leaped out of my agony it comes suddenly with a terrible blow of truth you are a man i never knew it till now some wonderful change came to me when you buckled on these guns and showed that gray awful face i loved you then all my life ive loved but never as now no woman can love like a broken woman if it were not for one thingjust one thingand yet i cant speak itid glory in your manhoodthe lion in you that means to

mehide me in some wild placeand love me and mend my broken heart spare him and take me away  she lifted her face closer and closer to his until their lips nearly touched and she hung upon his neck and with strength almost spent pressed and still pressed her palpitating body to his  kiss me she whispered blindly  nonot at your price he answered his voice had changed or she had lost clearness of hearing  kiss me are you a man kiss me and save me  jane you never played fair with me but now youre blisterin your lipsblackenin your soul with lies  by the memory of my motherby my bibleno no i have no bible but by my hope of heaven i swear i love you  lassiters gray lips formed soundless words that meant even her love could not avail to bend his will as if the hold of her arms was that of a childs he loosened it and stepped away  wait dont go oh hear a last word may a more just and merciful god than the god i was taught to worship judge meforgive mesave me for i can no longer keep silent lassiter in pleading for dyer ive been pleading more for my father my father was a mormon master close to the leaders of the church it was my father who sent dyer out to proselyte it was my father who had the blueice eye and the beard of gold it was my father you got trace of in the past years truly dyer ruined milly ernedragged her from her hometo utahto cottonwoods but it was for my father if milly erne was ever wife of a mormon that mormon was my father i never knewnever will know whether or not she was a wife blind i may be lassiterfanatically faithful to a false religion i may have been but i know justice and my father is beyond human justice surely he is meeting just punishmentsomewhere always it has appalled methe thought of your killing dyer for my fathers sins so i have prayed  jane the past is dead in my love for you i forgot the past this thing im about to do aint for myself or milly or fay its not because of anythin that ever happened in the past but for what is happenin right now its for you an listen since i was a boy ive never thanked god for anythin if there is a godan ive come to believe iti thank him now for the years that made me lassiter i can reach down en feel these big guns en know what i can do with them an jane only one of the miracles dyer professes to believe in can save him  again for jane withersteen came the spinning of her brain in darkness and as she whirled in endless chaos she seemed to be falling at the feet of a luminous figurea manlassiterwho had saved her from herself who could not be changed who would slay rightfully then she slipped into utter blackness  when she recovered from her faint she became aware that she was lying on a couch near the window in her sittingroom her brow felt damp and cold and wet some one was chafing her hands she recognized judkins and then saw that his lean hard face wore the hue and look of excessive agitation  judkins her voice broke weakly  aw miss withersteen youre comin round fine now jest lay still a little youre all right everythins all right  where ishe  who  lassiter  you neednt worry none about him  where is he tell meinstantly  wal hes in the other room patchin up a few

therell be some of an uprisin when tull gits back  i shall ride away with lassiter judkins tell me all you sawall you know about this killing she realized without wonder or amaze how judkinss one word affirming the death of dyerthat the catastrophe had fallenhad completed the change whereby she had been molded or beaten or broken into another woman she felt calm slightly cold strong as she had not been strong since the first shadow fell upon her  i jest saw about all of it miss withersteen an ill be glad to tell you if youll only hev patience with me said judkins earnestly you see ive been pecooliarly interested an natrully im some excited an i talk a lot thet mebbe aint necessary but i cant help thet  i was at the meetinhouse where dyer was holdin court you know he allus acts as magistrate an judge when tulls away an the trial was fer tryin whats left of my boy ridersthet helped me hold your cattlefer a lot of hatchedup things the boys never did were used to thet an the boys wouldnt hev minded bein locked up fer a while or hevin to dig ditches or whatever the judge laid down you see i divided the gold you give me among all my boys an they all hid it en they all feel rich howsomever court was adjourned before the judge passed sentence yes mam court was adjourned some strange an quick much as if lightnin hed struck the meetinhouse  i hed trouble attendin the trial but i got in there was a good many people there all my boys an judge dyer with his several clerks also he hed with him the five riders whove been guardin him pretty close of late they was carter wright jengessen an two new riders from stone bridge i didnt hear their names but i heard they was handy men with guns an they looked more like rustlers than riders anyway there they was the five all in a row  judge dyer was tellin willie kern one of my best an steadiest boysdyer was tellin him how there was a ditch opened near willies home lettin water through his lot where it hadnt ought to go an willie was tryin to git a word in to prove he wasnt at home all the day it happenedwhich was true as i knowbut willie couldnt git a word in an then judge dyer went on layin down the law an all to onct he happened to look down the long room an if ever any man turned to stone he was thet man  natrully i looked back to see what hed acted so powerful strange on the judge an there halfway up the room in the middle of the wide aisle stood lassiter all white an black he looked an i cant think of anythin he resembled onless its death venters made thet same room some still an chilly when he called tull but this was different i give my word miss withersteen thet i went cold to my very marrow i dont know why but lassiter had a way about him thets awful he spoke a worda namei couldnt understand it though he spoke clear as a bell i was too excited mebbe judge dyer must hev understood it an a lot more thet was mystery to me for he pitched forrard out of his chair right onto the platform  then them five riders dyers bodyguards they jumped up an two of them thet i found out afterward were the strangers from stone bridge they piled right out of a winder so quick you couldnt catch your breath it was plain they wasnt mormons  jengessen carter an wright eyed lassiter for what must hev been a second an seemed like an hour an they went white en strung but they didnt weaken nor lose their nerve  i hed a good look at lassiter he stood sort of stiff bendin a little an both his arms were crooked an his hands looked like a hawks claws but there aint no tellin how his eyes looked i know this though an thet is his eyes could read the mind of any man about to throw a gun an in watchin him of course i couldnt see the three men go fer their guns an though i was lookin right at lassiterlookin hardi couldnt see how he drawed he was quicker n eyesightthets all but i seen the red spurtin of his guns en heard his shots jest the very littlest instant before i heard the shots of the riders an when i turned wright an carter was down en jengessen whos tough like a steer was pullin the trigger of a wabblin gun but it was plain he was shot through plumb center an sudden he fell with a crash an his gun clattered on the floor  then there was a hell of a silence nobody breathed sartin i didnt anyway i saw lassiter slip a smokin gun back in a belt but he hadnt throwed either of the big black guns an i thought thet strange an all this was happenin quickyou cant imagine how quick  there come a scrapin on the floor an dyer got up his face like lead i wanted to watch lassiter but dyers face onct i seen it like thet glued my eyes i seen him go fer his gunwhy i could hev done better quickeran then there was a thunderin shot from lassiter an it hit dyers right arm an his gun went off as it dropped he looked at lassiter like a cornered sagewolf an sort of howled an reached down fer his gun hed jest picked it off the floor an was raisin it when another thunderin shot almost tore thet arm offso it seemed to me the gun dropped again an he went down on his knees kind of flounderin after it it was some strange an terrible to see his awful earnestness why would such a man cling so to life anyway he got the gun with left hand an was raisin it pullin trigger in his madness when the third thunderin shot hit his left arm an he dropped the gun again but thet left arm wasnt useless yet fer he grabbed up the gun an with a shakin aim thet would hev been pitiful to mein any other manhe began to shoot one wild bullet struck a man twenty feet from lassiter an it killed thet man as i seen afterward then come a bunch of thunderin shotsnine i calkilated after fer they come so quick i couldnt count theman i knew lassiter hed turned the black guns loose on dyer  im tellin you straight miss withersteen fer i want you to know afterward youll git over it ive seen some soulrackin scenes on this utah border but this was the awfulest i remember i closed my eyes an fer a minute i thought of the strangest things out of place there such as youd never dream would come to mind i saw the sage an runnin hossesan thets the beautfulest sight to mean i saw dim things in the dark an there was a kind of hummin in my ears an i remember distinctlyfer it was what made all these things whirl out of my mind an opened my eyesi remember distinctly it was the smell of gunpowder  the court had about adjourned fer thet judge he was on his knees en he wasnt prayin he was gaspin an tryin to press his big floppin crippled hands over his body lassiter had sent all those last thunderin shots through his body thet was lassiters way  an lassiter spoke en if i ever forgit his words ill never forgit the sound of his voice  proselyter i reckon youd better call quick on thet god who reveals hisself to you on earth because he wont be visitin the place youre goin to  an then i seen dyer look at his big hangin hands thet wasnt big enough fer the last work he set them to an he looked up at lassiter an then he stared horrible at somethin thet wasnt lassiter nor anyone there nor the room nor the branches of purple sage peepin into the winder whatever he seen it was with the look of a man who discovers somethin too late thets a terrible look an with a horrible understandin cry he slid forrard on his face  judkins paused in his narrative breathing heavily while he wiped his perspiring brow  thets about all he concluded lassiter left the meetinhouse an i hurried to catch up with him he was bleedin from three gunshots none of them much to bother him an we come right up here i found you layin in the hall an i hed to work some over you  jane withersteen offered up no prayer for dyers soul  lassiters step sounded in the hallthe familiar soft silverclinking stepand she heard it with thrilling new emotions in which was a vague joy in her very fear of him the door opened and she saw him the old lassiter slow easy gentle cool yet not exactly the same lassiter she rose and for a moment her eyes blurred and swam in tears  are youallall right she asked tremulously  i reckon  lassiter ill ride away with you hide me till danger is pasttill we are forgottenthen take me where you will your people shall be my people and your god my god  he kissed her hand with the quaint grace and courtesy that came to him in rare moments  black star an night are ready he said simply  his quiet mention of the black racers spurred jane to action hurrying to her room she changed to her riders suit packed her jewelry and the gold that was left and all the womans apparel for which there was space in the saddlebags and then returned to the hall black star stamped his ironshod hoofs and tossed his beautiful head and eyed her with knowing eyes  judkins i give bells to you said jane i hope you will always keep him and be good to him  judkins mumbled thanks that he could not speak fluently and his eyes flashed  lassiter strapped janes saddlebags upon black star and led the racers out into the court  judkins you ride with jane out into the sage if you see any riders comin shout quick twice an jane dont look back ill catch up soon well get to the break into the pass before midnight an then wait until mornin to go down  black star bent his graceful neck and bowed his noble head and his broad shoulders yielded as he knelt for jane to mount  she rode out of the court beside judkins through the grove across the wide lane into the sage and she realized that she was leaving withersteen house forever and she did not look back a strange dreamy calm peace pervaded her soul her doom had fallen upon her but instead of finding life no longer worth living she found it doubly significant full of sweetness as the western breeze beautiful and unknown as the sageslope stretching its purple sunset shadows before her she became aware of judkinss hand touching hers she heard him speak a husky goodby then into the place of bells shot the deadblack keen racy nose of night and she knew lassiter rode beside her  dontlookback he said and his voice too was not clear  facing straight ahead seeing only the waving shadowy sage jane held out her gauntleted hand to feel it enclosed in strong clasp so she rode on without a backward glance at the beautiful grove of cottonwoods she did not seem to think of the past of what she left forever but of the color and mystery and wildness of the sageslope leading down to deception pass and of the future she watched the shadows lengthen down the slope she felt the cool west wind sweeping by from the rear and she wondered at low yellow clouds sailing swiftly over her and beyond  dont lookback said lassiter  thickdriving belts of smoke traveled by on the wind and with it came a strong pungent odor of burning wood  lassiter had fired withersteen house but jane did not look back  a misty veil obscured the clear searching gaze she had kept steadfastly upon the purple slope and the dim lines of canyons it passed as passed the rolling clouds of smoke and she saw the valley deepening into the shades of twilight night came on swift as the fleet racers and stars peeped out to brighten and grow and the huge windy eastern heave of sagelevel paled under a rising moon and turned to silver blanched in moonlight the sage yet seemed to hold its hue of purple and was infinitely more wild and lonely so the night hours wore on and jane withersteen never once looked back    chapter xxi black star and night  the time had come for venters and bess to leave their retreat they were at great pains to choose the few things they would be able to carry with them on the journey out of utah  bern whatever kind of a packs this anyhow questioned bess rising from her work with reddened face  venters absorbed in his own task did not look up at all and in reply said he had brought so much from cottonwoods that he did not recollect the half of it  a woman packed this bess exclaimed  he scarcely caught her meaning but the peculiar tone of her voice caused him instantly to rise and he saw bess on her knees before an open pack which he recognized as the one given him by jane  by george he ejaculated guiltily and then at sight of besss face he laughed outright  a woman packed this she repeated fixing woeful tragic eyes on him  well is that a crime  therethere is a woman after all  now bess  youve lied to me  then and there venters found it imperative to postpone work for the present all her life bess had been isolated but she had inherited certain elements of the eternal feminine  but there was a woman and you did lie to me she kept repeating after he had explained  what of that bess ill get angry at you in a moment remember youve been pent up all your life i venture to say that if youd been out in the world you d have had a dozen sweethearts and have told many a lie before this  i wouldnt anything of the kind declared bess indignantly  wellperhaps not lie but youd have had the sweetheartsyou couldnt have helped thatbeing so pretty  this remark appeared to be a very clever and fortunate one and the work of selecting and then of stowing all the packs in the cave went on without further interruption  venters closed up the opening of the cave with a thatch of willows and aspens so that not even a bird or a rat could get in to the sacks of grain and this work was in order with the precaution habitually observed by him he might not be able to get out of utah and have to return to the valley but he owed it to bess to make the attempt and in case they were compelled to turn back he wanted to find that fine store of food and grain intact the outfit of implements and utensils he packed away in another cave  bess we have enough to live here all our lives he said once dreamily  shall i go roll balancing rock she asked in light speech but with deepblue fire in her eyes  nono  ah you dont forget the gold and the world she sighed  child you forget the beautiful dresses and the traveland everything  oh i want to go but i want to stay  i feel the same way  they let the eight calves out of the corral and kept only two of the burros venters had brought from cottonwoods these they intended to ride bess freed all her petsthe quail and rabbits and foxes  the last sunset and twilight and night were both the sweetest and saddest they had ever spent in surprise valley morning brought keen exhilaration and excitement when venters had saddled the two burros strapped on the light packs and the two canteens the sunlight was dispersing the lazy shadows from the valley taking a last look at the caves and the silver spruces venters and bess made a reluctant start leading the burros ring and whitie looked keen and knowing something seemed to drag at venterss feet and he noticed bess lagged behind never had the climb from terrace to bridge appeared so long  not till they reached the opening of the gorge did they stop to rest and take one last look at the valley the tremendous arch of stone curved clear and sharp in outline against the morning sky and through it streaked the golden shaft the valley seemed an enchanted circle of glorious veils of gold and wraiths of white and silver haze and dim blue moving shadebeautiful and wild and unreal as a dream  wewe canththink of italwaysreremember sobbed bess  hush dont cry our valley has only fitted us for a better life somewhere come  they entered the gorge and he closed the willow gate from rosy golden morning light they passed into cool dense gloom the burros pattered up the trail with little hollowcracking steps and the gorge widened to narrow outlet and the gloom lightened to gray at the divide they halted for another rest venterss keen remembering gaze searched balancing rock and the long incline and the cracked toppling walls but failed to note the slightest change  the dogs led the descent then came bess leading her burro then venters leading his bess kept her eyes bent downward venters however had an irresistible desire to look upward at balancing rock it had always haunted him and now he wondered if he were really to get through the outlet before the huge stone thundered down he fancied that would be a miracle every few steps he answered to the strange nervous fear and turned to make sure the rock still stood like a giant statue and as he descended it grew dimmer in his sight it changed form it swayed it nodded darkly and at last in his heightened fancy he saw it heave and roll as in a dream when he felt himself falling yet knew he would never fall so he saw this longstanding thunderbolt of the little stonemen plunge down to close forever the outlet to deception pass  and while he was giving way to unaccountable dread imaginations the descent was accomplished without mishap  im glad thats over he said breathing more freely i hope im by that hanging rock for good and all since almost the moment i first saw it ive had an idea that it was waiting for me now when it does fall if im thousands of miles away ill hear it  with the first glimpses of the smooth slope leading down to the grotesque cedars and out to the pass venterss cool nerve returned one long survey to the left then one to the right satisfied his caution leading the burros down to the spur of rock he halted at the steep incline  bess heres the bad place the place i told you about with the cut steps you start down leading your burro take your time and hold on to him if you slip ive got a rope on him and a halfhitch on this point of rock so i can let him down safely coming up here was a killing job but itll be easy going down  both burros passed down the difficult stairs cut by the cliffdwellers and did it without a misstep after that the descent down the slope and over the mile of scrawled ripped and ridged rock required only careful guidance and venters got the burros to level ground in a condition that caused him to congratulate himself  oh if we only had wrangle exclaimed venters but were lucky thats the worst of our trail passed weve only men to fear now if we get up in the sage we can hide and slip along like coyotes  they mounted and rode west through the valley and entered the canyon from time to time venters walked leading his burro when they got by all the canyons and gullies opening into the pass they went faster and with fewer halts venters did not confide in bess the alarming fact that he had seen horses and smoke less than a mile up one of the intersecting canyons he did not talk at all and long after he had passed this canyon and felt secure once more in the certainty that they had been unobserved he never relaxed his watchfulness but he did not walk any more and he kept the burros at a steady trot night fell before they reached the last water in the pass and they made camp by starlight venters did not want the burros to stray so he tied them with long halters in the grass near the spring bess tired out and silent laid her head in a saddle and went to sleep between the two dogs venters did not close his eyes the canyon silence appeared full of the low continuous hum of insects he listened until the hum grew into a roar and then breaking the spell once more he heard it low and clear he watched the stars and the moving shadows and always his glance returned to the girls dimly pale face and he remembered how white and still it had once looked in the starlight and again stern thought fought his strange fancies would all his labor and his love be for naught would he lose her after all what did the dark shadow around her portend did calamity lurk on that long upland trail through the sage why should his heart swell and throb with nameless fear he listened to the silence and told himself that in the broad light of day he could dispel this leadenweighted dread  at the first hint of gray over the eastern rim he awoke bess saddled the burros and began the days travel he wanted to get out of the pass before there was any chance of riders coming down they gained the break as the first red rays of the rising sun colored the rim  for once so eager was he to get up to level ground he did not send ring or whitie in advance encouraging bess to hurry pulling at his patient plodding burro he climbed the soft steep trail  brighter and brighter grew the light he mounted the last broken edge of rim to have the sunfired purple sageslope burst upon him as a glory bess panted up to his side tugging on the halter of her burro  were up he cried joyously theres not a dot on the sage were safe well not be seen oh bess  ring growled and sniffed the keen air and bristled venters clutched at his rifle whitie sometimes made a mistake but ring never the dull thud of hoofs almost deprived venters of power to turn and see from where disaster threatened he felt his eyes dilate as he stared at lassiter leading black star and night out of the sage with jane withersteen in riders costume close beside them  for an instant venters felt himself whirl dizzily in the center of vast circles of sage he recovered partially enough to see lassiter standing with a glad smile and jane riveted in astonishment  why bern she exclaimed how good it is to see you were riding away you see the storm burstand im a ruined woman i thought you were alone  venters unable to speak for consternation and bewildered out of all sense of what he ought or ought not to do simply stared at jane  son where are you bound for asked lassiter  not safewhere i was imwere going out of utahback east he found tongue to say  i reckon this meetins the luckiest thing that ever happened to you an to mean to janean to bess said lassiter coolly  bess cried jane with a sudden leap of blood to her pale cheek  it was entirely beyond venters to see any luck in that meeting  jane withersteen took one flashing womans glance at besss scarlet face at her slender shapely form  venters is this a girla woman she questioned in a voice that stung  yes  did you have her in that wonderful valley  yes but jane  all the time you were gone  yes but i couldnt tell  was it for her you asked me to give you supplies was it for her that you wanted to make your valley a paradise  ohjane  answer me  yes  oh you liar and with these passionate words jane withersteen succumbed to fury for the second time in her life she fell into the ungovernable rage that had been her fathers weakness and it was worse than his for she was a jealous womanjealous even of her friends  as best he could he bore the brunt of her anger it was not only his deceit to her that she visited upon him but her betrayal by religion by life itself  her passion like fire at white heat consumed itself in little time her physical strength failed and still her spirit attempted to go on in magnificent denunciation of those who had wronged her like a tree cut deep into its roots she began to quiver and shake and her anger weakened into despair and her ringing voice sank into a broken husky whisper then spent and pitiable upheld by lassiters arm she turned and hid her face in black stars mane  numb as venters was when at length jane withersteen lifted her head and looked at him he yet suffered a pang  jane the girl is innocent he cried  can you expect me to believe that she asked with weary bitter eyes  im not that kind of a liar and you know it if i liedif i kept silent when honor should have made me speak it was to spare you i came to cottonwoods to tell you but i couldnt add to your pain i intended to tell you i had come to love this girl but jane i hadnt forgotten how good you were to me i havent changed at all toward you i prize your friendship as i always have but however it may look to youdont be unjust the girl is innocent ask lassiter  jane shes jest as sweet an innocent as little fay said lassiter there was a faint smile upon his face and a beautiful light  venters saw and knew that lassiter saw how jane withersteens tortured soul wrestled with hate and threw itwith scorn doubt suspicion and overcame all  bern if in my misery i accused you unjustly i crave forgiveness she said im not what i once was tell mewho is this girl  jane she is oldrings daughter and his masked rider lassiter will tell you how i shot her for a rustler saved her lifeall the story its a strange story jane as wild as the sage but its truetrue as her innocence that you must believe  oldrings masked rider oldrings daughter exclaimed jane and shes innocent you ask me to believe much if this girl isis what you say how could she be going away with the man who killed her father  why did you tell that cried venters passionately  janes question had roused bess out of stupefaction her eyes suddenly darkened and dilated she stepped toward venters and held up both hands as if to ward off a blow  diddid you kill oldring  i did bess and i hate myself for it but you know i never dreamed he was your father i thought hed wronged you i killed him when i was madly jealous  for a moment bess was shocked into silence  but he was my father she broke out at last and now i must go backi cant go with you its all overthat beautiful dream oh i knew it couldnt come true you cant take me now  if you forgive me bess itll all come right in the end implored venters  it cant be right ill go back after all i loved him he was good to me i cant forget that  if you go back to oldrings men ill follow you and then theyll kill me said venters hoarsely  oh no bern youll not come let me go its best for you to forget me ive brought you only pain and dishonor  she did not weep but the sweet bloom and life died out of her face she looked haggard and sad all at once stunted and her hands dropped listlessly and her head drooped in slow final acceptance of a hopeless fate  jane look there cried venters in despairing grief need you have told her where was all your kindness of heart this girl has had a wretched lonely life and id found a way to make her happy youve killed it youve killed something sweet and pure and hopeful just as sure as you breathe  oh bern it was a slip i never thoughti never thought replied jane how could i tell she didnt know  lassiter suddenly moved forward and with the beautiful light on his face now strangely luminous he looked at jane and venters and then let his soft bright gaze rest on bess  well i reckon youve all had your say an now its lassiters turn why i was jest praying for this meetin bess jest look here  gently he touched her arm and turned her to face the others and then outspread his great hand to disclose a shiny battered gold locket  open it he said with a singularly rich voice  bess complied but listlessly  janeventerscome closer went on lassiter take a look at the picture dont you know the woman  jane after one glance drew back  milly erne she cried wonderingly  venters with tingling pulse with something growing on him recognized in the faded miniature portrait the eyes of milly erne  yes thats milly said lassiter softly bess did you ever see her facelook hardwith all your heart an soul  the eyes seem to haunt me whispered bess oh i cant remembertheyre eyes of my dreamsbutbut  lassiters strong arm went round her and he bent his head  child i thought youd remember her eyes theyre the same beautiful eyes youd see if you looked in a mirror or a clear spring theyre your mothers eyes you are milly ernes child your name is elizabeth erne youre not oldrings daughter youre the daughter of frank erne a man once my best friend look heres his picture beside millys he was handsome an as fine an gallant a southern gentleman as i ever seen frank came of an old family you come of the best of blood lass and blood tells  bess slipped through his arm to her knees and hugged the locket to her bosom and lifted wonderful yearning eyes  itcantbetrue  thank god lass it is true replied lassiter jane an bern herethey both recognize milly they see milly in you theyre so knocked out they cant tell you thats all  who are you whispered bess  i reckon im millys brother an your uncle uncle jim aint that fine  oh i cant believedont raise me bern let me kneel i see truth in your facein miss withersteens but let me hear it allall on my knees tell me how its true  well elizabeth listen said lassiter before you was born your father made a mortal enemy of a mormon named dyer they was both ministers an come to be rivals dyer stole your mother away from her home she gave birth to you in texas eighteen years ago then she was taken to utah from place to place an finally to the last border settlementcottonwoods you was about three years old when you was taken away from milly she never knew what had become of you but she lived a good while hopin and prayin to have you again then she gave up an died an i may as well put in here your father died ten years ago well i spent my time tracin milly an some months back i landed in cottonwoods an jest lately i learned all about you i had a talk with oldrin an told him you was dead an he told me what i had so long been wantin to know it was dyer of course who stole you from milly part reason he was sore because milly refused to give you mormon teachin but mostly he still hated frank erne so infernally that he made a deal with oldrin to take you an bring you up as an infamous rustler an rustlers girl the idea was to break frank ernes heart if he ever came to utahto show him his daughter with a band of low rustlers welloldrin took you brought you up from childhood an then made you his masked rider he made you infamous he kept that part of the contract but he learned to love you as a daughter an never let any but his own men know you was a girl i heard him say that with my own ears an i saw his big eyes grow dim he told me how he had guarded you always kept you locked up in his absence was always at your side or near you on those rides that made you famous on the sage he said he an an old rustler whom he trusted had taught you how to read an write they selected the books for you dyer had wanted you brought up the vilest of the vile an oldrin brought you up the innocentest of the innocent he said you didnt know what vileness was i can hear his big voice tremble now as he said it he told me how the menrustlers an outlawswho from time to time tried to approach you familiarlyhe told me how he shot them dead im tellin you this specially because youve showed such shamesayin you was nameless an all that nothin on earth can be wronger than that idea of yours an the truth of it is here oldrin swore to me that if dyer died releasin the contract he intended to hunt up your father an give you back to him it seems oldrin wasnt all bad en he sure loved you  venters leaned forward in passionate remorse  oh bess i know lassiter speaks the truth for when i shot oldring he dropped to his knees and fought with unearthly power to speak and he said manwhydidntyouwait bess was then he fell dead and ive been haunted by his look and words oh bess what a strange splendid thing for oldring to do it all seems impossible but dear you really are not what you thought  elizabeth erne cried jane withersteen i loved your mother and i see her in you  what had been incredible from the lips of men became in the tone look and gesture of a woman a wonderful truth for bess with little tremblings of all her slender body she rocked to and fro on her knees the yearning wistfulness of her eyes changed to solemn splendor of joy she believed she was realizing happiness and as the process of thought was slow so were the variations of her expression her eyes reflected the transformation of her soul dark brooding hopeless beliefclouds of gloomdrifted paled vanished in glorious light an exquisite rose flusha glowshone from her face as she slowly began to rise from her knees a spirit uplifted her all that she had held as base dropped from her  venters watched her in joy too deep for words by it he divined something of what lassiters revelation meant to bess but he knew he could only faintly understand that moment when she seemed to be lifted by some spiritual transfiguration was the most beautiful moment of his life she stood with parted quivering lips with hands tightly clasping the locket to her heaving breast a new conscious pride of worth dignified the old wild free grace and poise  uncle jim she said tremulously with a different smile from any venters had ever seen on her face  lassiter took her into his arms  i reckon its powerful fine to hear that replied lassiter unsteadily  venters feeling his eyes grow hot and wet turned away and found himself looking at jane withersteen he had almost forgotten her presence tenderness and sympathy were fast hiding traces of her agitation venters read her mindfelt the reaction of her noble heartsaw the joy she was beginning to feel at the happiness of others and suddenly blinded choked by his emotions he turned from her also he knew what she would do presently she would make some magnificent amend for her anger she would give some manifestation of her love probably all in a moment as she had loved milly erne so would she love elizabeth erne  pears to me folks that wed better talk a little serious now remarked lassiter at length time flies  youre right replied venters instantly id forgotten timeplacedanger lassiter youre riding away janes leaving withersteen house  forever replied jane  i fired withersteen house said lassiter  dyer questioned venters sharply  i reckon where dyers gone there wont be any kidnappin of girls  ah i knew it i told judkinsand tull went on venters passionately  tull wasnt around when i broke loose by now hes likely on our trail with his riders  lassiter youre going into the pass to hide till all this storm blows over  i reckon thats janes idea im thinkin the stormll be a powerful long time blowin over i was comin to join you in surprise valley youll go back now with me  no i want to take bess out of utah lassiter bess found gold in the valley weve a saddlebag full of gold if we can reach sterling  man howre you ever goin to do that sterlin is a hundred miles  my plan is to ride on keeping sharp lookout somewhere up the trail well take to the sage and go round cottonwoods and then hit the trail again  its a bad plan youll kill the burros in two days  then well walk  thats more bad an worse better go back down the pass with me  lassiter this girl has been hidden all her life in that lonely place went on venters oldrings men are hunting me wed not be safe there any longer even if we would be id take this chance to get her out i want to marry her she shall have some of the pleasures of lifesee cities and people weve goldwell be rich why life opens sweet for both of us and by heaven ill get her out or lose my life in the attempt  i reckon if you go on with them burros youll lose your life all right tull will have riders all over this sage you cant get out on them burros its a fool idea thats not doin best by the girl come with me en take chances on the rustlers  lassiters cool argument made venters waver not in determination to go but in hope of success  bess i want you to know lassiter says the trips almost useless now im afraid hes right weve got about one chance in a hundred to go through shall we take it shall we go on  well go on replied bess  that settles it lassiter  lassiter spread wide his hands as if to signify he could do no more and his face clouded  venters felt a touch on his elbow jane stood beside him with a hand on his arm she was smiling something radiated from her and like an electric current accelerated the motion of his blood  bern youd be right to die rather than not take elizabeth out of utahout of this wild country you must do it youll show her the great world with all its wonders think how little she has seen think what delight is in store for her you have gold you will be free you will make her happy what a glorious prospect i share it with you ill think of youdream of youpray for you  thank you jane replied venters trying to steady his voice it does look bright oh if we were only across that wide open waste of sage  bern the trips as good as made itll be safeeasy itll be a glorious ride she said softly  venters stared had janes troubles made her insane lassiter too acted queerly all at once beginning to turn his sombrero round in hands that actually shook  you are a rider she is a rider this will be the ride of your lives added jane in that same soft undertone almost as if she were musing to herself  jane he cried  i give you black star and night  black star and night he echoed  its done lassiter put our saddlebags on the burros  only when lassiter moved swiftly to execute her bidding did venterss clogged brain grasp at literal meanings he leaped to catch lassiters busy hands  no no what are you doing he demanded in a kind of fury i wont take her racers what do you think i am itd be monstrous lassiter stop it i say youve got her to save youve miles and miles to go tull is trailing you there are rustlers in the pass give me back that saddlebag  soncool down returned lassiter in a voice he might have used to a child but the grip with which he tore away venterss grasping hands was that of a giant listenyou fool boy janes sized up the situation the burrosll do for us well sneak along an hide ill take your dogs an your rifle why its the trick the blacks are yours an sure as i can throw a gun youre goin to ride safe out of the sage  janestop himplease stop him gasped venters ive lost my strength i cant doanything this is hell for me cant you see that ive ruined youit was through me you lost all youve only black star and night left you love these horses oh i know how you must love them now andyoure trying to give them to me to help me out of utah to save the girl i love  that will be my glory  then in the white rapt face in the unfathomable eyes venters saw jane withersteen in a supreme moment this moment was one wherein she reached up to the height for which her noble soul had ever yearned he after disrupting the calm tenor of her peace after bringing down on her head the implacable hostility of her churchmen after teaching her a bitter lesson of lifehe was to be her salvation and he turned away again this time shaken to the core of his soul jane withersteen was the incarnation of selflessness he experienced wonder and terror exquisite pain and rapture what were all the shocks life had dealt him compared to the thought of such loyal and generous friendship  and instantly as if by some divine insight he knew himself in the remakingtried found wanting but stronger better surerand he wheeled to jane withersteen eager joyous passionate wild exalted he bent to her he left tears and kisses on her hands  jane ii cant find wordsnow he said im beyond words onlyi understand and ill take the blacks  dont be losin no more time cut in lassiter i aint certain but i think i seen a speck up the sageslope mebbe i was mistaken but anyway we must all be movin ive shortened the stirrups on black star put bess on him  jane withersteen held out her arms  elizabeth erne she cried and bess flew to her  how inconceivably strange and beautiful it was for venters to see bess clasped to jane withersteens breast  then he leaped astride night  venters ride straight on up the slope lassiter was saying an if you dont meet any riders keep on till youre a few miles from the village then cut off in the sage an go round to the trail but youll most likely meet riders with tull jest keep right on till youre jest out of gunshot an then make your cutoff into the sage theyll ride after you but it wont be no use you can ride an bess can ride when youre out of reach turn on round to the west an hit the trail somewhere save the hosses all you can but dont be afraid black star and night are good for a hundred miles before sundown if you have to push them you can get to sterlin by night if you want but better make it along about tomorrow mornin when you get through the notch on the glaze trail swing to the right youll be able to see both glaze an stone bridge keep away from them villages you wont run no risk of meetin any of oldrins rustlers from sterlin on youll find water in them deep hollows north of the notch theres an old trail there not much used en it leads to sterlin thats your trail an one thing more if tull pushes youor keeps on persistentlike for a few milesjest let the blacks out an lose him an his riders  lassiter may we meet again said venters in a deep voice  son it aint likelyit aint likely well bess oldrinmasked riderelizabeth ernenow you climb on black star ive heard you could ride well every rider loves a good horse an lass there never was but one that could beat black star  ah lassiter there never was any horse that could beat black star said jane with the old pride  i often wonderedmebbe venters rode out that race when he brought back the blacks son was wrangle the best hoss  no lassiter replied venters for this lie he had his reward in janes quick smile  well well my hosssense aint always right an here im talkie a lot wastin time it aint so easy to find an lose a pretty niece all in one hour elizabethgoodby  oh uncle jim goodby  elizabeth erne be happy goodby said jane  goodbyohgoodby in lithe supple action bess swung up to black stars saddle  jane withersteen goodby called venters hoarsely  bernbessriders of the purple sagegoodby    chapter xxii riders of the purple sage  black star and night answering to spur swept swiftly westward along the white slowrising sagebordered trail venters heard a mournful howl from ring but whitie was silent the blacks settled into their fleet longstriding gallop the wind sweetly fanned venterss hot face from the summit of the first lowswelling ridge he looked back lassiter waved his hand jane waved her scarf venters replied by standing in his stirrups and holding high his sombrero then the dip of the ridge hid them from the height of the next he turned once more lassiter jane and the burros had disappeared they had gone down into the pass venters felt a sensation of irreparable loss  bernlook called bess pointing up the long slope  a small dark moving dot split the line where purple sage met blue sky that dot was a band of riders  pull the black bess  they slowed from gallop to canter then to trot the fresh and eager horses did not like the check  bern black star has great eyesight  i wonder if theyre tulls riders they might be rustlers but its all the same to us  the black dot grew to a dark patch moving under low dust clouds it grew all the time though very slowly there were long periods when it was in plain sight and intervals when it dropped behind the sage the blacks trotted for half an hour for another halfhour and still the moving patch appeared to stay on the horizon line gradually however as time passed it began to enlarge to creep down the slope to encroach upon the intervening distance  bess what do you make them out asked venters i dont think theyre rustlers  theyre sageriders replied bess i see a white horse and several grays rustlers seldom ride any horses but bays and blacks  that white horse is tulls pull the black bess ill get down and cinch up were in for some riding are you afraid  not now answered the girl smiling  you neednt be bess you dont weigh enough to make black star know youre on him i wont be able to stay with you youll leave tull and his riders as if they were standing still  how about you  never fear if i cant stay with you i can still laugh at tull  look bern theyve stopped on that ridge they see us  yes but were too far yet for them to make out who we are theyll recognize the blacks first weve passed most of the ridges and the thickest sage now when i give the word let black star go and ride  venters calculated that a mile or more still intervened between them and the riders they were approaching at a swift canter soon venters recognized tulls white horse and concluded that the riders had likewise recognized black star and night but it would be impossible for tull yet to see that the blacks were not ridden by lassiter and jane venters noted that tull and the line of horsemen perhaps ten or twelve in number stopped several times and evidently looked hard down the slope it must have been a puzzling circumstance for tull venters laughed grimly at the thought of what tulls rage would be when he finally discovered the trick venters meant to sheer out into the sage before tull could possibly be sure who rode the blacks  the gap closed to a distance to half a mile tull halted his riders came up and formed a dark group around him venters thought he saw him wave his arms and was certain of it when the riders dashed into the sage to right and left of the trail tull had anticipated just the move held in mind by venters  now bess shouted venters strike north go round those riders and turn west  black star sailed over the low sage and in a few leaps got into his stride and was running venters spurred night after him it was hard going in the sage the horses could run as well there but keen eyesight and judgment must constantly be used by the riders in choosing ground and continuous swerving from aisle to aisle between the brush and leaping little washes and mounds of the packrats and breaking through sage made rough riding when venters had turned into a long aisle he had time to look up at tulls riders they were now strung out into an extended line riding northeast and as venters and bess were holding due north this meant if the horses of tull and his riders had the speed and the staying power they would head the blacks and turn them back down the slope tulls men were not saving their mounts they were driving them desperately venters feared only an accident to black star or night and skilful riding would mitigate possibility of that one glance ahead served to show him that bess could pick a course through the sage as well as he she looked neither back nor at the running riders and bent forward over black stars neck and studied the ground ahead  it struck venters presently after he had glanced up from time to time that bess was drawing away from him as he had expected he had however only thought of the light weight black star was carrying and of his superior speed he saw now that the black was being ridden as never before except when jerry card lost the race to wrangle how easily gracefully naturally bess sat her saddle she could ride suddenly venters remembered she had said she could ride but he had not dreamed she was capable of such superb horsemanship then all at once flashing over him thrilling him came the recollection that bess was oldrings masked rider  he forgot tullthe running ridersthe race he let night have a free rein and felt him lengthen out to suit himself knowing he would keep to black stars course knowing that he had been chosen by the best rider now on the upland sage for jerry card was dead and fame had rivaled him with only one rider and that was the slender girl who now swung so easily with black stars stride venters had abhorred her notoriety but now he took passionate pride in her skill her daring her power over a horse and he delved into his memory recalling famous rides which he had heard related in the villages and round the campfires oldrings masked rider many times this strange rider at once well known and unknown had escaped pursuers by matchless riding he had to run the gantlet of vigilantes down the main street of stone bridge leaving dead horses and dead rustlers behind he had jumped his horse over the gerber wash a deep wide ravine separating the fields of glaze from the wild sage he had been surrounded north of sterling and he had broken through the line how often had been told the story of day stampedes of night raids of pursuit and then how the masked rider swift as the wind was gone in the sage a fleet dark horsea slender dark forma black maska driving run down the slopea dot on the purple sagea shadowy muffled steed disappearing in the night  and this masked rider of the uplands had been elizabeth erne  the sweet sage wind rushed in venterss face and sang a song in his ears he heard the dull rapid beat of nights hoofs he saw black star drawing away farther and farther he realized both horses were swinging to the west then gunshots in the rear reminded him of tull venters looked back far to the side dropping behind trooped the riders they were shooting venters saw no puffs or dust heard no whistling bullets he was out of range when he looked back again tulls riders had given up pursuit the best they could do no doubt had been to get near enough to recognize who really rode the blacks venters saw tull drooping in his saddle  then venters pulled night out of his running stride those few miles had scarcely warmed the black but venters wished to save him bess turned and though she was far away venters caught the white glint of her waving hand he held night to a trot and rode on seeing bess and black star and the sloping upward stretch of sage and from time to time the receding black riders behind soon they disappeared behind a ridge and he turned no more they would go back to lassiters trail and follow it and follow in vain so venters rode on with the wind growing sweeter to taste and smell and the purple sage richer and the sky bluer in his sight and the song in his ears ringing by and by bess halted to wait for him and he knew she had come to the trail when he reached her it was to smile at sight of her standing with arms round black stars neck  oh bern i love him she cried hes beautiful he knows and how he can run ive had fast horses but black star wrangle never beat him  im wondering if i didnt dream that bess the blacks are grand what it must have cost janeahwell when we get out of this wild country with star and night back to my old home in illinois well buy a beautiful farm with meadows and springs and cool shade there well turn the horses freefree to roam and browse and drinknever to feel a spur againnever to be ridden  i would like that said bess  they rested then mounting they rode side by side up the white trail the sun rose higher behind them far to the left a low fine of green marked the site of cottonwoods venters looked once and looked no more bess gazed only straight ahead they put the blacks to the long swinging riders canter and at times pulled them to a trot and occasionally to a walk the hours passed the miles slipped behind and the wall of rock loomed in the fore the notch opened wide it was a rugged stony pass but with level and open trail and venters and bess ran the blacks through it an old trail led off to the right taking the line of the wall and his venters knew to be the trail mentioned by lassiter  the little hamlet glaze a white and green patch in the vast waste of purple lay miles down a slope much like the cottonwoods slope only this descended to the west and miles farther west a faint green spot marked the location of stone bridge all the rest of that world was seemingly smooth undulating sage with no ragged lines of canyons to accentuate its wildness  bess were safewere free said venters were alone on the sage were half way to sterling  ah i wonder how it is with lassiter and miss withersteen  never fear bess hell outwit tull hell get away and hide her safely he might climb into surprise valley but i dont think hell go so far  bern will we ever find any place like our beautiful valley  no but dear listen well go back some day after yearsten years then well be forgotten and our valley will be just as we left it  what if balancing rock falls and closes the outlet to the pass  ive thought of that ill pack in ropes and ropes and if the outlets closed well climb up the cliffs and over them to the valley and go down on rope ladders it could be done i know just where to make the climb and ill never forget  oh yes let us go back  its something sweet to look forward to bess its like all the future looks to me  call meelizabeth she said shyly  elizabeth erne its a beautiful name but ill never forget bess do you knowhave you thought that very soonby this time tomorrowyou will be elizabeth venters  so they rode on down the old trail and the sun sloped to the west and a golden sheen lay on the sage the hours sped now the afternoon waned often they rested the horses the glisten of a pool of water in a hollow caught venterss eye and here he unsaddled the blacks and let them roll and drink and browse when he and bess rode up out of the hollow the sun was low a crimson ball and the valley seemed veiled in purple fire and smoke it was that short time when the sun appeared to rest before setting and silence like a cloak of invisible life lay heavy on all that shimmering world of sage  they watched the sun begin to bury its red curve under the dark horizon  well ride on till late he said then you can sleep a little while i watch and graze the horses and well ride into sterling early tomorrow well be married well be in time to catch the stage well tie black star and night behindand thenfor a country not wild and terrible like this  oh bern but look the sun is setting on the sagethe last time for us till we dare come again to the utah border ten years oh bern look so you will never forget  slumbering fading purple fire burned over the undulating sage ridges long streaks and bars and shafts and spears fringed the far western slope drifting golden veils mingled with low purple shadows colors and shades changed in slow wondrous transformation  suddenly venters was startled by a low rumbling roarso low that it was like the roar in a seashell  bess did you hear anything he whispered  no  listen maybe i only imaginedah  out of the east or north from remote distance breathed an infinitely low continuously long sounddeep weird detonating thundering deadeningdying    chapter xxiii the fall of balancing rock  through tearblurred sight jane withersteen watched venters and elizabeth erne and the black racers disappear over the ridge of sage  theyre gone said lassiter an theyre safe now an therell never be a day of their comin happy lives but what theyll remember jane withersteen anan uncle jim i reckon jane wed better be on our way  the burros obediently wheeled and started down the break with little cautious steps but lassiter had to leash the whining dogs and lead them jane felt herself bound in a feeling that was neither listlessness nor indifference yet which rendered her incapable of interest she was still strong in body but emotionally tired that hour at the entrance to deception pass had been the climax of her sufferingthe flood of her wraththe last of her sacrificethe supremity of her loveand the attainment of peace she thought that if she had little fay she would not ask any more of life  like an automaton she followed lassiter down the steep trail of dust and bits of weathered stone and when the little slides moved with her or piled around her knees she experienced no alarm vague relief came to her in the sense of being enclosed between dark stone walls deep hidden from the glare of sun from the glistening sage lassiter lengthened the stirrup straps on one of the burros and bade her mount and ride close to him she was to keep the burro from cracking his little hard hoofs on stones then she was riding on between dark gleaming walls there were quiet and rest and coolness in this canyon she noted indifferently that they passed close under shady bulging shelves of cliff through patches of grass and sage and thicket and groves of slender trees and over white pebbly washes and around masses of broken rock the burros trotted tirelessly the dogs once more free pattered tirelessly and lassiter led on with never a stop and at every open place he looked back the shade under the walls gave place to sunlight and presently they came to a dense thicket of slender trees through which they passed to rich green grass and water here lassiter rested the burros for a little while but he was restless uneasy silent always listening peering under the trees she dully reflected that enemies were behind thembefore them still the thought awakened no dread or concern or interest  at his bidding she mounted and rode on close to the heels of his burro the canyon narrowed the walls lifted their rugged rims higher and the sun shone down hot from the center of the blue stream of sky above lassiter traveled slower with more exceeding care as to the ground he chose and he kept speaking low to the dogs they were now huntingdogskeen alert suspicious sniffing the warm breeze the monotony of the yellow walls broke in change of color and smooth surface and the rugged outline of rims grew craggy splits appeared in deep breaks and gorges running at right angles and then the pass opened wide at a junction of intersecting canyons  lassiter dismounted led his burro called the dogs close and proceeded at snail pace through dark masses of rock and dense thickets under the left wall long he watched and listened before venturing to cross the mouths of side canyons at length he halted fled his burro lifted a warning hand to jane and then slipped away among the boulders and followed by the stealthy dogs disappeared from sight the time he remained absent was neither short nor long to jane withersteen  when he reached her side again he was pale and his lips were set in a hard line and his gray eyes glittered coldly bidding her dismount he led the burros into a covert of stones and cedars and tied them  jane ive run into the fellers ive been lookin for an im goin after them he said  why she asked  i reckon i wont take time to tell you  couldnt we slip by without being seen  likely enough but that aint my game an id like to know in case i dont come back what youll do  what can i do  i reckon you can go back to tull or stay in the pass an be taken off by rustlers whichll you do  i dont know i cant think very well but i believe id rather be taken off by rustlers  lassiter sat down put his head in his hands and remained for a few moments in what appeared to be deep and painful thought when he lifted his face it was haggard lined cold as sculptured marble  ill go i only mentioned that chance of my not comin back im pretty sure to come  need you risk so much must you fight more havent you shed enough blood  id like to tell you why im goin he continued in coldness he had seldom used to her she remarked it but it was the same to her as if he had spoken with his old gentle warmth but i reckon i wont only ill say that mercy an goodness such as is in you though theyre the grand things in human nature cant be lived up to on this utah border lifes hell out here you thinkor you used to thinkthat your religion made this life heaven mebbe them scales on your eyes has dropped now jane i wouldnt have you no different an thats why im going to try to hide you somewhere in this pass id like to hide many more women for ive come to see there are more like you among your people an id like you to see jest how hard an cruel this border life is its bloody youd think churches an churchmen would make it better they make it worse you give names to thingsbishops elders ministers mormonism duty faith glory you dreamor youre driven mad im a man an i know i name fanatics followers blind women oppressors thieves ranchers rustlers riders an we havewhat youve lived through these last months it cant be helped but it cant last always an remember hissome day the borderll be better cleaner for the ways of ten like lassiter  she saw him shake his tall form erect look at her strangely and steadfastly and then noiselessly stealthily slip away amid the rocks and trees ring and whitie not being bidden to follow remained with jane she felt extreme weariness yet somehow it did not seem to be of her body and she sat down in the shade and tried to think she saw a creeping lizard cactus flowers the drooping burros the resting dogs an eagle high over a yellow crag once the meanest flower a color the flight of the bee or any living thing had given her deepest joy lassiter had gone off yielding to his incurable blood lust probably to his own death and she was sorry but there was no feeling in her sorrow  suddenly from the mouth of the canyon just beyond her rang out a clear sharp report of a rifle echoes clapped then followed a piercingly high yell of anguish quickly breaking again echoes clapped in grim imitation dull revolver shotshoarse yellspound of hoofsshrill neighs of horsescommingling of echoesand again silence lassiter must be busily engaged thought jane and no chill trembled over her no blanching tightened her skin yes the border was a bloody place but life had always been bloody men were bloodspillers phases of the history of the world flashed through her mindgreek and roman wars dark mediaeval times the crimes in the name of religion on sea on land everywhereshooting stabbing cursing clashing fighting men greed power oppression fanaticism love hate revenge justice freedomfor these men killed one another  she lay there under the cedars gazing up through the delicate lacelike foliage at the blue sky and she thought and wondered and did not care  more rattling shots disturbed the noonday quiet she heard a sliding of weathered rock a hoarse shout of warning a yell of alarm again the clear sharp crack of the rifle and another cry that was a cry of death then rifle reports pierced a dull volley of revolver shots bullets whizzed over janes hidingplace one struck a stone and whined away in the air after that for a time succeeded desultory shots and then they ceased under long thundering fire from heavier guns  sooner or later then jane heard the cracking of horses hoofs on the stones and the sound came nearer and nearer silence intervened until lassiters soft jingling step assured her of his approach when he appeared he was covered with blood  all right jane he said i come back an dont worry  with water from a canteen he washed the blood from his face and hands  jane hurry now tear my scarf in two en tie up these places that hole through my hand is some inconvenient worse n this at over my ear thereyoure doin fine not a bit nervousno tremblin i reckon i aint done your courage justice im glad youre brave jest nowyoull need to be well i was hid pretty good enough to keep them from shootin me deep but they was slingin lead close all the time i used up all the rifle shells an en i went after them mebbe you heard it was then i got hit had to use up every shell in my own gun an they did too as i seen rustlers an mormons jane an now im packin five bullet holes in my carcass an guns without shells hurry now  he unstrapped the saddlebags from the burros slipped the saddles and let them lie turned the burros loose and calling the dogs led the way through stones and cedars to an open where two horses stood  jane are you strong he asked  i think so im not tired jane replied  i dont mean that way can you bear up  i think i can bear anything  i reckon you look a little cold an thick so im preparin you  for what  i didnt tell you why i jest had to go after them fellers i couldnt tell you i believe youd have died but i can tell you nowif youll bear up under a shock  go on my friend  ive got little fay alivebad hurtbut shell live  jane withersteens deadlocked feeling rent by lassiters deep quivering voice leaped into an agony of sensitive life  here he added and showed her where little fay lay on the grass  unable to speak unable to stand jane dropped on her knees by that long beautiful golden hair jane recognized the beloved fay but fays loveliness was gone her face was drawn and looked old with grief but she was not deadher heart beatand jane withersteen gathered strength and lived again  you see i jest had to go after fay lassiter was saying as he knelt to bathe her little pale face but i reckon i dont want no more choices like the one i had to make there was a crippled feller in that bunch jane mebbe venters crippled him anyway thats why they were holding up here i seen little fay first thing en was hard put to it to figure out a way to get her an i wanted hosses too i had to take chances so i crawled close to their camp one feller jumped a hoss with little fay an when i shot him of course she dropped shes stunned an bruisedshe fell right on her head jane shes comin to she aint bad hurt  fays long lashes fluttered her eyes opened at first they seemed glazed over they looked dazed by pain then they quickened darkened to shine with intelligencebewildermentmemoryand sudden wonderful joy  muvverjane she whispered  oh little fay little fay cried jane lifting clasping the child to her  now weve got to rustle said lassiter in grim coolness jane look down the pass  across the mounds of rock and sage jane caught sight of a band of riders filing out of the narrow neck of the pass and in the lead was a white horse which even at a distance of a mile or more she knew  tull she almost screamed  i reckon but jane weve still got the game in our hands theyre ridin tired hosses venters likely give them a chase he wouldnt forget that an weve fresh hosses  hurriedly he strapped on the saddlebags gave quick glance to girths and cinches and stirrups then leaped astride  lift little fay up he said  with shaking arms jane complied  get back your nerve woman thiss life or death now mind that climb up keep your wits stick close to me watch where your hosss goin en ride  somehow jane mounted somehow found strength to hold the reins to spur to cling on to ride a horrible quaking craven fear possessed her soul lassiter led the swift flight across the wide space over washes through sage into a narrow canyon where the rapid clatter of hoofs rapped sharply from the walls the wind roared in her ears the gleaming cliffs swept by trail and sage and grass moved under her lassiters bandaged bloodstained face turned to her he shouted encouragement he looked back down the pass he spurred his horse jane clung on spurring likewise and the horses settled from hard furious gallop into a longstriding driving run she had never ridden at anything like that pace desperately she tried to get the swing of the horse to be of some help to him in that race to see the best of the ground and guide him into it but she failed of everything except to keep her seat the saddle and to spur and spur at times she closed her eyes unable to bear sight of fays golden curls streaming in the wind she could not pray she could not rail she no longer cared for herself all of life of good of use in the world of hope in heaven entered in lassiters ride with little fay to safety she would have tried to turn the ironjawed brute she rode she would have given herself to that relentless darkbrowed tull but she knew lassiter would turn with her so she rode on and on  whether that run was of moments or hours jane withersteen could not tell lassiters horse covered her with froth that blew back in white streams both horses ran their limit were allowed slow down in time to save them and went on dripping heaving staggering  oh lassiter we must runwe must run  he looked back saying nothing the bandage had blown from his head and blood trickled down his face he was bowing under the strain of injuries of the ride of his burden yet how cool and gay he lookedhow intrepid  the horses walked trotted galloped ran to fall again to walk hours sped or dragged time was an instantan eternity jane withersteen felt hell pursuing her and dared not look back for fear she would fall from her horse  oh lassiter is he coming  the grim rider looked over his shoulder but said no word fays golden hair floated on the breeze the sun shone the walls gleamed the sage glistened and then it seemed the sun vanished the walls shaded the sage paled the horses walkedtrottedgallopedranto fall again to walk shadows gathered under shelving cliffs the canyon turned brightened opened into a long wide wallenclosed valley again the sun lowering in the west reddened the sage far ahead round scrawled stone appeared to block the pass  bear up jane bear up called lassiter its our game if you dont weaken  lassiter go onalone save little fay  only with you  ohim a cowarda miserable coward i cant fight or think or hope or pray im lost oh lassiter look back is he coming ill nothold out  keep your breath woman an ride not for yourself or for me but for fay  a last breaking run across the sage brought lassiters horse to a walk  hes done said the rider  oh nono moaned jane  look back jane look back threefour miles weve come across this valley en no tull yet in sight only a few more miles  jane looked back over the long stretch of sage and found the narrow gap in the wall out of which came a file of dark horses with a white horse in the lead sight of the riders acted upon jane as a stimulant the weight of cold horrible terror lessened and gazing forward at the dogs at lassiters limping horse at the blood on his face at the rocks growing nearer last at fays golden hair the ice left her veins and slowly strangely she gained hold of strength that she believed would see her to the safety lassiter promised and as she gazed lassiters horse stumbled and fell  he swung his leg and slipped from the saddle  jane take the child he said and lifted fay up jane clasped her arms suddenly strong theyre gainin went on lassiter as he watched the pursuing riders but well beat em yet  turning with janes bridle in his hand he was about to start when he saw the saddlebag on the fallen horse  ive jest about got time he muttered and with swift fingers that did not blunder or fumble he loosened the bag and threw it over his shoulder then he started to run leading janes horse and he ran and trotted and walked and ran again close ahead now jane saw a rise of bare rock lassiter reached it searched along the base and finding a low place dragged the weary horse up and over round smooth stone looking backward jane saw tulls white horse not a mile distant with riders strung out in a long line behind him looking forward she saw more valley to the right and to the left a towering cliff lassiter pulled the horse and kept on  little fay lay in her arms with wideopen eyeseyes which were still shadowed by pain but no longer fixed glazed in terror the golden curls blew across janes lips the little hands feebly clasped her arm a ghost of a troubled trustful smile hovered round the sweet lips and jane withersteen awoke to the spirit of a lioness  lassiter was leading the horse up a smooth slope toward cedar trees of twisted and bleached appearance among these he halted  jane give me the girl en get down he said as if it wrenched him he unbuckled the empty black guns with a strange air of finality he then received fay in his arms and stood a moment looking backward tulls white horse mounted the ridge of round stone and several bays or blacks followed i wonder what hell think when he sees them empty guns jane bring your saddlebag and climb after me  a glistening wonderful bare slope with little holes swelled up and up to lose itself in a frowning yellow cliff jane closely watched her steps and climbed behind lassiter he moved slowly perhaps he was only husbanding his strength but she saw drops of blood on the stone and then she knew they climbed and climbed without looking back her breast labored she began to feel as if little points of fiery steel were penetrating her side into her lungs she heard the panting of lassiter and the quicker panting of the dogs  waithere he said  before her rose a bulge of stone nicked with little cut steps and above that a corner of yellow wall and overhanging that a vast ponderous cliff  the dogs pattered up disappeared round the corner lassiter mounted the steps with fay and he swayed like a drunken man and he too disappeared but instantly he returned alone and half ran half slipped down to her  then from below pealed up hoarse shouts of angry men tull and several of his riders had reached the spot where lassiter had parted with his guns  youll need that breathmebbe said lassiter facing downward with glittering eyes  now jane the last pull he went on walk up them little steps ill follow an steady you dont think jest go little fays above her eyes are open she jest said to me wheres muvver jane  without a fear or a tremor or a slip or a touch of lassiters hand jane withersteen walked up that ladder of cut steps  he pushed her round the corner of the wall fay lay with wide staring eyes in the shade of a gloomy wall the dogs waited lassiter picked up the child and turned into a dark cleft it zigzagged it widened it opened jane was amazed at a wonderfully smooth and steep incline leading up between ruined splintered toppling walls a red haze from the setting sun filled this passage lassiter climbed with slow measured steps and blood dripped from him to make splotches on the white stone jane tried not to step in his blood but was compelled for she found no other footing the saddlebag began to drag her down she gasped for breath she thought her heart was bursting slower slower yet the rider climbed whistling as he breathed the incline widened huge pinnacles and monuments of stone stood alone leaning fearfully red sunset haze shone through cracks where the wall had split jane did not look high but she felt the overshadowing of broken rims above she felt that it was a fearful menacing place and she climbed on in heartrending effort and she fell beside lassiter and fay at the top of the incline in a narrow smooth divide  he staggered to his feetstaggered to a huge leaning rock that rested on a small pedestal he put his hand on itthe hand that had been shot throughand jane saw blood drip from the ragged hole then he fell  janeicantdoit he whispered  what  roll thestone all mylife ive lovedto roll stonesen now icant  what of it you talk strangely why roll that stone  i planned tofetch you hereto roll this stone see itll smash the cragsloosen the wallsclose the outlet  as jane withersteen gazed down that long incline walled in by crumbling cliffs awaiting only the slightest jar to make them fall asunder she saw tull appear at the bottom and begin to climb a rider followed himanotherand another  see tull the riders  yestheyll get usnow  why havent you strength left to roll the stone  janeit aint thative lost my nerve  you lassiter  i wanted to roll itmeant tobut icant venterss valley is down behind here we couldlive there but if i roll the stonewere shut in for always i dont dare im thinkin of you  lassiter roll the stone she cried  he arose tottering but with set face and again he placed the bloody hand on the balancing rock jane withersteen gazed from him down the passageway tull was climbing almost she thought she saw his dark relentless face behind him more riders climbed what did they mean for fayfor lassiterfor herself  roll the stone lassiter i love you  under all his deathly pallor and the blood and the iron of seared cheek and lined brow worked a great change he placed both hands on the rock and then leaned his shoulder there and braced his powerful body  roll the stone  it stirred it groaned it grated it moved and with a slow grinding as of wrathful relief began to lean it had waited ages to fall and now was slow in starting then as if suddenly instinct with life it leaped hurtingly down to alight on the steep incline to bound more swiftly into the air to gather momentum to plunge into the lofty leaning crag below the crag thundered into atoms a wave of aira splitting shock dust shrouded the sunset red of shaking rims dust shrouded tull as he fell on his knees with uplifted arms shafts and monuments and sections of wall fell majestically  from the depths there rose a longdrawn rumbling roar the outlet to deception pass closed forever
