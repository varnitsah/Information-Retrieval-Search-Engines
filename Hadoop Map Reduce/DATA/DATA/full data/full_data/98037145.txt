way off is calling his wares  the girls fingers slip between      his own and stay unmoving  he looks round into her face  in      spite of makeup it has a queer unholy touching beauty  young off  with an outburst  no we dont only love ourselves there is more  i cant explain but theres something great theres kindnessandand       the shouting of newspaper boys grows louder and their cries      passionately vehement clash into each other and obscure each      word  his head goes up to listen her hand tightens within his      armshe too is listening  the cries come nearer hoarser more

against the plushcovered table her head      down a dark figure in a dark room with the moonlight      sharpening her outline  hardly a moment he stays then makes      for the door  when he is gone she still stands there her chin      on her breast with the sound in her ears of cheering of      hurrying feet and voices crying eavy defeat stands in the      centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the tornup notes      staring out unto the moonlight seeing not this hated room and      the hated square outside but a german orchard and herself a      little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her and a      hundred other pictures such as the drowning see  then she      sinks down on the floor lays her forehead on the dusty carpet      and presses her body to it  mechanically she sweeps together      the scattered fragments of notes assembling them with the dust      into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with      her fingers while the tears run down her cheeks  girl  defeat  der vaterland  defeat  one shillin       then suddenly in the moonlight she sits up and begins to      sing with all her might die wacht am rhein  and outside men      pass

scott       a throaty chuckle from foreson in the darkness  the light      dances up flickers shifts grows steady falling on the      orchard outside  the reading lamp darts alight and a piercing      little glare from it strikes into the auditorium away from      herbert  in a terrible voice  mr foreson  foreson  sir  vane  lookatthatshade       foreson mutters walks up to it and turns it round so

foreson  reappearing  sir  vane  i want props  foreson  in a stentorian voice  props       another motheaten man appears through the french windows  vane  is that boulder firm  props  going to where in front of the backcloth and apparently among its apple trees lies the counterfeitment of a mossy boulder he puts his foot on it  if you dont put too much weight on it sir  vane  it wont creak  props

cleanshaven face and small mouth      occupied by the butt end of a cigar has come on to the stage      from stage left and stands waiting to be noticed  props  attracted by the scent of the cigar

it       he extinguishes his cigar and descends the steps and sits in      the centre of the front row of the stalls  vane  mr foreson  foreson  appearing through curtain right  sir  vane  beginners  take your curtain down       he descends the steps and seats himself next to frust  the      curtain goes down       a womans voice is heard singing very beautifully sullivans      song orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees and the      mountain tops that freeze etc  frust  some voice       the curtain rises in the armchair the professor is yawning      tall thin abstracted and slightly grizzled in the hair  he      has a pad of paper over his knee ink on the stool to his right      and the encyclopedia volume on the stand to his leftbarricaded      in fact by the article he is writing  he is reading a page over      to himself but the words are drowned in the sound of the song      his wife is singing in the next room partly screened off by the      curtain  she finishes and stops  his voice can then be heard      conning the words of his article  prof  orpheus symbolized the voice of beauty the call of life luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves  probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns  mankind has not changed  the civilized being still hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk  and yethe stops with a driedup airrather impatiently  go on my dear  it helps the atmosphere       the voice of his wife begins again gets as far as made them      sing and stops dead just as the professors pen is beginning      to scratch  and suddenly drawing the curtain further aside       she appears  much younger than the professor pale very      pretty of a botticellian type in face figure and in her      clinging creamcoloured frock  she gazes at her abstracted      husband then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window      and stands looking out  the wife  god  what beauty  prof  looking up  umm  the wife  i said god  what beauty  prof  aha  the wife  looking at him  do you know that i have to repeat everything to you nowadays  prof  what  the wife  that i have to repeat  prof  yes i heard  im sorry  i get absorbed  the wife  in all but me  prof  startled  my dear your song was helping me like anything to get the mood  this paper is the very deuceto balance between the historical and the natural  the wife  who wants the natural  prof  grumbling  umm  wish i thought that  modern taste history may go hang theyre all for tuppencecoloured sentiment nowadays  the wife  as if to herself  is the spring sentiment  prof  i beg your pardon my dear i didnt catch  wife  as if against her willurged by some pentup force  beauty beauty  prof  thats what im trying to say here  the orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of beauty  he takes up his pen while she continues to stare out at the moonlight  yawning  dash it  i get so sleepy i wish youd tell them to make the afterdinner coffee twice as strong  wife  i will  prof  how does this strike you  conning  many renaissance pictures especially those of botticelli francesca and piero di cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of orpheus and we owe a tiny gemlike raphael apollo and marsyas to the same pagan inspiration  wife  we owe it more than thatrebellion against the dryasdust  prof  quite  i might develop that we owe it our revolt against the academic or our disgust at big business and all the grossness of commercial success  we owe  his voice peters out  wife  itlove  prof  abstracted  eh  wife  i said we owe it love  prof  rather startled  possibly  buter  with a dry smile i mustnt say that herehardly  wife  to herself and the moonlight  orpheus with his lute  prof  most people think a lute is a sort of flute  yawning heavily  my dear if youre not going to sing again dyou mind sitting down  i want to concentrate  wife  im going out  prof  mind the dew  wife  the christian virtues and the dew  prof  with a little dry laugh  not bad  not bad  the christian virtues and the dew  his hand takes up his pen his face droops over his paper while his wife looks at him with a very strange face how far we can trace the modern resurgence against the christian virtues to the symbolic figures of orpheus pan apollo and bacchus might be difficult to estimate but       during those words his wife has passed through the window into      the moonlight and her voice rises singing as she goes      orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees  prof  suddenly aware of something  shell get her throat bad he is silent as the voice swells in the distance  sounds queer at nighthm  he is silentyawning  the voice dies away  suddenly his head nods he fights his drowsiness writes a word or two nods again and in twenty seconds is asleep       the stage is darkened by a blackout  frusts voice is heard      speaking  frust  whats that girls name  vane  vanessa hellgrove  frust  aha       the stage is lighted up again  moonlight bright on the      orchard the room in darkness where the professors figure is      just visible sleeping in the chair and screwed a little more      round towards the window  from behind the mossy boulder a      faunlike figure uncurls itself and peeps over with ears      standing up and elbows leaning on the stone playing a rustic      pipe and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and      listening  a shiver of wind passes blowing petals from the      appletrees       the faun darts his head towards where from right comes slowly      the figure of a greek youth holding a lute or lyre which his      fingers strike lifting out little wandering strains as of wind      whinnying in funnels and odd corners  the faun darts down      behind the stone and the youth stands by the boulder playing      his lute  slowly while he plays the whitened trunk of an      appletree is seen to dissolve into the body of a girl with      bare arms and feet her dark hair unbound and the face of the      professors wife  hypnotized she slowly sways towards him      their eyes fixed on each other till she is quite close  her      arms go out to him cling round his neck and their lips meet      but as they meet there comes a gasp and the professor with      rumpled hair is seen starting from his chair his hands thrown      up and at his horrified oh the stage is darkened with a      blackout       the voice of frust is heard speaking  frust  gee       the stage is lighted up again as in the opening scene  the      professor is seen in his chair with spilt sheets of paper round      him waking from a dream  he shakes himself pinches his leg      stares heavily round into the moonlight rises  prof  phew  beastly dream  boof  hm  he moves to the window and calls  blanche  blanche  to himself  made treesmade trees calling  blanche  wifes voice  yes  prof  where are you  wife  appearing by the stone with her hair down  here  prof  i sayiive been asleephad a dream  come in  ill tell you       she comes and they stand in the window  prof  i dreamed i saw afaun on that boulder blowing on a pipe  he looks nervously at the stone  with two damned little rabbits and a fox sitting up and listening  and then from out there came our friend orpheus playing on his confounded lute till he actually turned that tree there into you  and gradually hehe drew you like a snake till youerput your arms round his neck anderkissed him boof  i woke up  most unpleasant  why  your hairs down  wife  yes  prof  why  wife  it was no dream  he was bringing me to life  prof  what on earth  wife  do you suppose i am alive  im as dead as euridice  prof  good heavens blanche whats the matter with you tonight  wife  pointing to the litter of papers  why dont we live instead of writing of it  she points out unto the moonlight  what do we get out of life  money fame fashion talk learning  yes  and what good are they  i want
