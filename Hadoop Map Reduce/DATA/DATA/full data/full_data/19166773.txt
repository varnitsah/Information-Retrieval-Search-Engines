19166773	the heavenly footman  or a description of the man that gets to heaven with directions how to run so as to obtain  by  john bunyan        so run that ye may obtain1 cor ix 24     the authors epistle to all slothful and careless people   friends  solomon saith that the desire of the slothful killeth him and if so what will slothfulness itself do to those that entertain it the proverb is he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame and this i dare be bold to say no greater shame can befall a man than to see that he hath fooled away his soul and sinned away eternal life and i am sure this is the next way to do it namely to be slothful slothful i say in the work of salvation the vineyard of the slothful man in reference to the things of this life is not fuller of briers nettles and stinking weeds than he that is slothful for heaven hath his heart full of heartchoking and souldamning sin  slothfulness hath these two evils first to neglect the time in which it should be getting heaven and by that means doth in the second place bring in untimely repentance i will warrant you that he who should lose his soul in this world through slothfulness will have no cause to be glad thereat when he comes to hell slothfulness is usually accompanied with carelessness and carelessness is for the most part begotten by senselessness and senselessness doth again put fresh strength into slothfulness and by this means the soul is left remediless slothfulness shutteth out christ slothfulness shameth the soul  slothfulness is condemned even by the feeblest of all the creatures go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold that is he will not break up the fallow ground of his heart because there must be some pains taken by him that will do it therefore he shall beg in harvest that is when the saints of god shall have their glorious heaven and happiness given to them but the sluggard shall have nothing that is be never the better for his crying for mercy according to that in matthew xxv 1012  if you would know a sluggard in the things of heaven compare him with one that is slothful in the things of this world as 1 he that is slothful is loath to set about the work he should follow so is he that is slothful for heaven 2 he that is slothful is one that is willing to make delays so is he that is slothful for heaven 3 he that is a sluggard any small matter that cometh in between he will make it a sufficient excuse to keep him off from plying his work so it is also with him that is slothful for heaven 4 he that is slothful doeth his work by the halves and so it is with him that is slothful for heaven he may almost but he shall never altogether obtain perfection of deliverance from hell he may almost but he shall never without he mend be altogether a saint 5 they that are slothful do usually lose the season in which things are to be done and thus it is also with them that are slothful for heaven they miss the seasons of grace and therefore 6 they that are slothful have seldom or never good fruit so also it will be with the soulsluggard 7 they that are slothful are chid for the same so also will christ deal with those that are not active for him thou wicked and slothful servant out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou saidst i was thus and thus wherefore then gavest thou not my money to the bank c take the unprofitable servant and cast him into utter darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth  what shall i say 1 time runs and will ye be slothful 2 much of your lives are past and will you be slothful 3 your souls are worth a thousand worlds and will ye be slothful 4 the day of death and judgment is at the door and will ye be slothful 5 the curse of god hangs over your heads and will you be slothful 6 besides the devils are earnest laborious and seek by all means every day by every sin to keep you out of heaven and hinder you of salvation and will you be slothful 7 also your neighbors are diligent for things that will perish and will you be slothful for things that will endure for ever 8 would you be willing to be damned for slothfulness 9 would you be willing the angels of god should neglect to fetch your souls away to heaven when you lie a dying and the devils stand by ready to scramble for them 10 was christ slothful in the work of your redemption 11 are his ministers slothful in tendering this unto you 12 and lastly if all this will not move i tell you god will not be slothful or negligent to damn you their damnation slumbereth not 2 pet ii 3 nor will the devils neglect to fetch thee nor hell neglect to shut its mouth upon thee  sluggard art thou asleep still art thou resolved to sleep the sleep of death will neither tidings from heaven nor hell awake thee wilt thou say still yet a little sleep a little slumber and a little folding of the arms to sleep wilt thou yet turn thyself in thy sloth as the door is turned upon the hinges o that i was one that was skilful in lamentation and had but a yearning heart towards thee how would i pity thee how would i bemoan thee o that i could with jeremiah let my eyes run down with rivers of water for thee poor soul lost soul dying soul what a hard heart have i that i cannot mourn for thee if thou shouldst lose but a limb a child or a friend it would not be so much but poor man it is thy soul if it was to lie in hell but for a day but for a year nay ten thousand years it would in comparison be nothing but o it is for ever what a soulamazing word will that be which saith depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire c  objection but if i should set in and run as you would have me then i must run from all my friends for none of them are running that way  answer and if thou dost thou wilt run into the bosom of christ and of god and then what harm will that do thee  objection but if i run this way then i must run from all my sins  answer that is true indeed yet if thou dost not thou wilt run into hell fire  objection but if i run this way then i shall be hated and lose the love of my friends and relations and of those that i expect benefit from or have reliance on and i shall be mocked of all my neighbors  answer and if thou dost not thou art sure to lose the love and favor of god and christ the benefits of heaven and glory and be mocked of god for thy folly i will laugh at your calamity and mock when your fear cometh if thou wouldst not be hated and mocked then take heed thou by thy folly dost not procure the displeasure and mockings of the great god for his mocks and hatred will be terrible because they will fall upon thee in terrible times even when tribulation and anguish take hold on thee which will be when death and judgment come when all the men in the earth and all the angels in heaven cannot help thee  objection but surely i may begin this time enough a year or two hence may i not  answer first hast thou any lease of thy life did ever god tell thee thou shalt live half a year or two months longer nay it may be thou mayst not live so long and therefore secondly wilt thou be so sottish and unwise as to venture thy soul upon a little uncertain time thirdly dost thou know whether the day of grace will last a week longer or no for the day of grace is past with some before their life is ended and if it should be so with thee wouldst thou not say o that i had begun to run before the day of grace had been past and the gates of heaven shut against me but fourthly if thou shouldst see any of thy neighbors neglect the making sure of either house or land to themselves if they had it proffered to them saying time enough hereafterwhen the time is uncertain and besides they do not know whether ever it will be proffered to them again or no i say wouldst thou not call them fools and if so then dost thou think that thou art a wise man to let thy immortal soul hang over hell by a thread of uncertain time which may soon be cut asunder by death  but to speak plainly all these are the words of a slothful spirit arise man be slothful no longer set foot and heart and all into the way of god and run the crown is at the end of the race  farewell i wish our souls may meet with comfort at the journeys end  john bunyan      chapter i  heaven must be run for  so run that ye may obtain1 corinthians ix 24   heaven and happiness is that which every one desireth insomuch that wicked balaam could say let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his yet for all this there are but very few that do obtain that evertobedesired glory insomuch that many eminent professors drop short of a welcome from god into this pleasant place the apostle therefore because he did desire the salvation of the souls of the corinthians to whom he writes this epistle layeth them down in these words such counsel as if taken would be for their help and advantage  first not to be wicked and sit still and wish for heaven but to run for it secondly not to content themselves with every kind of running but saith he so run that ye may obtain  as if he should say some because they would not lose their souls begin to run betimes they run apace they run with patience they run the right way do you so run some run from both father and mother friends and companions and this that they may have the crown do you so run some run through temptations afflictions good report evil report that they may win the pearl do you so run so run that ye may obtain  these words are taken from mens running for a wager a very apt similitude to set before the eyes of the saints of the lord know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain that is do not only run but be sure you win as well as run so run that ye may obtain  i shall not need to make any great ado in opening the words at this time but shall rather lay down one doctrine that i do find in them and in prosecuting that i shall show you in some measure the scope of the words  the doctrine is this they that will have heaven must run for it  i say that they that will have heaven must run for it i beseech you to heed it well know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run ye the prize is heaven and if you will have it you must run for it you have another scripture for this in the 12th of the hebrews wherefore seeing we also saith the apostle are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and let us run saith he again saith paul i so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air  but before i go any farther let me explain the nature and reasons of this running  as to its nature this running is called  1 fleeing observe that this running is not an ordinary or any sort of running but it is to be understood of the swiftest sort of running and therefore in the 6th of the hebrews it is called a fleeing that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us mark who have fled it is taken from that xxth of joshua concerning the man that was to flee to the city of refuge when the avenger of blood was hard at his heels to take vengeance on him for the offence he had committed therefore it is a running or fleeing for ones life a running with all might and main as we use to say so run  2 pressing this running in another place is called a pressing i press toward the mark phil iii which signifieth that they that will have heaven must not stick at any difficulties they meet with but press crowd and thrust through all that may stand between heaven and their souls so run  3 continuing this running is called in another place a continuing in the way of life if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel not to run a little now and then by fits and starts or halfway or almost thither but to run for my life to run through all difficulties and to continue therein to the end of the race which must be to the end of my life so run that ye may obtain and the reasons for this point are these  1 because every one that runneth doth not obtain the prize there be many that do run yea and run far too who yet miss the crown that standeth at the end of the race you know that all that run in a race do not obtain the victory they all run but one wins and so it is here it is not every one that runneth nor every one that seeketh nor every one that striveth for the mastery that hath it though a man do strive for the mastery saith paul yet he is not crowned unless he strive lawfully that is unless he so run and so strive as to have gods approbation  what do you think that every heavy heeled professor will have heaven what every lazy one every wanton and foolish professor that will be stopped by any thing kept back by any thing that scarce runneth so fast heavenward as a snail creepeth on the ground nay there are some professors that do not go on so fast in the way of god as a snail doth go on the wall and yet these think that heaven and happiness is for them but stay there are many more that run than there be that obtain therefore he that will have heaven must run for it  2 because you know that though men do run yet if they do not overcome or win as well as run what will they be the better for the running they will get nothing you know the man that runneth doth do it that he may win the prize but if he doth not obtain it he doth lose his labor spend his pains and time and that to no purpose i say he getteth nothing and ah how many such runners will there be found in the day of judgment even multitudesmultitudes that have run yea run so far as to come to heavens gates are not able to get any further but there stand knocking when it is too late crying lord lord when they have nothing but rebukes for their pains depart from me you come not in here you come too late you ran too lazy the door is shut when once the master of the house is risen up saith christ and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us he shall answer and say unto you i know you not depart c o sad will the state of those be that run and miss i therefore if you will have heaven you must run for it and so run that ye may obtain  3 because the way is long i speak metaphorically and there is many a dirty step many a high hill much work to do a wicked heart world and devil to overcome i say there are many steps to be taken by those that intend to be saved by running or walking in the steps of that faith of our father abraham out of egypt thou must go through the red sea thou must run a long and tedious journey through the vast howling wilderness before thou come to the land of promise  4 they that will go to heaven must run for it because as the way is so long so the time in which they are to get to the end of it is very uncertain the time present is the only time thou hast no more time allotted thee than that thou now enjoyest boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth do not say i have time enough to get to heaven seven years hence for i tell thee the bell may toll for thee before seven days more be ended when death comes away thou must go whether thou art provided or not and therefore look to it make no delays it is not good dallying with things of so great concernment as the salvation or damnation of thy soul you know he that hath a great way to go in a little time and less by half than he thinks of had need to run for it  5 they that will have heaven must run for it because the devil the law sin death and hell follow them there is never a poor soul that is going to heaven but the devil the law sin death and hell make after that soul your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and i will assure you the devil is nimble he can run apace he is light of foot he hath overtaken many he hath turned up their heels and hath given them an everlasting fall also the law that can shoot a great way have a care to keep out of the reach of those great guns the ten commandments hell also hath a wide mouth it can stretch itself farther than you are aware of and as the angel said to lot take heed look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain that is any where between this and heaven lest thou be consumed so say i to thee take heed tarry not lest either the devil hell death or the fearful curses of the law of god do overtake thee and throw thee down in the midst of thy sins so as never to rise and recover again if this were well considered then thou as well as i would say they that will have heaven must run for it  6 they that will go to heaven must run for it because perchance the gates of heaven may shut shortly sometimes sinners have not heavengates open to them so long as they suppose and if they be once shut against a man they are so heavy that all the men in the world or all the angels in heaven are not able to open them i shut and no man can open saith christ and how if thou shouldst come but one quarter of an hour too late i tell thee it will cost thee an eternity to bewail thy misery in francis spira can tell thee what it is to stay till the gates of mercy be quite shut or to run so lazily that they be shut before thou get within them what to be shut out what out of heaven sinner rather than lose it run for it yea and so run that thou mayst obtain  7 lastly because if thou lose thou losest all thou losest soul god christ heaven ease peace c besides thou layest thyself open to all the shame contempt and reproach that either god christ saints the world sin the devil and all can lay upon thee as christ saith of the foolish builder so will i say of thee if thou be such a one who runs and misseth i say even all that go by will begin to mock at thee saying this man began to run well but was not able to finish but more of this anon     chapter ii  directions for this heavenly course   question but how should a poor soul do so to run for this very thing is that which afflicteth me sore as you say to think that i may run and yet fall short methinks to fall short at last oh it fears me greatly pray tell me therefore how i should run  answer that thou mayst indeed be satisfied in this particular consider these following things  the first directionif thou wouldst so run as to obtain the kingdom of heaven then be sure that thou get into the way that leadeth thither for it is a vain thing to think that ever thou shalt have the prize though thou runnest ever so fast unless thou art in the way that leads to it set the case that there should be a man in london that was to run to york for a wager now though he run ever so swiftly yet if he run full south he might run himself out of breath and be never the nearer the prize but rather the farther off just so is it here it is not simply the runner nor yet the hasty runner that winneth the crown unless he be in the way that leadeth thereto i have observed that little time which i have been a professor that there is a great running to and fro some this way and some that way yet it is to be feared most of them are out of the way and then though they run as swift as the eagle can fly they are benefited nothing at all  here is one runs a quaking another a ranting one again runs after the baptism and another after the independency here is one for freewill and another for presbytery and yet possibly most of all these sects run quite the wrong way and yet every one is for his life his soul either for heaven or hell  if thou now say which is the way i tell thee it is christ the son of mary the son of god jesus saith i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh to the father but by me so then thy business is if thou wouldst have salvation to see if christ be thine with all his benefits whether he hath covered thee with his righteousness whether he hath showed thee that thy sins are washed away with his heartblood whether thou art planted into him and whether thou have faith in him so as to make a life out of him and to conform thee to him that is such faith as to conclude that thou art righteous because christ is thy righteousness and so constrained to walk with him as the joy of thy heart because he saved thy soul and for the lords sake take heed and do not deceive thyself and think thou art in the way upon too slight grounds for if thou miss of the way thou wilt miss of the prize and if thou miss of that i am sure thou wilt lose thy soul even that soul which is worth more than the whole world  but i have treated more largely on this in my book of the two covenants and therefore shall pass it now only i beseech thee to have a care of thy soul and that thou mayst so do take this counsel mistrust thy own strength and throw it away down on thy knees in prayer to the lord for the spirit of truth search his word for direction flee seducers company keep company with the soundest christians that have most experience of christ and be sure thou have a care of quakers ranters freewillers also do not have too much company with some anabaptists though i go under that name myself  i tell thee this is such a serious matter and i fear thou wilt so little regard it that the thoughts of the worth of the thing and of thy too light regarding it doth even make my heart ache whilst i am waiting to thee the lord teach thee the way by his spirit and then i am sure thou wilt know it so run  only by the way let me bid thee have a care of two things and so i shall pass to the next thing 1 have a care of relying on the outward obedience to any of gods commands or thinking thyself ever the better in the sight of god for that 2 take heed of fetching peace for thy soul from any inherent righteousness but if thou canst believe that as thou art a sinner so thou art justified freely by the love of god through the redemption that is in christ and that god for christs sake hath forgiven thee not because he saw any thing done or to be done in or by thee to move him thereunto to do it because this is the right way the lord put thee into it and keep thee in it  the second directionas thou shouldst get into the way so thou shouldst also be much in studying and musing on the way you know men that would be expert in any thing are usually much in studying of that thing and so likewise is it with those that quickly grow expert in any thing this therefore thou shouldst do  let thy study be much exercised about christ who is the way what he is what he hath done and why he is what he is and why he hath done what is done as why he took upon him the form of a servant why he was made in the likeness of men why he cried why he died why he bare the sins of the world why he was made sin and why he was made righteousness why he is in heaven in the nature of man and what he doth there be much in musing and considering of these things be thinking also enough for thy warning of those places which thou must not come near but leave some on this hand and some on that hand as it is with those that travel into other countries they must leave such a gate on this hand and such a bush on that hand and go by such a place where standeth such a thing thus therefore you must do avoid such things as are expressly forbidden in the word of god withdraw thy foot far from her and come not nigh the door of her house for her steps take hold of hell going down to the chambers of death and so of every thing that is not in the way have a care of it that thou go not by it come not near it have nothing to do with it so run  the third directionnot only thus but in the next place thou must strip thyself of those things that may hang upon thee to the hindering of thee in the way to the kingdom of heaven as covetousness pride lust or whatever else thy heart may be inclining unto which may hinder thee in this heavenly race men that run for a wager if they intend to win as well as run do not use to encumber themselves or carry those things about them that may be a hindrance to them in their running every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things that is he layeth aside every thing that would be any wise a disadvantage to him as saith the apostle let us lay aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us  it is but a vain thing to talk of going to heaven if thou let thy heart be encumbered with those things that would hinder would you not say that such a man would be in danger of losing though he run if he fill his pockets with stones hang heavy garments on his shoulders and great lumpish shoes on his feet so it is here thou talkest of going to heaven and yet fillest thy pockets with stones that is fillest thy heart with this world lettest that hang on thy shoulders with its profits and pleasures alas alas thou art widely mistaken if thou intendest to win thou must strip thou must lay aside every weight thou must be temperate in all things thou must so run  the fourth directionbeware of bypaths take heed thou dost not turn into those lanes which lead out of the way there are crooked paths paths in which men go astray paths that lead to death and damnation but take heed of all those some of them are dangerous because of practice some because of opinion but mind them not mind the path before thee look right before thee turn neither to the right hand nor to the left but let thine eyes look right on even right before thee ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil this counsel being not so seriously taken as given is the reason of that starting from opinion to opinion reeling this way and that way out of this lane into that lane and so missing the way to the kingdom  though the way to heaven be but one yet there are many crooked lanes and bypaths shoot down upon it as i may say and again notwithstanding the kingdom of heaven be the biggest city yet usually those bypaths are most beaten most travellers go those ways and therefore the way to heaven is hard to be found and as hard to be kept in by reason of these yet nevertheless it is in this case as it was with the harlot of jericho she had one scarlet thread tied in her window by which her house was known so it is here the scarlet stream of christs blood runs throughout the way to the kingdom of heaven therefore mind that see if thou do find the besprinkling of the blood of christ in the way and if thou do be of good cheer thou art in the right way  but have a care thou beguile not thyself with a fancy for then thou mayst light into any lane or way but that thou mayst not be mistaken consider though it seem ever so pleasant yet if thou do not find that in the very middle of the road there is written with the heart blood of christ that he came into the world to save sinners and that we are justified though we are ungodly shun that way for this it is which the apostle meaneth when he saith we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the vail that is to say his flesh how easy a matter is it in this our day for the devil to be too cunning for poor souls by calling his bypaths the way to the kingdom if such an opinion or fancy be but cried up by one or more this inscription being set upon it by the devil this is the way of god how speedily greedily and by heaps do poor simple souls throw away themselves upon it especially if it be daubed over with a few external acts of morality if so good but this is because men do not know painted bypaths from the plain way to the kingdom of heaven they have not yet learned the true christ and what his righteousness is neither have they a sense of their own insufficiency but are bold proud presumptuous selfconceited and therefore take  the fifth directiondo not thou be too much in looking too high in thy journey heavenwards you know men that run a race do not use to stare and gaze this way and that neither do they use to cast up their eyes too high lest haply through their too much gazing with their eyes after other things they in the mean time stumble and catch a fall the very same case is this if thou gaze and stare after every opinion and way that comes into the world also if thou be prying overmuch in gods secret decrees or let thy heart too much entertain questions about some nice foolish curiosities thou mayst stumble and fall as many hundreds in england have done both in ranting and quakery to their eternal overthrow without the marvellous operation of gods grace be suddenly stretched forth to bring them back again  take heed therefore follow not that proud lofty spirit that devillike cannot be content with his own station david was of an excellent spirit where he saith lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child do thou so run  the sixth directiontake heed that you have not an ear open to every one that calleth after you as you are in your journey men that run you know if any do call after them saying i would speak with you or go not too fast and you shall have my company with youif they run for some great matter they use to say alas i cannot stay i am in haste pray talk not to me now neither can i stay for you i am running for a wager if i win i am made if i lose i am undone and therefore hinder me not thus wise are men when they run for corruptible things and thus shouldst thou do and thou hast more cause to do so than they forasmuch as they run but for things that last not but thou for an incorruptible glory i give thee notice of this betimes knowing that thou shalt have enough call after thee even the devil sin this world vain company pleasures profits esteem among men ease pomp pride together with an innumerable company of such companions one crying stay for me the other saying do not leave me behind a third saying and take me along with you what will you go saith the devil without your sins pleasures and profits are you so hasty can you not stay and take these along with you will you leave your friends and companions behind you can you not do as your neighbors docarry the world sin lust pleasure profit esteem among men along with youhave a care thou do not let thine ear now be open to the tempting enticing alluring and soulentangling flatteries of such sinksouls as these are my son saith solomon if sinners entice thee consent thou not  you know what it cost the young man whom solomon speaks of in the 7th of proverbs that was enticed by a harlot with her much fair speech she won him and caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced him till he went after her as an ox to the slaughter as a fool to the correction of the stocks even so far till the dart struck through his liver and he knew not that it was for his life hearken unto me now therefore saith he o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth let not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her paths for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain that is kept out of heaven by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death soul take this counsel and say satan sin lust pleasure profit pride friends companions and every thing elselet me alone stand off come not nigh me for i am running for heaven for my soul for god for christfrom hell and everlasting damnation if i win i win all and if i lose i lose all let me alone for i will not hear so run  the seventh directionin the next place be not daunted though thou meetest with ever so many discouragements in thy journey thither that man that is resolved for heaven if satan cannot win him by flatteries he will endeavor to weaken him by discouragements saying thou art a sinner thou hast broken gods law thou art not elected thou comest too late the day of grace is past god doth not care for thee thy heart is naught thou art lazy with a hundred other discouraging suggestions and thus it was with david where he saith i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living as if he should say the devil did so rage and my heart was so base that had i judged according to my own sense and feeling i had been absolutely distracted but i trusted to christ in the promise and looked that god would be as good as his promise in having mercy upon me an unworthy sinner and this is that which encouraged me and kept me from fainting  and thus must thou do when satan or the law or thy conscience do go about to dishearten thee either by the greatness of thy sins the wickedness of thy heart the tediousness of the way the loss of outward enjoyments the hatred that thou wilt procure from the world or the like then thou must encourage thyself with the freeness of the promises the tenderheartedness of christ the merits of his blood the freeness of his invitations to come in the greatness of the sin of others that have been pardoned and that the same god through the same christ holdeth forth the same grace as free as ever if these be not thy meditations thou wilt draw very heavily in the way to heaven if thou do not give up all for lost and so knock off from following any farther therefore i say take heart in thy journey and say to them that seek thy destruction rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me  the eighth directiontake heed of being offended at the cross that thou must go by before thou come to heaven you must understand as i have already touched that there is no man that goeth to heaven but he must go by the cross the cross is the standing waymark by which all they that go to glory must pass  we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution if thou art in thy way to the kingdom my life for thine thou wilt come at the cross shortly the lord grant thou dost not shrink at it so as to turn thee back again if any man will come after me saith christ let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me the cross it stands and hath stood from the beginning as a waymark to the kingdom of heaven you know if one ask you the way to such and such a place you for the better direction do not only say this is the way but then also say you must go by such a gate by such a stile such a bush tree bridge or such like why so it is here art thou enquiring the way to heaven why i tell thee christ is the way into him thou must get even into his righteousness to be justified and if thou art in him thou wilt presently see the cross thou must go close by it thou must touch it nay thou must take it up or else thou wilt quickly go out of the way that leads to heaven and turn up some of those crooked lanes that lead down to the chambers of death  now thou mayst know the cross by these six things 1 it is known in the doctrine of justification 2 in the doctrine of mortification 3 in the doctrine of perseverance 4 in selfdenial 5 in patience 6 in communion with poor saints  1 in the doctrine of justification there is a great deal of the cross in that a man is forced to suffer the destruction of his own righteousness for the righteousness of another this is no easy matter for a man to do i assure you it stretcheth every vein in his heart before he will be brought to yield to it what for a man to deny reject abhor and throw away all his prayers tears alms keeping of sabbaths hearing reading with the rest in the point of justification and to count them accursed and to be willing in the very midst of the sense of his sins to throw himself wholly upon the righteousness and obedience of another man abhorring his own counting it as a deadly sin as the open breach of the law i say to do this indeed and in truth is the biggest piece of the cross and therefore paul calleth this very thing a suffering where he saith and i have suffered the loss of all things which principally was his righteousness that i might win christ and be found in him not having but rejecting my own righteousness that is the first  2 in the doctrine of mortification is also much of the cross is it nothing for a man to lay hands on his vile opinions on his vile sins on his bosom sins on his beloved pleasant darling sins that stick as close to him as the flesh sticks to the bones what to lose all these brave things that my eyes behold for that which i never saw with my eyes what to lose my pride my covetousness my vain company sports and pleasures and the rest i tell you this is no easy matter if it were what need of all those prayers sighs watchings what need we be so backward to it nay do you not see that some men before they will set about this work will even venture the loss of their souls heaven god christ and all what mean else all those delays and putoffs saying stay a little longer i am loath to leave my sins while i am so young and in health again what is the reason else that others do it so by the halves coldly and seldom notwithstanding they are convinced over and over and over nay and also promise to amend and yet all is in vain i will assure you to cut off right hands and pluck out right eyes is no pleasure to the flesh  3 the doctrine of perseverance is also cross to the flesh which is not only to begin but to hold out not only to bid fair and to say would i had heaven but so to know christ to put on christ and walk with christ as to come to heaven indeed it is no great matter to begin to look for heaven to begin to seek the lord to begin to shun sin oh but it is a very great matter to continue with gods approbation my servant caleb saith god because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully followed me always he hath continually followed me him will i bring into the land almost all the many thousands of the children of israel in their generation fell short of perseverance when they walked from egypt towards the land of canaan indeed they went to work at first pretty willingly but they were very shortwinded they were quickly out of breath and in their hearts they turned back again into egypt  it is an easy matter for a man to run hard for a spurt for a furlong for a mile or two oh i but to hold out for a hundred for a thousand for ten thousand miles that man that doth this must look to meet with cross pain and wearisomeness to the flesh especially if as he goeth he meeteth with briars and quagmires and other encumbrances that make his journey so much the more painful  nay do you not see with your eyes daily that perseverance is a very great part of the cross why else do men so soon grow weary i could point out many that after they have followed the ways of god about a twelvemonth others it may be two three or four some more and some less years have been beat out of windthey have taken up their lodging and rest before they have got halfway to heaven some in this some in that sin and have secretly nay sometimes openly said that the way is too strait the race too long the religion too holy and they cannot hold outi can go no farther  and so likewise of the other three namely patience selfdenial communion and communication with and to the poor saints how hard are these things it is an easy matter to deny another man but it is not so easy a matter to deny ones self to deny myself out of love to god to his gospel to his saints of this advantage and of that gain nay of that which otherwise i might lawfully do were it not for offending them that scripture is but seldom read and seldomer put in practice which saith i will eat no flesh while the world standeth if it make my brother to offend again we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves  but how froward how hasty how peevish and selfresolved are the generality of professors at this day alas how little considering the poor unless it be to say be thou warmed and filled but to give is a seldom work also especially to give to any poor i tell you all these things are cross to flesh and blood and that man that hath a watchful eye over the flesh and also some considerable measure of strength against it shall find his heart in these things like unto a starting horse that is rid without a curbing bridle ready to start at every thing that is offensive to him yea and ready to run away too do what the rider can  it is the cross which keepeth back those that are kept from heaven i am persuaded were it not for the cross where we have one professor we should have twenty but this crossthat is it which spoileth all  some men as i said before when they come at the cross can go no farther but back again to their sins they must go others stumble at it and break their necks others again when they see the cross is approaching turn aside to the left hand or to the right hand and so think to get to heaven another way but they will be deceived for all that will live godly in christ jesus shall mark it shall suffer persecution there are but few when they come at the cross cry welcome cross as some of the martyrs did to the stake they were burned at  therefore if thou meet with the cross in thy journey in what manner soever it be be not daunted and say alas what shall i do now but rather take courage knowing that by the cross is the way to the kingdom can a man believe in christ and not be hated by the devil can he make a profession of this christ and that sweetly and convincingly and the children of satan hold their tongue can darkness agree with light or the devil endure that christ jesus should be honored both by faith and a heavenly conversation and let that soul alone at quiet did you never read that the dragon persecuted the woman and that christ saith in the world ye shall have tribulation  the ninth directionbeg of god that he would do these two things for thee first enlighten thine understanding and secondly inflame thy will if these two be but effectually done there is no fear but what thou wilt go safe to heaven  one of the great reasons why men and women do so little regard the other world is because they see so little of it and the reason why they see so little of it is because they have their understanding darkened and therefore saith paul do not you believers walk as do other gentiles even in the vanity of their minds having their understandings darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance or foolishness that is in them because of the blindness of their heart walk not as those run not with them alas poor souls they have their understandings darkened their hearts blinded and that is the reason they have such undervaluing thoughts of the lord jesus christ and the salvation of their souls for when men do come to see the things of another world what a god what a christ what a heaven and what an eternal glory there is to be enjoyed also when they see that it is possible for them to have a share in it i tell you it will make them run through thick and thin to enjoy it moses having a sight of this because his understanding was enlightened feared not the wrath of the king but chose rather to suffer afflictions with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season he refused to be called the son of the kings daughter accounting it wonderful riches to be accounted worthy so much as to suffer for christ with the poor despised saints and that was because he saw him who is invisible and had respect unto the recompense of reward and this is that which the apostle usually prayeth for in his epistles for the saints namely that they might know what is the hope of gods calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and that they might be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and know the love of christ which passeth knowledge  pray therefore that god would enlighten thy understanding that will be a very great help unto thee it will make thee endure many a hard brunt for christ as paul saith after you were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions you took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance if there be ever such a rare jewel lying just in a mans way yet if he see it not he will rather trample upon it than stoop for it and it is because he sees it not why so it is here though heaven be worth ever so much and thou hast ever so much need of it yet if thou see it not that is have not thy understanding opened or enlightened to see thou wilt not regard at all therefore cry to the lord for enlightening grace and say lord open my blind eyes lord take the veil off my dark heart show me the things of the other world and let me see the sweetness glory and excellency of them for christs sake this is the first thing the second is  the tenth directioncry to god that he would inflame thy will also with the things of the other world for when a mans will is fully set to do such or such a thing then it must be a very hard matter that shall hinder that man from bringing about his end when pauls will was set resolvedly to go up to jerusalem though it was signified to him before what he should there suffer he was not daunted at all nay saith he i am ready or willing not only to be bound but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus his will was inflamed by love to christ and therefore all the persuasions that could be used wrought nothing at all  your selfwilled people nobody knows what to do with them we use to say of such he will have his own will do all that you can indeed to have such a will for heaven is an admirable advantage to a man that undertaketh a race hither a man that is resolved and hath his will fixed saith i will do my best to advantage myself i will do my worst to hinder my enemies i will not give out as long as i can stand i will have it or i will lose my life so job though he slay me yet will i trust in him so jacob i will not let thee go except thou bless me i will i will i will o this blessed inflamed will for heaven what is like it if a man be willing then any argument shall be matter of encouragement but if unwilling then any argument shall give discouragement this is seen both in saints and sinners in them that are the children of god and also those that are the children of the devil as  1 the saints of old being willing and resolved for heaven what could stop them could fire and faggot sword or halter stinking dungeons whips bears bulls lions cruel rackings stoning starving nakedness in all these things they were more than conquerors through him that loved them who had also made them willing in the day of his power  2 see again on the other side the children of the devil because they are not willing how many shifts and starting holes they will have i have married a wife i have a farm i shall offend my landlord i shall offend my master i shall lose my trading i shall lose my pride my pleasures i shall be mocked and scoffedtherefore i dare not comei saith another will stay till i am older till my children are out till i am got a little aforehand in the world till i have done this and that and the other business but alas the thing is they are not willing for were they but soundly willing these and a thousand such as these would hold them no faster than the cords held samson when he broke them like burnt flax  i tell you the will is all that is one of the chief things which turns the wheel either backwards or forwards and god knoweth that full well and so likewise doth the devil and therefore they both endeavor very much to strengthen the will of their servants god is for making his a willing people to serve him and the devil doth what he can to possess the will and affection of those that are his with love to sin and therefore when christ comes close to the matter indeed saith he ye will not come to me how often would i have gathered you as a hen doth her chickens but ye would not the devil had possessed their wills and so long he was sure enough of them  o therefore cry hard to god to inflame thy will for heaven and christ thy will i say if that be rightly set for heaven thou wilt not be beat off with discouragements and this was the reason that when jacob wrestled with the angel though he lost a limb as it were for the hollow of his thigh was put out of joint as he wrestled with him yet saith he i will not mark i will not let thee go except thou bless me get thy will tipt with the heavenly grace and resolution against all discouragements and then thou goest full speed for heaven but if thou falter in thy will and be not sound there thou wilt run hobbling and halting all the way thou runnest and also to be sure thou wilt fall short at last the lord give thee a will and courage  thus have i done with directing thee how to run to the kingdom be sure thou keep in memory what i have said unto thee lest thou lose thy way but because i would have thee think of them take all in short in this little bit of paper 1 get into the way 2 then study on it 3 then strip and lay aside every thing that would hinder 4 beware of bypaths 5 cry hard to god for an enlightened heart and a willing mindand god give thee a prosperous journey     chapter iii  motives to pursue this heavenly course   yet before i do quite take my leave of thee let me give thee a few motives to take along with thee it may be they will be as good as a pair of spurs to prick on thy lumpish heart in this rich journey  the first motiveconsider there is no way but this thou must either win or lose if thou winnest then heaven god christ glory ease peace life yea life eternal is thine thou shalt be made equal to the angels in heaven thou shalt sorrow no more sigh no more feel no more pain thou shalt be out of the reach of sin hell death the devil the grave and whatever else may endeavor thy hurt but contrariwise and if thou lose then thy loss is heaven glory god christ ease peace and whatever else tendeth to make eternity comfortable to the saints besides thou procurest eternal death sorrow pain blackness and darkness fellowship with devils together with the everlasting damnation of thy own soul  the second motiveconsider that this devil this hell death and damnation follow after thee as hard as they can drive and have their commission so to do by the law against which thou hast sinned and therefore for the lords sake make haste  the third motiveif they seize upon thee before thou get to the city of refuge they will put an everlasting stop to thy journey this also cries run for it  the fourth motiveknow also that now heavens gates the heart of christ with his arms are wide open to receive thee o methinks that this consideration that the devil followeth after to destroy and that christ standeth openarmed to receive should make thee reach out and fly with all haste and speed and therefore  the fifth motivekeep thine eye upon the prize be sure that thy eyes be continually upon the profit thou art like to get  the reason why men are so apt to faint in their race for heaven lieth chiefly in either of these two things they do not seriously consider the worth of the prize or else if they do they are afraid it is too good for them but most lose heaven for want of considering the prize and the worth of it and therefore that thou mayst not do the like  1 keep thine eye much upon the excellency the sweetness the beauty the comfort the peace that is to be had there by those that win the prize this was that which made the apostle run through any thinggood report evil report persecution affliction hunger nakedness peril by sea and peril by land bonds and imprisonments also it made others endure to be stoned sawn asunder to have their eyes bored out with augers their bodies broiled on gridirons their tongues cut out of their mouths to be boiled in cauldrons thrown to the wild beasts burned at the stake whipped at posts and a thousand other fearful torments while they looked not at the things which are seen as the things of this world but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal o this word eternal it was that made them so firm that when they might have had deliverance they would not accept it for they knew that in the world to come they should have a better resurrection  2 and do not let the thoughts of the rareness of the place make thee say in thy heart this is too good for me for i tell thee heaven is prepared for whosoever will accept of it and they shall be entertained with hearty good welcome consider therefore that as bad as thou have got thither thither went scrubbed beggarly lazarus c nay it is prepared for the poor hearken my beloved brethren saith james that is take notice of it hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom therefore take heart and run man  the sixth motivethink much of them that are gone before first how really they go into the kingdom secondly how safe they are in the arms of jesus would they be here again for a thousand worlds or if they were would they be afraid that god would not make them welcome thirdly what would they judge of thee if they knew thy heart began to fail thee in thy journey or thy sins began to allure thee and to persuade thee to stop thy race would they not call thee a thousand fools and say o that he did but see what we see feel what we feel and taste of the dainties that we taste of oh if he were one quarter of an hour to behold to see to feel to taste and enjoy but the thousandth part of what we enjoy what would he do what would he suffer what would he leave undone would he favor sin would he love this world below would he be afraid of friends or shrink at the most fearful threatenings that the greatest tyrants could invent to give him nay those who have had but a sight of these things by faith when they have been as far off from them as heaven from earth yet they have been able to say with a comfortable and merry heart as the bird that sings in the spring that this and more shall not stop them from running to heaven  sometimes when my base heart hath been inclining to this world and to loiter in my journey towards heaven the very consideration of the glorious saints and angels in heaven what they enjoy and what low thoughts they have of the things of this world together how they would befool me if they did but know that my heart was drawing back hath caused me to rush forward to disdain these poor low empty beggarly things and to say to my soul come soul let us not be weary let us see what this heaven is let us even venture all for it and try if that will quit the cost surely abraham david paul and the rest of the saints of god were as wise as any are now and yet they lost all for this glorious kingdom o therefore throw away sinful lusts follow after righteousness love the lord jesus devote thyself to his fearill warrant thee he will give thee a goodly recompense reader what sayest thou to this art thou resolved to follow me nay resolve if thou canst to get before me so run that ye may obtain  the seventh motiveto encourage thee a little farther set to the work and when thou hast run thyself down weary then the lord jesus will take thee up and carry thee is not this enough to make any poor soul begin his race thou perhaps criest oh but i am feeble i am lame c well but christ hath a bosom consider therefore that when thou hast run thyself down weary he will put thee in his bosom he shall gather the lambs with his arms and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young this is the way that fathers take to encourage their children saying run sweet babe until thou art weary and then i will take thee up and carry thee he will gather his lambs with his arms and carry them in his bosom when they are weary they shall ride  the eighth motiveor else he will convey new strength from heaven into thy soul which will be as well the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint what shall i say besides that hath not already been said thou shalt have good and easy lodging good and wholesome diet the bosom of christ to lie in the joys of heaven to feed on shall i speak of the satisfaction and of the duration of all these verily to describe them to the height is a work too hard for me to do     chapter iv  application of the point   thus you see i have here spoken something though but little now i shall come to make some use and application of what hath been said and so conclude  the first useyou see here that he that will go to heaven must run for it yea and not only run but so run that is as i have said run earnestly run continually strip off every thing that would hinder in his race with the rest well then do you so run  1 and now let us examine a little art thou got into the right way art thou in christs righteousness do not say yes in thy heart when in truth there is no such matter it is a dangerous thing you know for a man to think he is in the right way when he is in the wrong it is the next way for him to lose his way and not only so but if he run for heaven as thou sayest thou dost even to lose that too oh this is the misery of most men to persuade themselves that they run right when they have never one foot in the way the lord give thee understanding here or else thou art undone for ever  prithee soul search when was it thou turned out of thy sins and righteousness into the righteousness of jesus christ i say dost thou see thyself in him and is he more precious to thee than the whole world is thy mind always musing on him and also to be walking with him dost thou count his company more precious than the whole world dost thou count all things but poor lifeless empty vain things without communion with him doth his company sweeten all things and his absence embitter all things soul i beseech thee be serious and lay it to heart and do not take things of such weighty concernment as the salvation or damnation of thy soul without good ground  2 art thou unladen of the things of this world as pride pleasures profits lusts vanities what dost thou think to run fast enough with the world thy sins and lusts in thy heart i tell thee soul they that have laid all aside every weight every sin and are got into the nimblest posture they find work enough to run so to run as to hold out  to run through all that opposition all the jostles all the rubs over all the stumbling blocks over all the snares from all the entanglements that the devil sin the world and their own hearts lay before them i tell thee if thou art going heavenward thou wilt find it no small or easy matter art thou therefore discharged and unladen of these things never talk of going to heaven if thou art not it is to be feared thou wilt be found among the many that will seek to enter in and shall not be able  the second useif so then in the next place what will become of them that are grown weary before they are got half way thither why man it is he that holdeth out to the end that must be saved it is he that overcometh that shall inherit all things it is not every one that begins agrippa gave a fair step for a sudden he steps almost into the body of christ in less than half an hour thou saith he to paul hast almost persuaded me to be a christian ah but it was but almost and so he had as good have been never a whit he stept fair indeed but yet he stopt short he was hot while he was at it but he was quickly out of wind o this but almost i tell you this but almost lost him his soul  methinks i have seen sometimes how these poor wretches that get but almost to heaven how fearfully their almost and their but almost will torment them in hell when they shall cry out in bitterness of their souls saying almost a christian i was almost got into the kingdom almost out of the hands of the devil almost out of my sins almost from under the curse of god almost and that was all almost but not altogether oh that i should be almost to heaven and should not go quite through friend it is a sad thing to sit down before we are in heaven and to grow weary before we come to the place of rest and if it should be thy case i am sure thou dost not so run as to obtain but again  the third usein the next place what then will become of them that some time since were running posthaste to heaven insomuch that they seemed to outstrip many but now are running as fast back again do you think those ever come thither what to run back again back again to sin to the world to the devil back again to the lusts of the flesh oh it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn to turn back again from the holy commandment those men shall not only be damned for sin but for professing to all the world that sin is better than christ for the man that runs back again doth as good as say i have tried christ and i have tried sin and i do not find so much profit in christ as in sin i say this man declareth this even by his running back again oh sad what a doom they will have who were almost at heavengates and then run back again if any draw back saith christ my soul shall have no pleasure in him again no man having put his hand to the plough that is set forward in ways of god and looking back turning back again is fit for the kingdom of heaven and if not fit for the kingdom of heaven then for certain he must needs be fit for the fire of hell and therefore saith the apostle those that bring forth these apostatizing fruits as briers and thorns are rejected being nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned  oh there is never another christ to save them by bleeding and dying for them and if they shall not escape that neglect then how shall they escape that reject and turn their back upon so great a salvation and if the righteous that is they that run for it will find work enough to get to heaven then where will the ungodly backsliding sinner appear oh if judas the traitor or francis spira the backslider were but now alive in the world to whisper these men in the ear a little and tell them what it hath cost their souls for backsliding surely it would stick by them and make them afraid of running back again so long as they had one day to live in this world  the fourth useso again fourthly how like to those mens sufferings will those be that have all this while sat still and have not so much as set one foot forward to the kingdom of heaven surely he that backslideth and he that sitteth still in sin are both of one mind the one will not stir because he loveth his sins and the things of this world the other runs back again because he loveth his sins and the things of this world is it not one and the same thing they are all one here and shall not one and the same hell hold them hereafter he is an ungodly one that never looked after christ and he is an ungodly one that did once look after him and then ran quite back again and therefore that word must certainly drop out of the mouth of christ against them both depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels  the fifth useagain here you may see in the next place that if they that will have heaven must run for it then this calls aloud to those who began but a while since to run i say for them to mend their pace if they intend to win you know that they which come hindmost had need run fastest friend i tell thee that there be those that have run ten years to thy one nay twenty to five and yet if thou talk with them sometimes they will say they doubt but they shall come late enough how then will it be with thee look to it therefore that thou delay no time not an hours time but part speedily with all with every thing that is a hindrance to thee in thy journey and run yea and so run that thou mayst obtain  the sixth useagain sixthly you that are old professors take you heed that the young striplings of jesus that began to strip but the other day do not outrun you so as to have that scripture fulfilled on you the first shall be last and the last first which will be a shame to you and a credit for them what for a young soldier to be more courageous than he that hath been used to wars to you that are hindermost i say strive to outrun them that are before you and to you that are foremost i say hold your ground and keep before them in faith and love if possible for indeed that is the right running for one to strive to outrun another even for the hindermost to endeavor to overtake the foremost and he that is before should be sure to lay out himself to keep his ground even to the very utmost but then  the seventh useagain how basely do they behave themselves how unlike they are to win that think it enough to keep company with the hindmost there are some men that profess themselves such as run for heaven as well as any yet if there be but any lazy slothful cold halfhearted professors in the country they will be sure to take example by them they think if they can but keep pace with them they shall do fair but these do not consider that the hindmost lose the prize you may know it if you will that it cost the foolish virgins dear for their coming too late they that were ready went in with him and the door was shut afterward mark afterward came the other the foolish virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said depart i know you not depart lazy professors slothful professors  oh methinks the word of god is so plain for the overthrow of your lazy professors that it is to be wondered men do not take more notice of it how was lots wife served for running lazily and for giving but one look behind her after the things she left in sodom how was esau served for staying too long before he came for the blessing and how were they served that are mentioned in the 13th of luke for staying till the door was shut also the foolish virgins a heavy aftergroan will they give that have thus stayed too long it turned lots wife into a pillar of salt it made esau weep with an exceeding loud and bitter cry it made judas hang himself yea and it will make thee curse the day in which thou wast born if thou miss of the kingdom as thou wilt certainly do if this be thy course but  the eighth useagain how and if thou by thy lazy running shouldst not only destroy thyself but also thereby be the cause of the damnation of some others for thou being a professor thou must think that others will take notice of thee and because thou art but a poor cold lazy runner and one that seeks to drive the world and pleasure along with thee why thereby others will think of doing so too nay say they why may not we as well as he he is a professor and yet he seeks for pleasures riches profits he loveth vain company and he is so and so and professeth that he is going for heaven yea and he saith also he doth not fear but he shall have entertainment let us therefore keep pace with him we shall fare no worse than he o how fearful a thing will it be if thou shalt be instrumental to the ruin of others by thy halting in the way of righteousness look to it thou wilt have strength little enough to appear before god to give an account of the loss of thy own soul thou needest not to have to give an account for others why thou didst stop them from entering in how wilt thou answer that saying you would not enter in yourselves and them that would you hindered for that saying will be eminently fulfilled on them that through their own idleness do keep themselves out of heaven and by giving others the same example hinder them also  the ninth usetherefore now to speak a word to both of you and so i shall conclude  1 i beseech you in the name of our lord jesus christ that none of you do run so lazily in the way to heaven as to hinder either yourselves or others i know that even he who runs laziest if he should see a man running for a temporal life who should so much neglect his own wellbeing in this world as to venture when he is running for his life to pick up here and there a lock of wool that hangeth by the wayside or to step now and then aside out of the way to gather up a straw or two or any rotten stick i say if he should do this when he is running for his life thou wouldst condemn him and dost thou not condemn thyself that dost the very same in effect nay worse that loiterest in thy race notwithstanding thy soul heaven glory and all is at stake have a care have a care poor wretched sinner have a care  2 if yet there shall be any that notwithstanding this advice will still be flagging and loitering in the way to the kingdom of glory be thou so wise as not to take example by them learn of no man farther than he followeth christ but look unto jesus who is not only the author and finisher of faith but who did for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despise the shame and is now set down at the right hand of god i say look to no man to learn of him any farther than he followeth christ be ye followers of me saith paul even as i am of christ though he was an eminent man yet his exhortation was that none should follow him any farther than he followed christ  provocationnow that you may be provoked in run with the foremost take notice of this when lot and his wife were running from cursed sodom to the mountains to save their lives it is said that his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt and yet you see that neither her practice nor the judgment of god that fell upon her for the same would cause lot to look behind him i have sometimes wondered at lot in this particular his wife looked behind her and died immediately but let what would become of her lot would not so much as look behind him to see her we do not read that he did so much as once look where she was or what was become of her his heart was indeed upon his journey and well it might be there was the mountain before him and the fire and brimstone behind him his life lay at stake and he had lost it if he had but looked behind him do thou so run and in thy race remember lots wife and remember her doom and remember for what that doom did overtake her and remember that god made her an example for all lazy runners to the end of the world and take heed thou fall not after the same example but if this will not provoke thee  consider thus 1 thy soul is thy own soul that is either to be saved or lost thou shalt not lose my soul by thy laziness it is thy own soul thy own ease thy own peace thy own advantage or disadvantage if it were my own that thou art desired to be good unto methinks reason should move thee somewhat to pity it but alas it is thy own thy own soul what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul gods people wish well to the soul of others and wilt not thou wish well to thy own and if this will not provoke thee then  think again 2 if thou lose thy soul it is thou also that must bear the blame it made cain stark mad to consider that he had not looked to his brother abels soul how much more will it perplex thee to think that thou hadst not a care of thy own and if this will not provoke thee to bestir thyself  think again 3 that if thou wilt not run the people of god are resolved to deal with thee even as lot dealt with his wife that is leave thee behind them it may be thou hast a father mother brother c going post haste to heaven wouldst thou be willing to be left behind them surely no  again 4 will it not be a dishonor to thee to see the very boys and girls in the country to have more wit than thyself it may be the servants of some men as the horsekeeper ploughman scullion c are more looking after heaven than their masters i am apt to think sometimes that more servants than masters that more tenants than landlords will inherit the kingdom of heaven but is not this a shame for them that are such i am persuaded you scorn that your servants should say that they are wiser than you in the things of the world and yet i am bold to say that many of them are wiser than you in the things of the world to come which are of greater concernment  expostulationwell then sinner what sayest thou where is thy heart wilt thou run art thou resolved to strip or art thou not think quickly man it is no dallying in this matter confer not with flesh and blood look up to heaven and see how thou likest it also to hell of which thou mayst understand something in my book called sighs from hell or the groans of a lost soul which i wish thee to read seriously overa and accordingly devote thyself if thou dost not know the way inquire at the word of god if thou wantest company cry for gods spirit if thou wantest encouragement entertain the promises but be sure thou begin betimes get into the way run apace and hold out to the end and the lord give thee a prosperous journey  farewell   footnote a this book will
