body of my greatuncle captain john carter of virginia away from the sight of men in that strange mausoleum in the old cemetery at richmond  often had i pondered on the odd instructions he had left me governing the construction of his mighty tomb and especially those parts which directed that he be laid in an open casket and that the ponderous mechanism which controlled the bolts of the vaults huge door be accessible only from the inside  twelve years had passed since i had read the remarkable manuscript of this remarkable man this man who remembered no childhood and who could not even offer a vague guess as to his age who was always young and yet who had dandled my grandfathers greatgrandfather upon his knee this man who had spent ten years upon the planet mars who had fought for the green men of barsoom and fought against them who had fought for and against the red men and who had won the ever beautiful dejah thoris princess of helium for his wife and for nearly ten years had been a prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium  twelve years had passed since his body had been found upon the bluff before his cottage overlooking the hudson and ofttimes during these long years i had wondered if john carter were really dead or if he again roamed the dead sea bottoms of that dying planet if he had returned to barsoom to find that he had opened the frowning portals of the mighty atmosphere plant in time to save the countless millions who were dying of asphyxiation on that fargone day that had seen him hurtled ruthlessly through fortyeight million miles of space back to earth once more  i had wondered if he had found his blackhaired princess and the slender son he had dreamed was with her in the royal gardens of tardos mors awaiting his return  or had he found that he had been too late and thus gone back to a living death upon a dead world  or was he really dead after all never to return either to his mother earth or his beloved mars  thus was i lost in useless speculation one sultry august evening when old ben my body servant handed me a telegram  tearing it open i read   meet me tomorrow hotel raleigh richmond  john carter   early the next morning i took the first train for richmond and within two hours was being ushered into the room occupied by john carter  as i entered he rose to greet me his oldtime cordial smile of welcome lighting his handsome face  apparently he had not aged a minute but was still the straight cleanlimbed fightingman of thirty  his keen grey eyes were undimmed and the only lines upon his face were the lines of iron character and determination that always had been there since first i remembered him nearly thirtyfive years before  well nephew he greeted me do you feel as though you were seeing a ghost or suffering from the effects of too many of uncle bens juleps  juleps i reckon i replied for i certainly feel mighty good but maybe its just the sight of you again that affects me  you have been back to mars  tell me  and dejah thoris  you found her well and awaiting you  yes i have been to barsoom again andbut its a long story too long to tell in the limited time i have before i must return  i have learned the secret nephew and i may traverse the trackless void at my will coming and going between the countless planets as i list but my heart is always in barsoom and while it is there in the keeping of my martian princess i doubt that i shall ever again leave the dying world that is my life  i have come now because my affection for you prompted me to see you once more before you pass over for ever into that other life that i shall never know and which though i have died thrice and shall die again tonight as you know death i am as unable to fathom as are you  even the wise and mysterious therns of barsoom that ancient cult which for countless ages has been credited with holding the secret of life and death in their impregnable fastnesses upon the hither slopes of the mountains of otz are as ignorant as we  i have proved it though i near lost my life in the doing of it but you shall read it all in the notes i have been making during the last three months that i have been back upon earth  he patted a swelling portfolio that lay on the table at his elbow  i know that you are interested and that you believe and i know that the world too is interested though they will not believe for many years yes for many ages since they cannot understand  earth men have not yet progressed to a point where they can comprehend the things that i have written in those notes  give them what you wish of it what you think will not harm them but do not feel aggrieved if they laugh at you  that night i walked down to the cemetery with him  at the door of his vault he turned and pressed my hand  goodbye nephew he said  i may never see you again for i doubt that i can ever bring myself to leave my wife and boy while they live and the span of life upon barsoom is often more than a thousand years  he entered the vault  the great door swung slowly to  the ponderous bolts grated into place  the lock clicked  i have never seen captain john carter of virginia since  but here is the story of his return to mars on that other occasion as i have gleaned it from the great mass of notes which he left for me upon the table of his room in the hotel at richmond  there is much which i have left out much which i have not dared to tell but you will find the story of his second search for dejah thoris princess of helium even more remarkable than was his first manuscript which i gave to an unbelieving world a short time since and through which we followed the fighting virginian across dead sea bottoms under the moons of mars  e r b     the gods of mars     chapter i  the plant men   as i stood upon the bluff before my cottage on that clear cold night in the early part of march 1886 the noble hudson flowing like the grey and silent spectre of a dead river below me i felt again the strange compelling influence of the mighty god of war my beloved mars which for ten long and lonesome years i had implored with outstretched arms to carry me back to my lost love  not since that other march night in 1866 when i had stood without that arizona cave in which my still and lifeless body lay wrapped in the similitude of earthly death had i felt the irresistible attraction of the god of my profession  with arms outstretched toward the red eye of the great star i stood praying for a return of that strange power which twice had drawn me through the immensity of space praying as i had prayed on a thousand nights before during the long ten years that i had waited and hoped  suddenly a qualm of nausea swept over me my senses swam my knees gave beneath me and i pitched headlong to the ground upon the very verge of the dizzy bluff  instantly my brain cleared and there swept back across the threshold of my memory the vivid picture of the horrors of that ghostly arizona cave again as on that fargone night my muscles refused to respond to my will and again as though even here upon the banks of the placid hudson i could hear the awful moans and rustling of the fearsome thing which had lurked and threatened me from the dark recesses of the cave i made the same mighty and superhuman effort to break the bonds of the strange anaesthesia which held me and again came the sharp click as of the sudden parting of a taut wire and i stood naked and free beside the staring lifeless thing that had so recently pulsed with the warm red lifeblood of john carter  with scarcely a parting glance i turned my eyes again toward mars lifted my hands toward his lurid rays and waited  nor did i have long to wait for scarce had i turned ere i shot with the rapidity of thought into the awful void before me  there was the same instant of unthinkable cold and utter darkness that i had experienced twenty years before and then i opened my eyes in another world beneath the burning rays of a hot sun which beat through a tiny opening in the dome of the mighty forest in which i lay  the scene that met my eyes was so unmartian that my heart sprang to my throat as the sudden fear swept through me that i had been aimlessly tossed upon some strange planet by a cruel fate  why not  what guide had i through the trackless waste of interplanetary space  what assurance that i might not as well be hurtled to some fardistant star of another solar system as to mars  i lay upon a closecropped sward of red grasslike vegetation and about me stretched a grove of strange and beautiful trees covered with huge and gorgeous blossoms and filled with brilliant voiceless birds  i call them birds since they were winged but mortal eye neer rested on such odd unearthly shapes  the vegetation was similar to that which covers the lawns of the red martians of the great waterways but the trees and birds were unlike anything that i had ever seen upon mars and then through the further trees i could see that most unmartian of all sightsan open sea its blue waters shimmering beneath the brazen sun  as i rose to investigate further i experienced the same ridiculous catastrophe that had met my first attempt to walk under martian conditions  the lesser attraction of this smaller planet and the reduced air pressure of its greatly rarefied atmosphere afforded so little resistance to my earthly muscles that the ordinary exertion of the mere act of rising sent me several feet into the air and precipitated me upon my face in the soft and brilliant grass of this strange world  this experience however gave me some slightly increased assurance that after all i might indeed be in some to me unknown corner of mars and this was very possible since during my ten years residence upon the planet i had explored but a comparatively tiny area of its vast expanse  i arose again laughing at my forgetfulness and soon had mastered once more the art of attuning my earthly sinews to these changed conditions  as i walked slowly down the imperceptible slope toward the sea i could not help but note the parklike appearance of the sward and trees  the grass was as closecropped and carpetlike as some old english lawn and the trees themselves showed evidence of careful pruning to a uniform height of about fifteen feet from the ground so that as one turned his glance in any direction the forest had the appearance at a little distance of a vast highceiled chamber  all these evidences of careful and systematic cultivation convinced me that i had been fortunate enough to make my entry into mars on this second occasion through the domain of a civilized people and that when i should find them i would be accorded the courtesy and protection that my rank as a prince of the house of tardos mors entitled me to  the trees of the forest attracted my deep admiration as i proceeded toward the sea  their great stems some of them fully a hundred feet in diameter attested their prodigious height which i could only guess at since at no point could i penetrate their dense foliage above me to more than sixty or eighty feet  as far aloft as i could see the stems and branches and twigs were as smooth and as highly polished as the newest of americanmade pianos the wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony while their nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the subdued light of the forest as clear and white as the finest china or again they were azure scarlet yellow or deepest purple  and in the same way was the foliage as gay and variegated as the stems while the blooms that clustered thick upon them may not be described in any earthly tongue and indeed might challenge the language of the gods  as i neared the confines of the forest i beheld before me and between the grove and the open sea a broad expanse of meadow land and as i was about to emerge from the shadows of the trees a sight met my eyes that banished all romantic and poetic reflection upon the beauties of the strange landscape  to my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach before me only a vague dim line indicated its further shore while at my right a mighty river broad placid and majestic flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me  at a little distance up the river rose mighty perpendicular bluffs from the very base of which the great river seemed to rise  but it was not these inspiring and magnificent evidences of natures grandeur that took my immediate attention from the beauties of the forest  it was the sight of a score of figures moving slowly about the meadow near the bank of the mighty river  odd grotesque shapes they were unlike anything that i had ever seen upon mars and yet at a distance most manlike in appearance  the larger specimens appeared to be about ten or twelve feet in height when they stood erect and to be proportioned as to torso and lower extremities precisely as is earthly man  their arms however were very short and from where i stood seemed as though fashioned much after the manner of an elephants trunk in that they moved in sinuous and snakelike undulations as though entirely without bony structure or if there were bones it seemed that they must be vertebral in nature  as i watched them from behind the stem of a huge tree one of the creatures moved slowly in my direction engaged in the occupation that seemed to be the principal business of each of them and which consisted in running their oddly shaped hands over the surface of the sward for what purpose i could not determine  as he approached quite close to me i obtained an excellent view of him and though i was later to become better acquainted with his kind i may say that that single cursory examination of this awful travesty on nature would have proved quite sufficient to my desires had i been a free agent  the fastest flier of the heliumetic navy could not quickly enough have carried me far from this hideous creature  its hairless body was a strange and ghoulish blue except for a broad band of white which encircled its protruding single eye an eye that was all dead whitepupil iris and ball  its nose was a ragged inflamed circular hole in the centre of its blank face a hole that resembled more closely nothing that i could think of other than a fresh bullet wound which has not yet commenced to bleed  below this repulsive orifice the face was quite blank to the chin for the thing had no mouth that i could discover  the head with the exception of the face was covered by a tangled mass of jetblack hair some eight or ten inches in length  each hair was about the bigness of a large angleworm and as the thing moved the muscles of its scalp this awful headcovering seemed to writhe and wriggle and crawl about the fearsome face as though indeed each separate hair was endowed with independent life  the body and the legs were as symmetrically human as nature could have fashioned them and the feet too were human in shape but of monstrous proportions  from heel to toe they were fully three feet long and very flat and very broad  as it came quite close to me i discovered that its strange movements running its odd hands over the surface of the turf were the result of its peculiar method of feeding which consists in cropping off the tender vegetation with its razorlike talons and sucking it up from its two mouths which lie one in the palm of each hand through its armlike throats  in addition to the features which i have already described the beast was equipped with a massive tail about six feet in length quite round where it joined the body but tapering to a flat thin blade toward the end which trailed at right angles to the ground  by far the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable creature however were the two tiny replicas of it each about six inches in length which dangled one on either side from its armpits  they were suspended by a small stem which seemed to grow from the exact tops of their heads to where it connected them with the body of the adult  whether they were the young or merely portions of a composite creature i did not know  as i had been scrutinizing this weird monstrosity the balance of the herd had fed quite close to me and i now saw that while many had the smaller specimens dangling from them not all were thus equipped and i further noted that the little ones varied in size from what appeared to be but tiny unopened buds an inch in diameter through various stages of development to the fullfledged and perfectly formed creature of ten to twelve inches in length  feeding with the herd were many of the little fellows not much larger than those which remained attached to their parents and from the young of that size the herd graded up to the immense adults  fearsomelooking as they were i did not know whether to fear them or not for they did not seem to be particularly well equipped for fighting and i was on the point of stepping from my hidingplace and revealing myself to them to note the effect upon them of the sight of a man when my rash resolve was fortunately for me nipped in the bud by a strange shrieking wail which seemed to come from the direction of the bluffs at my right  naked and unarmed as i was my end would have been both speedy and horrible at the hands of these cruel creatures had i had time to put my resolve into execution but at the moment of the shriek each member of the herd turned in the direction from which the sound seemed to come and at the same instant every particular snakelike hair upon their heads rose stiffly perpendicular as if each had been a sentient organism looking or listening for the source or meaning of the wail and indeed the latter proved to be the truth for this strange growth upon the craniums of the plant men of barsoom represents the thousand ears of these hideous creatures the last remnant of the strange race which sprang from the original tree of life  instantly every eye turned toward one member of the herd a large fellow who evidently was the leader  a strange purring sound issued from the mouth in the palm of one of his hands and at the same time he started rapidly toward the bluff followed by the entire herd  their speed and method of locomotion were both remarkable springing as they did in great leaps of twenty or thirty feet much after the manner of a kangaroo  they were rapidly disappearing when it occurred to me to follow them and so hurling caution to the winds i sprang across the meadow in their wake with leaps and bounds even more prodigious than their own for the muscles of an athletic earth man produce remarkable results when pitted against the lesser gravity and air pressure of mars  their way led directly towards the apparent source of the river at the base of the cliffs and as i neared this point i found the meadow dotted with huge boulders that the ravages of time had evidently dislodged from the towering crags above  for this reason i came quite close to the cause of the disturbance before the scene broke upon my horrified gaze  as i topped a great boulder i saw the herd of plant men surrounding a little group of perhaps five or six green men and women of barsoom  that i was indeed upon mars i now had no doubt for here were members of the wild hordes that people the dead sea bottoms and deserted cities of that dying planet  here were the great males towering in all the majesty of their imposing height here were the gleaming white tusks protruding from their massive lower jaws to a point near the centre of their foreheads the laterally placed protruding eyes with which they could look forward or backward or to either side without turning their heads here the strange antennaelike ears rising from the tops of their foreheads and the additional pair of arms extending from midway between the shoulders and the hips  even without the glossy green hide and the metal ornaments which denoted the tribes to which they belonged i would have known them on the instant for what they were for where else in all the universe is their like duplicated  there were two men and four females in the party and their ornaments denoted them as members of different hordes a fact which tended to puzzle me infinitely since the various hordes of green men of barsoom are eternally at deadly war with one another and never except on that single historic instance when the great tars tarkas of thark gathered a hundred and fifty thousand green warriors from several hordes to march upon the doomed city of zodanga to rescue dejah thoris princess of helium from the clutches of than kosis had i seen green martians of different hordes associated in other than mortal combat  but now they stood back to back facing in wideeyed amazement the very evidently hostile demonstrations of a common enemy  both men and women were armed with longswords and daggers but no firearms were in evidence else it had been short shrift for the gruesome plant men of barsoom  presently the leader of the plant men charged the little party and his method of attack was as remarkable as it was effective and by its very strangeness was the more potent since in the science of the green warriors there was no defence for this singular manner of attack the like of which it soon was evident to me they were as unfamiliar with as they were with the monstrosities which confronted them  the plant man charged to within a dozen feet of the party and then with a bound rose as though to pass directly above their heads  his powerful tail was raised high to one side and as he passed close above them he brought it down in one terrific sweep that crushed a green warriors skull as though it had been an eggshell  the balance of the frightful herd was now circling rapidly and with bewildering speed about the little knot of victims  their prodigious bounds and the shrill screeching purr of their uncanny mouths were well calculated to confuse and terrorize their prey so that as two of them leaped simultaneously from either side the mighty sweep of those awful tails met with no resistance and two more green martians went down to an ignoble death  there were now but one warrior and two females left and it seemed that it could be but a matter of seconds ere these also lay dead upon the scarlet sward  but as two more of the plant men charged the warrior who was now prepared by the experiences of the past few minutes swung his mighty longsword aloft and met the hurtling bulk with a clean cut that clove one of the plant men from chin to groin  the other however dealt a single blow with his cruel tail that laid both of the females crushed corpses upon the ground  as the green warrior saw the last of his companions go down and at the same time perceived that the entire herd was charging him in a body he rushed boldly to meet them swinging his longsword in the terrific manner that i had so often seen the men of his kind wield it in their ferocious and almost continual warfare among their own race  cutting and hewing to right and left he laid an open path straight through the advancing plant men and then commenced a mad race for the forest in the shelter of which he evidently hoped that he might find a haven of refuge  he had turned for that portion of the forest which abutted on the cliffs and thus the mad race was taking the entire party farther and farther from the boulder where i lay concealed  as i had watched the noble fight which the great warrior had put up against such enormous odds my heart had swelled in admiration for him and acting as i am wont to do more upon impulse than after mature deliberation i instantly sprang from my sheltering rock and bounded quickly toward the bodies of the dead green martians a welldefined plan of action already formed  half a dozen great leaps brought me to the spot and another instant saw me again in my stride in quick pursuit of the hideous monsters that were rapidly gaining on the fleeing warrior but this time i grasped a mighty longsword in my hand and in my heart was the old blood lust of the fighting man and a red mist swam before my eyes and i felt my lips respond to my heart in the old smile that has ever marked me in the midst of the joy of battle  swift as i was i was none too soon for the green warrior had been overtaken ere he had made half the distance to the forest and now he stood with his back to a boulder while the herd temporarily balked hissed and screeched about him  with their single eyes in the centre of their heads and every eye turned upon their prey they did not note my soundless approach so that i was upon them with my great longsword and four of them lay dead ere they knew that i was among them  for an instant they recoiled before my terrific onslaught and in that instant the green warrior rose to the occasion and springing to my side laid to the right and left of him as i had never seen but one other warrior do with great circling strokes that formed a figure eight about him and that never stopped until none stood living to oppose him his keen blade passing through flesh and bone and metal as though each had been alike thin air  as we bent to the slaughter far above us rose that shrill weird cry which i had heard once before and which had called the herd to the attack upon their victims  again and again it rose but we were too much engaged with the fierce and powerful creatures about us to attempt to search out even with our eyes the author of the horrid notes  great tails lashed in frenzied anger about us razorlike talons cut our limbs and bodies and a green and sticky syrup such as oozes from a crushed caterpillar smeared us from head to foot for every cut and thrust of our longswords brought spurts of this stuff upon us from the severed arteries of the plant men through which it courses in its sluggish viscidity in lieu of blood  once i felt the great weight of one of the monsters upon my back and as keen talons sank into my flesh i experienced the frightful sensation of moist lips sucking the lifeblood from the wounds to which the claws still clung  i was very much engaged with a ferocious fellow who was endeavouring to reach my throat from in front while two more one on either side were lashing viciously at me with their tails  the green warrior was much put to it to hold his own and i felt that the unequal struggle could last but a moment longer when the huge fellow discovered my plight and tearing himself from those that surrounded him he raked the assailant from my back with a single sweep of his blade and thus relieved i had little difficulty with the others  once together we stood almost back to back against the great boulder and thus the creatures were prevented from soaring above us to deliver their deadly blows and as we were easily their match while they remained upon the ground we were making great headway in dispatching what remained of them when our attention was again attracted by the shrill wail of the caller above our heads  this time i glanced up and far above us upon a little natural balcony on the face of the cliff stood a strange figure of a man shrieking out his shrill signal the while he waved one hand in the direction of the rivers mouth as though beckoning to some one there and with the other pointed and gesticulated toward us  a glance in the direction toward which he was looking was sufficient to apprise me of his aims and at the same time to fill me with the dread of dire apprehension for streaming in from all directions across the meadow from out of the forest and from the far distance of the flat land across the river i could see converging upon us a hundred different lines of wildly leaping creatures such as we were now engaged with and with them some strange new monsters which ran with great swiftness now erect and now upon all fours  it will be a great death i said to my companion look  as he shot a quick glance in the direction i indicated he smiled  we may at least die fighting and as great warriors should john carter he replied  we had just finished the last of our immediate antagonists as he spoke and i turned in surprised wonderment at the sound of my name  and there before my astonished eyes i beheld the greatest of the green men of barsoom their shrewdest statesman their mightiest general my great and good friend tars tarkas jeddak of thark     chapter ii  a forest battle   tars tarkas and i found no time for an exchange of experiences as we stood there before the great boulder surrounded by the corpses of our grotesque assailants for from all directions down the broad valley was streaming a perfect torrent of terrifying creatures in response to the weird call of the strange figure far above us  come cried tars tarkas we must make for the cliffs  there lies our only hope of even temporary escape there we may find a cave or a narrow ledge which two may defend for ever against this motley unarmed horde  together we raced across the scarlet sward i timing my speed that i might not outdistance my slower companion  we had perhaps three hundred yards to cover between our boulder and the cliffs and then to search out a suitable shelter for our stand against the terrifying things that were pursuing us  they were rapidly overhauling us when tars tarkas cried to me to hasten ahead and discover if possible the sanctuary we sought  the suggestion was a good one for thus many valuable minutes might be saved to us and throwing every ounce of my earthly muscles into the effort i cleared the remaining distance between myself and the cliffs in great leaps and bounds that put me at their base in a moment  the cliffs rose perpendicular directly from the almost level sward of the valley  there was no accumulation of fallen debris forming a more or less rough ascent to them as is the case with nearly all other cliffs i have ever seen  the scattered boulders that had fallen from above and lay upon or partly buried in the turf were the only indication that any disintegration of the massive towering pile of rocks ever had taken place  my first cursory inspection of the face of the cliffs filled my heart with forebodings since nowhere could i discern except where the weird herald stood still shrieking his shrill summons the faintest indication of even a bare foothold upon the lofty escarpment  to my right the bottom of the cliff was lost in the dense foliage of the forest which terminated at its very foot rearing its gorgeous foliage fully a thousand feet against its stern and forbidding neighbour  to the left the cliff ran apparently unbroken across the head of the broad valley to be lost in the outlines of what appeared to be a range of mighty mountains that skirted and confined the valley in every direction  perhaps a thousand feet from me the river broke as it seemed directly from the base of the cliffs and as there seemed not the remotest chance for escape in that direction i turned my attention again toward the forest  the cliffs towered above me a good five thousand feet  the sun was not quite upon them and they loomed a dull yellow in their own shade  here and there they were broken with streaks and patches of dusky red green and occasional areas of white quartz  altogether they were very beautiful but i fear that i did not regard them with a particularly appreciative eye on this my first inspection of them  just then i was absorbed in them only as a medium of escape and so as my gaze ran quickly time and again over their vast expanse in search of some cranny or crevice i came suddenly to loathe them as the prisoner must loathe the cruel and impregnable walls of his dungeon  tars tarkas was approaching me rapidly and still more rapidly came the awful horde at his heels  it seemed the forest now or nothing and i was just on the point of motioning tars tarkas to follow me in that direction when the sun passed the cliffs zenith and as the bright rays touched the dull surface it burst out into a million scintillant lights of burnished gold of flaming red of soft greens and gleaming whitesa more gorgeous and inspiring spectacle human eye has never rested upon  the face of the entire cliff was as later inspection conclusively proved so shot with veins and patches of solid gold as to quite present the appearance of a solid wall of that precious metal except where it was broken by outcroppings of ruby emerald and diamond bouldersa faint and alluring indication of the vast and unguessable riches which lay deeply buried behind the magnificent surface  but what caught my most interested attention at the moment that the suns rays set the cliffs face ashimmer was the several black spots which now appeared quite plainly in evidence high across the gorgeous wall close to the forests top and extending apparently below and behind the branches  almost immediately i recognised them for what they were the dark openings of caves entering the solid wallspossible avenues of escape or temporary shelter could we but reach them  there was but a single way and that led through the mighty towering trees upon our right  that i could scale them i knew full well but tars tarkas with his mighty bulk and enormous weight would find it a task possibly quite beyond his prowess or his skill for martians are at best but poor climbers  upon the entire surface of that ancient planet i never before had seen a hill or mountain that exceeded four thousand feet in height above the dead sea bottoms and as the ascent was usually gradual nearly to their summits they presented but few opportunities for the practice of climbing  nor would the martians have embraced even such opportunities as might present themselves for they could always find a circuitous route about the base of any eminence and these roads they preferred and followed in preference to the shorter but more arduous ways  however there was nothing else to consider than an attempt to scale the trees contiguous to the cliff in an effort to reach the caves above  the thark grasped the possibilities and the difficulties of the plan at once but there was no alternative and so we set out rapidly for the trees nearest the cliff  our relentless pursuers were now close to us so close that it seemed that it would be an utter impossibility for the jeddak of thark to reach the forest in advance of them nor was there any considerable will in the efforts that tars tarkas made for the green men of barsoom do not relish flight nor ever before had i seen one fleeing from death in whatsoever form it might have confronted him  but that tars tarkas was the bravest of the brave he had proven thousands of times yes tens of thousands in countless mortal combats with men and beasts  and so i knew that there was another reason than fear of death behind his flight as he knew that a greater power than pride or honour spurred me to escape these fierce destroyers  in my case it was lovelove of the divine dejah thoris and the cause of the tharks great and sudden love of life i could not fathom for it is oftener that they seek death than lifethese strange cruel loveless unhappy people  at length however we reached the shadows of the forest while right behind us sprang the swiftest of our pursuersa giant plant man with claws outreaching to fasten his bloodsucking mouths upon us  he was i should say a hundred yards in advance of his closest companion and so i called to tars tarkas to ascend a great tree that brushed the cliffs face while i dispatched the fellow thus giving the less agile thark an opportunity to reach the higher branches before the entire horde should be upon us and every vestige of escape cut off  but i had reckoned without a just appreciation either of the cunning of my immediate antagonist or the swiftness with which his fellows were covering the distance which had separated them from me  as i raised my longsword to deal the creature its death thrust it halted in its charge and as my sword cut harmlessly through the empty air the great tail of the thing swept with the power of a grizzlys arm across the sward and carried me bodily from my feet to the ground in an instant the brute was upon me but ere it could fasten its hideous mouths into my breast and throat i grasped a writhing tentacle in either hand  the plant man was well muscled heavy and powerful but my earthly sinews and greater agility in conjunction with the deathly strangle hold i had upon him would have given me i think an eventual victory had we had time to discuss the merits of our relative prowess uninterrupted  but  as we strained and struggled about the tree into which tars tarkas was clambering with infinite difficulty i suddenly caught a glimpse over the shoulder of my antagonist of the great swarm of pursuers that now were fairly upon me  now at last i saw the nature of the other monsters who had come with the plant men in response to the weird calling of the man upon the cliffs face  they were that most dreaded of martian creaturesgreat white apes of barsoom  my former experiences upon mars had familiarized me thoroughly with them and their methods and i may say that of all the fearsome and terrible weird and grotesque inhabitants of that strange world it is the white apes that come nearest to familiarizing me with the sensation of fear  i think that the cause of this feeling which these apes engender within me is due to their remarkable resemblance in form to our earth men which gives them a human appearance that is most uncanny when coupled with their enormous size  they stand fifteen feet in height and walk erect upon their hind feet like the green martians they have an intermediary set of arms midway between their upper and lower limbs  their eyes are very close set but do not protrude as do those of the green men of mars their ears are high set but more laterally located than are the green mens while their snouts and teeth are much like those of our african gorilla  upon their heads grows an enormous shock of bristly hair  it was into the eyes of such as these and the terrible plant men that i gazed above the shoulder of my foe and then in a mighty wave of snarling snapping screaming purring rage they swept over meand of all the sounds that assailed my ears as i went down beneath them to me the most hideous was the horrid purring of the plant men  instantly a score of cruel fangs and keen talons were sunk into my flesh cold sucking lips fastened themselves upon my arteries  i struggled to free myself and even though weighed down by these immense bodies i succeeded in struggling to my feet where still grasping my longsword and shortening my grip upon it until i could use it as a dagger i wrought such havoc among them that at one time i stood for an instant free  what it has taken minutes to write occurred in but a few seconds but during that time tars tarkas had seen my plight and had dropped from the lower branches which he had reached with such infinite labour and as i flung the last of my immediate antagonists from me the great thark leaped to my side and again we fought back to back as we had done a hundred times before  time and again the ferocious apes sprang in to close with us and time and again we beat them back with our swords  the great tails of the plant men lashed with tremendous power about us as they charged from various directions or sprang with the agility of greyhounds above our heads but every attack met a gleaming blade in sword hands that had been reputed for twenty years the best that mars ever had known for tars tarkas and john carter were names that the fighting men of the world of warriors loved best to speak  but even the two best swords in a world of fighters can avail not for ever against overwhelming numbers of fierce and savage brutes that know not what defeat means until cold steel teaches their hearts no longer to beat and so step by step we were forced back  at length we stood against the giant tree that we had chosen for our ascent and then as charge after charge hurled its weight upon us we gave back again and again until we had been forced halfway around the huge base of the colossal trunk  tars tarkas was in the lead and suddenly i heard a little cry of exultation from him  here is shelter for one at least john carter he said and glancing down i saw an opening in the base of the tree about three feet in diameter  in with you tars tarkas i cried but he would not go saying that his bulk was too great for the little aperture while i might slip in easily  we shall both die if we remain without john carter here is a slight chance for one of us  take it and you may live to avenge me it is useless for me to attempt to worm my way into so small an opening with this horde of demons besetting us on all sides  then we shall die together tars tarkas i replied for i shall not go first  let me defend the opening while you get in then my smaller stature will permit me to slip in with you before they can prevent  we still were fighting furiously as we talked in broken sentences punctured with vicious cuts and thrusts at our swarming enemy  at length he yielded for it seemed the only way in which either of us might be saved from the everincreasing numbers of our assailants who were still swarming upon us from all directions across the broad valley  it was ever your way john carter to think last of your own life he said but still more your way to command the lives and actions of others even to the greatest of jeddaks who rule upon barsoom  there was a grim smile upon his cruel hard face as he the greatest jeddak of them all turned to obey the dictates of a creature of another worldof a man whose stature was less than half his own  if you fail john carter he said know that the cruel and heartless thark to whom you taught the meaning of friendship will come out to die beside you  as you will my friend i replied but quickly now head first while i cover your retreat  he hesitated a little at that word for never before in his whole life of continual strife had he turned his back upon aught than a dead or defeated enemy  haste tars tarkas i urged or we shall both go down to profitless defeat i cannot hold them for ever alone  as he dropped to the ground to force his way into the tree the whole howling pack of hideous devils hurled themselves upon me  to right and left flew my shimmering blade now green with the sticky juice of a plant man now red with the crimson blood of a great white ape but always flying from one opponent to another hesitating but the barest fraction of a second to drink the lifeblood in the centre of some savage heart  and thus i fought as i never had fought before against such frightful odds that i cannot realize even now that human muscles could have withstood that awful onslaught that terrific weight of hurtling tons of ferocious battling flesh  with the fear that we would escape them the creatures redoubled their efforts to pull me down and though the ground about me was piled high with their dead and dying comrades they succeeded at last in overwhelming me and i went down beneath them for the second time that day and once again felt those awful sucking lips against my flesh  but scarce had i fallen ere i felt powerful hands grip my ankles and in another second i was being drawn within the shelter of the trees interior  for a moment it was a tug of war between tars tarkas and a great plant man who clung tenaciously to my breast but presently i got the point of my longsword beneath him and with a mighty thrust pierced his vitals  torn and bleeding from many cruel wounds i lay panting upon the ground within the hollow of the tree while tars tarkas defended the opening from the furious mob without  for an hour they howled about the tree but after a few attempts to reach us they confined their efforts to terrorizing shrieks and screams to horrid growling on the part of the great white apes and the fearsome and indescribable purring by the plant men  at length all but a score who had apparently been left to prevent our escape had left us and our adventure seemed destined to result in a siege the only outcome of which could be our death by starvation for even should we be able to slip out after dark whither in this unknown and hostile valley could we hope to turn our steps toward possible escape  as the attacks of our enemies ceased and our eyes became accustomed to the semidarkness of the interior of our strange retreat i took the opportunity to explore our shelter  the tree was hollow to an extent of about fifty feet in diameter and from its flat hard floor i judged that it had often been used to domicile others before our occupancy  as i raised my eyes toward its roof to note the height i saw far above me a faint glow of light  there was an opening above  if we could but reach it we might still hope to make the shelter of the cliff caves  my eyes had now become quite used to the subdued light of the interior and as i pursued my investigation i presently came upon a rough ladder at the far side of the cave  quickly i mounted it only to find that it connected at the top with the lower of a series of horizontal wooden bars that spanned the now narrow and shaftlike interior of the trees stem  these bars were set one above another about three feet apart and formed a perfect ladder as far above me as i could see  dropping to the floor once more i detailed my discovery to tars tarkas who suggested that i explore aloft as far as i could go in safety while he guarded the entrance against a possible attack  as i hastened above to explore the strange shaft i found that the ladder of horizontal bars mounted always as far above me as my eyes could reach and as i ascended the light from above grew brighter and brighter  for fully five hundred feet i continued to climb until at length i reached the opening in the stem which admitted the light  it was of about the same diameter as the entrance at the foot of the tree and opened directly upon a large flat limb the well worn surface of which testified to its long continued use as an avenue for some creature to and from this remarkable shaft  i did not venture out upon the limb for fear that i might be discovered and our retreat in this direction cut off but instead hurried to retrace my steps to tars tarkas  i soon reached him and presently we were both ascending the long ladder toward the opening above  tars tarkas went in advance and as i reached the first of the horizontal bars i drew the ladder up after me and handing it to him he carried it a hundred feet further aloft where he wedged it safely between one of the bars and the side of the shaft  in like manner i dislodged the lower bars as i passed them so that we soon had the interior of the tree denuded of all possible means of ascent for a distance of a hundred feet from the base thus precluding possible pursuit and attack from the rear  as we were to learn later this precaution saved us from dire predicament and was eventually the means of our salvation  when we reached the opening at the top tars tarkas drew to one side that i might pass out and investigate as owing to my lesser weight and greater agility i was better fitted for the perilous threading of this dizzy hanging pathway  the limb upon which i found myself ascended at a slight angle toward the cliff and as i followed it i found that it terminated a few feet above a narrow ledge which protruded from the cliffs face at the entrance to a narrow cave  as i approached the slightly more slender extremity of the branch it bent beneath my weight until as i balanced perilously upon its outer tip it swayed gently on a level with the ledge at a distance of a couple of feet  five hundred feet below me lay the vivid scarlet carpet of the valley nearly five thousand feet above towered the mighty gleaming face of the gorgeous cliffs  the cave that i faced was not one of those that i had seen from the ground and which lay much higher possibly a thousand feet  but so far as i might know it was as good for our purpose as another and so i returned to the tree for tars tarkas  together we wormed our way along the waving pathway but when we reached the end of the branch we found that our combined weight so depressed the limb that the caves mouth was now too far above us to be reached  we finally agreed that tars tarkas should return along the branch leaving his longest leather harness strap with me and that when the limb had risen to a height that would permit me to enter the cave i was to do so and on tars tarkas return i could then lower the strap and haul him up to the safety of the ledge  this we did without mishap and soon found ourselves together upon the verge of a dizzy little balcony with a magnificent view of the valley spreading out below us  as far as the eye could reach gorgeous forest and crimson sward skirted a silent sea and about all towered the brilliant monster guardian cliffs  once we thought we discerned a gilded minaret gleaming in the sun amidst the waving tops of fardistant trees but we soon abandoned the idea in the belief that it was but an hallucination born of our great desire to discover the haunts of civilized men in this beautiful yet forbidding spot  below us upon the rivers bank the great white apes were devouring the last remnants of tars tarkas former companions while great herds of plant men grazed in everwidening circles about the sward which they kept as close clipped as the smoothest of lawns  knowing that attack from the tree was now improbable we determined to explore the cave which we had every reason to believe was but a continuation of the path we had already traversed leading the gods alone knew where but quite evidently away from this valley of grim ferocity  as we advanced we found a wellproportioned tunnel cut from the solid cliff  its walls rose some twenty feet above the floor which was about five feet in width  the roof was arched  we had no means of making a light and so groped our way slowly into the everincreasing darkness tars tarkas keeping in touch with one wall while i felt along the other while to prevent our wandering into diverging branches and becoming separated or lost in some intricate and labyrinthine maze we clasped hands  how far we traversed the tunnel in this manner i do not know but presently we came to an obstruction which blocked our further progress it seemed more like a partition than a sudden ending of the cave for it was constructed not of the material of the cliff but of something which felt like very hard wood  silently i groped over its surface with my hands and presently was rewarded by the feel of the button which as commonly denotes a door on mars as does a door knob on earth  gently pressing it i had the satisfaction of feeling the door slowly give before me and in another instant we were looking into a dimly lighted apartment which so far as we could see was unoccupied  without more ado i swung the door wide open and followed by the huge thark stepped into the chamber  as we stood for a moment in silence gazing about the room a slight noise behind caused me to turn quickly when to my astonishment i saw the door close with a sharp click as though by an unseen hand  instantly i sprang toward it to wrench it open again for something in the uncanny movement of the thing and the tense and almost palpable silence of the chamber seemed to portend a lurking evil lying hidden in this rockbound chamber within the bowels of the golden cliffs  my fingers clawed futilely at the unyielding portal while my eyes sought in vain for a duplicate of the button which had given us ingress  and then from unseen lips a cruel and mocking peal of laughter rang through the desolate place     chapter iii  the chamber of mystery   for moments after that awful laugh had ceased reverberating through the rocky room tars tarkas and i stood in tense and expectant silence but no further sound broke the stillness nor within the range of our vision did aught move  at length tars tarkas laughed softly after the manner of his strange kind when in the presence of the horrible or terrifying  it is not an hysterical laugh but rather the genuine expression of the pleasure they derive from the things that move earth men to loathing or to tears  often and again have i seen them roll upon the ground in mad fits of uncontrollable mirth when witnessing the death agonies of women and little children beneath the torture of that hellish green martian fetethe great games  i looked up at the thark a smile upon my own lips for here in truth was greater need for a smiling face than a trembling chin  what do you make of it all i asked  where in the deuce are we  he looked at me in surprise  where are we he repeated  do you tell me john carter that you know not where you be  that i am upon barsoom is all that i can guess and but for you and the great white apes i should not even guess that for the sights i have seen this day are as unlike the things of my beloved barsoom as i knew it ten long years ago as they are unlike the world of my birth  no tars tarkas i know not where we be  where have you been since you opened the mighty portals of the atmosphere plant years ago after the keeper had died and the engines stopped and all barsoom was dying that had not already died of asphyxiation  your body even was never found though the men of a whole world sought after it for years though the jeddak of helium and his granddaughter your princess offered such fabulous rewards that even princes of royal blood joined in the search  there was but one conclusion to reach when all efforts to locate you had failed and that that you had taken the long last pilgrimage down the mysterious river iss to await in the valley dor upon the shores of the lost sea of korus the beautiful dejah thoris your princess  why you had gone none could guess for your princess still lived  thank god i interrupted him  i did not dare to ask you for i feared i might have been too late to save hershe was very low when i left her in the royal gardens of tardos mors that longgone night so very low that i scarcely hoped even then to reach the atmosphere plant ere her dear spirit had fled from me for ever  and she lives yet  she lives john carter  you have not told me where we are i reminded him  we are where i expected to find you john carterand another  many years ago you heard the story of the woman who taught me the thing that green martians are reared to hate the woman who taught me to love you know the cruel tortures and the awful death her love won for her at the hands of the beast tal hajus  she i thought awaited me by the lost sea of korus  you know that it was left for a man from another world for yourself john carter to teach this cruel thark what friendship is and you i thought also roamed the carefree valley dor  thus were the two i most longed for at the end of the long pilgrimage i must take some day and so as the time had elapsed which dejah thoris had hoped might bring you once more to her side for she has always tried to believe that you had but temporarily returned to your own planet i at last gave way to my great yearning and a month since i started upon the journey the end of which you have this day witnessed do you understand now where you be john carter  and that was the river iss emptying into the lost sea of korus in the valley dor i asked  this is the valley of love and peace and rest to which every barsoomian since time immemorial has longed to pilgrimage at the end of a life of hate and strife and bloodshed he replied  this john carter is heaven  his tone was cold and ironical its bitterness but reflecting the terrible disappointment he had suffered  such a fearful disillusionment such a blasting of lifelong hopes and aspirations such an uprooting of ageold tradition might have excused a vastly greater demonstration on the part of the thark  i laid my hand upon his shoulder  i am sorry i said nor did there seem aught else to say  think john carter of the countless billions of barsoomians who have taken the voluntary pilgrimage down this cruel river since the beginning of time only to fall into the ferocious clutches of the terrible creatures that today assailed us  there is an ancient legend that once a red man returned from the banks of the lost sea of korus returned from the valley dor back through the mysterious river iss and the legend has it that he narrated a fearful blasphemy of horrid brutes that inhabited a valley of wondrous loveliness brutes that pounced upon each barsoomian as he terminated his pilgrimage and devoured him upon the banks of the lost sea where he had looked to find love and peace and happiness but the ancients killed the blasphemer as tradition has ordained that any shall be killed who return from the bosom of the river of mystery  but now we know that it was no blasphemy that the legend is a true one and that the man told only of what he saw but what does it profit us john carter since even should we escape we also would be treated as blasphemers  we are between the wild thoat of certainty and the mad zitidar of factwe can escape neither  as earth men say we are between the devil and the deep sea tars tarkas i replied nor could i help but smile at our dilemma  there is naught that we can do but take things as they come and at least have the satisfaction of knowing that whoever slays us eventually will have far greater numbers of their own dead to count than they will get in return  white ape or plant man green barsoomian or red man whosoever it shall be that takes the last toll from us will know that it is costly in lives to wipe out john carter prince of the house of tardos mors and tars tarkas jeddak of thark at the same time  i could not help but laugh at his grim humour and he joined in with me in one of those rare laughs of real enjoyment which was one of the attributes of this fierce tharkian chief which marked him from the others of his kind  but about yourself john carter he cried at last  if you have not been here all these years where indeed have you been and how is it that i find you here today  i have been back to earth i replied  for ten long earth years i have been praying and hoping for the day that would carry me once more to this grim old planet of yours for which with all its cruel and terrible customs i feel a bond of sympathy and love even greater than for the world that gave me birth  for ten years have i been enduring a living death of uncertainty and doubt as to whether dejah thoris lived and now that for the first time in all these years my prayers have been answered and my doubt relieved i find myself through a cruel whim of fate hurled into the one tiny spot of all barsoom from which there is apparently no escape and if there were at a price which would put out for ever the last flickering hope which i may cling to of seeing my princess again in this lifeand you have seen today with what pitiful futility man yearns toward a material hereafter  only a bare halfhour before i saw you battling with the plant men i was standing in the moonlight upon the banks of a broad river that taps the eastern shore of earths most blessed land  i have answered you my friend  do you believe  i believe replied tars tarkas though i cannot understand  as we talked i had been searching the interior of the chamber with my eyes  it was perhaps two hundred feet in length and half as broad with what appeared to be a doorway in the centre of the wall directly opposite that through which we had entered  the apartment was hewn from the material of the cliff showing mostly dull gold in the dim light which a single minute radium illuminator in the centre of the roof diffused throughout its great dimensions  here and there polished surfaces of ruby emerald and diamond patched the golden walls and ceiling  the floor was of another material very hard and worn by much use to the smoothness of glass  aside from the two doors i could discern no sign of other aperture and as one we knew to be locked against us i approached the other  as i extended my hand to search for the controlling button that cruel and mocking laugh rang out once more so close to me this time that i involuntarily shrank back tightening my grip upon the hilt of my great sword  and then from the far corner of the great chamber a hollow voice chanted there is no hope there is no hope the dead return not the dead return not nor is there any resurrection  hope not for there is no hope  though our eyes instantly turned toward the spot from which the voice seemed to emanate there was no one in sight and i must admit that cold shivers played along my spine and the short hairs at the base of my head stiffened and rose up as do those upon a hounds neck when in the night his eyes see those uncanny things which are hidden from the sight of man  quickly i walked toward the mournful voice but it had ceased ere i reached the further wall and then from the other end of the chamber came another voice shrill and piercing  fools  fools it shrieked  thinkest thou to defeat the eternal laws of life and death  wouldst cheat the mysterious issus goddess of death of her just dues  did not her mighty messenger the ancient iss bear you upon her leaden bosom at your own behest to the valley dor  thinkest thou o fools that issus wilt give up her own  thinkest thou to escape from whence in all the countless ages but a single soul has fled  go back the way thou camest to the merciful maws of the children of the tree of life or the gleaming fangs of the great white apes for there lies speedy surcease from suffering but insist in your rash purpose to thread the mazes of the golden cliffs of the mountains of otz past the ramparts of the impregnable fortresses of the holy therns and upon your way death in its most frightful form will overtake youa death so horrible that even the holy therns themselves who conceived both life and death avert their eyes from its fiendishness and close their ears against the hideous shrieks of its victims  go back o fools the way thou camest  and then the awful laugh broke out from another part of the chamber  most uncanny i remarked turning to tars tarkas  what shall we do he asked  we cannot fight empty air i would almost sooner return and face foes into whose flesh i may feel my blade bite and know that i am selling my carcass dearly before i go down to that eternal oblivion which is evidently the fairest and most desirable eternity that mortal man has the right to hope for  if as you say we cannot fight empty air tars tarkas i replied neither on the other hand can empty air fight us  i who have faced and conquered in my time thousands of sinewy warriors and tempered blades shall not be turned back by wind nor no more shall you thark  but unseen voices may emanate from unseen and unseeable creatures who wield invisible blades answered the green warrior  rot tars tarkas i cried those voices come from beings as real as you or as i  in their veins flows lifeblood that may be let as easily as ours and the fact that they remain invisible to us is the best proof to my mind that they are mortal nor overly courageous mortals at that  think you tars tarkas that john carter will fly at the first shriek of a cowardly foe who dare not come out into the open and face a good blade  i had spoken in a loud voice that there might be no question that our wouldbe terrorizers should hear me for i was tiring of this nerveracking fiasco  it had occurred to me too that the whole business was but a plan to frighten us back into the valley of death from which we had escaped that we might be quickly disposed of by the savage creatures there  for a long period there was silence then of a sudden a soft stealthy sound behind me caused me to turn suddenly to behold a great manylegged banth creeping sinuously upon me  the banth is a fierce beast of prey that roams the low hills surrounding the dead seas of ancient mars  like nearly all martian animals it is almost hairless having only a great bristly mane about its thick neck  its long lithe body is supported by ten powerful legs its enormous jaws are equipped like those of the calot or martian hound with several rows of long needlelike fangs its mouth reaches to a point far back of its tiny ears while its enormous protruding eyes of green add the last touch of terror to its awful aspect  as it crept toward me it lashed its powerful tail against its yellow sides and when it saw that it was discovered it emitted the terrifying roar which often freezes its prey into momentary paralysis in the instant that it makes its spring  and so it launched its great bulk toward me but its mighty voice had held no paralysing terrors for me and it met cold steel instead of the tender flesh its cruel jaws gaped so widely to engulf  an instant later i drew my blade from the still heart of this great barsoomian lion and turning toward tars tarkas was surprised to see him facing a similar monster  no sooner had he dispatched his than i turning as though drawn by the instinct of my guardian subconscious mind beheld another of the savage denizens of the martian wilds leaping across the chamber toward me  from then on for the better part of an hour one hideous creature after another was launched upon us springing apparently from the empty air about us  tars tarkas was satisfied here was something tangible that he could cut and slash with his great blade while i for my part may say that the diversion was a marked improvement over the uncanny voices from unseen lips  that there was nothing supernatural about our new foes was well evidenced by their howls of rage and pain as they felt the sharp steel at their vitals and the very real blood which flowed from their severed arteries as they died the real death  i noticed during the period of this new persecution that the beasts appeared only when our backs were turned we never saw one really materialize from thin air nor did i for an instant sufficiently lose my excellent reasoning faculties to be once deluded into the belief that the beasts came into the room other than through some concealed and wellcontrived doorway  among the ornaments of tars tarkas leather harness which is the only manner of clothing worn by martians other than silk capes and robes of silk and fur for protection from the cold after dark was a small mirror about the bigness of a ladys hand glass which hung midway between his shoulders and his waist against his broad back  once as he stood looking down at a newly fallen antagonist my eyes happened to fall upon this mirror and in its shiny surface i saw pictured a sight that caused me to whisper  move not tars tarkas  move not a muscle  he did not ask why but stood like a graven image while my eyes watched the strange thing that meant so much to us  what i saw was the quick movement of a section of the wall behind me it was turning upon pivots and with it a section of the floor directly in front of it was turning  it was as though you placed a visitingcard upon end on a silver dollar that you had laid flat upon a table so that the edge of the card perfectly bisected the surface of the coin  the card might represent the section of the wall that turned and the silver dollar the section of the floor  both were so nicely fitted into the adjacent portions of the floor and wall that no crack had been noticeable in the dim light of the chamber  as the turn was half completed a great beast was revealed sitting upon its haunches upon that part of the revolving floor that had been on the opposite side before the wall commenced to move when the section stopped the beast was facing toward me on our side of the partitionit was very simple  but what had interested me most was the sight that the halfturned section had presented through the opening that it had made  a great chamber well lighted in which were several men and women chained to the wall and in front of them evidently directing and operating the movement of the secret doorway a wickedfaced man neither red as are the red men of mars nor green as are the green men but white like myself with a great mass of flowing yellow hair  the prisoners behind him were red martians  chained with them were a number of fierce beasts such as had been turned upon us and others equally as ferocious  as i turned to meet my new foe it was with a heart considerably lightened  watch the wall at your end of the chamber tars tarkas i cautioned it is through secret doorways in the wall that the brutes are loosed upon us  i was very close to him and spoke in a low whisper that my knowledge of their secret might not be disclosed to our tormentors  as long as we remained each facing an opposite end of the apartment no further attacks were made upon us so it was quite clear to me that the partitions were in some way pierced that our actions might be observed from without  at length a plan of action occurred to me and backing quite close to tars tarkas i unfolded my scheme in a low whisper keeping my eyes still glued upon my end of the room  the great thark grunted his assent to my proposition when i had done and in accordance with my plan commenced backing toward the wall which i faced while i advanced slowly ahead of him  when we had reached a point some ten feet from the secret doorway i halted my companion and cautioning him to remain absolutely motionless until i gave the prearranged signal i quickly turned my back to the door through which i could almost feel the burning and baleful eyes of our would be executioner  instantly my own eyes sought the mirror upon tars tarkas back and in another second i was closely watching the section of the wall which had been disgorging its savage terrors upon us  i had not long to wait for presently the golden surface commenced to move rapidly  scarcely had it started than i gave the signal to tars tarkas simultaneously springing for the receding half of the pivoting door  in like manner the thark wheeled and leaped for the opening being made by the inswinging section  a single bound carried me completely through into the adjoining room and brought me face to face with the fellow whose cruel face i had seen before  he was about my own height and well muscled and in every outward detail moulded precisely as are earth men  at his side hung a longsword a shortsword a dagger and one of the destructive radium revolvers that are common upon mars  the fact that i was armed only with a longsword and so according to the laws and ethics of battle everywhere upon barsoom should only have been met with a similar or lesser weapon seemed to have no effect upon the moral sense of my enemy for he whipped out his revolver ere i scarce had touched the floor by his side but an uppercut from my longsword sent it flying from his grasp before he could discharge it  instantly he drew his longsword and thus evenly armed we set to in earnest for one of the closest battles i ever have fought  the fellow was a marvellous swordsman and evidently in practice while i had not gripped the hilt of a sword for ten long years before that morning  but it did not take me long to fall easily into my fighting stride so that in a few minutes the man began to realize that he had at last met his match  his face became livid with rage as he found my guard impregnable while blood flowed from a dozen minor wounds upon his face and body  who are you white man he hissed  that you are no barsoomian from the outer world is evident from your colour  and you are not of us  his last statement was almost a question  what if i were from the temple of issus i hazarded on a wild guess  fate forfend he exclaimed his face going white under the blood that now nearly covered it  i did not know how to follow up my lead but i carefully laid the idea away for future use should circumstances require it  his answer indicated that for all he knew i might be from the temple of issus and in it were men like unto myself and either this man feared the inmates of the temple or else he held their persons or their power in such reverence that he trembled to think of the harm and indignities he had heaped upon one of them  but my present business with him was of a different nature than that which requires any considerable abstract reasoning it was to get my sword between his ribs and this i succeeded in doing within the next few seconds nor was i an instant too soon  the chained prisoners had been watching the combat in tense silence not a sound had fallen in the room other than the clashing of our contending blades the soft shuffling of our naked feet and the few whispered words we had hissed at each other through clenched teeth the while we continued our mortal duel  but as the body of my antagonist sank an inert mass to the floor a cry of warning broke from one of the female prisoners  turn  turn  behind you she shrieked and as i wheeled at the first note of her shrill cry i found myself facing a second man of the same race as he who lay at my feet  the fellow had crept stealthily from a dark corridor and was almost upon me with raised sword ere i saw him  tars tarkas was nowhere in sight and the secret panel in the wall through which i had come was closed  how i wished that he were by my side now  i had fought almost continuously for many hours i had passed through such experiences and adventures as must sap the vitality of man and with all this i had not eaten for nearly twentyfour hours nor slept  i was fagged out and for the first time in years felt a question as to my ability to cope with an antagonist but there was naught else for it than to engage my man and that as quickly and ferociously as lay in me for my only salvation was to rush him off his feet by the impetuosity of my attacki could not hope to win a longdrawnout battle  but the fellow was evidently of another mind for he backed and parried and parried and sidestepped until i was almost completely fagged from the exertion of attempting to finish him  he was a more adroit swordsman if possible than my previous foe and i must admit that he led me a pretty chase and in the end came near to making a sorry fool of meand a dead one into the bargain  i could feel myself growing weaker and weaker until at length objects commenced to blur before my eyes and i staggered and blundered about more asleep than awake and then it was that he worked his pretty little coup that came near to losing me my life  he had backed me around so that i stood in front of the corpse of his fellow and then he rushed me suddenly so that i was forced back upon it and as my heel struck it the impetus of my body flung me backward across the dead man  my head struck the hard pavement with a resounding whack and to that alone i owe my life for it cleared my brain and the pain roused my temper so that i was equal for the moment to tearing my enemy to pieces with my bare hands and i verily believe that i should have attempted it had not my right hand in the act of raising my body from the ground come in contact with a bit of cold metal  as the eyes of the layman so is the hand of the fighting man when it comes in contact with an implement of his vocation and thus i did not need to look or reason to know that the dead mans revolver lying where it had fallen when i struck it from his grasp was at my disposal  the fellow whose ruse had put me down was springing toward me the point of his gleaming blade directed straight at my heart and as he came there rang from his lips the cruel and mocking peal of laughter that i had heard within the chamber of mystery  and so he died his thin lips curled in the snarl of his hateful laugh and a bullet from the revolver of his dead companion bursting in his heart  his body borne by the impetus of his headlong rush plunged upon me the hilt of his sword must have struck my head for with the impact of the corpse i lost consciousness     chapter iv  thuvia   it was the sound of conflict that aroused me once more to the realities of life  for a moment i could neither place my surroundings nor locate the sounds which had aroused me  and then from beyond the blank wall beside which i lay i heard the shuffling of feet the snarling of grim beasts the clank of metal accoutrements and the heavy breathing of a man  as i rose to my feet i glanced hurriedly about the chamber in which i had just encountered such a warm reception  the prisoners and the savage brutes rested in their chains by the opposite wall eyeing me with varying expressions of curiosity sullen rage surprise and hope  the latter emotion seemed plainly evident upon the handsome and intelligent face of the young red martian woman whose cry of warning had been instrumental in saving my life  she was the perfect type of that remarkably beautiful race whose outward appearance is identical with the more godlike races of earth men except that this higher race of martians is of a light reddish copper colour  as she was entirely unadorned i could not even guess her station in life though it was evident that she was either a prisoner or slave in her present environment  it was several seconds before the sounds upon the opposite side of the partition jolted my slowly returning faculties into a realization of their probable import and then of a sudden i grasped the fact that they were caused by tars tarkas in what was evidently a desperate struggle with wild beasts or savage men  with a cry of encouragement i threw my weight against the secret door but as well have assayed the downhurling of the cliffs themselves then i sought feverishly for the secret of the revolving panel but my search was fruitless and i was about to raise my longsword against the sullen gold when the young woman prisoner called out to me  save thy sword o mighty warrior for thou shalt need it more where it will avail to some purposeshatter it not against senseless metal which yields better to the lightest finger touch of one who knows its secret  know you the secret of it then i asked  yes release me and i will give you entrance to the other horror chamber if you wish  the keys to my fetters are upon the first dead of thy foemen  but why would you return to face again the fierce banth or whatever other form of destruction they have loosed within that awful trap  because my friend fights there alone i answered as i hastily sought and found the keys upon the carcass of the dead custodian of this grim chamber of horrors  there were many keys upon the oval ring but the fair martian maid quickly selected that which sprung the great lock at her waist and freed she hurried toward the secret panel  again she sought out a key upon the ring  this time a slender needlelike affair which she inserted in an almost invisible hole in the wall  instantly the door swung upon its pivot and the contiguous section of the floor upon which i was standing carried me with it into the chamber where tars tarkas fought  the great thark stood with his back against an angle of the walls while facing him in a semicircle a halfdozen huge monsters crouched waiting for an opening  their bloodstreaked heads and shoulders testified to the cause of their wariness as well as to the swordsmanship of the green warrior whose glossy hide bore the same mute but eloquent witness to the ferocity of the attacks that he had so far withstood  sharp talons and cruel fangs had torn leg arm and breast literally to ribbons  so weak was he from continued exertion and loss of blood that but for the supporting wall i doubt that he even could have stood erect  but with the tenacity and indomitable courage of his kind he still faced his cruel and relentless foesthe personification of that ancient proverb of his tribe leave to a thark his head and one hand and he may yet conquer  as he saw me enter a grim smile touched those grim lips of his but whether the smile signified relief or merely amusement at the sight of my own bloody and dishevelled condition i do not know  as i was about to spring into the conflict with my sharp longsword i felt a gentle hand upon my shoulder and turning found to my surprise that the young woman had followed me into the chamber  wait she whispered leave them to me and pushing me advanced all defenceless and unarmed upon the snarling banths  when quite close to them she spoke a single martian word in low but peremptory tones  like lightning the great beasts wheeled upon her and i looked to see her torn to pieces before i could reach her side but instead the creatures slunk to her feet like puppies that expect a merited whipping  again she spoke to them but in tones so low i could not catch the words and then she started toward the opposite side of the chamber with the six mighty monsters trailing at heel  one by one she sent them through the secret panel into the room beyond and when the last had passed from the chamber where we stood in wideeyed amazement she turned and smiled at us and then herself passed through leaving us alone  for a moment neither of us spoke  then tars tarkas said  i heard the fighting beyond the partition through which you passed but i did not fear for you john carter until i heard the report of a revolver shot  i knew that there lived no man upon all barsoom who could face you with naked steel and live but the shot stripped the last vestige of hope from me since you i knew to be without firearms tell me of it  i did as he bade and then together we sought the secret panel through which i had just entered the apartmentthe one at the opposite end of the room from that through which the girl had led her savage companions  to our disappointment the panel eluded our every effort to negotiate its secret lock  we felt that once beyond it we might look with some little hope of success for a passage to the outside world  the fact that the prisoners within were securely chained led us to believe that surely there must be an avenue of escape from the terrible creatures which inhabited this unspeakable place  again and again we turned from one door to another from the baffling golden panel at one end of the chamber to its mate at the otherequally baffling  when we had about given up all hope one of the panels turned silently toward us and the young woman who had led away the banths stood once more beside us  who are you she asked and what your mission that you have the temerity to attempt to escape from the valley dor and the death you have chosen  i have chosen no death maiden i replied  i am not of barsoom nor have i taken yet the voluntary pilgrimage upon the river iss  my friend here is jeddak of all the tharks and though he has not yet expressed a desire to return to the living world i am taking him with me from the living lie that hath lured him to this frightful place  i am of another world  i am john carter prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium  perchance some faint rumour of me may have leaked within the confines of your hellish abode  she smiled  yes she replied naught that passes in the world we have left is unknown here  i have heard of you many years ago  the therns have ofttimes wondered whither you had flown since you had neither taken the pilgrimage nor could be found upon the face of barsoom  tell me i said and who be you and why a prisoner yet with power over the ferocious beasts of the place that denotes familiarity and authority far beyond that which might be expected of a prisoner or a slave  slave i am she answered  for fifteen years a slave in this terrible place and now that they have tired of me and become fearful of the power which my knowledge of their ways has given me i am but recently condemned to die the death  she shuddered  what death i asked  the holy therns eat human flesh she answered me but only that which has died beneath the sucking lips of a plant manflesh from which the defiling blood of life has been drawn  and to this cruel end i have been condemned  it was to be within a few hours had your advent not caused an interruption of their plans  was it then holy therns who felt the weight of john carters hand i asked  oh no those whom you laid low are lesser therns but of the same cruel and hateful race  the holy therns abide upon the outer slopes of these grim hills facing the broad world from which they harvest their victims and their spoils  labyrinthine passages connect these caves with the luxurious palaces of the holy therns and through them pass upon their many duties the lesser therns and hordes of slaves and prisoners and fierce beasts the grim inhabitants of this sunless world  there be within this vast network of winding passages and countless chambers men women and beasts who born within its dim and gruesome underworld have never seen the light of daynor ever shall  they are kept to do the bidding of the race of therns to furnish at once their sport and their sustenance  now and again some hapless pilgrim drifting out upon the silent sea from the cold iss escapes the plant men and the great white apes that guard the temple of issus and falls into the remorseless clutches of the therns or as was my misfortune is coveted by the holy thern who chances to be upon watch in the balcony above the river where it issues from the bowels of the mountains through the cliffs of gold to empty into the lost sea of korus  all who reach the valley dor are by custom the rightful prey of the plant men and the apes while their arms and ornaments become the portion of the therns but if one escapes the terrible denizens of the valley for even a few hours the therns may claim such a one as their own  and again the holy thern on watch should he see a victim he covets often tramples upon the rights of the unreasoning brutes of the valley and takes his prize by foul means if he cannot gain it by fair  it is said that occasionally some deluded victim of barsoomian superstition will so far escape the clutches of the countless enemies that beset his path from the moment that he emerges from the subterranean passage through which the iss flows for a thousand miles before it enters the valley dor as to reach the very walls of the temple of issus but what fate awaits one there not even the holy therns may guess for who has passed within those gilded walls never has returned to unfold the mysteries they have held since the beginning of time  the temple of issus is to the therns what the valley dor is imagined by the peoples of the outer world to be to them it is the ultimate haven of peace refuge and happiness to which they pass after this life and wherein an eternity of eternities is spent amidst the delights of the flesh which appeal most strongly to this race of mental giants and moral pygmies  the temple of issus is i take it a heaven within a heaven i said let us hope that there it will be meted to the therns as they have meted it here unto others  who knows the girl murmured  the therns i judge from what you have said are no less mortal than we and yet have i always heard them spoken of with the utmost awe and reverence by the people of barsoom as one might speak of the gods themselves  the therns are mortal she replied  they die from the same causes as you or i might those who do not live their allotted span of life one thousand years when by the authority of custom they may take their way in happiness through the long tunnel that leads to issus  those who die before are supposed to spend the balance of their allotted time in the image of a plant man and it is for this reason that the plant men are held sacred by the therns since they believe that each of these hideous creatures was formerly a thern  and should a plant man die i asked  should he die before the expiration of the thousand years from the birth of the thern whose immortality abides within him then the soul passes into a great white ape but should the ape die short of the exact hour that terminates the thousand years the soul is for ever lost and passes for all eternity into the carcass of the slimy and fearsome silians whose wriggling thousands seethe the silent sea beneath the hurtling moons when the sun has gone and strange shapes walk through the valley dor  we sent several holy therns to the silians today then said tars tarkas laughing  and so will your death be the more terrible when it comes said the maiden  and come it willyou cannot escape  one has escaped centuries ago i reminded her and what has been done may be done again  it is useless even to try she answered hopelessly  but try we shall i cried and you shall go with us if you wish  to be put to death by mine own people and render my memory a disgrace to my family and my nation  a prince of the house of tardos mors should know better than to suggest such a thing  tars tarkas listened in silence but i could feel his eyes riveted upon me and i knew that he awaited my answer as one might listen to the reading of his sentence by the foreman of a jury  what i advised the girl to do would seal our fate as well since if i bowed to the inevitable decree of ageold superstition we must all remain and meet our fate in some horrible form within this awful abode of horror and cruelty  we have the right to escape if we can i answered  our own moral senses will not be offended if we succeed for we know that the fabled life of love and peace in the blessed valley of dor is a rank and wicked deception  we know that the valley is not sacred we know that the holy therns are not holy that they are a race of cruel and heartless mortals knowing no more of the real life to come than we do  not only is it our right to bend every effort to escapeit is a solemn duty from which we should not shrink even though we know that we should be reviled and tortured by our own peoples when we returned to them  only thus may we carry the truth to those without and though the likelihood of our narrative being given credence is i grant you remote so wedded are mortals to their stupid infatuation for impossible superstitions we should be craven cowards indeed were we to shirk the plain duty which confronts us  again there is a chance that with the weight of the testimony of several of us the truth of our statements may be accepted and at least a compromise effected which will result in the dispatching of an expedition of investigation to this hideous mockery of heaven  both the girl and the green warrior stood silent in thought for some moments  the former it was who eventually broke the silence  never had i considered the matter in that light before she said indeed would i give my life a thousand times if i could but save a single soul from the awful life that i have led in this cruel place yes you are right and i will go with you as far as we can go but i doubt that we ever shall escape  i turned an inquiring glance toward the thark  to the gates of issus or to the bottom of korus spoke the green warrior to the snows to the north or to the snows to the south tars tarkas follows where john carter leads  i have spoken  come then i cried we must make the start for we could not be further from escape than we now are in the heart of this mountain and within the four walls of this chamber of death  come then said the girl but do not flatter yourself that you can find no worse place than this within the territory of the therns  so saying she swung the secret panel that separated us from the apartment in which i had found her and we stepped through once more into the presence of the other prisoners  there were in all ten red martians men and women and when we had briefly explained our plan they decided to join forces with us though it was evident that it was with some considerable misgivings that they thus tempted fate by opposing an ancient superstition even though each knew through cruel experience the fallacy of its entire fabric  thuvia the girl whom i had first freed soon had the others at liberty  tars tarkas and i stripped the bodies of the two therns of their weapons which included swords daggers and two revolvers of the curious and deadly type manufactured by the red martians  we distributed the weapons as far as they would go among our followers giving the firearms to two of the women thuvia being one so armed  with the latter as our guide we set off rapidly but cautiously through a maze of passages crossing great chambers hewn from the solid metal of the cliff following winding corridors ascending steep inclines and now and again concealing ourselves in dark recesses at the sound of approaching footsteps  our destination thuvia said was a distant storeroom where arms and ammunition in plenty might be found  from there she was to lead us to the summit of the cliffs from where it would require both wondrous wit and mighty fighting to win our way through the very heart of the stronghold of the holy therns to the world without  and even then o prince she cried the arm of the holy thern is long  it reaches to every nation of barsoom  his secret temples are hidden in the heart of every community  wherever we go should we escape we shall find that word of our coming has preceded us and death awaits us before we may pollute the air with our blasphemies  we had proceeded for possibly an hour without serious interruption and thuvia had just whispered to me that we were approaching our first destination when on entering a great chamber we came upon a man evidently a thern  he wore in addition to his leathern trappings and jewelled ornaments a great circlet of gold about his brow in the exact centre of which was set an immense stone the exact counterpart of that which i had seen upon the breast of the little old man at the atmosphere plant nearly twenty years before  it is the one priceless jewel of barsoom  only two are known to exist and these were worn as the insignia of their rank and position by the two old men in whose charge was placed the operation of the great engines which pump the artificial atmosphere to all parts of mars from the huge atmosphere plant the secret to whose mighty portals placed in my possession the ability to save from immediate extinction the life of a whole world  the stone worn by the thern who confronted us was of about the same size as that which i had seen before an inch in diameter i should say it scintillated nine different and distinct rays the seven primary colours of our earthly prism and the two rays which are unknown upon earth but whose wondrous beauty is indescribable  as the thern saw us his eyes narrowed to two nasty slits  stop he cried  what means this thuvia  for answer the girl raised her revolver and fired pointblank at him without a sound he sank to the earth dead  beast she hissed  after all these years i am at last revenged  then as she turned toward me evidently with a word of explanation on her lips her eyes suddenly widened as they rested upon me and with a little exclamation she started toward me  o prince she cried fate is indeed kind to us  the way is still difficult but through this vile thing upon the floor we may yet win to the outer world  notest thou not the remarkable resemblance between this holy thern and thyself  the man was indeed of my precise stature nor were his eyes and features unlike mine but his hair was a mass of flowing yellow locks like those of the two i had killed while mine is black and close cropped  what of the resemblance i asked the girl thuvia  do you wish me with my black short hair to pose as a yellowhaired priest of this infernal cult  she smiled and for answer approached the body of the man she had slain and kneeling beside it removed the circlet of gold from the forehead and then to my utter amazement lifted the entire scalp bodily from the corpses head  rising she advanced to my side and placing the yellow wig over my black hair crowned me with the golden circlet set with the magnificent gem  now don his harness prince she said and you may pass where you will in the realms of the therns for sator throg was a holy thern of the tenth cycle and mighty among his kind  as i stooped to the dead man to do her bidding i noted that not a hair grew upon his head which was quite as bald as an egg  they are all thus from birth explained thuvia noting my surprise the race from which they sprang were crowned with a luxuriant growth of golden hair but for many ages the present race has been entirely bald  the wig however has come to be a part of their apparel and so important a part do they consider it that it is cause for the deepest disgrace were a thern to appear in public without it  in another moment i stood garbed in the habiliments of a holy thern  at thuvias suggestion two of the released prisoners bore the body of the dead thern upon their shoulders with us as we continued our journey toward the storeroom which we reached without further mishap  here the keys which thuvia bore from the dead thern of the prison vault were the means of giving us immediate entrance to the chamber and very quickly we were thoroughly outfitted with arms and ammunition  by this time i was so thoroughly fagged out that i could go no further so i threw myself upon the floor bidding tars tarkas to do likewise and cautioning two of the released prisoners to keep careful watch  in an instant i was asleep     chapter v  corridors of peril   how long i slept upon the floor of the storeroom i do not know but it must have been many hours  i was awakened with a start by cries of alarm and scarce were my eyes opened nor had i yet sufficiently collected my wits to quite realize where i was when a fusillade of shots rang out reverberating through the subterranean corridors in a series of deafening echoes  in an instant i was upon my feet  a dozen lesser therns confronted us from a large doorway at the opposite end of the storeroom from which we had entered  about me lay the bodies of my companions with the exception of thuvia and tars tarkas who like myself had been asleep upon the floor and thus escaped the first raking fire  as i gained my feet the therns lowered their wicked rifles their faces distorted in mingled chagrin consternation and alarm  instantly i rose to the occasion  what means this i cried in tones of fierce anger  is sator throg to be murdered by his own vassals  have mercy o master of the tenth cycle cried one of the fellows while the others edged toward the doorway as though to attempt a surreptitious escape from the presence of the mighty one  ask them their mission here whispered thuvia at my elbow  what do you here fellows i cried  two from the outer world are at large within the dominions of the therns  we sought them at the command of the father of therns  one was white with black hair the other a huge green warrior and here the fellow cast a suspicious glance toward tars tarkas  here then is one of them spoke thuvia indicating the thark and if you will look upon this dead man by the door perhaps you will recognize the other  it was left for sator throg and his poor slaves to accomplish what the lesser therns of the guard were unable to dowe have killed one and captured the other for this had sator throg given us our liberty  and now in your stupidity have you come and killed all but myself and like to have killed the mighty sator throg himself  the men looked very sheepish and very scared  had they not better throw these bodies to the plant men and then return to their quarters o mighty one asked thuvia of me  yes do as thuvia bids you i said  as the men picked up the bodies i noticed that the one who stooped to gather up the late sator throg started as his closer scrutiny fell upon the upturned face and then the fellow stole a furtive sneaking glance in my direction from the corner of his eye  that he suspicioned something of the truth i could have sworn but that it was only a suspicion which he did not dare voice was evidenced by his silence  again as he bore the body from the room he shot a quick but searching glance toward me and then his eyes fell once more upon the bald and shiny dome of the dead man in his arms  the last fleeting glimpse that i obtained of his profile as he passed from my sight without the chamber revealed a cunning smile of triumph upon his lips  only tars tarkas thuvia and i were left  the fatal marksmanship of the therns had snatched from our companions whatever slender chance they had of gaining the perilous freedom of the world without  so soon as the last of the gruesome procession had disappeared the girl urged us to take up our flight once more  she too had noted the questioning attitude of the thern who had borne sator throg away  it bodes no good for us o prince she said  for even though this fellow dared not chance accusing you in error there be those above with power sufficient to demand a closer scrutiny and that prince would indeed prove fatal  i shrugged my shoulders  it seemed that in any event the outcome of our plight must end in death  i was refreshed from my sleep but still weak from loss of blood  my wounds were painful  no medicinal aid seemed possible  how i longed for the almost miraculous healing power of the strange salves and lotions of the green martian women  in an hour they would have had me as new  i was discouraged  never had a feeling of such utter hopelessness come over me in the face of danger  then the long flowing yellow locks of the holy thern caught by some vagrant draught blew about my face  might they not still open the way of freedom  if we acted in time might we not even yet escape before the general alarm was sounded  we could at least try  what will the fellow do first thuvia i asked  how long will it be before they may return for us  he will go directly to the father of therns old matai shang  he may have to wait for an audience but since he is very high among the lesser therns in fact as a thorian among them it will not be long that matai shang will keep him waiting  then if the father of therns puts credence in his story another hour will see the galleries and chambers the courts and gardens filled with searchers  what we do then must be done within an hour  what is the best way thuvia the shortest way out of this celestial hades  straight to the top of the cliffs prince she replied and then through the gardens to the inner courts  from there our way will lie within the temples of the therns and across them to the outer court then the rampartso prince it is hopeless  ten thousand warriors could not hew a way to liberty from out this awful place  since the beginning of time little by little stone by stone have the therns been ever adding to the defences of their stronghold  a continuous line of impregnable fortifications circles the outer slopes of the mountains of otz  within the temples that lie behind the ramparts a million fightingmen are ever ready  the courts and gardens are filled with slaves with women and with children  none could go a stones throw without detection  if there is no other way thuvia why dwell upon the difficulties of this  we must face them  can we not better make the attempt after dark asked tars tarkas there would seem to be no chance by day  there would be a little better chance by night but even then the ramparts are well guarded possibly better than by day  there are fewer abroad in the courts and gardens though said thuvia  what is the hour i asked  it was midnight when you released me from my chains said thuvia two hours later we reached the storeroom  there you slept for fourteen hours  it must now be nearly sundown again  come we will go to some nearby window in the cliff and make sure  so saying she led the way through winding corridors until at a sudden turn we came upon an opening which overlooked the valley dor  at our right the sun was setting a huge red orb below the western range of otz  a little below us stood the holy thern on watch upon his balcony  his scarlet robe of office was pulled tightly about him in anticipation of the cold that comes so suddenly with darkness as the sun sets  so rare is the atmosphere of mars that it absorbs very little heat from the sun  during the daylight hours it is always extremely hot at night it is intensely cold  nor does the thin atmosphere refract the suns rays or diffuse its light as upon earth there is no twilight on mars  when the great orb of day disappears beneath the horizon the effect is precisely as that of the extinguishing of a single lamp within a chamber  from brilliant light you are plunged without warning into utter darkness  then the moons come the mysterious magic moons of mars hurtling like monster meteors low across the face of the planet  the declining sun lighted brilliantly the eastern banks of korus the crimson sward the gorgeous forest  beneath the trees we saw feeding many herds of plant men  the adults stood aloft upon their toes and their mighty tails their talons pruning every available leaf and twig it was then that i understood the careful trimming of the trees which had led me to form the mistaken idea when first i opened my eyes upon the grove that it was the playground of a civilized people  as we watched our eyes wandered to the rolling iss which issued from the base of the cliffs beneath us  presently there emerged from the mountain a canoe laden with lost souls from the outer world  there were a dozen of them  all were of the highly civilized and cultured race of red men who are dominant on mars  the eyes of the herald upon the balcony beneath us fell upon the doomed party as soon as did ours  he raised his head and leaning far out over the low rail that rimmed his dizzy perch voiced the shrill weird wail that called the demons of this hellish place to the attack  for an instant the brutes stood with stiffly erected ears then they poured from the grove toward the rivers bank covering the distance with great ungainly leaps  the party had landed and was standing on the sward as the awful horde came in sight  there was a brief and futile effort of defence  then silence as the huge repulsive shapes covered the bodies of their victims and scores of sucking mouths fastened themselves to the flesh of their prey  i turned away in disgust  their part is soon over said thuvia  the great white apes get the flesh when the plant men have drained the arteries  look they are coming now  as i turned my eyes in the direction the girl indicated i saw a dozen of the great white monsters running across the valley toward the river bank  then the sun went down and darkness that could almost be felt engulfed us  thuvia lost no time in leading us toward the corridor which winds back and forth up through the cliffs toward the surface thousands of feet above the level on which we had been  twice great banths wandering loose through the galleries blocked our progress but in each instance thuvia spoke a low word of command and the snarling beasts slunk sullenly away  if you can dissolve all our obstacles as easily as you master these fierce brutes i can see no difficulties in our way i said to the girl smiling  how do you do it  she laughed and then shuddered  i do not quite know she said  when first i came here i angered sator throg because i repulsed him  he ordered me to be thrown into one of the great pits in the inner gardens  it was filled with banths in my own country i had been accustomed to command  something in my voice i do not know what cowed the beasts as they sprang to attack me  instead of tearing me to pieces as sator throg had desired they fawned at my feet  so greatly were sator throg and his friends amused by the sight that they kept me to train and handle the terrible creatures  i know them all by name  there are many of them wandering through these lower regions  they are the scavengers  many prisoners die here in their chains  the banths solve the problem of sanitation at least in this respect  in the gardens and temples above they are kept in pits  the therns fear them  it is because of the banths that they seldom venture below ground except as their duties call them  an idea occurred to me suggested by what thuvia had just said  why not take a number of banths and set them loose before us above ground i asked  thuvia laughed  it would distract attention from us i am sure she said  she commenced calling in a low singsong voice that was half purr  she continued this as we wound our tedious way through the maze of subterranean passages and chambers  presently soft padded feet sounded close behind us and as i turned i saw a pair of great green eyes shining in the dark shadows at our rear  from a diverging tunnel a sinuous tawny form crept stealthily toward us  low growls and angry snarls assailed our ears on every side as we hastened on and one by one the ferocious creatures answered the call of their mistress  she spoke a word to each as it joined us  like wellschooled terriers they paced the corridors with us but i could not help but note the lathering jowls nor the hungry expressions with which they eyed tars tarkas and myself  soon we were entirely surrounded by some fifty of the brutes  two walked close on either side of thuvia as guards might walk  the sleek sides of others now and then touched my own naked limbs  it was a strange experience the almost noiseless passage of naked human feet and padded paws the golden walls splashed with precious stones the dim light cast by the tiny radium bulbs set at considerable distances along the roof the huge maned beasts of prey crowding with low growls about us the mighty green warrior towering high above us all myself crowned with the priceless diadem of a holy thern and leading the procession the beautiful girl thuvia  i shall not soon forget it  presently we approached a great chamber more brightly lighted than the corridors  thuvia halted us  quietly she stole toward the entrance and glanced within  then she motioned us to follow her  the room was filled with specimens of the strange beings that inhabit this underworld a heterogeneous collection of hybridsthe offspring of the prisoners from the outside world red and green martians and the white race of therns  constant confinement below ground had wrought odd freaks upon their skins  they more resemble corpses than living beings  many are deformed others maimed while the majority thuvia explained are sightless  as they lay sprawled about the floor sometimes overlapping one another again in heaps of several bodies they suggested instantly to me the grotesque illustrations that i had seen in copies of dantes inferno and what more fitting comparison  was this not indeed a veritable hell peopled by lost souls dead and damned beyond all hope  picking our way carefully we threaded a winding path across the chamber the great banths sniffing hungrily at the tempting prey spread before them in such tantalizing and defenceless profusion  several times we passed the entrances to other chambers similarly peopled and twice again we were compelled to cross directly through them  in others were chained prisoners and beasts  why is it that we see no therns i asked of thuvia  they seldom traverse the underworld at night for then it is that the great banths prowl the dim corridors seeking their prey  the therns fear the awful denizens of this cruel and hopeless world that they have fostered and allowed to grow beneath their feet  the prisoners even sometimes turn upon them and rend them  the thern can never tell from what dark shadow an assassin may spring upon his back  by day it is different  then the corridors and chambers are filled with guards passing to and fro slaves from the temples above come by hundreds to the granaries and storerooms  all is life then  you did not see it because i led you not in the beaten tracks but through roundabout passages seldom used  yet it is possible that we may meet a thern even yet  they do occasionally find it necessary to come here after the sun has set  because of this i have moved with such great caution  but we reached the upper galleries without detection and presently thuvia halted us at the foot of a short steep ascent  above us she said is a doorway which opens on to the inner gardens  i have brought you thus far  from here on for four miles to the outer ramparts our way will be beset by countless dangers  guards patrol the courts the temples the gardens  every inch of the ramparts themselves is beneath the eye of a sentry  i could not understand the necessity for such an enormous force of armed men about a spot so surrounded by mystery and superstition that not a soul upon barsoom would have dared to approach it even had they known its exact location  i questioned thuvia asking her what enemies the therns could fear in their impregnable fortress  we had reached the doorway now and thuvia was opening it  they fear the black pirates of barsoom o prince she said from whom may our first ancestors preserve us  the door swung open the smell of growing things greeted my nostrils the cool night air blew against my cheek  the great banths sniffed the unfamiliar odours and then with a rush they broke past us with low growls swarming across the gardens beneath the lurid light of the nearer moon  suddenly a great cry arose from the roofs of the temples a cry of alarm and warning that taken up from point to point ran off to the east and to the west from temple court and rampart until it sounded as a dim echo in the distance  the great tharks longsword leaped from its scabbard thuvia shrank shuddering to my side     chapter vi  the black pirates of barsoom   what is it i asked of the girl  for answer she pointed to the sky  i looked and there above us i saw shadowy bodies flitting hither and thither high over temple court and garden  almost immediately flashes of light broke from these strange objects there was a roar of musketry and then answering flashes and roars from temple and rampart  the black pirates of barsoom o prince said thuvia  in great circles the air craft of the marauders swept lower and lower toward the defending forces of the therns  volley after volley they vomited upon the temple guards volley on volley crashed through the thin air toward the fleeting and illusive fliers  as the pirates swooped closer toward the ground thern soldiery poured from the temples into the gardens and courts  the sight of them in the open brought a score of fliers darting toward us from all directions  the therns fired upon them through shields affixed to their rifles but on steadily on came the grim black craft  they were small fliers for the most part built for two to three men  a few larger ones there were but these kept high aloft dropping bombs upon the temples from their keel batteries  at length with a concerted rush evidently in response to a signal of command the pirates in our immediate vicinity dashed recklessly to the ground in the very midst of the thern soldiery  scarcely waiting for their craft to touch the creatures manning them leaped among the therns with the fury of demons  such fighting  never had i witnessed its like before  i had thought the green martians the most ferocious warriors in the universe but the awful abandon with which the black pirates threw themselves upon their foes transcended everything i ever before had seen  beneath the brilliant light of mars two glorious moons the whole scene presented itself in vivid distinctness  the goldenhaired whiteskinned therns battling with desperate courage in handtohand conflict with their ebonyskinned foemen  here a little knot of struggling warriors trampled a bed of gorgeous pimalia there the curved sword of a black man found the heart of a thern and left its dead foeman at the foot of a wondrous statue carved from a living ruby yonder a dozen therns pressed a single pirate back upon a bench of emerald upon whose iridescent surface a strangely beautiful barsoomian design was traced out in inlaid diamonds  a little to one side stood thuvia the thark and i  the tide of battle had not reached us but the fighters from time to time swung close enough that we might distinctly note them  the black pirates interested me immensely  i had heard vague rumours little more than legends they were during my former life on mars but never had i seen them nor talked with one who had  they were popularly supposed to inhabit the lesser moon from which they descended upon barsoom at long intervals  where they visited they wrought the most horrible atrocities and when they left carried away with them firearms and ammunition and young girls as prisoners  these latter the rumour had it they sacrificed to some terrible god in an orgy which ended in the eating of their victims  i had an excellent opportunity to examine them as the strife occasionally brought now one and now another close to where i stood they were large men possibly six feet and over in height  their features were clear cut and handsome in the extreme their eyes were well set and large though a slight narrowness lent them a crafty appearance the iris as well as i could determine by moonlight was of extreme blackness while the eyeball itself was quite white and clear the physical structure of their bodies seemed identical with those of the therns the red men and my own  only in the colour of their skin did they differ materially from us that is of the appearance of polished ebony and odd as it may seem for a southerner to say it adds to rather than detracts from their marvellous beauty  but if their bodies are divine their hearts apparently are quite the reverse  never did i witness such a malign lust for blood as these demons of the outer air evinced in their mad battle with the therns  all about us in the garden lay their sinister craft which the therns for some reason then unaccountable to me made no effort to injure now and again a black warrior would rush from a nearby temple bearing a young woman in his arms  straight for his flier he would leap while those of his comrades who fought near by would rush to cover his escape  the therns on their side would hasten to rescue the girl and in an instant the two would be swallowed in the vortex of a maelstrom of yelling devils hacking and hewing at one another like fiends incarnate  but always it seemed were the black pirates of barsoom victorious and the girl brought miraculously unharmed through the conflict borne away into the outer darkness upon the deck of a swift flier  fighting similar to that which surrounded us could be heard in both directions as far as sound carried and thuvia told me that the attacks of the black pirates were usually made simultaneously along the entire ribbonlike domain of the therns which circles the valley dor on the outer slopes of the mountains of otz  as the fighting receded from our position for a moment thuvia turned toward me with a question  do you understand now o prince she said why a million warriors guard the domains of the holy therns by day and by night  the scene you are witnessing now is but a repetition of what i have seen enacted a score of times during the fifteen years i have been a prisoner here  from time immemorial the black pirates of barsoom have preyed upon the holy therns  yet they never carry their expeditions to a point as one might readily believe it was in their power to do where the extermination of the race of therns is threatened  it is as though they but utilized the race as playthings with which they satisfy their ferocious lust for fighting and from whom they collect toll in arms and ammunition and in prisoners  why dont they jump in and destroy these fliers i asked  that would soon put a stop to the attacks or at least the blacks would scarce be so bold  why see how perfectly unguarded they leave their craft as though they were lying safe in their own hangars at home  the therns do not dare  they tried it once ages ago but the next night and for a whole moon thereafter a thousand great black battleships circled the mountains of otz pouring tons of projectiles upon the temples the gardens and the courts until every thern who was not killed was driven for safety into the subterranean galleries  the therns know that they live at all only by the sufferance of the black men  they were near to extermination that once and they will not venture risking it again  as she ceased talking a new element was instilled into the conflict it came from a source equally unlooked for by either thern or pirate the great banths which we had liberated in the garden had evidently been awed at first by the sound of the battle the yelling of the warriors and the loud report of rifle and bomb  but now they must have become angered by the continuous noise and excited by the smell of new blood for all of a sudden a great form shot from a clump of low shrubbery into the midst of a struggling mass of humanity  a horrid scream of bestial rage broke from the banth as he felt warm flesh beneath his powerful talons  as though his cry was but a signal to the others the entire great pack hurled themselves among the fighters  panic reigned in an instant thern and black man turned alike against the common enemy for the banths showed no partiality toward either  the awful beasts bore down a hundred men by the mere weight of their great bodies as they hurled themselves into the thick of the fight leaping and clawing they mowed down the warriors with their powerful paws turning for an instant to rend their victims with frightful fangs  the scene was fascinating in its terribleness but suddenly it came to me that we were wasting valuable time watching this conflict which in itself might prove a means of our escape  the therns were so engaged with their terrible assailants that now if ever escape should be comparatively easy  i turned to search for an opening through the contending hordes  if we could but reach the ramparts we might find that the pirates somewhere had thinned the guarding forces and left a way open to us to the world without  as my eyes wandered about the garden the sight of the hundreds of air craft lying unguarded around us suggested the simplest avenue to freedom  why it had not occurred to me before  i was thoroughly familiar with the mechanism of every known make of flier on barsoom for nine years i had sailed and fought with the navy of helium  i had raced through space on the tiny oneman air scout and i had commanded the greatest battleship that ever had floated in the thin air of dying mars  to think with me is to act  grasping thuvia by the arm i whispered to tars tarkas to follow me  quickly we glided toward a small flier which lay furthest from the battling warriors  another instant found us huddled on the tiny deck  my hand was on the starting lever  i pressed my thumb upon the button which controls the ray of repulsion that splendid discovery of the martians which permits them to navigate the thin atmosphere of their planet in huge ships that dwarf the dreadnoughts of our earthly navies into pitiful insignificance  the craft swayed slightly but she did not move  then a new cry of warning broke upon our ears  turning i saw a dozen black pirates dashing toward us from the melee  we had been discovered  with shrieks of rage the demons sprang for us  with frenzied insistence i continued to press the little button which should have sent us racing out into space but still the vessel refused to budge  then it came to methe reason that she would not rise  we had stumbled upon a twoman flier  its ray tanks were charged only with sufficient repulsive energy to lift two ordinary men  the tharks great weight was anchoring us to our doom  the blacks were nearly upon us  there was not an instant to be lost in hesitation or doubt  i pressed the button far in and locked it  then i set the lever at high speed and as the blacks came yelling upon us i slipped from the crafts deck and with drawn longsword met the attack  at the same moment a girls shriek rang out behind me and an instant later as the blacks fell upon me  i heard far above my head and faintly in thuvias voice my prince o my prince i would rather remain and die with but the rest was lost in the noise of my assailants  i knew though that my ruse had worked and that temporarily at least thuvia and tars tarkas were safe and the means of escape was theirs  for a moment it seemed that i could not withstand the weight of numbers that confronted me but again as on so many other occasions when i had been called upon to face fearful odds upon this planet of warriors and fierce beasts i found that my earthly strength so far transcended that of my opponents that the odds were not so greatly against me as they appeared  my seething blade wove a net of death about me  for an instant the blacks pressed close to reach me with their shorter swords but presently they gave back and the esteem in which they suddenly had learned to hold my sword arm was writ large upon each countenance  i knew though that it was but a question of minutes before their greater numbers would wear me down or get around my guard  i must go down eventually to certain death before them  i shuddered at the thought of it dying thus in this terrible place where no word of my end ever could reach my dejah thoris  dying at the hands of nameless black men in the gardens of the cruel therns  then my oldtime spirit reasserted itself  the fighting blood of my virginian sires coursed hot through my veins  the fierce blood lust and the joy of battle surged over me  the fighting smile that has brought consternation to a thousand foemen touched my lips  i put the thought of death out of my mind and fell upon my antagonists with fury that those who escaped will remember to their dying day  that others would press to the support of those who faced me i knew so even as i fought i kept my wits at work searching for an avenue of escape  it came from an unexpected quarter out of the black night behind me  i had just disarmed a huge fellow who had given me a desperate struggle and for a moment the blacks stood back for a breathing spell  they eyed me with malignant fury yet withal there was a touch of respect in their demeanour  thern said one you fight like a dator  but for your detestable yellow hair and your white skin you would be an honour to the first born of barsoom  i am no thern i said and was about to explain that i was from another world thinking that by patching a truce with these fellows and fighting with them against the therns i might enlist their aid in regaining my liberty  but just at that moment a heavy object smote me a resounding whack between my shoulders that nearly felled me to the ground  as i turned to meet this new enemy an object passed over my shoulder striking one of my assailants squarely in the face and knocking him senseless to the sward  at the same instant i saw that the thing that had struck us was the trailing anchor of a rather fairsized air vessel possibly a ten man cruiser  the ship was floating slowly above us not more than fifty feet over our heads  instantly the one chance for escape that it offered presented itself to me  the vessel was slowly rising and now the anchor was beyond the blacks who faced me and several feet above their heads  with a bound that left them gaping in wideeyed astonishment i sprang completely over them  a second leap carried me just high enough to grasp the now rapidly receding anchor  but i was successful and there i hung by one hand dragging through the branches of the higher vegetation of the gardens while my late foemen shrieked and howled beneath me  presently the vessel veered toward the west and then swung gracefully to the south  in another instant i was carried beyond the crest of the golden cliffs out over the valley dor where six thousand feet below me the lost sea of korus lay shimmering in the moonlight  carefully i climbed to a sitting posture across the anchors arms  i wondered if by chance the vessel might be deserted  i hoped so  or possibly it might belong to a friendly people and have wandered by accident almost within the clutches of the pirates and the therns  the fact that it was retreating from the scene of battle lent colour to this hypothesis  but i decided to know positively and at once so with the greatest caution i commenced to climb slowly up the anchor chain toward the deck above me  one hand had just reached for the vessels rail and found it when a fierce black face was thrust over the side and eyes filled with triumphant hate looked into mine     chapter vii  a fair goddess   for an instant the black pirate and i remained motionless glaring into each others eyes  then a grim smile curled the handsome lips above me as an ebony hand came slowly in sight from above the edge of the deck and the cold hollow eye of a revolver sought the centre of my forehead  simultaneously my free hand shot out for the black throat just within reach and the ebony finger tightened on the trigger  the pirates hissing die cursed thern was half choked in his windpipe by my clutching fingers  the hammer fell with a futile click upon an empty chamber  before he could fire again i had pulled him so far over the edge of the deck that he was forced to drop his firearm and clutch the rail with both hands  my grasp upon his throat effectually prevented any outcry and so we struggled in grim silence he to tear away from my hold i to drag him over to his death  his face was taking on a livid hue his eyes were bulging from their sockets  it was evident to him that he soon must die unless he tore loose from the steel fingers that were choking the life from him  with a final effort he threw himself further back upon the deck at the same instant releasing his hold upon the rail to tear frantically with both hands at my fingers in an effort to drag them from his throat  that little second was all that i awaited  with one mighty downward surge i swept him clear of the deck  his falling body came near to tearing me from the frail hold that my single free hand had upon the anchor chain and plunging me with him to the waters of the sea below  i did not relinquish my grasp upon him however for i knew that a single shriek from those lips as he hurtled to his death in the silent waters of the sea would bring his comrades from above to avenge him  instead i held grimly to him choking ever choking while his frantic struggles dragged me lower and lower toward the end of the chain  gradually his contortions became spasmodic lessening by degrees until they ceased entirely  then i released my hold upon him and in an instant he was swallowed by the black shadows far below  again i climbed to the ships rail  this time i succeeded in raising my eyes to the level of the deck where i could take a careful survey of the conditions immediately confronting me  the nearer moon had passed below the horizon but the clear effulgence of the further satellite bathed the deck of the cruiser bringing into sharp relief the bodies of six or eight black men sprawled about in sleep  huddled close to the base of a rapid fire gun was a young white girl securely bound  her eyes were widespread in an expression of horrified anticipation and fixed directly upon me as i came in sight above the edge of the deck  unutterable relief instantly filled them as if they fell upon the mystic jewel which sparkled in the centre of my stolen headpiece  she did not speak  instead her eyes warned me to beware the sleeping figures that surrounded her  noiselessly i gained the deck  the girl nodded to me to approach her as i bent low she whispered to me to release her  i can aid you she said and you will need all the aid available when they awaken  some of them will awake in korus i replied smiling  she caught the meaning of my words and the cruelty of her answering smile horrified me  one is not astonished by cruelty in a hideous face but when it touches the features of a goddess whose finechiselled lineaments might more fittingly portray love and beauty the contrast is appalling  quickly i released her  give me a revolver she whispered  i can use that upon those your sword does not silence in time  i did as she bid  then i turned toward the distasteful work that lay before me  this was no time for fine compunctions nor for a chivalry that these cruel demons would neither appreciate nor reciprocate  stealthily i approached the nearest sleeper  when he awoke he was well on his journey to the bosom of korus  his piercing shriek as consciousness returned to him came faintly up to us from the black depths beneath  the second awoke as i touched him and though i succeeded in hurling him from the cruisers deck his wild cry of alarm brought the remaining pirates to their feet  there were five of them  as they arose the girls revolver spoke in sharp staccato and one sank back to the deck again to rise no more  the others rushed madly upon me with drawn swords  the girl evidently dared not fire for fear of wounding me but i saw her sneak stealthily and catlike toward the flank of the attackers  then they were on me  for a few minutes i experienced some of the hottest fighting i had ever passed through  the quarters were too small for foot work  it was stand your ground and give and take  at first i took considerably more than i gave but presently i got beneath one fellows guard and had the satisfaction of seeing him collapse upon the deck  the others redoubled their efforts  the crashing of their blades upon mine raised a terrific din that might have been heard for miles through the silent night  sparks flew as steel smote steel and then there was the dull and sickening sound of a shoulder bone parting beneath the keen edge of my martian sword  three now faced me but the girl was working her way to a point that would soon permit her to reduce the number by one at least  then things happened with such amazing rapidity that i can scarce comprehend even now all that took place in that brief instant  the three rushed me with the evident purpose of forcing me back the few steps that would carry my body over the rail into the void below  at the same instant the girl fired and my sword arm made two moves  one man dropped with a bullet in his brain a sword flew clattering across the deck and dropped over the edge beyond as i disarmed one of my opponents and the third went down with my blade buried to the hilt in his breast and three feet of it protruding from his back and falling wrenched the sword from my grasp  disarmed myself i now faced my remaining foeman whose own sword lay somewhere thousands of feet below us lost in the lost sea  the new conditions seemed to please my adversary for a smile of satisfaction bared his gleaming teeth as he rushed at me barehanded the great muscles which rolled beneath his glossy black hide evidently assured him that here was easy prey not worth the trouble of drawing the dagger from his harness  i let him come almost upon me  then i ducked beneath his outstretched arms at the same time sidestepping to the right  pivoting on my left toe i swung a terrific right to his jaw and like a felled ox he dropped in his tracks  a low silvery laugh rang out behind me  you are no thern said the sweet voice of my companion for all your golden locks or the harness of sator throg  never lived there upon all barsoom before one who could fight as you have fought this night  who are you  i am john carter prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium i replied  and whom i added has the honour of serving been accorded me  she hesitated a moment before speaking  then she asked  you are no thern  are you an enemy of the therns  i have been in the territory of the therns for a day and a half during that entire time my life has been in constant danger  i have been harassed and persecuted  armed men and fierce beasts have been set upon me  i had no quarrel with the therns before but can you wonder that i feel no great love for them now  i have spoken  she looked at me intently for several minutes before she replied  it was as though she were attempting to read my inmost soul to judge my character and my standards of chivalry in that longdrawn searching gaze  apparently the inventory satisfied her  i am phaidor daughter of matai shang holy hekkador of the holy therns father of therns master of life and death upon barsoom brother of issus prince of life eternal  at that moment i noticed that the black i had dropped with my fist was commencing to show signs of returning consciousness  i sprang to his side  stripping his harness from him i securely bound his hands behind his back and after similarly fastening his feet tied him to a heavy gun carriage  why not the simpler way asked phaidor  i do not understand  what simpler way i replied  with a slight shrug of her lovely shoulders she made a gesture with her hands personating the casting of something over the crafts side  i am no murderer i said  i kill in selfdefence only  she looked at me narrowly  then she puckered those divine brows of hers and shook her head  she could not comprehend  well neither had my own dejah thoris been able to understand what to her had seemed a foolish and dangerous policy toward enemies  upon barsoom quarter is neither asked nor given and each dead man means so much more of the waning resources of this dying planet to be divided amongst those who survive  but there seemed a subtle difference here between the manner in which this girl contemplated the dispatching of an enemy and the tenderhearted regret of my own princess for the stern necessity which demanded it  i think that phaidor regretted the thrill that the spectacle would have afforded her rather than the fact that my decision left another enemy alive to threaten us  the man had now regained full possession of his faculties and was regarding us intently from where he lay bound upon the deck  he was a handsome fellow clean limbed and powerful with an intelligent face and features of such exquisite chiselling that adonis himself might have envied him  the vessel unguided had been moving slowly across the valley but now i thought it time to take the helm and direct her course  only in a very general way could i guess the location of the valley dor  that it was far south of the equator was evident from the constellations but i was not sufficiently a martian astronomer to come much closer than a rough guess without the splendid charts and delicate instruments with which as an officer in the heliumite navy i had formerly reckoned the positions of the vessels on which i sailed  that a northerly course would quickest lead me toward the more settled portions of the planet immediately decided the direction that i should steer  beneath my hand the cruiser swung gracefully about  then the button which controlled the repulsive rays sent us soaring far out into space  with speed lever pulled to the last notch we raced toward the north as we rose ever farther and farther above that terrible valley of death  as we passed at a dizzy height over the narrow domains of the therns the flash of powder far below bore mute witness to the ferocity of the battle that still raged along that cruel frontier  no sound of conflict reached our ears for in the rarefied atmosphere of our great altitude no sound wave could penetrate they were dissipated in thin air far below us  it became intensely cold  breathing was difficult  the girl phaidor and the black pirate kept their eyes glued upon me  at length the girl spoke  unconsciousness comes quickly at this altitude she said quietly unless you are inviting death for us all you had best drop and that quickly  there was no fear in her voice  it was as one might say you had better carry an umbrella  it is going to rain  i dropped the vessel quickly to a lower level  nor was i a moment too soon  the girl had swooned  the black too was unconscious while i myself retained my senses i think only by sheer will  the one on whom all responsibility rests is apt to endure the most  we were swinging along low above the foothills of the otz  it was comparatively warm and there was plenty of air for our starved lungs so i was not surprised to see the black open his eyes and a moment later the girl also  it was a close call she said  it has taught me two things though i replied  what  that even phaidor daughter of the master of life and death is mortal i said smiling  there is immortality only in issus she replied  and issus is for the race of therns alone  thus am i immortal  i caught a fleeting grin passing across the features of the black as he heard her words  i did not then understand why he smiled  later i was to learn and she too in a most horrible manner  if the other thing you have just learned she continued has led to as erroneous deductions as the first you are little richer in knowledge than you were before  the other i replied is that our dusky friend here does not hail from the nearer moonhe was like to have died at a few thousand feet above barsoom  had we continued the five thousand miles that lie between thuria and the planet he would have been but the frozen memory of a man  phaidor looked at the black in evident astonishment  if you are not of thuria then where she asked  he shrugged his shoulders and turned his eyes elsewhere but did not reply  the girl stamped her little foot in a peremptory manner  the daughter of matai shang is not accustomed to having her queries remain unanswered she said  one of the lesser breed should feel honoured that a member of the holy race that was born to inherit life eternal should deign even to notice him  again the black smiled that wicked knowing smile  xodar dator of the first born of barsoom is accustomed to give commands not to receive them replied the black pirate  then turning to me what are your intentions concerning me  i intend taking you both back to helium i said  no harm will come to you  you will find the red men of helium a kindly and magnanimous race but if they listen to me there will be no more voluntary pilgrimages down the river iss and the impossible belief that they have cherished for ages will be shattered into a thousand pieces  are you of helium he asked  i am a prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium i replied but i am not of barsoom  i am of another world  xodar looked at me intently for a few moments  i can well believe that you are not of barsoom he said at length none of this world could have bested eight of the first born singlehanded  but how is it that you wear the golden hair and the jewelled circlet of a holy thern  he emphasized the word holy with a touch of irony  i had forgotten them i said  they are the spoils of conquest and with a sweep of my hand i removed the disguise from my head  when the blacks eyes fell on my closecropped black hair they opened in astonishment  evidently he had looked for the bald pate of a thern  you are indeed of another world he said a touch of awe in his voice  with the skin of a thern the black hair of a first born and the muscles of a dozen dators it was no disgrace even for xodar to acknowledge your supremacy  a thing he could never do were you a barsoomian he added  you are travelling several laps ahead of me my friend i interrupted  i glean that your name is xodar but whom pray are the first born and what a dator and why if you were conquered by a barsoomian could you not acknowledge it  the first born of barsoom he explained are the race of black men of which i am a dator or as the lesser barsoomians would say prince my race is the oldest on the planet  we trace our lineage unbroken direct to the tree of life which flourished in the centre of the valley dor twentythree million years ago  for countless ages the fruit of this tree underwent the gradual changes of evolution passing by degrees from true plant life to a combination of plant and animal  in the first stages the fruit of the tree possessed only the power of independent muscular action while the stem remained attached to the parent plant later a brain developed in the fruit so that hanging there by their long stems they thought and moved as individuals  then with the development of perceptions came a comparison of them judgments were reached and compared and thus reason and the power to reason were born upon barsoom  ages passed  many forms of life came and went upon the tree of life but still all were attached to the parent plant by stems of varying lengths  at length the fruit tree consisted in tiny plant men such as we now see reproduced in such huge dimensions in the valley dor but still hanging to the limbs and branches of the tree by the stems which grew from the tops of their heads  the buds from which the plant men blossomed resembled large nuts about a foot in diameter divided by double partition walls into four sections  in one section grew the plant man in another a sixteenlegged worm in the third the progenitor of the white ape and in the fourth the primaeval black man of barsoom  when the bud burst the plant man remained dangling at the end of his stem but the three other sections fell to the ground where the efforts of their imprisoned occupants to escape sent them hopping about in all directions  thus as time went on all barsoom was covered with these imprisoned creatures  for countless ages they lived their long lives within their hard shells hopping and skipping about the broad planet falling into rivers lakes and seas to be still further spread about the surface of the new world  countless billions died before the first black man broke through his prison walls into the light of day  prompted by curiosity he broke open other shells and the peopling of barsoom commenced  the pure strain of the blood of this first black man has remained untainted by admixture with other creatures in the race of which i am a member but from the sixteenlegged worm the first ape and renegade black man has sprung every other form of animal life upon barsoom  the therns and he smiled maliciously as he spoke are but the result of ages of evolution from the pure white ape of antiquity  they are a lower order still  there is but one race of true and immortal humans on barsoom  it is the race of black men  the tree of life is dead but before it died the plant men learned to detach themselves from it and roam the face of barsoom with the other children of the first parent  now their bisexuality permits them to reproduce themselves after the manner of true plants but otherwise they have progressed but little in all the ages of their existence  their actions and movements are largely matters of instinct and not guided to any great extent by reason since the brain of a plant man is but a trifle larger than the end of your smallest finger  they live upon vegetation and the blood of animals and their brain is just large enough to direct their movements in the direction of food and to translate the food sensations which are carried to it from their eyes and ears  they have no sense of selfpreservation and so are entirely without fear in the face of danger  that is why they are such terrible antagonists in combat  i wondered why the black man took such pains to discourse thus at length to enemies upon the genesis of life barsoomian  it seemed a strangely inopportune moment for a proud member of a proud race to unbend in casual conversation with a captor  especially in view of the fact that the black still lay securely bound upon the deck  it was the faintest straying of his eye beyond me for the barest fraction of a second that explained his motive for thus dragging out my interest in his truly absorbing story  he lay a little forward of where i stood at the levers and thus he faced the stern of the vessel as he addressed me  it was at the end of his description of the plant men that i caught his eye fixed momentarily upon something behind me  nor could i be mistaken in the swift gleam of triumph that brightened those dark orbs for an instant  some time before i had reduced our speed for we had left the valley dor many miles astern and i felt comparatively safe  i turned an apprehensive glance behind me and the sight that i saw froze the newborn hope of freedom that had been springing up within me  a great battleship forging silent and unlighted through the dark night loomed close astern     chapter viii  the depths of omean   now i realized why the black pirate had kept me engrossed with his strange tale  for miles he had sensed the approach of succour and but for that single telltale glance the battleship would have been directly above us in another moment and the boarding party which was doubtless even now swinging in their harness from the ships keel would have swarmed our deck placing my rising hope of escape in sudden and total eclipse  i was too old a hand in aerial warfare to be at a loss now for the right manoeuvre  simultaneously i reversed the engines and dropped the little vessel a sheer hundred feet  above my head i could see the dangling forms of the boarding party as the battleship raced over us  then i rose at a sharp angle throwing my speed lever to its last notch  like a bolt from a crossbow my splendid craft shot its steel prow straight at the whirring propellers of the giant above us  if i could but touch them the huge bulk would be disabled for hours and escape once more possible  at the same instant the sun shot above the horizon disclosing a hundred grim black faces peering over the stern of the battleship upon us  at sight of us a shout of rage went up from a hundred throats  orders were shouted but it was too late to save the giant propellers and with a crash we rammed them  instantly with the shock of impact i reversed my engine but my prow was wedged in the hole it had made in the battleships stern  only a second i hung there before tearing away but that second was amply long to swarm my deck with black devils  there was no fight  in the first place there was no room to fight  we were simply submerged by numbers  then as swords menaced me a command from xodar stayed the hands of his fellows  secure them he said but do not injure them  several of the pirates already had released xodar  he now personally attended to my disarming and saw that i was properly bound  at least he thought that the binding was secure  it would have been had i been a martian but i had to smile at the puny strands that confined my wrists  when the time came i could snap them as they had been cotton string  the girl they bound also and then they fastened us together  in the meantime they had brought our craft alongside the disabled battleship and soon we were transported to the latters deck  fully a thousand black men manned the great engine of destruction  her decks were crowded with them as they pressed forward as far as discipline would permit to get a glimpse of their captives  the girls beauty elicited many brutal comments and vulgar jests  it was evident that these selfthought supermen were far inferior to the red men of barsoom in refinement and in chivalry  my closecropped black hair and thern complexion were the subjects of much comment  when xodar told his fellow nobles of my fighting ability and strange origin they crowded about me with numerous questions  the fact that i wore the harness and metal of a thern who had been killed by a member of my party convinced them that i was an enemy of their hereditary foes and placed me on a better footing in their estimation  without exception the blacks were handsome men and well built  the officers were conspicuous through the wondrous magnificence of their resplendent trappings  many harnesses were so encrusted with gold platinum silver and precious stones as to entirely hide the leather beneath  the harness of the commanding officer was a solid mass of diamonds against the ebony background of his skin they blazed out with a peculiarly accentuated effulgence  the whole scene was enchanting the handsome men the barbaric splendour of the accoutrements the polished skeel wood of the deck the gloriously grained sorapus of the cabins inlaid with priceless jewels and precious metals in intricate and beautiful design the burnished gold of hand rails the shining metal of the guns  phaidor and i were taken below decks where still fast bound we were thrown into a small compartment which contained a single porthole  as our escort left us they barred the door behind them  we could hear the men working on the broken propellers and from the porthole we could see that the vessel was drifting lazily toward the south  for some time neither of us spoke  each was occupied with his own thoughts  for my part i was wondering as to the fate of tars tarkas and the girl thuvia  even if they succeeded in eluding pursuit they must eventually fall into the hands of either red men or green and as fugitives from the valley dor they could look for but little else than a swift and terrible death  how i wished that i might have accompanied them  it seemed to me that i could not fail to impress upon the intelligent red men of barsoom the wicked deception that a cruel and senseless superstition had foisted upon them  tardos mors would believe me  of that i was positive  and that he would have the courage of his convictions my knowledge of his character assured me  dejah thoris would believe me  not a doubt as to that entered my head  then there were a thousand of my red and green warrior friends whom i knew would face eternal damnation gladly for my sake  like tars tarkas where i led they would follow  my only danger lay in that should i ever escape the black pirates it might be to fall into the hands of unfriendly red or green men  then it would mean short shrift for me  well there seemed little to worry about on that score for the likelihood of my ever escaping the blacks was extremely remote  the girl and i were linked together by a rope which permitted us to move only about three or four feet from each other  when we had entered the compartment we had seated ourselves upon a low bench beneath the porthole  the bench was the only furniture of the room it was of sorapus wood  the floor ceiling and walls were of carborundum aluminum a light impenetrable composition extensively utilized in the construction of martian fighting ships  as i had sat meditating upon the future my eyes had been riveted upon the porthole which was just level with them as i sat  suddenly i looked toward phaidor  she was regarding me with a strange expression i had not before seen upon her face  she was very beautiful then  instantly her white lids veiled her eyes and i thought i discovered a delicate flush tingeing her cheek  evidently she was embarrassed at having been detected in the act of staring at a lesser creature i thought  do you find the study of the lower orders interesting i asked laughing  she looked up again with a nervous but relieved little laugh  oh very she said especially when they have such excellent profiles  it was my turn to flush but i did not  i felt that she was poking fun at me and i admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death and so i laughed with her  do you know where we are going she said  to solve the mystery of the eternal hereafter i imagine i replied  i am going to a worse fate than that she said with a little shudder  what do you mean  i can only guess she replied since no thern damsel of all the millions that have been stolen away by black pirates during the ages they have raided our domains has ever returned to narrate her experiences among them  that they never take a man prisoner lends strength to the belief that the fate of the girls they steal is worse than death  is it not a just retribution i could not help but ask  what do you mean  do not the therns themselves do likewise with the poor creatures who take the voluntary pilgrimage down the river of mystery  was not thuvia for fifteen years a plaything and a slave  is it less than just that you should suffer as you have caused others to suffer  you do not understand she replied  we therns are a holy race  it is an honour to a lesser creature to be a slave among us  did we not occasionally save a few of the lower orders that stupidly float down an unknown river to an unknown end all would become the prey of the plant men and the apes  but do you not by every means encourage the superstition among those of the outside world i argued  that is the wickedest of your deeds can you tell me why you foster the cruel deception  all life on barsoom she said is created solely for the support of the race of therns  how else could we live did the outer world not furnish our labour and our food  think you that a thern would demean himself by labour  it is true then that you eat human flesh i asked in horror  she looked at me in pitying commiseration for my ignorance  truly we eat the flesh of the lower orders  do not you also  the flesh of beasts yes i replied but not the flesh of man  as man may eat of the flesh of beasts so may gods eat of the flesh of man  the holy therns are the gods of barsoom  i was disgusted and i imagine that i showed it  you are an unbeliever now she continued gently but should we be fortunate enough to escape the clutches of the black pirates and come again to the court of matai shang i think that we shall find an argument to convince you of the error of your ways  and she hesitated perhaps we shall find a way to keep you asasone of us  again her eyes dropped to the floor and a faint colour suffused her cheek  i could not understand her meaning nor did i for a long time dejah thoris was wont to say that in some things i was a veritable simpleton and i guess that she was right  i fear that i would ill requite your fathers hospitality i answered since the first thing that i should do were i a thern would be to set an armed guard at the mouth of the river iss to escort the poor deluded voyagers back to the outer world  also should i devote my life to the extermination of the hideous plant men and their horrible companions the great white apes  she looked at me really horror struck  no no she cried you must not say such terribly sacrilegious thingsyou must not even think them  should they ever guess that you entertained such frightful thoughts should we chance to regain the temples of the therns they would mete out a frightful death to you not even mymy  again she flushed and started over  not even i could save you  i said no more  evidently it was useless  she was even more steeped in superstition than the martians of the outer world  they only worshipped a beautiful hope for a life of love and peace and happiness in the hereafter  the therns worshipped the hideous plant men and the apes or at least they reverenced them as the abodes of the departed spirits of their own dead  at this point the door of our prison opened to admit xodar  he smiled pleasantly at me and when he smiled his expression was kindlyanything but cruel or vindictive  since you cannot escape under any circumstances he said i cannot see the necessity for keeping you confined below  i will cut your bonds and you may come on deck  you will witness something very interesting and as you never shall return to the outer world it will do no harm to permit you to see it  you will see what no other than the first born and their slaves know the existence ofthe subterranean entrance to the holy land to the real heaven of barsoom  it will be an excellent lesson for this daughter of the therns he added for she shall see the temple of issus and issus perchance shall embrace her  phaidors head went high  what blasphemy is this dog of a pirate she cried  issus would wipe out your entire breed an you ever came within sight of her temple  you have much to learn thern replied xodar with an ugly smile nor do i envy you the manner in which you will learn it  as we came on deck i saw to my surprise that the vessel was passing over a great field of snow and ice  as far as the eye could reach in any direction naught else was visible  there could be but one solution to the mystery  we were above the south polar ice cap  only at the poles of mars is there ice or snow upon the planet  no sign of life appeared below us  evidently we were too far south even for the great furbearing animals which the martians so delight in hunting  xodar was at my side as i stood looking out over the ships rail  what course i asked him  a little west of south he replied  you will see the otz valley directly  we shall skirt it for a few hundred miles  the otz valley i exclaimed but man is not there where lie the domains of the therns from which i but just escaped  yes answered xodar  you crossed this ice field last night in the long chase that you led us  the otz valley lies in a mighty depression at the south pole  it is sunk thousands of feet below the level of the surrounding country like a great round bowl  a hundred miles from its northern boundary rise the otz mountains which circle the inner valley of dor in the exact centre of which lies the lost sea of korus  on the shore of this sea stands the golden temple of issus in the land of the first born  it is there that we are bound  as i looked i commenced to realize why it was that in all the ages only one had escaped from the valley dor  my only wonder was that even the one had been successful  to cross this frozen windswept waste of bleak ice alone and on foot would be impossible  only by air boat could the journey be made i finished aloud  it was thus that one did escape the therns in bygone times but none has ever escaped the first born said xodar with a touch of pride in his voice  we had now reached the southernmost extremity of the great ice barrier it ended abruptly in a sheer wall thousands of feet high at the base of which stretched a level valley broken here and there by low rolling hills and little clumps of forest and with tiny rivers formed by the melting of the ice barrier at its base  once we passed far above what seemed to be a deep canyonlike rift stretching from the ice wall on the north across the valley as far as the eye could reach  that is the bed of the river iss said xodar it runs far beneath the ice field and below the level of the valley otz but its canyon is open here  presently i descried what i took to be a village and pointing it out to xodar asked him what it might be  it is a village of lost souls he answered laughing  this strip between the ice barrier and the mountains is considered neutral ground some turn off from their voluntary pilgrimage down the iss and scaling the awful walls of its canyon below us stop in the valley also a slave now and then escapes from the therns and makes his way hither  they do not attempt to recapture such since there is no escape from this outer valley and as a matter of fact they fear the patrolling cruisers of the first born too much to venture from their own domains  the poor creatures of this outer valley are not molested by us since they have nothing that we desire nor are they numerically strong enough to give us an interesting fightso we too leave them alone  there are several villages of them but they have increased in numbers but little in many years since they are always warring among themselves  now we swung a little north of west leaving the valley of lost souls and shortly i discerned over our starboard bow what appeared to be a black mountain rising from the desolate waste of ice  it was not high and seemed to have a flat top  xodar had left us to attend to some duty on the vessel and phaidor and i stood alone beside the rail  the girl had not once spoken since we had been brought to the deck  is what he has been telling me true i asked her  in part yes she answered  that about the outer valley is true but what he says of the location of the temple of issus in the centre of his country is false  if it is not false she hesitated  oh it cannot be true it cannot be true  for if it were true then for countless ages have my people gone to torture and ignominious death at the hands of their cruel enemies instead of to the beautiful life eternal that we have been taught to believe issus holds for us  as the lesser barsoomians of the outer world have been lured by you to the terrible valley dor so may it be that the therns themselves have been lured by the first born to an equally horrid fate i suggested it would be a stern and awful retribution phaidor but a just one  i cannot believe it she said  we shall see i answered and then we fell silent again for we were rapidly approaching the black mountains which in some indefinable way seemed linked with the answer to our problem  as we neared the dark truncated cone the vessels speed was diminished until we barely moved  then we topped the crest of the mountain and below us i saw yawning the mouth of a huge circular well the bottom of which was lost in inky blackness  the diameter of this enormous pit was fully a thousand feet  the walls were smooth and appeared to be composed of a black basaltic rock  for a moment the vessel hovered motionless directly above the centre of the gaping void then slowly she began to settle into the black chasm lower and lower she sank until as darkness enveloped us her lights were thrown on and in the dim halo of her own radiance the monster battleship dropped on and on down into what seemed to me must be the very bowels of barsoom  for quite half an hour we descended and then the shaft terminated abruptly in the dome of a mighty subterranean world  below us rose and fell the billows of a buried sea  a phosphorescent radiance illuminated the scene  thousands of ships dotted the bosom of the ocean  little islands rose here and there to support the strange and colourless vegetation of this strange world  slowly and with majestic grace the battleship dropped until she rested on the water  her great propellers had been drawn and housed during our descent of the shaft and in their place had been run out the smaller but more powerful water propellers  as these commenced to revolve the ship took up its journey once more riding the new element as buoyantly and as safely as she had the air  phaidor and i were dumbfounded  neither had either heard or dreamed that such a world existed beneath the surface of barsoom  nearly all the vessels we saw were war craft  there were a few lighters and barges but none of the great merchantmen such as ply the upper air between the cities of the outer world  here is the harbour of the navy of the first born said a voice behind us and turning we saw xodar watching us with an amused smile on his lips  this sea he continued is larger than korus  it receives the waters of the lesser sea above it  to keep it from filling above a certain level we have four great pumping stations that force the oversupply back into the reservoirs far north from which the red men draw the water which irrigates their farm lands  a new light burst on me with this explanation  the red men had always considered it a miracle that caused great columns of water to spurt from the solid rock of their reservoir sides to increase the supply of the precious liquid which is so scarce in the outer world of mars  never had their learned men been able to fathom the secret of the source of this enormous volume of water  as ages passed they had simply come to accept it as a matter of course and ceased to question its origin  we passed several islands on which were strangely shaped circular buildings apparently roofless and pierced midway between the ground and their tops with small heavily barred windows  they bore the earmarks of prisons which were further accentuated by the armed guards who squatted on low benches without or patrolled the short beach lines  few of these islets contained over an acre of ground but presently we sighted a much larger one directly ahead  this proved to be our destination and the great ship was soon made fast against the steep shore  xodar signalled us to follow him and with a halfdozen officers and men we left the battleship and approached a large oval structure a couple of hundred yards from the shore  you shall soon see issus said xodar to phaidor  the few prisoners we take are presented to her  occasionally she selects slaves from among them to replenish the ranks of her handmaidens  none serves issus above a single year and there was a grim smile on the blacks lips that lent a cruel and sinister meaning to his simple statement  phaidor though loath to believe that issus was allied to such as these had commenced to entertain doubts and fears  she clung very closely to me no longer the proud daughter of the master of life and death upon barsoom but a young and frightened girl in the power of relentless enemies  the building which we now entered was entirely roofless  in its centre was a long tank of water set below the level of the floor like the swimming pool of a natatorium  near one side of the pool floated an oddlooking black object  whether it were some strange monster of these buried waters or a queer raft i could not at once perceive  we were soon to know however for as we reached the edge of the pool directly above the thing xodar cried out a few words in a strange tongue  immediately a hatch cover was raised from the surface of the object and a black seaman sprang from the bowels of the strange craft  xodar addressed the seaman  transmit to your officer he said the commands of dator xodar  say to him that dator xodar with officers and men escorting two prisoners would be transported to the gardens of issus beside the golden temple  blessed be the shell of thy first ancestor most noble dator replied the man  it shall be done even as thou sayest and raising both hands palms backward above his head after the manner of salute which is common to all races of barsoom he disappeared once more into the entrails of his ship  a moment later an officer resplendent in the gorgeous trappings of his rank appeared on deck and welcomed xodar to the vessel and in the latters wake we filed aboard and below  the cabin in which we found ourselves extended entirely across the ship having portholes on either side below the water line  no sooner were all below than a number of commands were given in accordance with which the hatch was closed and secured and the vessel commenced to vibrate to the rhythmic purr of its machinery  where can we be going in such a tiny pool of water asked phaidor  not up i replied for i noticed particularly that while the building is roofless it is covered with a strong metal grating  then where she asked again  from the appearance of the craft i judge we are going down i replied  phaidor shuddered  for such long ages have the waters of barsooms seas been a thing of tradition only that even this daughter of the therns born as she had been within sight of mars only remaining sea had the same terror of deep water as is a common attribute of all martians  presently the sensation of sinking became very apparent  we were going down swiftly  now we could hear the water rushing past the portholes and in the dim light that filtered through them to the water beyond the swirling eddies were plainly visible  phaidor grasped my arm  save me she whispered  save me and your every wish shall be granted  anything within the power of the holy therns to give will be yours  phaidor she stumbled a little here and then in a very low voice phaidor already is yours  i felt very sorry for the poor child and placed my hand over hers where it rested on my arm  i presume my motive was misunderstood for with a swift glance about the apartment to assure herself that we were alone she threw both her arms about my neck and dragged my face down to hers     chapter ix  issus goddess of life eternal   the confession of love which the girls fright had wrung from her touched me deeply but it humiliated me as well since i felt that in some thoughtless word or act i had given her reason to believe that i reciprocated her affection  never have i been much of a ladies man being more concerned with fighting and kindred arts which have ever seemed to me more befitting a man than mooning over a scented glove four sizes too small for him or kissing a dead flower that has begun to smell like a cabbage  so i was quite at a loss as to what to do or say  a thousand times rather face the wild hordes of the dead sea bottoms than meet the eyes of this beautiful young girl and tell her the thing that i must tell her  but there was nothing else to be done and so i did it  very clumsily too i fear  gently i unclasped her hands from about my neck and still holding them in mine i told her the story of my love for dejah thoris  that of all the women of two worlds that i had known and admired during my long life she alone had i loved  the tale did not seem to please her  like a tigress she sprang panting to her feet  her beautiful face was distorted in an expression of horrible malevolence  her eyes fairly blazed into mine  dog she hissed  dog of a blasphemer  think you that phaidor daughter of matai shang supplicates  she commands  what to her is your puny outer world passion for the vile creature you chose in your other life  phaidor has glorified you with her love and you have spurned her ten thousand unthinkably atrocious deaths could not atone for the affront that you have put upon me  the thing that you call dejah thoris shall die the most horrible of them all  you have sealed the warrant for her doom  and you  you shall be the meanest slave in the service of the goddess you have attempted to humiliate  tortures and ignominies shall be heaped upon you until you grovel at my feet asking the boon of death  in my gracious generosity i shall at length grant your prayer and from the high balcony of the golden cliffs i shall watch the great white apes tear you asunder  she had it all fixed up  the whole lovely programme from start to finish  it amazed me to think that one so divinely beautiful could at the same time be so fiendishly vindictive  it occurred to me however that she had overlooked one little factor in her revenge and so without any intent to add to her discomfiture but rather to permit her to rearrange her plans along more practical lines i pointed to the nearest porthole  evidently she had entirely forgotten her surroundings and her present circumstances for a single glance at the dark swirling waters without sent her crumpled upon a low bench where with her face buried in her arms she sobbed more like a very unhappy little girl than a proud and allpowerful goddess  down down we continued to sink until the heavy glass of the portholes became noticeably warm from the heat of the water without  evidently we were very far beneath the surface crust of mars  presently our downward motion ceased and i could hear the propellers swirling through the water at our stern and forcing us ahead at high speed  it was very dark down there but the light from our portholes and the reflection from what must have been a powerful searchlight on the submarines nose showed that we were forging through a narrow passage rocklined and tubelike  after a few minutes the propellers ceased their whirring  we came to a full stop and then commenced to rise swiftly toward the surface  soon the light from without increased and we came to a stop  xodar entered the cabin with his men  come he said and we followed him through the hatchway which had been opened by one of the seamen  we found ourselves in a small subterranean vault in the centre of which was the pool in which lay our submarine floating as we had first seen her with only her black back showing  around the edge of the pool was a level platform and then the walls of the cave rose perpendicularly for a few feet to arch toward the centre of the low roof  the walls about the ledge were pierced with a number of entrances to dimly lighted passageways  toward one of these our captors led us and after a short walk halted before a steel cage which lay at the bottom of a shaft rising above us as far as one could see  the cage proved to be one of the common types of elevator cars that i had seen in other parts of barsoom  they are operated by means of enormous magnets which are suspended at the top of the shaft  by an electrical device the volume of magnetism generated is regulated and the speed of the car varied  in long stretches they move at a sickening speed especially on the upward trip since the small force of gravity inherent to mars results in very little opposition to the powerful force above  scarcely had the door of the car closed behind us than we were slowing up to stop at the landing above so rapid was our ascent of the long shaft  when we emerged from the little building which houses the upper terminus of the elevator we found ourselves in the midst of a veritable fairyland of beauty  the combined languages of earth men hold no words to convey to the mind the gorgeous beauties of the scene  one may speak of scarlet sward and ivorystemmed trees decked with brilliant purple blooms of winding walks paved with crushed rubies with emerald with turquoise even with diamonds themselves of a magnificent temple of burnished gold handwrought with marvellous designs but where are the words to describe the glorious colours that are unknown to earthly eyes where the mind or the imagination that can grasp the gorgeous scintillations of unheardof rays as they emanate from the thousand nameless jewels of barsoom  even my eyes for long years accustomed to the barbaric splendours of a martian jeddaks court were amazed at the glory of the scene  phaidors eyes were wide in amazement  the temple of issus she whispered half to herself  xodar watched us with his grim smile partly of amusement and partly malicious gloating  the gardens swarmed with brilliantly trapped black men and women among them moved red and white females serving their every want  the places of the outer world and the temples of the therns had been robbed of their princesses and goddesses that the blacks might have their slaves  through this scene we moved toward the temple  at the main entrance we were halted by a cordon of armed guards  xodar spoke a few words to an officer who came forward to question us  together they entered the temple where they remained for some time  when they returned it was to announce that issus desired to look upon the daughter of matai shang and the strange creature from another world who had been a prince of helium  slowly we moved through endless corridors of unthinkable beauty through magnificent apartments and noble halls  at length we were halted in a spacious chamber in the centre of the temple  one of the officers who had accompanied us advanced to a large door in the further end of the chamber  here he must have made some sort of signal for immediately the door opened and another richly trapped courtier emerged  we were then led up to the door where we were directed to get down on our hands and knees with our backs toward the room we were to enter the doors were swung open and after being cautioned not to turn our heads under penalty of instant death we were commanded to back into the presence of issus  never have i been in so humiliating a position in my life and only my love for dejah thoris and the hope which still clung to me that i might again see her kept me from rising to face the goddess of the first born and go down to my death like a gentleman facing my foes and with their blood mingling with mine  after we had crawled in this disgusting fashion for a matter of a couple of hundred feet we were halted by our escort  let them rise said a voice behind us a thin wavering voice yet one that had evidently been accustomed to command for many years  rise said our escort but do not face toward issus  the woman pleases me said the thin wavering voice again after a few moments of silence  she shall serve me the allotted time  the man you may return to the isle of shador which lies against the northern shore of the sea of omean  let the woman turn and look upon issus knowing that those of the lower orders who gaze upon the holy vision of her radiant face survive the blinding glory but a single year  i watched phaidor from the corner of my eye  she paled to a ghastly hue  slowly very slowly she turned as though drawn by some invisible yet irresistible force  she was standing quite close to me so close that her bare arm touched mine as she finally faced issus goddess of life eternal  i could not see the girls face as her eyes rested for the first time on the supreme deity of mars but felt the shudder that ran through her in the trembling flesh of the arm that touched mine  it must be dazzling loveliness indeed thought i to cause such emotion in the breast of so radiant a beauty as phaidor daughter of matai shang  let the woman remain  remove the man  go  thus spoke issus and the heavy hand of the officer fell upon my shoulder  in accordance with his instructions i dropped to my hands and knees once more and crawled from the presence  it had been my first audience with deity but i am free to confess that i was not greatly impressedother than with the ridiculous figure i cut scrambling about on my marrow bones  once without the chamber the doors closed behind us and i was bid to rise  xodar joined me and together we slowly retraced our steps toward the gardens  you spared my life when you easily might have taken it he said after we had proceeded some little way in silence and i would aid you if i might  i can help to make your life here more bearable but your fate is inevitable  you may never hope to return to the outer world  what will be my fate i asked  that will depend largely upon issus  so long as she does not send for you and reveal her face to you you may live on for years in as mild a form of bondage as i can arrange for you  why should she send for me i asked  the men of the lower orders she often uses for various purposes of amusement  such a fighter as you for example would render fine sport in the monthly rites of the temple  there are men pitted against men and against beasts for the edification of issus and the replenishment of her larder  she eats human flesh i asked  not in horror however for since my recently acquired knowledge of the holy therns i was prepared for anything in this still less accessible heaven where all was evidently dictated by a single omnipotence where ages of narrow fanaticism and selfworship had eradicated all the broader humanitarian instincts that the race might once have possessed  they were a people drunk with power and success looking upon the other inhabitants of mars as we look upon the beasts of the field and the forest  why then should they not eat of the flesh of the lower orders whose lives and characters they no more understood than do we the inmost thoughts and sensibilities of the cattle we slaughter for our earthly tables  she eats only the flesh of the best bred of the holy therns and the red barsoomians  the flesh of the others goes to our boards  the animals are eaten by the slaves  she also eats other dainties  i did not understand then that there lay any special significance in his reference to other dainties  i thought the limit of ghoulishness already had been reached in the recitation of issus menu  i still had much to learn as to the depths of cruelty and bestiality to which omnipotence may drag its possessor  we had about reached the last of the many chambers and corridors which led to the gardens when an officer overtook us  issus would look again upon this man he said  the girl has told her that he is of wondrous beauty and of such prowess that alone he slew seven of the first born and with his bare hands took xodar captive binding him with his own harness  xodar looked uncomfortable  evidently he did not relish the thought that issus had learned of his inglorious defeat  without a word he turned and we followed the officer once again to the closed doors before the audience chamber of issus goddess of life eternal  here the ceremony of entrance was repeated  again issus bid me rise for several minutes all was silent as the tomb  the eyes of deity were appraising me  presently the thin wavering voice broke the stillness repeating in a singsong drone the words which for countless ages had sealed the doom of numberless victims  let the man turn and look upon issus knowing that those of the lower orders who gaze upon the holy vision of her radiant face survive the blinding glory but a single year  i turned as i had been bid expecting such a treat as only the revealment of divine glory to mortal eyes might produce  what i saw was a solid phalanx of armed men between myself and a dais supporting a great bench of carved sorapus wood  on this bench or throne squatted a female black  she was evidently very old  not a hair remained upon her wrinkled skull  with the exception of two yellow fangs she was entirely toothless  on either side of her thin hawklike nose her eyes burned from the depths of horribly sunken sockets  the skin of her face was seamed and creased with a million deepcut furrows  her body was as wrinkled as her face and as repulsive  emaciated arms and legs attached to a torso which seemed to be mostly distorted abdomen completed the holy vision of her radiant beauty  surrounding her were a number of female slaves among them phaidor white and trembling  this is the man who slew seven of the first born and barehanded bound dator xodar with his own harness asked issus  most glorious vision of divine loveliness it is replied the officer who stood at my side  produce dator xodar she commanded  xodar was brought from the adjoining room  issus glared at him a baleful light in her hideous eyes  and such as you are a dator of the first born she squealed  for the disgrace you have brought upon the immortal race you shall be degraded to a rank below the lowest  no longer be you a dator but for evermore a slave of slaves to fetch and carry for the lower orders that serve in the gardens of issus  remove his harness  cowards and slaves wear no trappings  xodar stood stiffly erect  not a muscle twitched nor a tremor shook his giant frame as a soldier of the guard roughly stripped his gorgeous trappings from him  begone screamed the infuriated little old woman  begone but instead of the light of the gardens of issus let you serve as a slave of this slave who conquered you in the prison on the isle of shador in the sea of omean  take him away out of the sight of my divine eyes  slowly and with high held head the proud xodar turned and stalked from the chamber  issus rose and turned to leave the room by another exit  turning to me she said you shall be returned to shador for the present  later issus will see the manner of your fighting  go then she disappeared followed by her retinue  only phaidor lagged behind and as i started to follow my guard toward the gardens the girl came running after me  oh do not leave me in this terrible place she begged  forgive the things i said to you my prince  i did not mean them  only take me away with you  let me share your imprisonment on shador her words were an almost incoherent volley of thoughts so rapidly she spoke you did not understand the honour that i did you  among the therns there is no marriage or giving in marriage as among the lower orders of the outer world  we might have lived together for ever in love and happiness  we have both looked upon issus and in a year we die  let us live that year at least together in what measure of joy remains for the doomed  if it was difficult for me to understand you phaidor i replied can you not understand that possibly it is equally difficult for you to understand the motives the customs and the social laws that guide me  i do not wish to hurt you nor to seem to undervalue the honour which you have done me but the thing you desire may not be regardless of the foolish belief of the peoples of the outer world or of holy thern or ebon first born i am not dead  while i live my heart beats for but one womanthe incomparable dejah thoris princess of helium  when death overtakes me my heart shall have ceased to beat but what comes after that i know not  and in that i am as wise as matai shang master of life and death upon barsoom or issus goddess of life eternal  phaidor stood looking at me intently for a moment  no anger showed in her eyes this time only a pathetic expression of hopeless sorrow  i do not understand she said and turning walked slowly in the direction of the door through which issus and her retinue had passed a moment later she had passed from my sight     chapter x  the prison isle of shador   in the outer gardens to which the guard now escorted me i found xodar surrounded by a crowd of noble blacks  they were reviling and cursing him  the men slapped his face  the women spat upon him  when i appeared they turned their attentions toward me  ah cried one so this is the creature who overcame the great xodar barehanded  let us see how it was done  let him bind thurid suggested a beautiful woman laughing  thurid is a noble dator  let thurid show the dog what it means to face a real man  yes thurid  thurid cried a dozen voices  here he is now exclaimed another and turning in the direction indicated i saw a huge black weighed down with resplendent ornaments and arms advancing with noble and gallant bearing toward us  what now he cried  what would you of thurid  quickly a dozen voices explained  thurid turned toward xodar his eyes narrowing to two nasty slits  calot he hissed  ever did i think you carried the heart of a sorak in your putrid breast  often have you bested me in the secret councils of issus but now in the field of war where men are truly gauged your scabby heart hath revealed its sores to all the world  calot i spurn you with my foot and with the words he turned to kick xodar  my blood was up  for minutes it had been boiling at the cowardly treatment they had been according this once powerful comrade because he had fallen from the favour of issus  i had no love for xodar but i cannot stand the sight of cowardly injustice and persecution without seeing red as through a haze of bloody mist and doing things on the impulse of the moment that i presume i never should do after mature deliberation  i was standing close beside xodar as thurid swung his foot for the cowardly kick  the degraded dator stood erect and motionless as a carven image  he was prepared to take whatever his former comrades had to offer in the way of insults and reproaches and take them in manly silence and stoicism  but as thurids foot swung so did mine and i caught him a painful blow upon the shin bone that saved xodar from this added ignominy  for a moment there was tense silence then thurid with a roar of rage sprang for my throat just as xodar had upon the deck of the cruiser the results were identical  i ducked beneath his outstretched arms and as he lunged past me planted a terrific right on the side of his jaw  the big fellow spun around like a top his knees gave beneath him and he crumpled to the ground at my feet  the blacks gazed in astonishment first at the still form of the proud dator lying there in the ruby dust of the pathway then at me as though they could not believe that such a thing could be  you asked me to bind thurid i cried behold  and then i stooped beside the prostrate form tore the harness from it and bound the fellows arms and legs securely  as you have done to xodar now do you likewise to thurid  take him before issus bound in his own harness that she may see with her own eyes that there be one among you now who is greater than the first born  who are you whispered the woman who had first suggested that i attempt to bind thurid  i am a citizen of two worlds captain john carter of virginia prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium  take this man to your goddess as i have said and tell her too that as i have done to xodar and thurid so also can i do to the mightiest of her dators with naked hands with longsword or with shortsword i challenge the flower of her fightingmen to combat  come said the officer who was guarding me back to shador my orders are imperative there is to be no delay  xodar come you also  there was little of disrespect in the tone that the man used in addressing either xodar or myself  it was evident that he felt less contempt for the former dator since he had witnessed the ease with which i disposed of the powerful thurid  that his respect for me was greater than it should have been for a slave was quite apparent from the fact that during the balance of the return journey he walked or stood always behind me a drawn shortsword in his hand  the return to the sea of omean was uneventful  we dropped down the awful shaft in the same car that had brought us to the surface  there we entered the submarine taking the long dive to the tunnel far beneath the upper world  then through the tunnel and up again to the pool from which we had had our first introduction to the wonderful passageway from omean to the temple of issus  from the island of the submarine we were transported on a small cruiser to the distant isle of shador  here we found a small stone prison and a guard of half a dozen blacks  there was no ceremony wasted in completing our incarceration  one of the blacks opened the door of the prison with a huge key we walked in the door closed behind us the lock grated and with the sound there swept over me again that terrible feeling of hopelessness that i had felt in the chamber of mystery in the golden cliffs beneath the gardens of the holy therns  then tars tarkas had been with me but now i was utterly alone in so far as friendly companionship was concerned  i fell to wondering about the fate of the great thark and of his beautiful companion the girl thuvia  even should they by some miracle have escaped and been received and spared by a friendly nation what hope had i of the succour which i knew they would gladly extend if it lay in their power  they could not guess my whereabouts or my fate for none on all barsoom even dream of such a place as this  nor would it have advantaged me any had they known the exact location of my prison for who could hope to penetrate to this buried sea in the face of the mighty navy of the first born  no my case was hopeless  well i would make the best of it and rising i swept aside the brooding despair that had been endeavouring to claim me  with the idea of exploring my prison i started to look around  xodar sat with bowed head upon a low stone bench near the centre of the room in which we were  he had not spoken since issus had degraded him  the building was roofless the walls rising to a height of about thirty feet  halfway up were a couple of small heavily barred windows  the prison was divided into several rooms by partitions twenty feet high there was no one in the room which we occupied but two doors which led to other rooms were opened  i entered one of these rooms but found it vacant  thus i continued through several of the chambers until in the last one i found a young red martian boy sleeping upon the stone bench which constituted the only furniture of any of the prison cells  evidently he was the only other prisoner  as he slept i leaned over and looked at him  there was something strangely familiar about his face and yet i could not place him  his features were very regular and like the proportions of his graceful limbs and body beautiful in the extreme  he was very light in colour for a red man but in other respects he seemed a typical specimen of this handsome race  i did not awaken him for sleep in prison is such a priceless boon that i have seen men transformed into raging brutes when robbed by one of their fellowprisoners of a few precious moments of it  returning to my own cell i found xodar still sitting in the same position in which i had left him  man i cried it will profit you nothing to mope thus  it were no disgrace to be bested by john carter  you have seen that in the ease with which i accounted for thurid  you knew it before when on the cruisers deck you saw me slay three of your comrades  i would that you had dispatched me at the same time he said  come come i cried  there is hope yet  neither of us is dead  we are great fighters  why not win to freedom  he looked at me in amazement  you know not of what you speak he replied  issus is omnipotent issus is omniscient she hears now the words you speak  she knows the thoughts you think  it is sacrilege even to dream of breaking her commands  rot xodar i ejaculated impatiently  he sprang to his feet in horror  the curse of issus will fall upon you he cried  in another instant you will be smitten down writhing to your death in horrible agony  do you believe that xodar i asked  of course who would dare doubt  i doubt yes and further i deny i said  why xodar you tell me that she even knows my thoughts  the red men have all had that power for ages  and another wonderful power  they can shut their minds so that none may read their thoughts  i learned the first secret years ago the other i never had to learn since upon all barsoom is none who can read what passes in the secret chambers of my brain  your goddess cannot read my thoughts nor can she read yours when you are out of sight unless you will it  had she been able to read mine i am afraid that her pride would have suffered a rather severe shock when i turned at her command to gaze upon the holy vision of her radiant face  what do you mean he whispered in an affrighted voice so low that i could scarcely hear him  i mean that i thought her the most repulsive and vilely hideous creature my eyes ever had rested upon  for a moment he eyed me in horrorstricken amazement and then with a cry of blasphemer he sprang upon me  i did not wish to strike him again nor was it necessary since he was unarmed and therefore quite harmless to me  as he came i grasped his left wrist with my left hand and swinging my right arm about his left shoulder caught him beneath the chin with my elbow and bore him backward across my thigh  there he hung helpless for a moment glaring up at me in impotent rage  xodar i said let us be friends  for a year possibly we may be forced to live together in the narrow confines of this tiny room  i am sorry to have offended you but i could not dream that one who had suffered from the cruel injustice of issus still could believe her divine  i will say a few more words xodar with no intent to wound your feelings further but rather that you may give thought to the fact that while we live we are still more the arbiters of our own fate than is any god  issus you see has not struck me dead nor is she rescuing her faithful xodar from the clutches of the unbeliever who defamed her fair beauty  no xodar your issus is a mortal old woman  once out of her clutches and she cannot harm you  with your knowledge of this strange land and my knowledge of the outer world two such fightingmen as you and i should be able to win our way to freedom  even though we died in the attempt would not our memories be fairer than as though we remained in servile fear to be butchered by a cruel and unjust tyrantcall her goddess or mortal as you will  as i finished i raised xodar to his feet and released him  he did not renew the attack upon me nor did he speak  instead he walked toward the bench and sinking down upon it remained lost in deep thought for hours  a long time afterward i heard a soft sound at the doorway leading to one of the other apartments and looking up beheld the red martian youth gazing intently at us  kaor i cried after the red martian manner of greeting  kaor he replied  what do you here  i await my death i presume i replied with a wry smile  he too smiled a brave and winning smile  i also he said  mine will come soon  i looked upon the radiant beauty of issus nearly a year since  it has always been a source of keen wonder to me that i did not drop dead at the first sight of that hideous countenance  and her belly  by my first ancestor but never was there so grotesque a figure in all the universe  that they should call such a one goddess of life eternal goddess of death mother of the nearer moon and fifty other equally impossible titles is quite beyond me  how came you here i asked  it is very simple  i was flying a oneman air scout far to the south when the brilliant idea occurred to me that i should like to search for the lost sea of korus which tradition places near to the south pole  i must have inherited from my father a wild lust for adventure as well as a hollow where my bump of reverence should be  i had reached the area of eternal ice when my port propeller jammed and i dropped to the ground to make repairs  before i knew it the air was black with fliers and a hundred of these first born devils were leaping to the ground all about me  with drawn swords they made for me but before i went down beneath them they had tasted of the steel of my fathers sword and i had given such an account of myself as i know would have pleased my sire had he lived to witness it  your father is dead i asked  he died before the shell broke to let me step out into a world that has been very good to me  but for the sorrow that i had never the honour to know my father i have been very happy  my only sorrow now is that my mother must mourn me as she has for ten long years mourned my father  who was your father i asked  he was about to reply when the outer door of our prison opened and a burly guard entered and ordered him to his own quarters for the night locking the door after him as he passed through into the further chamber  it is issus wish that you two be confined in the same room said the guard when he had returned to our cell  this cowardly slave of a slave is to serve you well he said to me indicating xodar with a wave of his hand  if he does not you are to beat him into submission  it is issus wish that you heap upon him every indignity and degradation of which you can conceive  with these words he left us  xodar still sat with his face buried in his hands  i walked to his side and placed my hand upon his shoulder  xodar i said you have heard the commands of issus but you need not fear that i shall attempt to put them into execution  you are a brave man xodar  it is your own affair if you wish to be persecuted and humiliated but were i you i should assert my manhood and defy my enemies  i have been thinking very hard john carter he said of all the new ideas you gave me a few hours since  little by little i have been piecing together the things that you said which sounded blasphemous to me then with the things that i have seen in my past life and dared not even think about for fear of bringing down upon me the wrath of issus  i believe now that she is a fraud no more divine than you or i  more i am willing to concedethat the first born are no holier than the holy therns nor the holy therns more holy than the red men  the whole fabric of our religion is based on superstitious belief in lies that have been foisted upon us for ages by those directly above us to whose personal profit and aggrandizement it was to have us continue to believe as they wished us to believe  i am ready to cast off the ties that have bound me  i am ready to defy issus herself but what will it avail us  be the first born gods or mortals they are a powerful race and we are as fast in their clutches as though we were already dead  there is no escape  i have escaped from bad plights in the past my friend i replied nor while life is in me shall i despair of escaping from the isle of shador and the sea of omean  but we cannot escape even from the four walls of our prison urged xodar  test this flintlike surface he cried smiting the solid rock that confined us  and look upon this polished surface none could cling to it to reach the top  i smiled  that is the least of our troubles xodar i replied  i will guarantee to scale the wall and take you with me if you will help with your knowledge of the customs here to appoint the best time for the attempt and guide me to the shaft that lets from the dome of this abysmal sea to the light of gods pure air above  night time is the best and offers the only slender chance we have for then men sleep and only a dozing watch nods in the tops of the battleships  no watch is kept upon the cruisers and smaller craft the watchers upon the larger vessels see to all about them  it is night now  but i exclaimed it is not dark  how can it be night then  he smiled  you forget he said that we are far below ground  the light of the sun never penetrates here  there are no moons and no stars reflected in the bosom of omean  the phosphorescent light you now see pervading this great subterranean vault emanates from the rocks that form its dome it is always thus upon omean just as the billows are always as you see themrolling ever rolling over a windless sea  at the appointed hour of night upon the world above the men whose duties hold them here sleep but the light is ever the same  it will make escape more difficult i said and then i shrugged my shoulders for what pray is the pleasure of doing an easy thing  let us sleep on it tonight said xodar  a plan may come with our awakening  so we threw ourselves upon the hard stone floor of our prison and slept the sleep of tired men     chapter xi  when hell broke loose   early the next morning xodar and i commenced work upon our plans for escape  first i had him sketch upon the stone floor of our cell as accurate a map of the south polar regions as was possible with the crude instruments at our disposala buckle from my harness and the sharp edge of the wondrous gem i had taken from sator throg  from this i computed the general direction of helium and the distance at which it lay from the opening which led to omean  then i had him draw a map of omean indicating plainly the position of shador and of the opening in the dome which led to the outer world  these i studied until they were indelibly imprinted in my memory  from xodar i learned the duties and customs of the guards who patrolled shador  it seemed that during the hours set aside for sleep only one man was on duty at a time  he paced a beat that passed around the prison at a distance of about a hundred feet from the building  the pace of the sentries xodar said was very slow requiring nearly ten minutes to make a single round  this meant that for practically five minutes at a time each side of the prison was unguarded as the sentry pursued his snaillike pace upon the opposite side  this information you ask said xodar will be all very valuable after we get out but nothing that you have asked has any bearing on that first and most important consideration  we will get out all right i replied laughing  leave that to me  when shall we make the attempt he asked  the first night that finds a small craft moored near the shore of shador i replied  but how will you know that any craft is moored near shador  the windows are far beyond our reach  not so friend xodar look  with a bound i sprang to the bars of the window opposite us and took a quick survey of the scene without  several small craft and two large battleships lay within a hundred yards of shador  tonight i thought and was just about to voice my decision to xodar when without warning the door of our prison opened and a guard stepped in  if the fellow saw me there our chances of escape might quickly go glimmering for i knew that they would put me in irons if they had the slightest conception of the wonderful agility which my earthly muscles gave me upon mars  the man had entered and was standing facing the centre of the room so that his back was toward me  five feet above me was the top of a partition wall separating our cell from the next  there was my only chance to escape detection  if the fellow turned i was lost nor could i have dropped to the floor undetected since he was no nearly below me that i would have struck him had i done so  where is the white man cried the guard of xodar  issus commands his presence  he started to turn to see if i were in another part of the cell  i scrambled up the iron grating of the window until i could catch a good footing on the sill with one foot then i let go my hold and sprang for the partition top  what was that i heard the deep voice of the black bellow as my metal grated against the stone wall as i slipped over  then i dropped lightly to the floor of the cell beyond  where is the white slave again cried the guard  i know not replied xodar  he was here even as you entered  i am not his keepergo find him  the black grumbled something that i could not understand and then i heard him unlocking the door into one of the other cells on the further side  listening intently i caught the sound as the door closed behind him  then i sprang once more to the top of the partition and dropped into my own cell beside the astonished xodar  do you see now how we will escape i asked him in a whisper  i see how you may he replied but i am no wiser than before as to how i am to pass these walls  certain it is that i cannot bounce over them as you do  we heard the guard moving about from cell to cell and finally his rounds completed he again entered ours  when his eyes fell upon me they fairly bulged from his head  by the shell of my first ancestor he roared  where have you been  i have been in prison since you put me here yesterday i answered i was in this room when you entered  you had better look to your eyesight  he glared at me in mingled rage and relief  come he said  issus commands your presence  he conducted me outside the prison leaving xodar behind  there we found several other guards and with them the red martian youth who occupied another cell upon shador  the journey i had taken to the temple of issus on the preceding day was repeated  the guards kept the red boy and myself separated so that we had no opportunity to continue the conversation that had been interrupted the previous night  the youths face had haunted me  where had i seen him before  there was something strangely familiar in every line of him in his carriage his manner of speaking his gestures  i could have sworn that i knew him and yet i knew too that i had never seen him before  when we reached the gardens of issus we were led away from the temple instead of toward it  the way wound through enchanted parks to a mighty wall that towered a hundred feet in air  massive gates gave egress upon a small plain surrounded by the same gorgeous forests that i had seen at the foot of the golden cliffs  crowds of blacks were strolling in the same direction that our guards were leading us and with them mingled my old friends the plant men and great white apes  the brutal beasts moved among the crowd as pet dogs might  if they were in the way the blacks pushed them roughly to one side or whacked them with the flat of a sword and the animals slunk away as in great fear  presently we came upon our destination a great amphitheatre situated at the further edge of the plain and about half a mile beyond the garden walls  through a massive arched gateway the blacks poured in to take their seats while our guards led us to a smaller entrance near one end of the structure  through this we passed into an enclosure beneath the seats where we found a number of other prisoners herded together under guard  some of them were in irons but for the most part they seemed sufficiently awed by the presence of their guards to preclude any possibility of attempted escape  during the trip from shador i had had no opportunity to talk with my fellowprisoner but now that we were safely within the barred paddock our guards abated their watchfulness with the result that i found myself able to approach the red martian youth for whom i felt such a strange attraction  what is the object of this assembly i asked him  are we to fight for the edification of the first born or is it something worse than that  it is a part of the monthly rites of issus he replied in which black men wash the sins from their souls in the blood of men from the outer world  if perchance the black is killed it is evidence of his disloyalty to issusthe unpardonable sin  if he lives through the contest he is held acquitted of the charge that forced the sentence of the rites as it is called upon him  the forms of combat vary  a number of us may be pitted together against an equal number or twice the number of blacks or singly we may be sent forth to face wild beasts or some famous black warrior  and if we are victorious i asked what thenfreedom  he laughed  freedom forsooth  the only freedom for us death  none who enters the domains of the first born ever leave  if we prove able fighters we are permitted to fight often  if we are not mighty fighters  he shrugged his shoulders  sooner or later we die in the arena  and you have fought often i asked  very often he replied  it is my only pleasure  some hundred black devils have i accounted for during nearly a year of the rites of issus my mother would be very proud could she only know how well i have maintained the traditions of my fathers prowess  your father must have been a mighty warrior i said  i have known most of the warriors of barsoom in my time doubtless i knew him  who was he  my father was  come calots cried the rough voice of a guard  to the slaughter with you and roughly we were hustled to the steep incline that led to the chambers far below which let out upon the arena  the amphitheatre like all i had ever seen upon barsoom was built in a large excavation  only the highest seats which formed the low wall surrounding the pit were above the level of the ground  the arena itself was far below the surface  just beneath the lowest tier of seats was a series of barred cages on a level with the surface of the arena  into these we were herded  but unfortunately my youthful friend was not of those who occupied a cage with me  directly opposite my cage was the throne of issus  here the horrid creature squatted surrounded by a hundred slave maidens sparkling in jewelled trappings  brilliant cloths of many hues and strange patterns formed the soft cushion covering of the dais upon which they reclined about her  on four sides of the throne and several feet below it stood three solid ranks of heavily armed soldiery elbow to elbow  in front of these were the high dignitaries of this mock heavengleaming blacks bedecked with precious stones upon their foreheads the insignia of their rank set in circles of gold  on both sides of the throne stretched a solid mass of humanity from top to bottom of the amphitheatre  there were as many women as men and each was clothed in the wondrously wrought harness of his station and his house  with each black was from one to three slaves drawn from the domains of the therns and from the outer world  the blacks are all noble  there is no peasantry among the first born  even the lowest soldier is a god and has his slaves to wait upon him  the first born do no work  the men fightthat is a sacred privilege and duty to fight and die for issus  the women do nothing absolutely nothing  slaves wash them slaves dress them slaves feed them  there are some even who have slaves that talk for them and i saw one who sat during the rites with closed eyes while a slave narrated to her the events that were transpiring within the arena  the first event of the day was the tribute to issus  it marked the end of those poor unfortunates who had looked upon the divine glory of the goddess a full year before  there were ten of themsplendid beauties from the proud courts of mighty jeddaks and from the temples of the holy therns  for a year they had served in the retinue of issus today they were to pay the price of this divine preferment with their lives tomorrow they would grace the tables of the court functionaries  a huge black entered the arena with the young women  carefully he inspected them felt of their limbs and poked them in the ribs presently he selected one of their number whom he led before the throne of issus  he addressed some words to the goddess which i could not hear  issus nodded her head  the black raised his hands above his head in token of salute grasped the girl by the wrist and dragged her from the arena through a small doorway below the throne  issus will dine well tonight said a prisoner beside me  what do you mean i asked  that was her dinner that old thabis is taking to the kitchens  didst not note how carefully he selected the plumpest and tenderest of the lot  i growled out my curses on the monster sitting opposite us on the gorgeous throne  fume not admonished my companion you will see far worse than that if you live even a month among the first born  i turned again in time to see the gate of a nearby cage thrown open and three monstrous white apes spring into the arena  the girls shrank in a frightened group in the centre of the enclosure  one was on her knees with imploring hands outstretched toward issus but the hideous deity only leaned further forward in keener anticipation of the entertainment to come  at length the apes spied the huddled knot of terrorstricken maidens and with demoniacal shrieks of bestial frenzy charged upon them  a wave of mad fury surged over me  the cruel cowardliness of the powerdrunk creature whose malignant mind conceived such frightful forms of torture stirred to their uttermost depths my resentment and my manhood  the bloodred haze that presaged death to my foes swam before my eyes  the guard lolled before the unbarred gate of the cage which confined me  what need of bars indeed to keep those poor victims from rushing into the arena which the edict of the gods had appointed as their death place  a single blow sent the black unconscious to the ground  snatching up his longsword i sprang into the arena  the apes were almost upon the maidens but a couple of mighty bounds were all my earthly muscles required to carry me to the centre of the sandstrewn floor  for an instant silence reigned in the great amphitheatre then a wild shout arose from the cages of the doomed  my longsword circled whirring through the air and a great ape sprawled headless at the feet of the fainting girls  the other apes turned now upon me and as i stood facing them a sullen roar from the audience answered the wild cheers from the cages  from the tail of my eye i saw a score of guards rushing across the glistening sand toward me  then a figure broke from one of the cages behind them  it was the youth whose personality so fascinated me  he paused a moment before the cages with upraised sword  come men of the outer world he shouted  let us make our deaths worth while and at the back of this unknown warrior turn this days tribute to issus into an orgy of revenge that will echo through the ages and cause black skins to blanch at each repetition of the rites of issus  come  the racks without your cages are filled with blades  without waiting to note the outcome of his plea he turned and bounded toward me  from every cage that harboured red men a thunderous shout went up in answer to his exhortation  the inner guards went down beneath howling mobs and the cages vomited forth their inmates hot with the lust to kill  the racks that stood without were stripped of the swords with which the prisoners were to have been armed to enter their allotted combats and a swarm of determined warriors sped to our support  the great apes towering in all their fifteen feet of height had gone down before my sword while the charging guards were still some distance away  close behind them pursued the youth  at my back were the young girls and as it was in their service that i fought i remained standing there to meet my inevitable death but with the determination to give such an account of myself as would long be remembered in the land of the first born  i noted the marvellous speed of the young red man as he raced after the guards  never had i seen such speed in any martian  his leaps and bounds were little short of those which my earthly muscles had produced to create such awe and respect on the part of the green martians into whose hands i had fallen on that longgone day that had seen my first advent upon mars  the guards had not reached me when he fell upon them from the rear and as they turned thinking from the fierceness of his onslaught that a dozen were attacking them i rushed them from my side  in the rapid fighting that followed i had little chance to note aught else than the movements of my immediate adversaries but now and again i caught a fleeting glimpse of a purring sword and a lightly springing figure of sinewy steel that filled my heart with a strange yearning and a mighty but unaccountable pride  on the handsome face of the boy a grim smile played and ever and anon he threw a taunting challenge to the foes that faced him  in this and other ways his manner of fighting was similar to that which had always marked me on the field of combat  perhaps it was this vague likeness which made me love the boy while the awful havoc that his sword played amongst the blacks filled my soul with a tremendous respect for him  for my part i was fighting as i had fought a thousand times beforenow sidestepping a wicked thrust now stepping quickly in to let my swords point drink deep in a foemans heart before it buried itself in the throat of his companion  we were having a merry time of it we two when a great body of issus own guards were ordered into the arena  on they came with fierce cries while from every side the armed prisoners swarmed upon them  for half an hour it was as though all hell had broken loose  in the walled confines of the arena we fought in an inextricable masshowling cursing bloodstreaked demons and ever the sword of the young red man flashed beside me  slowly and by repeated commands i had succeeded in drawing the prisoners into a rough formation about us so that at last we fought formed into a rude circle in the centre of which were the doomed maids  many had gone down on both sides but by far the greater havoc had been wrought in the ranks of the guards of issus  i could see messengers running swiftly through the audience and as they passed the nobles there unsheathed their swords and sprang into the arena  they were going to annihilate us by force of numbersthat was quite evidently their plan  i caught a glimpse of issus leaning far forward upon her throne her hideous countenance distorted in a horrid grimace of hate and rage in which i thought i could distinguish an expression of fear  it was that face that inspired me to the thing that followed  quickly i ordered fifty of the prisoners to drop back behind us and form a new circle about the maidens  remain and protect them until i return i commanded  then turning to those who formed the outer line i cried down with issus  follow me to the throne we will reap vengeance where vengeance is deserved  the youth at my side was the first to take up the cry of down with issus and then at my back and from all sides rose a hoarse shout to the throne  to the throne  as one man we moved an irresistible fighting mass over the bodies of dead and dying foes toward the gorgeous throne of the martian deity hordes of the doughtiest fightingmen of the first born poured from the audience to check our progress  we mowed them down before us as they had been paper men  to the seats some of you i cried as we approached the arenas barrier wall  ten of us can take the throne for i had seen that issus guards had for the most part entered the fray within the arena  on both sides of me the prisoners broke to left and right for the seats vaulting the low wall with dripping swords lusting for the crowded victims who awaited them  in another moment the entire amphitheatre was filled with the shrieks of the dying and the wounded mingled with the clash of arms and triumphant shouts of the victors  side by side the young red man and i with perhaps a dozen others fought our way to the foot of the throne  the remaining guards reinforced by the high dignitaries and nobles of the first born closed in between us and issus who sat leaning far forward upon her carved sorapus bench now screaming highpitched commands to her following now hurling blighting curses upon those who sought to desecrate her godhood  the frightened slaves about her trembled in wideeyed expectancy knowing not whether to pray for our victory or our defeat  several among them proud daughters no doubt of some of barsooms noblest warriors snatched swords from the hands of the fallen and fell upon the guards of issus but they were soon cut down glorious martyrs to a hopeless cause  the men with us fought well but never since tars tarkas and i fought out that long hot afternoon shoulder to shoulder against the hordes of warhoon in the dead sea bottom before thark had i seen two men fight to such good purpose and with such unconquerable ferocity as the young red man and i fought that day before the throne of issus goddess of death and of life eternal  man by man those who stood between us and the carven sorapus wood bench went down before our blades  others swarmed in to fill the breach but inch by inch foot by foot we won nearer and nearer to our goal  presently a cry went up from a section of the stands near byrise slaves  rise slaves it rose and fell until it swelled to a mighty volume of sound that swept in great billows around the entire amphitheatre  for an instant as though by common assent we ceased our fighting to look for the meaning of this new note nor did it take but a moment to translate its significance  in all parts of the structure the female slaves were falling upon their masters with whatever weapon came first to hand  a dagger snatched from the harness of her mistress was waved aloft by some fair slave its shimmering blade crimson with the lifeblood of its owner swords plucked from the bodies of the dead about them heavy ornaments which could be turned into bludgeonssuch were the implements with which these fair women wreaked the longpent vengeance which at best could but partially recompense them for the unspeakable cruelties and indignities which their black masters had heaped upon them  and those who could find no other weapons used their strong fingers and their gleaming teeth  it was at once a sight to make one shudder and to cheer but in a brief second we were engaged once more in our own battle with only the unquenchable battle cry of the women to remind us that they still foughtrise slaves rise slaves  only a single thin rank of men now stood between us and issus  her face was blue with terror  foam flecked her lips  she seemed too paralysed with fear to move  only the youth and i fought now  the others all had fallen and i was like to have gone down too from a nasty longsword cut had not a hand reached out from behind my adversary and clutched his elbow as the blade was falling upon me  the youth sprang to my side and ran his sword through the fellow before he could recover to deliver another blow  i should have died even then but for that as my sword was tight wedged in the breastbone of a dator of the first born  as the fellow went down i snatched his sword from him and over his prostrate body looked into the eyes of the one whose quick hand had saved me from the first cut of his swordit was phaidor daughter of matai shang  fly my prince she cried  it is useless to fight them longer  all within the arena are dead  all who charged the throne are dead but you and this youth  only among the seats are there left any of your fightingmen and they and the slave women are fast being cut down listen  you can scarce hear the battlecry of the women now for nearly all are dead  for each one of you there are ten thousand blacks within the domains of the first born  break for the open and the sea of korus  with your mighty sword arm you may yet win to the golden cliffs and the templed gardens of the holy therns  there tell your story to matai shang my father  he will keep you and together you may find a way to rescue me  fly while there is yet a bare chance for flight  but that was not my mission nor could i see much to be preferred in the cruel hospitality of the holy therns to that of the first born  down with issus i shouted and together the boy and i took up the fight once more  two blacks went down with our swords in their vitals and we stood face to face with issus  as my sword went up to end her horrid career her paralysis left her and with an earpiercing shriek she turned to flee  directly behind her a black gulf suddenly yawned in the flooring of the dais  she sprang for the opening with the youth and i close at her heels  her scattered guard rallied at her cry and rushed for us  a blow fell upon the head of the youth  he staggered and would have fallen but i caught him in my left arm and turned to face an infuriated mob of religious fanatics crazed by the affront i had put upon their goddess just as issus disappeared into the black depths beneath me     chapter xii  doomed to die   for an instant i stood there before they fell upon me but the first rush of them forced me back a step or two  my foot felt for the floor but found only empty space  i had backed into the pit which had received issus  for a second i toppled there upon the brink  then i too with the boy still tightly clutched in my arms pitched backward into the black abyss  we struck a polished chute the opening above us closed as magically as it had opened and we shot down unharmed into a dimly lighted apartment far below the arena  as i rose to my feet the first thing i saw was the malignant countenance of issus glaring at me through the heavy bars of a grated door at one side of the chamber  rash mortal she shrilled  you shall pay the awful penalty for your blasphemy in this secret cell  here you shall lie alone and in darkness with the carcass of your accomplice festering in its rottenness by your side until crazed by loneliness and hunger you feed upon the crawling maggots that were once a man  that was all  in another instant she was gone and the dim light which had filled the cell faded into cimmerian blackness  pleasant old lady said a voice at my side  who speaks i asked  tis i your companion who has had the honour this day of fighting shoulder to shoulder with the greatest warrior that ever wore metal upon barsoom  i thank god that you are not dead i said  i feared for that nasty cut upon your head  it but stunned me he replied  a mere scratch  maybe it were as well had it been final i said  we seem to be in a pretty fix here with a splendid chance of dying of starvation and thirst  where are we  beneath the arena i replied  we tumbled down the shaft that swallowed issus as she was almost at our mercy  he laughed a low laugh of pleasure and relief and then reaching out through the inky blackness he sought my shoulder and pulled my ear close to his mouth  nothing could be better he whispered  there are secrets within the secrets of issus of which issus herself does not dream  what do you mean  i laboured with the other slaves a year since in the remodelling of these subterranean galleries and at that time we found below these an ancient system of corridors and chambers that had been sealed up for ages  the blacks in charge of the work explored them taking several of us along to do whatever work there might be occasion for  i know the entire system perfectly  there are miles of corridors honeycombing the ground beneath the gardens and the temple itself and there is one passage that leads down to and connects with the lower regions that open on the water shaft that gives passage to omean  if we can reach the submarine undetected we may yet make the sea in which there are many islands where the blacks never go  there we may live for a time and who knows what may transpire to aid us to escape  he had spoken all in a low whisper evidently fearing spying ears even here and so i answered him in the same subdued tone  lead back to shador my friend i whispered  xodar the black is there  we were to attempt our escape together so i cannot desert him  no said the boy one cannot desert a friend  it were better to be recaptured ourselves than that  then he commenced groping his way about the floor of the dark chamber searching for the trap that led to the corridors beneath  at length he summoned me by a low sst and i crept toward the sound of his voice to find him kneeling on the brink of an opening in the floor  there is a drop here of about ten feet he whispered  hang by your hands and you will alight safely on a level floor of soft sand  very quietly i lowered myself from the inky cell above into the inky pit below  so utterly dark was it that we could not see our hands at an inch from our noses  never i think have i known such complete absence of light as existed in the pits of issus  for an instant i hung in mid air  there is a strange sensation connected with an experience of that nature which is quite difficult to describe  when the feet tread empty air and the distance below is shrouded in darkness there is a feeling akin to panic at the thought of releasing the hold and taking the plunge into unknown depths  although the boy had told me that it was but ten feet to the floor below i experienced the same thrills as though i were hanging above a bottomless pit  then i released my hold and droppedfour feet to a soft cushion of sand  the boy followed me  raise me to your shoulders he said and i will replace the trap  this done he took me by the hand leading me very slowly with much feeling about and frequent halts to assure himself that he did not stray into wrong passageways  presently we commenced the descent of a very steep incline  it will not be long he said before we shall have light  at the lower levels we meet the same stratum of phosphorescent rock that illuminates omean  never shall i forget that trip through the pits of issus  while it was devoid of important incidents yet it was filled for me with a strange charm of excitement and adventure which i think must have hinged principally on the unguessable antiquity of these longforgotten corridors  the things which the stygian darkness hid from my objective eye could not have been half so wonderful as the pictures which my imagination wrought as it conjured to life again the ancient peoples of this dying world and set them once more to the labours the intrigues the mysteries and the cruelties which they had practised to make their last stand against the swarming hordes of the dead sea bottoms that had driven them step by step to the uttermost pinnacle of the world where they were now intrenched behind an impenetrable barrier of superstition  in addition to the green men there had been three principal races upon barsoom  the blacks the whites and a race of yellow men  as the waters of the planet dried and the seas receded all other resources dwindled until life upon the planet became a constant battle for survival  the various races had made war upon one another for ages and the three higher types had easily bested the green savages of the water places of the world but now that the receding seas necessitated constant abandonment of their fortified cities and forced upon them a more or less nomadic life in which they became separated into smaller communities they soon fell prey to the fierce hordes of green men  the result was a partial amalgamation of the blacks whites and yellows the result of which is shown in the present splendid race of red men  i had always supposed that all traces of the original races had disappeared from the face of mars yet within the past four days i had found both whites and blacks in great multitudes  could it be possible that in some faroff corner of the planet there still existed a remnant of the ancient race of yellow men  my reveries were broken in upon by a low exclamation from the boy  at last the lighted way he cried and looking up i beheld at a long distance before us a dim radiance  as we advanced the light increased until presently we emerged into welllighted passageways  from then on our progress was rapid until we came suddenly to the end of a corridor that let directly upon the ledge surrounding the pool of the submarine  the craft lay at her moorings with uncovered hatch  raising his finger to his lips and then tapping his sword in a significant manner the youth crept noiselessly toward the vessel  i was close at his heels  silently we dropped to the deserted deck and on hands and knees crawled toward the hatchway  a stealthy glance below revealed no guard in sight and so with the quickness and the soundlessness of cats we dropped together into the main cabin of the submarine  even here was no sign of life  quickly we covered and secured the hatch  then the boy stepped into the pilot house touched a button and the boat sank amid swirling waters toward the bottom of the shaft  even then there was no scurrying of feet as we had expected and while the boy remained to direct the boat i slid from cabin to cabin in futile search for some member of the crew  the craft was entirely deserted such good fortune seemed almost unbelievable  when i returned to the pilot house to report the good news to my companion he handed me a paper  this may explain the absence of the crew he said  it was a radioaerial message to the commander of the submarine   the slaves have risen  come with what men you have and those that you can gather on the way  too late to get aid from omean  they are massacring all within the amphitheatre  issus is threatened  haste  zithad   zithad is dator of the guards of issus explained the youth  we gave them a bad scareone that they will not soon forget  let us hope that it is but the beginning of the end of issus i said  only our first ancestor knows he replied  we reached the submarine pool in omean without incident  here we debated the wisdom of sinking the craft before leaving her but finally decided that it would add nothing to our chances for escape  there were plenty of blacks on omean to thwart us were we apprehended however many more might come from the temples and gardens of issus would not in any way decrease our chances  we were now in a quandary as to how to pass the guards who patrolled the island about the pool  at last i hit upon a plan  what is the name or title of the officer in charge of these guards i asked the boy  a fellow named torith was on duty when we entered this morning he replied  good  and what is the name of the commander of the submarine  yersted  i found a dispatch blank in the cabin and wrote the following order   dator torith return these two slaves at once to shador  yersted   that will be the simpler way to return i said smiling as i handed the forged order to the boy  come we shall see now how well it works  but our swords he exclaimed  what shall we say to explain them  since we cannot explain them we shall have to leave them behind us i replied  is it not the extreme of rashness to thus put ourselves again unarmed in the power of the first born  it is the only way i answered  you may trust me to find a way out of the prison of shador and i think once out that we shall find no great difficulty in arming ourselves once more in a country which abounds so plentifully in armed men  as you say he replied with a smile and shrug  i could not follow another leader who inspired greater confidence than you  come let us put your ruse to the test  boldly we emerged from the hatchway of the craft leaving our swords behind us and strode to the main exit which led to the sentrys post and the office of the dator of the guard  at sight of us the members of the guard sprang forward in surprise and with levelled rifles halted us  i held out the message to one of them he took it and seeing to whom it was addressed turned and handed it to torith who was emerging from his office to learn the cause of the commotion  the black read the order and for a moment eyed us with evident suspicion  where is dator yersted he asked and my heart sank within me as i cursed myself for a stupid fool in not having sunk the submarine to make good the lie that i must tell  his orders were to return immediately to the temple landing i replied  torith took a half step toward the entrance to the pool as though to corroborate my story  for that instant everything hung in the balance for had he done so and found the empty submarine still lying at her wharf the whole weak fabric of my concoction would have tumbled about our heads but evidently he decided the message must be genuine nor indeed was there any good reason to doubt it since it would scarce have seemed credible to him that two slaves would voluntarily have given themselves into custody in any such manner as this  it was the very boldness of the plan which rendered it successful  were you connected with the rising of the slaves asked torith  we have just had meagre reports of some such event  all were involved i replied  but it amounted to little  the guards quickly overcame and killed the majority of us  he seemed satisfied with this reply  take them to shador he ordered turning to one of his subordinates  we entered a small boat lying beside the island and in a few minutes were disembarking upon shador  here we were returned to our respective cells i with xodar the boy by himself and behind locked doors we were again prisoners of the first born     chapter xiii  a break for liberty   xodar listened in incredulous astonishment to my narration of the events which had transpired within the arena at the rites of issus  he could scarce conceive even though he had already professed his doubt as to the deity of issus that one could threaten her with sword in hand and not be blasted into a thousand fragments by the mere fury of her divine wrath  it is the final proof he said at last  no more is needed to completely shatter the last remnant of my superstitious belief in the divinity of issus  she is only a wicked old woman wielding a mighty power for evil through machinations that have kept her own people and all barsoom in religious ignorance for ages  she is still allpowerful here however i replied  so it behooves us to leave at the first moment that appears at all propitious  i hope that you may find a propitious moment he said with a laugh for it is certain that in all my life i have never seen one in which a prisoner of the first born might escape  tonight will do as well as any i replied  it will soon be night said xodar  how may i aid in the adventure  can you swim i asked him  no slimy silian that haunts the depths of korus is more at home in water than is xodar he replied  good  the red one in all probability cannot swim i said since there is scarce enough water in all their domains to float the tiniest craft  one of us therefore will have to support him through the sea to the craft we select  i had hoped that we might make the entire distance below the surface but i fear that the red youth could not thus perform the trip  even the bravest of the brave among them are terrorized at the mere thought of deep water for it has been ages since their forebears saw a lake a river or a sea  the red one is to accompany us asked xodar  yes  it is well  three swords are better than two  especially when the third is as mighty as this fellows  i have seen him battle in the arena at the rites of issus many times  never until i saw you fight had i seen one who seemed unconquerable even in the face of great odds one might think you two master and pupil or father and son  come to recall his face there is a resemblance between you  it is very marked when you fightthere is the same grim smile the same maddening contempt for your adversary apparent in every movement of your bodies and in every changing expression of your faces  be that as it may xodar he is a great fighter  i think that we will make a trio difficult to overcome and if my friend tars tarkas jeddak of thark were but one of us we could fight our way from one end of barsoom to the other even though the whole world were pitted against us  it will be said xodar when they find from whence you have come that is but one of the superstitions which issus has foisted upon a credulous humanity  she works through the holy therns who are as ignorant of her real self as are the barsoomians of the outer world her decrees are borne to the therns written in blood upon a strange parchment  the poor deluded fools think that they are receiving the revelations of a goddess through some supernatural agency since they find these messages upon their guarded altars to which none could have access without detection  i myself have borne these messages for issus for many years  there is a long tunnel from the temple of issus to the principal temple of matai shang  it was dug ages ago by the slaves of the first born in such utter secrecy that no thern ever guessed its existence  the therns for their part have temples dotted about the entire civilized world  here priests whom the people never see communicate the doctrine of the mysterious river iss the valley dor and the lost sea of korus to persuade the poor deluded creatures to take the voluntary pilgrimage that swells the wealth of the holy therns and adds to the numbers of their slaves  thus the therns are used as the principal means for collecting the wealth and labour that the first born wrest from them as they need it occasionally the first born themselves make raids upon the outer world it is then that they capture many females of the royal houses of the red men and take the newest in battleships and the trained artisans who build them that they may copy what they cannot create  we are a nonproductive race priding ourselves upon our nonproductiveness  it is criminal for a first born to labour or invent  that is the work of the lower orders who live merely that the first born may enjoy long lives of luxury and idleness  with us fighting is all that counts were it not for that there would be more of the first born than all the creatures of barsoom could support for in so far as i know none of us ever dies a natural death  our females would live for ever but for the fact that we tire of them and remove them to make place for others  issus alone of all is protected against death  she has lived for countless ages  would not the other barsoomians live for ever but for the doctrine of the voluntary pilgrimage which drags them to the bosom of iss at or before their thousandth year i asked him  i feel now that there is no doubt but that they are precisely the same species of creature as the first born and i hope that i shall live to fight for them in atonement of the sins i have committed against them through the ignorance born of generations of false teaching  as he ceased speaking a weird call rang out across the waters of omean i had heard it at the same time the previous evening and knew that it marked the ending of the day when the men of omean spread their silks upon the deck of battleship and cruiser and fall into the dreamless sleep of mars  our guard entered to inspect us for the last time before the new day broke upon the world above  his duty was soon performed and the heavy door of our prison closed behind himwe were alone for the night  i gave him time to return to his quarters as xodar said he probably would do then i sprang to the grated window and surveyed the nearby waters  at a little distance from the island a quarter of a mile perhaps lay a monster battleship while between her and the shore were a number of smaller cruisers and oneman scouts  upon the battleship alone was there a watch  i could see him plainly in the upper works of the ship and as i watched i saw him spread his sleeping silks upon the tiny platform in which he was stationed  soon he threw himself at full length upon his couch  the discipline on omean was lax indeed  but it is not to be wondered at since no enemy guessed the existence upon barsoom of such a fleet or even of the first born or the sea of omean  why indeed should they maintain a watch  presently i dropped to the floor again and talked with xodar describing the various craft i had seen  there is one there he said my personal property built to carry five men that is the swiftest of the swift  if we can board her we can at least make a memorable run for liberty and then he went on to describe to me the equipment of the boat her engines and all that went to make her the flier that she was  in his explanation i recognized a trick of gearing that kantos kan had taught me that time we sailed under false names in the navy of zodanga beneath sab than the prince  and i knew then that the first born had stolen it from the ships of helium for only they are thus geared  and i knew too that xodar spoke the truth when he lauded the speed of his little craft for nothing that cleaves the thin air of mars can approximate the speed of the ships of helium  we decided to wait for an hour at least until all the stragglers had sought their silks  in the meantime i was to fetch the red youth to our cell so that we would be in readiness to make our rash break for freedom together  i sprang to the top of our partition wall and pulled myself up on to it  there i found a flat surface about a foot in width and along this i walked until i came to the cell in which i saw the boy sitting upon his bench  he had been leaning back against the wall looking up at the glowing dome above omean and when he spied me balancing upon the partition wall above him his eyes opened wide in astonishment  then a wide grin of appreciative understanding spread across his countenance  as i stooped to drop to the floor beside him he motioned me to wait and coming close below me whispered catch my hand i can almost leap to the top of that wall myself  i have tried it many times and each day i come a little closer  some day i should have been able to make it  i lay upon my belly across the wall and reached my hand far down toward him  with a little run from the centre of the cell he sprang up until i grasped his outstretched hand and thus i pulled him to the walls top beside me  you are the first jumper i ever saw among the red men of barsoom i said  he smiled  it is not strange  i will tell you why when we have more time  together we returned to the cell in which xodar sat descending to talk with him until the hour had passed  there we made our plans for the immediate future binding ourselves by a solemn oath to fight to the death for one another against whatsoever enemies should confront us for we knew that even should we succeed in escaping the first born we might still have a whole world against usthe power of religious superstition is mighty  it was agreed that i should navigate the craft after we had reached her and that if we made the outer world in safety we should attempt to reach helium without a stop  why helium asked the red youth  i am a prince of helium i replied  he gave me a peculiar look but said nothing further on the subject  i wondered at the time what the significance of his expression might be but in the press of other matters it soon left my mind nor did i have occasion to think of it again until later  come i said at length now is as good a time as any  let us go  another moment found me at the top of the partition wall again with the boy beside me  unbuckling my harness i snapped it together with a single long strap which i lowered to the waiting xodar below  he grasped the end and was soon sitting beside us  how simple he laughed  the balance should be even simpler i replied  then i raised myself to the top of the outer wall of the prison just so that i could peer over and locate the passing sentry  for a matter of five minutes i waited and then he came in sight on his slow and snaillike beat about the structure  i watched him until he had made the turn at the end of the building which carried him out of sight of the side of the prison that was to witness our dash for freedom  the moment his form disappeared i grasped xodar and drew him to the top of the wall  placing one end of my harness strap in his hands i lowered him quickly to the ground below  then the boy grasped the strap and slid down to xodars side  in accordance with our arrangement they did not wait for me but walked slowly toward the water a matter of a hundred yards directly past the guardhouse filled with sleeping soldiers  they had taken scarce a dozen steps when i too dropped to the ground and followed them leisurely toward the shore  as i passed the guardhouse the thought of all the good blades lying there gave me pause for if ever men were to have need of swords it was my companions and i on the perilous trip upon which we were about to embark  i glanced toward xodar and the youth and saw that they had slipped over the edge of the dock into the water  in accordance with our plan they were to remain there clinging to the metal rings which studded the concretelike substance of the dock at the waters level with only their mouths and noses above the surface of the sea until i should join them  the lure of the swords within the guardhouse was strong upon me and i hesitated a moment half inclined to risk the attempt to take the few we needed  that he who hesitates is lost proved itself a true aphorism in this instance for another moment saw me creeping stealthily toward the door of the guardhouse  gently i pressed it open a crack enough to discover a dozen blacks stretched upon their silks in profound slumber  at the far side of the room a rack held the swords and firearms of the men  warily i pushed the door a trifle wider to admit my body  a hinge gave out a resentful groan  one of the men stirred and my heart stood still  i cursed myself for a fool to have thus jeopardized our chances for escape but there was nothing for it now but to see the adventure through  with a spring as swift and as noiseless as a tigers i lit beside the guardsman who had moved  my hands hovered about his throat awaiting the moment that his eyes should open  for what seemed an eternity to my overwrought nerves i remained poised thus  then the fellow turned again upon his side and resumed the even respiration of deep slumber  carefully i picked my way between and over the soldiers until i had gained the rack at the far side of the room  here i turned to survey the sleeping men  all were quiet  their regular breathing rose and fell in a soothing rhythm that seemed to me the sweetest music i ever had heard  gingerly i drew a longsword from the rack  the scraping of the scabbard against its holder as i withdrew it sounded like the filing of cast iron with a great rasp and i looked to see the room immediately filled with alarmed and attacking guardsmen  but none stirred  the second sword i withdrew noiselessly but the third clanked in its scabbard with a frightful din  i knew that it must awaken some of the men at least and was on the point of forestalling their attack by a rapid charge for the doorway when again to my intense surprise not a black moved  either they were wondrous heavy sleepers or else the noises that i made were really much less than they seemed to me  i was about to leave the rack when my attention was attracted by the revolvers  i knew that i could not carry more than one away with me for i was already too heavily laden to move quietly with any degree of safety or speed  as i took one of them from its pin my eye fell for the first time on an open window beside the rack  ah here was a splendid means of escape for it let directly upon the dock not twenty feet from the waters edge  and as i congratulated myself i heard the door opposite me open and there looking me full in the face stood the officer of the guard  he evidently took in the situation at a glance and appreciated the gravity of it as quickly as i for our revolvers came up simultaneously and the sounds of the two reports were as one as we touched the buttons on the grips that exploded the cartridges  i felt the wind of his bullet as it whizzed past my ear and at the same instant i saw him crumple to the ground  where i hit him i do not know nor if i killed him for scarce had he started to collapse when i was through the window at my rear  in another second the waters of omean closed above my head and the three of us were making for the little flier a hundred yards away  xodar was burdened with the boy and i with the three longswords  the revolver i had dropped so that while we were both strong swimmers it seemed to me that we moved at a snails pace through the water  i was swimming entirely beneath the surface but xodar was compelled to rise often to let the youth breathe so it was a wonder that we were not discovered long before we were  in fact we reached the boats side and were all aboard before the watch upon the battleship aroused by the shots detected us  then an alarm gun bellowed from a ships bow its deep boom reverberating in deafening tones beneath the rocky dome of omean  instantly the sleeping thousands were awake  the decks of a thousand monster craft teemed with fightingmen for an alarm on omean was a thing of rare occurrence  we cast away before the sound of the first gun had died and another second saw us rising swiftly from the surface of the sea  i lay at full length along the deck with the levers and buttons of control before me  xodar and the boy were stretched directly behind me prone also that we might offer as little resistance to the air as possible  rise high whispered xodar  they dare not fire their heavy guns toward the domethe fragments of the shells would drop back among their own craft  if we are high enough our keel plates will protect us from rifle fire  i did as he bade  below us we could see the men leaping into the water by hundreds and striking out for the small cruisers and oneman fliers that lay moored about the big ships  the larger craft were getting under way following us rapidly but not rising from the water  a little to your right cried xodar for there are no points of compass upon omean where every direction is due north  the pandemonium that had broken out below us was deafening  rifles cracked officers shouted orders men yelled directions to one another from the water and from the decks of myriad boats while through all ran the purr of countless propellers cutting water and air  i had not dared pull my speed lever to the highest for fear of overrunning the mouth of the shaft that passed from omeans dome to the world above but even so we were hitting a clip that i doubt has ever been equalled on the windless sea  the smaller fliers were commencing to rise toward us when xodar shouted the shaft  the shaft  dead ahead and i saw the opening black and yawning in the glowing dome of this underworld  a tenman cruiser was rising directly in front to cut off our escape it was the only vessel that stood in our way but at the rate that it was traveling it would come between us and the shaft in plenty of time to thwart our plans  it was rising at an angle of about fortyfive degrees dead ahead of us with the evident intention of combing us with grappling hooks from above as it skimmed low over our deck  there was but one forlorn hope for us and i took it  it was useless to try to pass over her for that would have allowed her to force us against the rocky dome above and we were already too near that as it was  to have attempted to dive below her would have put us entirely at her mercy and precisely where she wanted us  on either side a hundred other menacing craft were hastening toward us  the alternative was filled with riskin fact it was all risk with but a slender chance of success  as we neared the cruiser i rose as though to pass above her so that she would do just what she did do rise at a steeper angle to force me still higher  then as we were almost upon her i yelled to my companions to hold tight and throwing the little vessel into her highest speed i deflected her bows at the same instant until we were running horizontally and at terrific velocity straight for the cruisers keel  her commander may have seen my intentions then but it was too late almost at the instant of impact i turned my bows upward and then with a shattering jolt we were in collision  what i had hoped for happened the cruiser already tilted at a perilous angle was carried completely over backward by the impact of my smaller vessel  her crew fell twisting and screaming through the air to the water far below while the cruiser her propellers still madly churning dived swiftly headforemost after them to the bottom of the sea of omean  the collision crushed our steel bows and notwithstanding every effort on our part came near to hurling us from the deck  as it was we landed in a wildly clutching heap at the very extremity of the flier where xodar and i succeeded in grasping the handrail but the boy would have plunged overboard had i not fortunately grasped his ankle as he was already partially over  unguided our vessel careened wildly in its mad flight rising ever nearer the rocks above  it took but an instant however for me to regain the levers and with the roof barely fifty feet above i turned her nose once more into the horizontal plane and headed her again for the black mouth of the shaft  the collision had retarded our progress and now a hundred swift scouts were close upon us  xodar had told me that ascending the shaft by virtue of our repulsive rays alone would give our enemies their best chance to overtake us since our propellers would be idle and in rising we would be outclassed by many of our pursuers  the swifter craft are seldom equipped with large buoyancy tanks since the added bulk of them tends to reduce a vessels speed  as many boats were now quite close to us it was inevitable that we would be quickly overhauled in the shaft and captured or killed in short order  to me there always seems a way to gain the opposite side of an obstacle  if one cannot pass over it or below it or around it why then there is but a single alternative left and that is to pass through it  i could not get around the fact that many of these other boats could rise faster than ours by the fact of their greater buoyancy but i was none the less determined to reach the outer world far in advance of them or die a death of my own choosing in event of failure  reverse screamed xodar behind me  for the love of your first ancestor reverse  we are at the shaft  hold tight i screamed in reply  grasp the boy and hold tightwe are going straight up the shaft  the words were scarce out of my mouth as we swept beneath the pitchblack opening  i threw the bow hard up dragged the speed lever to its last notch and clutching a stanchion with one hand and the steeringwheel with the other hung on like grim death and consigned my soul to its author  i heard a little exclamation of surprise from xodar followed by a grim laugh  the boy laughed too and said something which i could not catch for the whistling of the wind of our awful speed  i looked above my head hoping to catch the gleam of stars by which i could direct our course and hold the hurtling thing that bore us true to the centre of the shaft  to have touched the side at the speed we were making would doubtless have resulted in instant death for us all but not a star showed aboveonly utter and impenetrable darkness  then i glanced below me and there i saw a rapidly diminishing circle of lightthe mouth of the opening above the phosphorescent radiance of omean  by this i steered endeavouring to keep the circle of light below me ever perfect  at best it was but a slender cord that held us from destruction and i think that i steered that night more by intuition and blind faith than by skill or reason  we were not long in the shaft and possibly the very fact of our enormous speed saved us for evidently we started in the right direction and so quickly were we out again that we had no time to alter our course  omean lies perhaps two miles below the surface crust of mars  our speed must have approximated two hundred miles an hour for martian fliers are swift so that at most we were in the shaft not over forty seconds  we must have been out of it for some seconds before i realised that we had accomplished the impossible  black darkness enshrouded all about us  there were neither moons nor stars  never before had i seen such a thing upon mars and for the moment i was nonplussed  then the explanation came to me  it was summer at the south pole  the ice cap was melting and those meteoric phenomena clouds unknown upon the greater part of barsoom were shutting out the light of heaven from this portion of the planet  fortunate indeed it was for us nor did it take me long to grasp the opportunity for escape which this happy condition offered us  keeping the boats nose at a stiff angle i raced her for the impenetrable curtain which nature had hung above this dying world to shut us out from the sight of our pursuing enemies  we plunged through the cold damp fog without diminishing our speed and in a moment emerged into the glorious light of the two moons and the million stars  i dropped into a horizontal course and headed due north  our enemies were a good halfhour behind us with no conception of our direction  we had performed the miraculous and come through a thousand dangers unscathedwe had escaped from the land of the first born  no other prisoners in all the ages of barsoom had done this thing and now as i looked back upon it it did not seem to have been so difficult after all  i said as much to xodar over my shoulder  it is very wonderful nevertheless he replied  no one else could have accomplished it but john carter  at the sound of that name the boy jumped to his feet  john carter he cried  john carter  why man john carter prince of helium has been dead for years  i am his son     chapter xiv  the eyes in the dark   my son  i could not believe my ears  slowly i rose and faced the handsome youth  now that i looked at him closely i commenced to see why his face and personality had attracted me so strongly  there was much of his mothers incomparable beauty in his clearcut features but it was strongly masculine beauty and his grey eyes and the expression of them were mine  the boy stood facing me half hope and half uncertainty in his look  tell me of your mother i said  tell me all you can of the years that i have been robbed by a relentless fate of her dear companionship  with a cry of pleasure he sprang toward me and threw his arms about my neck and for a brief moment as i held my boy close to me the tears welled to my eyes and i was like to have choked after the manner of some maudlin foolbut i do not regret it nor am i ashamed  a long life has taught me that a man may seem weak where women and children are concerned and yet be anything but a weakling in the sterner avenues of life  your stature your manner the terrible ferocity of your swordsmanship said the boy are as my mother has described them to me a thousand timesbut even with such evidence i could scarce credit the truth of what seemed so improbable to me however much i desired it to be true  do you know what thing it was that convinced me more than all the others  what my boy i asked  your first words to methey were of my mother  none else but the man who loved her as she has told me my father did would have thought first of her  for long years my son i can scarce recall a moment that the radiant vision of your mothers face has not been ever before me  tell me of her  those who have known her longest say that she has not changed unless it be to grow more beautifulwere that possible  only when she thinks i am not about to see her her face grows very sad and oh so wistful  she thinks ever of you my father and all helium mourns with her and for her  her grandfathers people love her  they loved you also and fairly worship your memory as the saviour of barsoom  each year that brings its anniversary of the day that saw you racing across a near dead world to unlock the secret of that awful portal behind which lay the mighty power of life for countless millions a great festival is held in your honour but there are tears mingled with the thanksgivingtears of real regret that the author of the happiness is not with them to share the joy of living he died to give them  upon all barsoom there is no greater name than john carter  and by what name has your mother called you my boy i asked  the people of helium asked that i be named with my fathers name but my mother said no that you and she had chosen a name for me together and that your wish must be honoured before all others so the name that she called me is the one that you desired a combination of hers and yourscarthoris  xodar had been at the wheel as i talked with my son and now he called me  she is dropping badly by the head john carter he said  so long as we were rising at a stiff angle it was not noticeable but now that i am trying to keep a horizontal course it is different  the wound in her bow has opened one of her forward ray tanks  it was true and after i had examined the damage i found it a much graver matter than i had anticipated  not only was the forced angle at which we were compelled to maintain the bow in order to keep a horizontal course greatly impeding our speed but at the rate that we were losing our repulsive rays from the forward tanks it was but a question of an hour or more when we would be floating stern up and helpless  we had slightly reduced our speed with the dawning of a sense of security but now i took the helm once more and pulled the noble little engine wide open so that again we raced north at terrific velocity in the meantime carthoris and xodar with tools in hand were puttering with the great rent in the bow in a hopeless endeavour to stem the tide of escaping rays  it was still dark when we passed the northern boundary of the ice cap and the area of clouds  below us lay a typical martian landscape rolling ochre sea bottom of long dead seas low surrounding hills with here and there the grim and silent cities of the dead past great piles of mighty architecture tenanted only by ageold memories of a once powerful race and by the great white apes of barsoom  it was becoming more and more difficult to maintain our little vessel in a horizontal position  lower and lower sagged the bow until it became necessary to stop the engine to prevent our flight terminating in a swift dive to the ground  as the sun rose and the light of a new day swept away the darkness of night our craft gave a final spasmodic plunge turned half upon her side and then with deck tilting at a sickening angle swung in a slow circle her bow dropping further below her stern each moment  to handrail and stanchion we clung and finally as we saw the end approaching snapped the buckles of our harness to the rings at her sides  in another moment the deck reared at an angle of ninety degrees and we hung in our leather with feet dangling a thousand yards above the ground  i was swinging quite close to the controlling devices so i reached out to the lever that directed the rays of repulsion  the boat responded to the touch and very gently we began to sink toward the ground  it was fully half an hour before we touched  directly north of us rose a rather lofty range of hills toward which we decided to make our way since they afforded greater opportunity for concealment from the pursuers we were confident might stumble in this direction  an hour later found us in the timerounded gullies of the hills amid the beautiful flowering plants that abound in the arid waste places of barsoom  there we found numbers of huge milkgiving shrubsthat strange plant which serves in great part as food and drink for the wild hordes of green men  it was indeed a boon to us for we all were nearly famished  beneath a cluster of these which afforded perfect concealment from wandering air scouts we lay down to sleepfor me the first time in many hours  this was the beginning of my fifth day upon barsoom since i had found myself suddenly translated from my cottage on the hudson to dor the valley beautiful the valley hideous  in all this time i had slept but twice though once the clock around within the storehouse of the therns  it was midafternoon when i was awakened by some one seizing my hand and covering it with kisses  with a start i opened my eyes to look into the beautiful face of thuvia  my prince  my prince she cried in an ecstasy of happiness  tis you whom i had mourned as dead  my ancestors have been good to me i have not lived in vain  the girls voice awoke xodar and carthoris  the boy gazed upon the woman in surprise but she did not seem to realize the presence of another than i  she would have thrown her arms about my neck and smothered me with caresses had i not gently but firmly disengaged myself  come come thuvia i said soothingly you are overwrought by the danger and hardships you have passed through  you forget yourself as you forget that i am the husband of the princess of helium  i forget nothing my prince she replied  you have spoken no word of love to me nor do i expect that you ever shall but nothing can prevent me loving you  i would not take the place of dejah thoris  my greatest ambition is to serve you my prince for ever as your slave no greater boon could i ask no greater honour could i crave no greater happiness could i hope  as i have before said i am no ladies man and i must admit that i seldom have felt so uncomfortable and embarrassed as i did that moment while i was quite familiar with the martian custom which allows female slaves to martian men whose high and chivalrous honour is always ample protection for every woman in his household yet i had never myself chosen other than men as my body servants  and i ever return to helium thuvia i said you shall go with me but as an honoured equal and not as a slave  there you shall find plenty of handsome young nobles who would face issus herself to win a smile from you and we shall have you married in short order to one of the best of them  forget your foolish gratitudebegotten infatuation which your innocence has mistaken for love  i like your friendship better thuvia  you are my master it shall be as you say she replied simply but there was a note of sadness in her voice  how came you here thuvia i asked  and where is tars tarkas  the great thark i fear is dead she replied sadly  he was a mighty fighter but a multitude of green warriors of another horde than his overwhelmed him  the last that i saw of him they were bearing him wounded and bleeding to the deserted city from which they had sallied to attack us  you are not sure that he is dead then i asked  and where is this city of which you speak  it is just beyond this range of hills  the vessel in which you so nobly resigned a place that we might find escape defied our small skill in navigation with the result that we drifted aimlessly about for two days  then we decided to abandon the craft and attempt to make our way on foot to the nearest waterway  yesterday we crossed these hills and came upon the dead city beyond  we had passed within its streets and were walking toward the central portion when at an intersecting avenue we saw a body of green warriors approaching  tars tarkas was in advance and they saw him but me they did not see the thark sprang back to my side and forced me into an adjacent doorway where he told me to remain in hiding until i could escape making my way to helium if possible  there will be no escape for me now he said for these be the warhoon of the south  when they have seen my metal it will be to the death  then he stepped out to meet them  ah my prince such fighting  for an hour they swarmed about him until the warhoon dead formed a hill where he had stood but at last they overwhelmed him those behind pushing the foremost upon him until there remained no space to swing his great sword  then he stumbled and went down and they rolled over him like a huge wave  when they carried him away toward the heart of the city he was dead i think for i did not see him move  before we go farther we must be sure i said  i cannot leave tars tarkas alive among the warhoons  tonight i shall enter the city and make sure  and i shall go with you spoke carthoris  and i said xodar  neither one of you shall go i replied  it is work that requires stealth and strategy not force  one man alone may succeed where more would invite disaster  i shall go alone  if i need your help i will return for you  they did not like it but both were good soldiers and it had been agreed that i should command  the sun already was low so that i did not have long to wait before the sudden darkness of barsoom engulfed us  with a parting word of instructions to carthoris and xodar in case i should not return i bade them all farewell and set forth at a rapid dogtrot toward the city  as i emerged from the hills the nearer moon was winging its wild flight through the heavens its bright beams turning to burnished silver the barbaric splendour of the ancient metropolis  the city had been built upon the gently rolling foothills that in the dim and distant past had sloped down to meet the sea  it was due to this fact that i had no difficulty in entering the streets unobserved  the green hordes that use these deserted cities seldom occupy more than a few squares about the central plaza and as they come and go always across the dead sea bottoms that the cities face it is usually a matter of comparative ease to enter from the hillside  once within the streets i kept close in the dense shadows of the walls  at intersections i halted a moment to make sure that none was in sight before i sprang quickly to the shadows of the opposite side thus i made the journey to the vicinity of the plaza without detection as i approached the purlieus of the inhabited portion of the city i was made aware of the proximity of the warriors quarters by the squealing and grunting of the thoats and zitidars corralled within the hollow courtyards formed by the buildings surrounding each square  these old familiar sounds that are so distinctive of green martian life sent a thrill of pleasure surging through me  it was as one might feel on coming home after a long absence  it was amid such sounds that i had first courted the incomparable dejah thoris in the ageold marble halls of the dead city of korad  as i stood in the shadows at the far corner of the first square which housed members of the horde i saw warriors emerging from several of the buildings  they all went in the same direction toward a great building which stood in the centre of the plaza  my knowledge of green martian customs convinced me that this was either the quarters of the principal chieftain or contained the audience chamber wherein the jeddak met his jeds and lesser chieftains  in either event it was evident that something was afoot which might have a bearing on the recent capture of tars tarkas  to reach this building which i now felt it imperative that i do i must needs traverse the entire length of one square and cross a broad avenue and a portion of the plaza  from the noises of the animals which came from every courtyard about me i knew that there were many people in the surrounding buildingsprobably several communities of the great horde of the warhoons of the south  to pass undetected among all these people was in itself a difficult task but if i was to find and rescue the great thark i must expect even more formidable obstacles before success could be mine  i had entered the city from the south and now stood on the corner of the avenue through which i had passed and the first intersecting avenue south of the plaza  the buildings upon the south side of this square did not appear to be inhabited as i could see no lights and so i decided to gain the inner courtyard through one of them  nothing occurred to interrupt my progress through the deserted pile i chose and i came into the inner court close to the rear walls of the east buildings without detection  within the court a great herd of thoats and zitidars moved restlessly about cropping the mosslike ochre vegetation which overgrows practically the entire uncultivated area of mars  what breeze there was came from the northwest so there was little danger that the beasts would scent me  had they their squealing and grunting would have grown to such a volume as to attract the attention of the warriors within the buildings  close to the east wall beneath the overhanging balconies of the second floors i crept in dense shadows the full length of the courtyard until i came to the buildings at the north end  these were lighted for about three floors up but above the third floor all was dark  to pass through the lighted rooms was of course out of the question since they swarmed with green martian men and women  my only path lay through the upper floors and to gain these it was necessary to scale the face of the wall  the reaching of the balcony of the second floor was a matter of easy accomplishmentan agile leap gave my hands a grasp upon the stone handrail above  in another instant i had drawn myself up on the balcony  here through the open windows i saw the green folk squatting upon their sleeping silks and furs grunting an occasional monosyllable which in connection with their wondrous telepathic powers is ample for their conversational requirements  as i drew closer to listen to their words a warrior entered the room from the hall beyond  come tan gama he cried we are to take the thark before kab kadja bring another with you  the warrior addressed arose and beckoning to a fellow squatting near the three turned and left the apartment  if i could but follow them the chance might come to free tars tarkas at once  at least i would learn the location of his prison  at my right was a door leading from the balcony into the building  it was at the end of an unlighted hall and on the impulse of the moment i stepped within  the hall was broad and led straight through to the front of the building  on either side were the doorways of the various apartments which lined it  i had no more than entered the corridor than i saw the three warriors at the other endthose whom i had just seen leaving the apartment then a turn to the right took them from my sight again  quickly i hastened along the hallway in pursuit  my gait was reckless but i felt that fate had been kind indeed to throw such an opportunity within my grasp and i could not afford to allow it to elude me now  at the far end of the corridor i found a spiral stairway leading to the floors above and below  the three had evidently left the floor by this avenue  that they had gone down and not up i was sure from my knowledge of these ancient buildings and the methods of the warhoons  i myself had once been a prisoner of the cruel hordes of northern warhoon and the memory of the underground dungeon in which i lay still is vivid in my memory  and so i felt certain that tars tarkas lay in the dark pits beneath some nearby building and that in that direction i should find the trail of the three warriors leading to his cell  nor was i wrong  at the bottom of the runway or rather at the landing on the floor below i saw that the shaft descended into the pits beneath and as i glanced down the flickering light of a torch revealed the presence of the three i was trailing  down they went toward the pits beneath the structure and at a safe distance behind i followed the flicker of their torch  the way led through a maze of tortuous corridors unlighted save for the wavering light they carried  we had gone perhaps a hundred yards when the party turned abruptly through a doorway at their right  i hastened on as rapidly as i dared through the darkness until i reached the point at which they had left the corridor  there through an open door i saw them removing the chains that secured the great thark tars tarkas to the wall  hustling him roughly between them they came immediately from the chamber so quickly in fact that i was near to being apprehended  but i managed to run along the corridor in the direction i had been going in my pursuit of them far enough to be without the radius of their meagre light as they emerged from the cell  i had naturally assumed that they would return with tars tarkas the same way that they had come which would have carried them away from me but to my chagrin they wheeled directly in my direction as they left the room  there was nothing for me but to hasten on in advance and keep out of the light of their torch  i dared not attempt to halt in the darkness of any of the many intersecting corridors for i knew nothing of the direction they might take  chance was as likely as not to carry me into the very corridor they might choose to enter  the sensation of moving rapidly through these dark passages was far from reassuring  i knew not at what moment i might plunge headlong into some terrible pit or meet with some of the ghoulish creatures that inhabit these lower worlds beneath the dead cities of dying mars there filtered to me a faint radiance from the torch of the men behindjust enough to permit me to trace the direction of the winding passageways directly before me and so keep me from dashing myself against the walls at the turns  presently i came to a place where five corridors diverged from a common point  i had hastened along one of them for some little distance when suddenly the faint light of the torch disappeared from behind me  i paused to listen for sounds of the party behind me but the silence was as utter as the silence of the tomb  quickly i realized that the warriors had taken one of the other corridors with their prisoner and so i hastened back with a feeling of considerable relief to take up a much safer and more desirable position behind them  it was much slower work returning however than it had been coming for now the darkness was as utter as the silence  it was necessary to feel every foot of the way back with my hand against the side wall that i might not pass the spot where the five roads radiated  after what seemed an eternity to me i reached the place and recognized it by groping across the entrances to the several corridors until i had counted five of them  in not one however showed the faintest sign of light  i listened intently but the naked feet of the green men sent back no guiding echoes though presently i thought i detected the clank of side arms in the far distance of the middle corridor  up this then i hastened searching for the light and stopping to listen occasionally for a repetition of the sound but soon i was forced to admit that i must have been following a blind lead as only darkness and silence rewarded my efforts  again i retraced my steps toward the parting of the ways when to my surprise i came upon the entrance to three diverging corridors any one of which i might have traversed in my hasty dash after the false clue i had been following  here was a pretty fix indeed  once back at the point where the five passageways met i might wait with some assurance for the return of the warriors with tars tarkas  my knowledge of their customs lent colour to the belief that he was but being escorted to the audience chamber to have sentence passed upon him  i had not the slightest doubt but that they would preserve so doughty a warrior as the great thark for the rare sport he would furnish at the great games  but unless i could find my way back to that point the chances were most excellent that i would wander for days through the awful blackness until overcome by thirst and hunger i lay down to die orwhat was that  a faint shuffling sounded behind me and as i cast a hasty glance over my shoulder my blood froze in my veins for the thing i saw there  it was not so much fear of the present danger as it was the horrifying memories it recalled of that time i near went mad over the corpse of the man i had killed in the dungeons of the warhoons when blazing eyes came out of the dark recesses and dragged the thing that had been a man from my clutches and i heard it scraping over the stone of my prison as they bore it away to their terrible feast  and now in these black pits of the other warhoons i looked into those same fiery eyes blazing at me through the terrible darkness revealing no sign of the beast behind them  i think that the most fearsome attribute of these awesome creatures is their silence and the fact that one never sees themnothing but those baleful eyes glaring unblinkingly out of the dark void behind  grasping my longsword tightly in my hand i backed slowly along the corridor away from the thing that watched me but ever as i retreated the eyes advanced nor was there any sound not even the sound of breathing except the occasional shuffling sound as of the dragging of a dead limb that had first attracted my attention  on and on i went but i could not escape my sinister pursuer  suddenly i heard the shuffling noise at my right and looking saw another pair of eyes evidently approaching from an intersecting corridor  as i started to renew my slow retreat i heard the noise repeated behind me and then before i could turn i heard it again at my left  the things were all about me  they had me surrounded at the intersection of two corridors  retreat was cut off in all directions unless i chose to charge one of the beasts  even then i had no doubt but that the others would hurl themselves upon my back  i could not even guess the size or nature of the weird creatures  that they were of goodly proportions i guessed from the fact that the eyes were on a level with my own  why is it that darkness so magnifies our dangers  by day i would have charged the great banth itself had i thought it necessary but hemmed in by the darkness of these silent pits i hesitated before a pair of eyes  soon i saw that the matter shortly would be taken entirely from my hands for the eyes at my right were moving slowly nearer me as were those at my left and those behind and before me  gradually they were closing in upon mebut still that awful stealthy silence  for what seemed hours the eyes approached gradually closer and closer until i felt that i should go mad for the horror of it  i had been constantly turning this way and that to prevent any sudden rush from behind until i was fairly worn out  at length i could endure it no longer and taking a fresh grasp upon my longsword i turned suddenly and charged down upon one of my tormentors  as i was almost upon it the thing retreated before me but a sound from behind caused me to wheel in time to see three pairs of eyes rushing at me from the rear  with a cry of rage i turned to meet the cowardly beasts but as i advanced they retreated as had their fellow  another glance over my shoulder discovered the first eyes sneaking on me again and again i charged only to see the eyes retreat before me and hear the muffled rush of the three at my back  thus we continued the eyes always a little closer in the end than they had been before until i thought that i should go mad with the terrible strain of the ordeal  that they were waiting to spring upon my back seemed evident and that it would not be long before they succeeded was equally apparent for i could not endure the wear of this repeated charge and countercharge indefinitely  in fact i could feel myself weakening from the mental and physical strain i had been undergoing  at that moment i caught another glimpse from the corner of my eye of the single pair of eyes at my back making a sudden rush upon me  i turned to meet the charge there was a quick rush of the three from the other direction but i determined to pursue the single pair until i should have at least settled my account with one of the beasts and thus be relieved of the strain of meeting attacks from both directions  there was no sound in the corridor only that of my own breathing yet i knew that those three uncanny creatures were almost upon me  the eyes in front were not retreating so rapidly now i was almost within sword reach of them  i raised my sword arm to deal the blow that should free me and then i felt a heavy body upon my back  a cold moist slimy something fastened itself upon my throat  i stumbled and went down     chapter xv  flight and pursuit   i could not have been unconscious more than a few seconds and yet i know that i was unconscious for the next thing i realized was that a growing radiance was illuminating the corridor about me and the eyes were gone  i was unharmed except for a slight bruise upon my forehead where it had struck the stone flagging as i fell  i sprang to my feet to ascertain the cause of the light  it came from a torch in the hand of one of a party of four green warriors who were coming rapidly down the corridor toward me  they had not yet seen me and so i lost no time in slipping into the first intersecting corridor that i could find  this time however i did not advance so far away from the main corridor as on the other occasion that had resulted in my losing tars tarkas and his guards  the party came rapidly toward the opening of the passageway in which i crouched against the wall  as they passed by i breathed a sigh of relief  i had not been discovered and best of all the party was the same that i had followed into the pits  it consisted of tars tarkas and his three guards  i fell in behind them and soon we were at the cell in which the great thark had been chained  two of the warriors remained without while the man with the keys entered with the thark to fasten his irons upon him once more  the two outside started to stroll slowly in the direction of the spiral runway which led to the floors above and in a moment were lost to view beyond a turn in the corridor  the torch had been stuck in a socket beside the door so that its rays illuminated both the corridor and the cell at the same time  as i saw the two warriors disappear i approached the entrance to the cell with a welldefined plan already formulated  while i disliked the thought of carrying out the thing that i had decided upon there seemed no alternative if tars tarkas and i were to go back together to my little camp in the hills  keeping near the wall i came quite close to the door to tars tarkas cell and there i stood with my longsword above my head grasped with both hands that i might bring it down in one quick cut upon the skull of the jailer as he emerged  i dislike to dwell upon what followed after i heard the footsteps of the man as he approached the doorway  it is enough that within another minute or two tars tarkas wearing the metal of a warhoon chief was hurrying down the corridor toward the spiral runway bearing the warhoons torch to light his way  a dozen paces behind him followed john carter prince of helium  the two companions of the man who lay now beside the door of the cell that had been tars tarkas had just started to ascend the runway as the thark came in view  why so long tan gama cried one of the men  i had trouble with a lock replied tars tarkas  and now i find that i have left my shortsword in the tharks cell  go you on ill return and fetch it  as you will tan gama replied he who had before spoken  we shall see you above directly  yes replied tars tarkas and turned as though to retrace his steps to the cell but he only waited until the two had disappeared at the floor above  then i joined him we extinguished the torch and together we crept toward the spiral incline that led to the upper floors of the building  at the first floor we found that the hallway ran but halfway through necessitating the crossing of a rear room full of green folk ere we could reach the inner courtyard so there was but one thing left for us to do and that was to gain the second floor and the hallway through which i had traversed the length of the building  cautiously we ascended  we could hear the sounds of conversation coming from the room above but the hall still was unlighted nor was any one in sight as we gained the top of the runway  together we threaded the long hall and reached the balcony overlooking the courtyard without being detected  at our right was the window letting into the room in which i had seen tan gama and the other warriors as they started to tars tarkas cell earlier in the evening  his companions had returned here and we now overheard a portion of their conversation  what can be detaining tan gama asked one  he certainly could not be all this time fetching his shortsword from the tharks cell spoke another  his shortsword asked a woman  what mean you  tan gama left his shortsword in the tharks cell explained the first speaker and left us at the runway to return and get it  tan gama wore no shortsword this night said the woman  it was broken in todays battle with the thark and tan gama gave it to me to repair  see i have it here and as she spoke she drew tan gamas shortsword from beneath her sleeping silks and furs  the warriors sprang to their feet  there is something amiss here cried one  tis even what i myself thought when tan gama left us at the runway said another  methought then that his voice sounded strangely  come let us hasten to the pits  we waited to hear no more  slinging my harness into a long single strap i lowered tars tarkas to the courtyard beneath and an instant later dropped to his side  we had spoken scarcely a dozen words since i had felled tan gama at the cell door and seen in the torchs light the expression of utter bewilderment upon the great tharks face  by this time he had said i should have learned to wonder at nothing which john carter accomplishes  that was all  he did not need to tell me that he appreciated the friendship which had prompted me to risk my life to rescue him nor did he need to say that he was glad to see me  this fierce green warrior had been the first to greet me that day now twenty years gone which had witnessed my first advent upon mars  he had met me with levelled spear and cruel hatred in his heart as he charged down upon me bending low at the side of his mighty thoat as i stood beside the incubator of his horde upon the dead sea bottom beyond korad  and now among the inhabitants of two worlds i counted none a better friend than tars tarkas jeddak of the tharks  as we reached the courtyard we stood in the shadows beneath the balcony for a moment to discuss our plans  there be five now in the party tars tarkas i said thuvia xodar carthoris and ourselves  we shall need five thoats to bear us  carthoris he cried  your son  yes  i found him in the prison of shador on the sea of omean in the land of the first born  i know not any of these places john carter  be they upon barsoom  upon and below my friend but wait until we shall have made good our escape and you shall hear the strangest narrative that ever a barsoomian of the outer world gave ear to  now we must steal our thoats and be well away to the north before these fellows discover how we have tricked them  in safety we reached the great gates at the far end of the courtyard through which it was necessary to take our thoats to the avenue beyond it is no easy matter to handle five of these great fierce beasts which by nature are as wild and ferocious as their masters and held in subjection by cruelty and brute force alone  as we approached them they sniffed our unfamiliar scent and with squeals of rage circled about us  their long massive necks upreared raised their great gaping mouths high above our heads  they are fearsome appearing brutes at best but when they are aroused they are fully as dangerous as they look  the thoat stands a good ten feet at the shoulder  his hide is sleek and hairless and of a dark slate colour on back and sides shading down his eight legs to a vivid yellow at the huge padded nailless feet the belly is pure white  a broad flat tail larger at the tip than at the root completes the picture of this ferocious green martian mounta fit war steed for these warlike people  as the thoats are guided by telepathic means alone there is no need for rein or bridle and so our object now was to find two that would obey our unspoken commands  as they charged about us we succeeded in mastering them sufficiently to prevent any concerted attack upon us but the din of their squealing was certain to bring investigating warriors into the courtyard were it to continue much longer  at length i was successful in reaching the side of one great brute and ere he knew what i was about i was firmly seated astride his glossy back  a moment later tars tarkas had caught and mounted another and then between us we herded three or four more toward the great gates  tars tarkas rode ahead and leaning down to the latch threw the barriers open while i held the loose thoats from breaking back to the herd  then together we rode through into the avenue with our stolen mounts and without waiting to close the gates hurried off toward the southern boundary of the city  thus far our escape had been little short of marvellous nor did our good fortune desert us for we passed the outer purlieus of the dead city and came to our camp without hearing even the faintest sound of pursuit  here a low whistle the prearranged signal apprised the balance of our party that i was returning and we were met by the three with every manifestation of enthusiastic rejoicing  but little time was wasted in narration of our adventure  tars tarkas and carthoris exchanged the dignified and formal greetings common upon barsoom but i could tell intuitively that the thark loved my boy and that carthoris reciprocated his affection  xodar and the green jeddak were formally presented to each other  then thuvia was lifted to the least fractious thoat xodar and carthoris mounted two others and we set out at a rapid pace toward the east  at the far extremity of the city we circled toward the north and under the glorious rays of the two moons we sped noiselessly across the dead sea bottom away from the warhoons and the first born but to what new dangers and adventures we knew not  toward noon of the following day we halted to rest our mounts and ourselves  the beasts we hobbled that they might move slowly about cropping the ochre mosslike vegetation which constitutes both food and drink for them on the march  thuvia volunteered to remain on watch while the balance of the party slept for an hour  it seemed to me that i had but closed my eyes when i felt her hand upon my shoulder and heard her soft voice warning me of a new danger  arise o prince she whispered  there be that behind us which has the appearance of a great body of pursuers  the girl stood pointing in the direction from whence we had come and as i arose and looked i too thought that i could detect a thin dark line on the far horizon  i awoke the others  tars tarkas whose giant stature towered high above the rest of us could see the farthest  it is a great body of mounted men he said and they are travelling at high speed  there was no time to be lost  we sprang to our hobbled thoats freed them and mounted  then we turned our faces once more toward the north and took our flight again at the highest speed of our slowest beast  for the balance of the day and all the following night we raced across that ochre wilderness with the pursuers at our back ever gaining upon us  slowly but surely they were lessening the distance between us just before dark they had been close enough for us to plainly distinguish that they were green martians and all during the long night we distinctly heard the clanking of their accoutrements behind us  as the sun rose on the second day of our flight it disclosed the pursuing horde not a halfmile in our rear  as they saw us a fiendish shout of triumph rose from their ranks  several miles in advance lay a range of hillsthe farther shore of the dead sea we had been crossing  could we but reach these hills our chances of escape would be greatly enhanced but thuvias mount although carrying the lightest burden already was showing signs of exhaustion  i was riding beside her when suddenly her animal staggered and lurched against mine  i saw that he was going down but ere he fell i snatched the girl from his back and swung her to a place upon my own thoat behind me where she clung with her arms about me  this double burden soon proved too much for my already overtaxed beast and thus our speed was terribly diminished for the others would proceed no faster than the slowest of us could go  in that little party there was not one who would desert another yet we were of different countries different colours different races different religionsand one of us was of a different world  we were quite close to the hills but the warhoons were gaining so rapidly that we had given up all hope of reaching them in time  thuvia and i were in the rear for our beast was lagging more and more suddenly i felt the girls warm lips press a kiss upon my shoulder for thy sake o my prince she murmured  then her arms slipped from about my waist and she was gone  i turned and saw that she had deliberately slipped to the ground in the very path of the cruel demons who pursued us thinking that by lightening the burden of my mount it might thus be enabled to bear me to the safety of the hills  poor child  she should have known john carter better than that  turning my thoat i urged him after her hoping to reach her side and bear her on again in our hopeless flight  carthoris must have glanced behind him at about the same time and taken in the situation for by the time i had reached thuvias side he was there also and springing from his mount he threw her upon its back and turning the animals head toward the hills gave the beast a sharp crack across the rump with the flat of his sword  then he attempted to do the same with mine  the brave boys act of chivalrous selfsacrifice filled me with pride nor did i care that it had wrested from us our last frail chance for escape  the warhoons were now close upon us  tars tarkas and xodar had discovered our absence and were charging rapidly to our support everything pointed toward a splendid ending of my second journey to barsoom  i hated to go out without having seen my divine princess and held her in my arms once again but if it were not writ upon the book of fate that such was to be then would i take the most that was coming to me and in these last few moments that were to be vouchsafed me before i passed over into that unguessed future i could at least give such an account of myself in my chosen vocation as would leave the warhoons of the south food for discourse for the next twenty generations  as carthoris was not mounted i slipped from the back of my own mount and took my place at his side to meet the charge of the howling devils bearing down upon us  a moment later tars tarkas and xodar ranged themselves on either hand turning their thoats loose that we might all be on an equal footing  the warhoons were perhaps a hundred yards from us when a loud explosion sounded from above and behind us and almost at the same instant a shell burst in their advancing ranks  at once all was confusion  a hundred warriors toppled to the ground  riderless thoats plunged hither and thither among the dead and dying  dismounted warriors were trampled underfoot in the stampede which followed  all semblance of order had left the ranks of the green men and as they looked far above our heads to trace the origin of this unexpected attack disorder turned to retreat and retreat to a wild panic  in another moment they were racing as madly away from us as they had before been charging down upon us  we turned to look in the direction from whence the first report had come and there we saw just clearing the tops of the nearer hills a great battleship swinging majestically through the air  her bow gun spoke again even as we looked and another shell burst among the fleeing warhoons  as she drew nearer i could not repress a wild cry of elation for upon her bows i saw the device of helium     chapter xvi  under arrest   as carthoris xodar tars tarkas and i stood gazing at the magnificent vessel which meant so much to all of us we saw a second and then a third top the summit of the hills and glide gracefully after their sister  now a score of oneman air scouts were launching from the upper decks of the nearer vessel and in a moment more were speeding in long swift dives to the ground about us  in another instant we were surrounded by armed sailors and an officer had stepped forward to address us when his eyes fell upon carthoris with an exclamation of surprised pleasure he sprang forward and placing his hands upon the boys shoulder called him by name  carthoris my prince he cried kaor  kaor  hor vastus greets the son of dejah thoris princess of helium and of her husband john carter  where have you been o my prince  all helium has been plunged in sorrow  terrible have been the calamities that have befallen your greatgrandsires mighty nation since the fatal day that saw you leave our midst  grieve not my good hor vastus cried carthoris since i bring not back myself alone to cheer my mothers heart and the hearts of my beloved people but also one whom all barsoom loved besther greatest warrior and her saviourjohn carter prince of helium  hor vastus turned in the direction indicated by carthoris and as his eyes fell upon me he was like to have collapsed from sheer surprise  john carter he exclaimed and then a sudden troubled look came into his eyes  my prince he started where hast thou and then he stopped but i knew the question that his lips dared not frame  the loyal fellow would not be the one to force from mine a confession of the terrible truth that i had returned from the bosom of the iss the river of mystery back from the shore of the lost sea of korus and the valley dor  ah my prince he continued as though no thought had interrupted his greeting that you are back is sufficient and let hor vastus sword have the high honour of being first at thy feet  with these words the noble fellow unbuckled his scabbard and flung his sword upon the ground before me  could you know the customs and the character of red martians you would appreciate the depth of meaning that that simple act conveyed to me and to all about us who witnessed it  the thing was equivalent to saying my sword my body my life my soul are yours to do with as you wish until death and after death i look to you alone for authority for my every act  be you right or wrong your word shall be my only truth whoso raises his hand against you must answer to my sword  it is the oath of fealty that men occasionally pay to a jeddak whose high character and chivalrous acts have inspired the enthusiastic love of his followers  never had i known this high tribute paid to a lesser mortal  there was but one response possible  i stooped and lifted the sword from the ground raised the hilt to my lips and then stepping to hor vastus i buckled the weapon upon him with my own hands  hor vastus i said placing my hand upon his shoulder you know best the promptings of your own heart  that i shall need your sword i have little doubt but accept from john carter upon his sacred honour the assurance that he will never call upon you to draw this sword other than in the cause of truth justice and righteousness  that i knew my prince he replied ere ever i threw my beloved blade at thy feet  as we spoke other fliers came and went between the ground and the battleship and presently a larger boat was launched from above one capable of carrying a dozen persons perhaps and dropped lightly near us  as she touched an officer sprang from her deck to the ground and advancing to hor vastus saluted  kantos kan desires that this party whom we have rescued be brought immediately to the deck of the xavarian he said  as we approached the little craft i looked about for the members of my party and for the first time noticed that thuvia was not among them questioning elicited the fact that none had seen her since carthoris had sent her thoat galloping madly toward the hills in the hope of carrying her out of harms way  immediately hor vastus dispatched a dozen air scouts in as many directions to search for her  it could not be possible that she had gone far since we had last seen her  we others stepped to the deck of the craft that had been sent to fetch us and a moment later were upon the xavarian  the first man to greet me was kantos kan himself  my old friend had won to the highest place in the navy of helium but he was still to me the same brave comrade who had shared with me the privations of a warhoon dungeon the terrible atrocities of the great games and later the dangers of our search for dejah thoris within the hostile city of zodanga  then i had been an unknown wanderer upon a strange planet and he a simple padwar in the navy of helium  today he commanded all heliums great terrors of the skies and i was a prince of the house of tardos mors jeddak of helium  he did not ask me where i had been  like hor vastus he too dreaded the truth and would not be the one to wrest a statement from me  that it must come some time he well knew but until it came he seemed satisfied to but know that i was with him once more  he greeted carthoris and tars tarkas with the keenest delight but he asked neither where he had been  he could scarcely keep his hands off the boy  you do not know john carter he said to me how we of helium love this son of yours  it is as though all the great love we bore his noble father and his poor mother had been centred in him  when it became known that he was lost ten million people wept  what mean you kantos kan i whispered by his poor mother for the words had seemed to carry a sinister meaning which i could not fathom  he drew me to one side  for a year he said ever since carthoris disappeared dejah thoris has grieved and mourned for her lost boy  the blow of years ago when you did not return from the atmosphere plant was lessened to some extent by the duties of motherhood for your son broke his white shell that very night  that she suffered terribly then all helium knew for did not all helium suffer with her the loss of her lord  but with the boy gone there was nothing left and after expedition upon expedition returned with the same hopeless tale of no clue as to his whereabouts our beloved princess drooped lower and lower until all who saw her felt that it could be but a matter of days ere she went to join her loved ones within the precincts of the valley dor  as a last resort mors kajak her father and tardos mors her grandfather took command of two mighty expeditions and a month ago sailed away to explore every inch of ground in the northern hemisphere of barsoom  for two weeks no word has come back from them but rumours were rife that they had met with a terrible disaster and that all were dead  about this time zat arrras renewed his importunities for her hand in marriage  he has been for ever after her since you disappeared  she hated him and feared him but with both her father and grandfather gone zat arrras was very powerful for he is still jed of zodanga to which position you will remember tardos mors appointed him after you had refused the honour  he had a secret audience with her six days ago  what took place none knows but the next day dejah thoris had disappeared and with her had gone a dozen of her household guard and body servants including sola the green womantars tarkas daughter you recall  no word left they of their intentions but it is always thus with those who go upon the voluntary pilgrimage from which none returns  we cannot think aught than that dejah thoris has sought the icy bosom of iss and that her devoted servants have chosen to accompany her  zat arrras was at helium when she disappeared  he commands this fleet which has been searching for her since  no trace of her have we found and i fear that it be a futile quest  while we talked hor vastus fliers were returning to the xavarian not one however had discovered a trace of thuvia  i was much depressed over the news of dejah thoris disappearance and now there was added the further burden of apprehension concerning the fate of this girl whom i believed to be the daughter of some proud barsoomian house and it had been my intention to make every effort to return her to her people  i was about to ask kantos kan to prosecute a further search for her when a flier from the flagship of the fleet arrived at the xavarian with an officer bearing a message to kantos kan from arrras  my friend read the dispatch and then turned to me  zat arrras commands me to bring our prisoners before him  there is naught else to do  he is supreme in helium yet it would be far more in keeping with chivalry and good taste were he to come hither and greet the saviour of barsoom with the honours that are his due  you know full well my friend i said smiling that zat arrras has good cause to hate me  nothing would please him better than to humiliate me and then to kill me  now that he has so excellent an excuse let us go and see if he has the courage to take advantage of it  summoning carthoris tars tarkas and xodar we entered the small flier with kantos kan and zat arrras officer and in a moment were stepping to the deck of zat arrras flagship  as we approached the jed of zodanga no sign of greeting or recognition crossed his face not even to carthoris did he vouchsafe a friendly word  his attitude was cold haughty and uncompromising  kaor zat arrras i said in greeting but he did not respond  why were these prisoners not disarmed he asked to kantos kan  they are not prisoners zat arrras replied the officer  two of them are of heliums noblest family  tars tarkas jeddak of thark is tardos mors best beloved ally  the other is a friend and companion of the prince of heliumthat is enough for me to know  it is not enough for me however retorted zat arrras  more must i hear from those who have taken the pilgrimage than their names  where have you been john carter  i have just come from the valley dor and the land of the first born zat arrras i replied  ah he exclaimed in evident pleasure you do not deny it then  you have returned from the bosom of iss  i have come back from a land of false hope from a valley of torture and death with my companions i have escaped from the hideous clutches of lying fiends  i have come back to the barsoom that i saved from a painless death to again save her but this time from death in its most frightful form  cease blasphemer cried zat arrras  hope not to save thy cowardly carcass by inventing horrid lies to but he got no further  one does not call john carter coward and liar thus lightly and zat arrras should have known it  before a hand could be raised to stop me i was at his side and one hand grasped his throat  come i from heaven or hell zat arrras you will find me still the same john carter that i have always been nor did ever man call me such names and livewithout apologizing and with that i commenced to bend him back across my knee and tighten my grip upon his throat  seize him cried zat arrras and a dozen officers sprang forward to assist him  kantos kan came close and whispered to me  desist i beg of you  it will but involve us all for i cannot see these men lay hands upon you without aiding you  my officers and men will join me and we shall have a mutiny then that may lead to the revolution  for the sake of tardos mors and helium desist  at his words i released zat arrras and turning my back upon him walked toward the ships rail  come kantos kan i said the prince of helium would return to the xavarian  none interfered  zat arrras stood white and trembling amidst his officers  some there were who looked upon him with scorn and drew toward me while one a man long in the service and confidence of tardos mors spoke to me in a low tone as i passed him  you may count my metal among your fightingmen john carter he said  i thanked him and passed on  in silence we embarked and shortly after stepped once more upon the deck of the xavarian  fifteen minutes later we received orders from the flagship to proceed toward helium  our journey thither was uneventful  carthoris and i were wrapped in the gloomiest of thoughts  kantos kan was sombre in contemplation of the further calamity that might fall upon helium should zat arrras attempt to follow the ageold precedent that allotted a terrible death to fugitives from the valley dor  tars tarkas grieved for the loss of his daughter  xodar alone was carefreea fugitive and outlaw he could be no worse off in helium than elsewhere  let us hope that we may at least go out with good red blood upon our blades he said  it was a simple wish and one most likely to be gratified  among the officers of the xavarian i thought i could discern division into factions ere we had reached helium  there were those who gathered about carthoris and myself whenever the opportunity presented while about an equal number held aloof from us  they offered us only the most courteous treatment but were evidently bound by their superstitious belief in the doctrine of dor and iss and korus  i could not blame them for i knew how strong a hold a creed however ridiculous it may be may gain upon an otherwise intelligent people  by returning from dor we had committed a sacrilege by recounting our adventures there and stating the facts as they existed we had outraged the religion of their fathers  we were blasphemerslying heretics even those who still clung to us from personal love and loyalty i think did so in the face of the fact that at heart they questioned our veracityit is very hard to accept a new religion for an old no matter how alluring the promises of the new may be but to reject the old as a tissue of falsehoods without being offered anything in its stead is indeed a most difficult thing to ask of any people  kantos kan would not talk of our experiences among the therns and the first born  it is enough he said that i jeopardize my life here and hereafter by countenancing you at alldo not ask me to add still further to my sins by listening to what i have always been taught was the rankest heresy  i knew that sooner or later the time must come when our friends and enemies would be forced to declare themselves openly  when we reached helium there must be an accounting and if tardos mors had not returned i feared that the enmity of zat arrras might weigh heavily against us for he represented the government of helium  to take sides against him were equivalent to treason  the majority of the troops would doubtless follow the lead of their officers and i knew that many of the highest and most powerful men of both land and air forces would cleave to john carter in the face of god man or devil  on the other hand the majority of the populace unquestionably would demand that we pay the penalty of our sacrilege  the outlook seemed dark from whatever angle i viewed it but my mind was so torn with anguish at the thought of dejah thoris that i realize now that i gave the terrible question of heliums plight but scant attention at that time  there was always before me day and night a horrible nightmare of the frightful scenes through which i knew my princess might even then be passingthe horrid plant menthe ferocious white apes  at times i would cover my face with my hands in a vain effort to shut out the fearful thing from my mind  it was in the forenoon that we arrived above the milehigh scarlet tower which marks greater helium from her twin city  as we descended in great circles toward the navy docks a mighty multitude could be seen surging in the streets beneath  helium had been notified by radioaerogram of our approach  from the deck of the xavarian we four carthoris tars tarkas xodar and i were transferred to a lesser flier to be transported to quarters within the temple of reward  it is here that martian justice is meted to benefactor and malefactor  here the hero is decorated  here the felon is condemned  we were taken into the temple from the landing stage upon the roof so that we did not pass among the people at all as is customary  always before i had seen prisoners of note or returned wanderers of eminence paraded from the gate of jeddaks to the temple of reward up the broad avenue of ancestors through dense crowds of jeering or cheering citizens  i knew that zat arrras dared not trust the people near to us for he feared that their love for carthoris and myself might break into a demonstration which would wipe out their superstitious horror of the crime we were to be charged with  what his plans were i could only guess but that they were sinister was evidenced by the fact that only his most trusted servitors accompanied us upon the flier to the temple of reward  we were lodged in a room upon the south side of the temple overlooking the avenue of ancestors down which we could see the full length to the gate of jeddaks five miles away  the people in the temple plaza and in the streets for a distance of a full mile were standing as close packed as it was possible for them to get  they were very orderlythere were neither scoffs nor plaudits and when they saw us at the window above them there were many who buried their faces in their arms and wept  late in the afternoon a messenger arrived from zat arrras to inform us that we would be tried by an impartial body of nobles in the great hall of the temple at the 1st zode on the following day or about 840 am earth time   wherever captain carter has used martian measurements of time distance weight and the like i have translated them into as nearly their equivalent in earthly values as is possible  his notes contain many martian tables and a great volume of scientific data but since the international astronomic society is at present engaged in classifying investigating and verifying this vast fund of remarkable and valuable information i have felt that it will add nothing to the interest of captain carters story or to the sum total of human knowledge to maintain a strict adherence to the original manuscript in these matters while it might readily confuse the reader and detract from the interest of the history  for those who may be interested however i will explain that the martian day is a trifle over 24 hours 37 minutes duration earth time  this the martians divide into ten equal parts commencing the day at about 6 am  earth time  the zodes are divided into fifty shorter periods each of which in turn is composed of 200 brief periods of time about equivalent to the earthly second  the barsoomian table of time as here given is but a part of the full table appearing in captain carters notes                   table     200 tals          1 xat     50 xats          1 zode     10 zodes          1 revolution of mars upon its axis     chapter xvii  the death sentence   a few moments before the appointed time on the following morning a strong guard of zat arrras officers appeared at our quarters to conduct us to the great hall of the temple  in twos we entered the chamber and marched down the broad aisle of hope as it is called to the platform in the centre of the hall before and behind us marched armed guards while three solid ranks of zodangan soldiery lined either side of the aisle from the entrance to the rostrum  as we reached the raised enclosure i saw our judges  as is the custom upon barsoom there were thirtyone supposedly selected by lot from men of the noble class for nobles were on trial  but to my amazement i saw no single friendly face among them  practically all were zodangans and it was i to whom zodanga owed her defeat at the hands of the green hordes and her subsequent vassalage to helium  there could be little justice here for john carter or his son or for the great thark who had commanded the savage tribesmen who overran zodangas broad avenues looting burning and murdering  about us the vast circular coliseum was packed to its full capacity all classes were representedall ages and both sexes  as we entered the hall the hum of subdued conversation ceased until as we halted upon the platform or throne of righteousness the silence of death enveloped the ten thousand spectators  the judges were seated in a great circle about the periphery of the circular platform  we were assigned seats with our backs toward a small platform in the exact centre of the larger one  this placed us facing the judges and the audience  upon the smaller platform each would take his place while his case was being heard  zat arrras himself sat in the golden chair of the presiding magistrate as we were seated and our guards retired to the foot of the stairway leading to the platform he arose and called my name  john carter he cried take your place upon the pedestal of truth to be judged impartially according to your acts and here to know the reward you have earned thereby then turning to and fro toward the audience he narrated the acts upon the value of which my reward was to be determined  know you o judges and people of helium he said that john carter one time prince of helium has returned by his own statement from the valley dor and even from the temple of issus itself  that in the presence of many men of helium he has blasphemed against the sacred iss and against the valley dor and the lost sea of korus and the holy therns themselves and even against issus goddess of death and of life eternal  and know you further by witness of thine own eyes that see him here now upon the pedestal of truth that he has indeed returned from these sacred precincts in the face of our ancient customs and in violation of the sanctity of our ancient religion  he who be once dead may not live again  he who attempts it must be made dead for ever  judges your duty lies plain before youhere can be no testimony in contravention of truth  what reward shall be meted to john carter in accordance with the acts he has committed  death shouted one of the judges  and then a man sprang to his feet in the audience and raising his hand on high cried justice  justice  justice it was kantos kan and as all eyes turned toward him he leaped past the zodangan soldiery and sprang upon the platform  what manner of justice be this he cried to zat arrras  the defendant has not been heard nor has he had an opportunity to call others in his behalf  in the name of the people of helium i demand fair and impartial treatment for the prince of helium  a great cry arose from the audience then justice  justice justice and zat arrras dared not deny them  speak then he snarled turning to me but blaspheme not against the things that are sacred upon barsoom  men of helium i cried turning to the spectators and speaking over the heads of my judges how can john carter expect justice from the men of zodanga  he cannot nor does he ask it  it is to the men of helium that he states his case nor does he appeal for mercy to any it is not in his own cause that he speaks nowit is in thine  in the cause of your wives and daughters and of wives and daughters yet unborn  it is to save them from the unthinkably atrocious indignities that i have seen heaped upon the fair women of barsoom in the place men call the temple of issus  it is to save them from the sucking embrace of the plant men from the fangs of the great white apes of dor from the cruel lust of the holy therns from all that the cold dead iss carries them to from homes of love and life and happiness  sits there no man here who does not know the history of john carter how he came among you from another world and rose from a prisoner among the green men through torture and persecution to a place high among the highest of barsoom  nor ever did you know john carter to lie in his own behalf or to say aught that might harm the people of barsoom or to speak lightly of the strange religion which he respected without understanding  there be no man here or elsewhere upon barsoom today who does not owe his life directly to a single act of mine in which i sacrificed myself and the happiness of my princess that you might live  and so men of helium i think that i have the right to demand that i be heard that i be believed and that you let me serve you and save you from the false hereafter of dor and issus as i saved you from the real death that other day  it is to you of helium that i speak now  when i am done let the men of zodanga have their will with me  zat arrras has taken my sword from me so the men of zodanga no longer fear me  will you listen  speak john carter prince of helium cried a great noble from the audience and the multitude echoed his permission until the building rocked with the noise of their demonstration  zat arrras knew better than to interfere with such a sentiment as was expressed that day in the temple of reward and so for two hours i talked with the people of helium  but when i had finished zat arrras arose and turning to the judges said in a low tone my nobles you have heard john carters plea every opportunity has been given him to prove his innocence if he be not guilty but instead he has but utilized the time in further blasphemy  what gentlemen is your verdict  death to the blasphemer cried one springing to his feet and in an instant the entire thirtyone judges were on their feet with upraised swords in token of the unanimity of their verdict  if the people did not hear zat arrras charge they certainly did hear the verdict of the tribunal  a sullen murmur rose louder and louder about the packed coliseum and then kantos kan who had not left the platform since first he had taken his place near me raised his hand for silence  when he could be heard he spoke to the people in a cool and level voice  you have heard the fate that the men of zodanga would mete to heliums noblest hero  it may be the duty of the men of helium to accept the verdict as final  let each man act according to his own heart  here is the answer of kantos kan head of the navy of helium to zat arrras and his judges and with that he unbuckled his scabbard and threw his sword at my feet  in an instant soldiers and citizens officers and nobles were crowding past the soldiers of zodanga and forcing their way to the throne of righteousness  a hundred men surged up on the platform and a hundred blades rattled and clanked to the floor at my feet  zat arrras and his officers were furious but they were helpless  one by one i raised the swords to my lips and buckled them again upon their owners  come said kantos kan we will escort john carter and his party to his own palace and they formed about us and started toward the stairs leading to the aisle of hope  stop cried zat arrras  soldiers of helium let no prisoner leave the throne of righteousness  the soldiery from zodanga were the only organized body of heliumetic troops within the temple so zat arrras was confident that his orders would be obeyed but i do not think that he looked for the opposition that was raised the moment the soldiers advanced toward the throne  from every quarter of the coliseum swords flashed and men rushed threateningly upon the zodangans  some one raised a cry tardos mors is deada thousand years to john carter jeddak of helium as i heard that and saw the ugly attitude of the men of helium toward the soldiers of zat arrras i knew that only a miracle could avert a clash that would end in civil war  hold i cried leaping to the pedestal of truth once more  let no man move till i am done  a single sword thrust here today may plunge helium into a bitter and bloody war the results of which none can foresee  it will turn brother against brother and father against son no mans life is worth that sacrifice  rather would i submit to the biased judgment of zat arrras than be the cause of civil strife in helium  let us each give in a point to the other and let this entire matter rest until tardos mors returns or mors kajak his son  if neither be back at the end of a year a second trial may be heldthe thing has a precedent  and then turning to zat arrras i said in a low voice unless you be a bigger fool than i take you to be you will grasp the chance i am offering you ere it is too late  once that multitude of swords below is drawn against your soldiery no man upon barsoomnot even tardos mors himselfcan avert the consequences  what say you speak quickly  the jed of zodangan helium raised his voice to the angry sea beneath us  stay your hands men of helium he shouted his voice trembling with rage  the sentence of the court is passed but the day of retribution has not been set  i zat arrras jed of zodanga appreciating the royal connections of the prisoner and his past services to helium and barsoom grant a respite of one year or until the return of mors kajak or tardos mors to helium  disperse quietly to your houses  go  no one moved  instead they stood in tense silence with their eyes fastened upon me as though waiting for a signal to attack  clear the temple commanded zat arrras in a low tone to one of his officers  fearing the result of an attempt to carry out this order by force i stepped to the edge of the platform and pointing toward the main entrance bid them pass out  as one man they turned at my request and filed silent and threatening past the soldiers of zat arrras jed of zodanga who stood scowling in impotent rage  kantos kan with the others who had sworn allegiance to me still stood upon the throne of righteousness with me  come said kantos kan to me we will escort you to your palace my prince  come carthoris and xodar  come tars tarkas  and with a haughty sneer for zat arrras upon his handsome lips he turned and strode to the throne steps and up the aisle of hope  we four and the hundred loyal ones followed behind him nor was a hand raised to stay us though glowering eyes followed our triumphal march through the temple  in the avenues we found a press of people but they opened a pathway for us and many were the swords that were flung at my feet as i passed through the city of helium toward my palace upon the outskirts  here my old slaves fell upon their knees and kissed my hands as i greeted them  they cared not where i had been  it was enough that i had returned to them  ah master cried one if our divine princess were but here this would be a day indeed  tears came to my eyes so that i was forced to turn away that i might hide my emotions  carthoris wept openly as the slaves pressed about him with expressions of affection and words of sorrow for our common loss  it was now that tars tarkas for the first time learned that his daughter sola had accompanied dejah thoris upon the last long pilgrimage  i had not had the heart to tell him what kantos kan had told me  with the stoicism of the green martian he showed no sign of suffering yet i knew that his grief was as poignant as my own  in marked contrast to his kind he had in welldeveloped form the kindlier human characteristics of love friendship and charity  it was a sad and sombre party that sat at the feast of welcome in the great dining hall of the palace of the prince of helium that day  we were over a hundred strong not counting the members of my little court for dejah thoris and i had maintained a household consistent with our royal rank  the board according to red martian custom was triangular for there were three in our family  carthoris and i presided in the centre of our sides of the tablemidway of the third side dejah thoris highbacked carven chair stood vacant except for her gorgeous wedding trappings and jewels which were draped upon it  behind stood a slave as in the days when his mistress had occupied her place at the board ready to do her bidding  it was the way upon barsoom so i endured the anguish of it though it wrung my heart to see that silent chair where should have been my laughing and vivacious princess keeping the great hall ringing with her merry gaiety  at my right sat kantos kan while to the right of dejah thoris empty place tars tarkas sat in a huge chair before a raised section of the board which years ago i had had constructed to meet the requirements of his mighty bulk  the place of honour at a martian hoard is always at the hostesss right and this place was ever reserved by dejah thoris for the great thark upon the occasions that he was in helium  hor vastus sat in the seat of honour upon carthoris side of the table there was little general conversation  it was a quiet and saddened party  the loss of dejah thoris was still fresh in the minds of all and to this was added fear for the safety of tardos mors and mors kajak as well as doubt and uncertainty as to the fate of helium should it prove true that she was permanently deprived of her great jeddak  suddenly our attention was attracted by the sound of distant shouting as of many people raising their voices at once but whether in anger or rejoicing we could not tell  nearer and nearer came the tumult  a slave rushed into the dining hall to cry that a great concourse of people was swarming through the palace gates  a second burst upon the heels of the first alternately laughing and shrieking as a madman  dejah thoris is found he cried  a messenger from dejah thoris  i waited to hear no more  the great windows of the dining hall overlooked the avenue leading to the main gatesthey were upon the opposite side of the hall from me with the table intervening  i did not waste time in circling the great boardwith a single leap i cleared table and diners and sprang upon the balcony beyond  thirty feet below lay the scarlet sward of the lawn and beyond were many people crowding about a great thoat which bore a rider headed toward the palace  i vaulted to the ground below and ran swiftly toward the advancing party  as i came near to them i saw that the figure on the thoat was sola  where is the princess of helium i cried  the green girl slid from her mighty mount and ran toward me  o my prince  my prince she cried  she is gone for ever  even now she may be a captive upon the lesser moon  the black pirates of barsoom have stolen her     chapter xviii  solas story   once within the palace i drew sola to the dining hall and when she had greeted her father after the formal manner of the green men she told the story of the pilgrimage and capture of dejah thoris  seven days ago after her audience with zat arrras dejah thoris attempted to slip from the palace in the dead of night  although i had not heard the outcome of her interview with zat arrras i knew that something had occurred then to cause her the keenest mental agony and when i discovered her creeping from the palace i did not need to be told her destination  hastily arousing a dozen of her most faithful guards i explained my fears to them and as one they enlisted with me to follow our beloved princess in her wanderings even to the sacred iss and the valley dor we came upon her but a short distance from the palace  with her was faithful woola the hound but none other  when we overtook her she feigned anger and ordered us back to the palace but for once we disobeyed her and when she found that we would not let her go upon the last long pilgrimage alone she wept and embraced us and together we went out into the night toward the south  the following day we came upon a herd of small thoats and thereafter we were mounted and made good time  we travelled very fast and very far due south until the morning of the fifth day we sighted a great fleet of battleships sailing north  they saw us before we could seek shelter and soon we were surrounded by a horde of black men  the princesss guard fought nobly to the end but they were soon overcome and slain  only dejah thoris and i were spared  when she realized that she was in the clutches of the black pirates she attempted to take her own life but one of the blacks tore her dagger from her and then they bound us both so that we could not use our hands  the fleet continued north after capturing us  there were about twenty large battleships in all besides a number of small swift cruisers that evening one of the smaller cruisers that had been far in advance of the fleet returned with a prisonera young red woman whom they had picked up in a range of hills under the very noses they said of a fleet of three red martian battleships  from scraps of conversation which we overheard it was evident that the black pirates were searching for a party of fugitives that had escaped them several days prior  that they considered the capture of the young woman important was evident from the long and earnest interview the commander of the fleet held with her when she was brought to him later she was bound and placed in the compartment with dejah thoris and myself  the new captive was a very beautiful girl  she told dejah thoris that many years ago she had taken the voluntary pilgrimage from the court of her father the jeddak of ptarth  she was thuvia the princess of ptarth  and then she asked dejah thoris who she might be and when she heard she fell upon her knees and kissed dejah thoris fettered hands and told her that that very morning she had been with john carter prince of helium and carthoris her son  dejah thoris could not believe her at first but finally when the girl had narrated all the strange adventures that had befallen her since she had met john carter and told her of the things john carter and carthoris and xodar had narrated of their adventures in the land of the first born dejah thoris knew that it could be none other than the prince of helium for who she said upon all barsoom other than john carter could have done the deeds you tell of and when thuvia told dejah thoris of her love for john carter and his loyalty and devotion to the princess of his choice dejah thoris broke down and weptcursing zat arrras and the cruel fate that had driven her from helium but a few brief days before the return of her beloved lord  i do not blame you for loving him thuvia she said and that your affection for him is pure and sincere i can well believe from the candour of your avowal of it to me  the fleet continued north nearly to helium but last night they evidently realized that john carter had indeed escaped them and so they turned toward the south once more  shortly thereafter a guard entered our compartment and dragged me to the deck  there is no place in the land of the first born for a green one he said and with that he gave me a terrific shove that carried me toppling from the deck of the battleship  evidently this seemed to him the easiest way of ridding the vessel of my presence and killing me at the same time  but a kind fate intervened and by a miracle i escaped with but slight bruises  the ship was moving slowly at the time and as i lunged overboard into the darkness beneath i shuddered at the awful plunge i thought awaited me for all day the fleet had sailed thousands of feet above the ground but to my utter surprise i struck upon a soft mass of vegetation not twenty feet from the deck of the ship  in fact the keel of the vessel must have been grazing the surface of the ground at the time  i lay all night where i had fallen and the next morning brought an explanation of the fortunate coincidence that had saved me from a terrible death  as the sun rose i saw a vast panorama of sea bottom and distant hills lying far below me  i was upon the highest peak of a lofty range  the fleet in the darkness of the preceding night had barely grazed the crest of the hills and in the brief span that they hovered close to the surface the black guard had pitched me as he supposed to my death  a few miles west of me was a great waterway  when i reached it i found to my delight that it belonged to helium  here a thoat was procured for methe rest you know  for many minutes none spoke  dejah thoris in the clutches of the first born  i shuddered at the thought but of a sudden the old fire of unconquerable selfconfidence surged through me  i sprang to my feet and with backthrown shoulders and upraised sword took a solemn vow to reach rescue and revenge my princess  a hundred swords leaped from a hundred scabbards and a hundred fightingmen sprang to the tabletop and pledged me their lives and fortunes to the expedition  already my plans were formulated  i thanked each loyal friend and leaving carthoris to entertain them withdrew to my own audience chamber with kantos kan tars tarkas xodar and hor vastus  here we discussed the details of our expedition until long after dark xodar was positive that issus would choose both dejah thoris and thuvia to serve her for a year  for that length of time at least they will be comparatively safe he said and we will at least know where to look for them  in the matter of equipping a fleet to enter omean the details were left to kantos kan and xodar  the former agreed to take such vessels as we required into dock as rapidly as possible where xodar would direct their equipment with water propellers  for many years the black had been in charge of the refitting of captured battleships that they might navigate omean and so was familiar with the construction of the propellers housings and the auxiliary gearing required  it was estimated that it would require six months to complete our preparations in view of the fact that the utmost secrecy must be maintained to keep the project from the ears of zat arrras  kantos kan was confident now that the mans ambitions were fully aroused and that nothing short of the title of jeddak of helium would satisfy him  i doubt he said if he would even welcome dejah thoris return for it would mean another nearer the throne than he  with you and carthoris out of the way there would be little to prevent him from assuming the title of jeddak and you may rest assured that so long as he is supreme here there is no safety for either of you  there is a way cried hor vastus to thwart him effectually and for ever  what i asked  he smiled  i shall whisper it here but some day i shall stand upon the dome of the temple of reward and shout it to cheering multitudes below  what do you mean asked kantos kan  john carter jeddak of helium said hor vastus in a low voice  the eyes of my companions lighted and grim smiles of pleasure and anticipation overspread their faces as each eye turned toward me questioningly  but i shook my head  no my friends i said smiling i thank you but it cannot be  not yet at least  when we know that tardos mors and mors kajak are gone to return no more if i be here then i shall join you all to see that the people of helium are permitted to choose fairly their next jeddak whom they choose may count upon the loyalty of my sword nor shall i seek the honour for myself  until then tardos mors is jeddak of helium and zat arrras is his representative  as you will john carter said hor vastus butwhat was that he whispered pointing toward the window overlooking the gardens  the words were scarce out of his mouth ere he had sprung to the balcony without  there he goes he cried excitedly  the guards  below there  the guards  we were close behind him and all saw the figure of a man run quickly across a little piece of sward and disappear in the shrubbery beyond  he was on the balcony when i first saw him cried hor vastus quick  let us follow him  together we ran to the gardens but even though we scoured the grounds with the entire guard for hours no trace could we find of the night marauder  what do you make of it kantos kan asked tars tarkas  a spy sent by zat arrras he replied  it was ever his way  he will have something interesting to report to his master then laughed hor vastus  i hope he heard only our references to a new jeddak i said  if he overheard our plans to rescue dejah thoris it will mean civil war for he will attempt to thwart us and in that i will not be thwarted there would i turn against tardos mors himself were it necessary  if it throws all helium into a bloody conflict i shall go on with these plans to save my princess  nothing shall stay me now short of death and should i die my friends will you take oath to prosecute the search for her and bring her back in safety to her grandfathers court  upon the hilt of his sword each of them swore to do as i had asked  it was agreed that the battleships that were to be remodelled should be ordered to hastor another heliumetic city far to the southwest kantos kan thought that the docks there in addition to their regular work would accommodate at least six battleships at a time  as he was commanderinchief of the navy it would be a simple matter for him to order the vessels there as they could be handled and thereafter keep the remodelled fleet in remote parts of the empire until we should be ready to assemble it for the dash upon omean  it was late that night before our conference broke up but each man there had his particular duties outlined and the details of the entire plan had been mapped out  kantos kan and xodar were to attend to the remodelling of the ships tars tarkas was to get into communication with thark and learn the sentiments of his people toward his return from dor  if favourable he was to repair immediately to thark and devote his time to the assembling of a great horde of green warriors whom it was our plan to send in transports directly to the valley dor and the temple of issus while the fleet entered omean and destroyed the vessels of the first born  upon hor vastus devolved the delicate mission of organising a secret force of fightingmen sworn to follow john carter wherever he might lead  as we estimated that it would require over a million men to man the thousand great battleships we intended to use on omean and the transports for the green men as well as the ships that were to convoy the transports it was no trifling job that hor vastus had before him  after they had left i bid carthoris goodnight for i was very tired and going to my own apartments bathed and lay down upon my sleeping silks and furs for the first good nights sleep i had had an opportunity to look forward to since i had returned to barsoom  but even now i was to be disappointed  how long i slept i do not know  when i awoke suddenly it was to find a halfdozen powerful men upon me a gag already in my mouth and a moment later my arms and legs securely bound  so quickly had they worked and to such good purpose that i was utterly beyond the power to resist them by the time i was fully awake  never a word spoke they and the gag effectually prevented me speaking silently they lifted me and bore me toward the door of my chamber  as they passed the window through which the farther moon was casting its brilliant beams i saw that each of the party had his face swathed in layers of silki could not recognize one of them  when they had come into the corridor with me they turned toward a secret panel in the wall which led to the passage that terminated in the pits beneath the palace  that any knew of this panel outside my own household i was doubtful  yet the leader of the band did not hesitate a moment  he stepped directly to the panel touched the concealed button and as the door swung open he stood aside while his companions entered with me  then he closed the panel behind him and followed us  down through the passageways to the pits we went  the leader rapped upon it with the hilt of his swordthree quick sharp blows a pause then three more another pause and then two  a second later the wall swung in and i was pushed within a brilliantly lighted chamber in which sat three richly trapped men  one of them turned toward me with a sardonic smile upon his thin cruel lipsit was zat arrras     chapter xix  black despair   ah said zat arrras to what kindly circumstance am i indebted for the pleasure of this unexpected visit from the prince of helium  while he was speaking one of my guards had removed the gag from my mouth but i made no reply to zat arrras simply standing there in silence with level gaze fixed upon the jed of zodanga  and i doubt not that my expression was coloured by the contempt i felt for the man  the eyes of those within the chamber were fixed first upon me and then upon zat arrras until finally a flush of anger crept slowly over his face  you may go he said to those who had brought me and when only his two companions and ourselves were left in the chamber he spoke to me again in a voice of icevery slowly and deliberately with many pauses as though he would choose his words cautiously  john carter he said by the edict of custom by the law of our religion and by the verdict of an impartial court you are condemned to die  the people cannot save youi alone may accomplish that  you are absolutely in my power to do with as i wishi may kill you or i may free you and should i elect to kill you none would be the wiser  should you go free in helium for a year in accordance with the conditions of your reprieve there is little fear that the people would ever insist upon the execution of the sentence imposed upon you  you may go free within two minutes upon one condition  tardos mors will never return to helium  neither will mors kajak nor dejah thoris  helium must select a new jeddak within the year  zat arrras would be jeddak of helium  say that you will espouse my cause  this is the price of your freedom  i am done  i knew it was within the scope of zat arrras cruel heart to destroy me and if i were dead i could see little reason to doubt that he might easily become jeddak of helium  free i could prosecute the search for dejah thoris  were i dead my brave comrades might not be able to carry out our plans  so by refusing to accede to his request it was quite probable that not only would i not prevent him from becoming jeddak of helium but that i would be the means of sealing dejah thoris fateof consigning her through my refusal to the horrors of the arena of issus  for a moment i was perplexed but for a moment only  the proud daughter of a thousand jeddaks would choose death to a dishonorable alliance such as this nor could john carter do less for helium than his princess would do  then i turned to zat arrras  there can be no alliance i said between a traitor to helium and a prince of the house of tardos mors  i do not believe zat arrras that the great jeddak is dead  zat arrras shrugged his shoulders  it will not be long john carter he said that your opinions will be of interest even to yourself so make the best of them while you can  zat arrras will permit you in due time to reflect further upon the magnanimous offer he has made you  into the silence and darkness of the pits you will enter upon your reflection this night with the knowledge that should you fail within a reasonable time to agree to the alternative which has been offered you never shall you emerge from the darkness and the silence again  nor shall you know at what minute the hand will reach out through the darkness and the silence with the keen dagger that shall rob you of your last chance to win again the warmth and the freedom and joyousness of the outer world  zat arrras clapped his hands as he ceased speaking  the guards returned  zat arrras waved his hand in my direction  to the pits he said  that was all  four men accompanied me from the chamber and with a radium handlight to illumine the way escorted me through seemingly interminable tunnels down ever down beneath the city of helium  at length they halted within a fairsized chamber  there were rings set in the rocky walls  to them chains were fastened and at the ends of many of the chains were human skeletons  one of these they kicked aside and unlocking the huge padlock that had held a chain about what had once been a human ankle they snapped the iron band about my own leg  then they left me taking the light with them  utter darkness prevailed  for a few minutes i could hear the clanking of accoutrements but even this grew fainter and fainter until at last the silence was as complete as the darkness  i was alone with my gruesome companionswith the bones of dead men whose fate was likely but the index of my own  how long i stood listening in the darkness i do not know but the silence was unbroken and at last i sunk to the hard floor of my prison where leaning my head against the stony wall i slept  it must have been several hours later that i awakened to find a young man standing before me  in one hand he bore a light in the other a receptacle containing a gruellike mixturethe common prison fare of barsoom  zat arrras sends you greetings said the young man and commands me to inform you that though he is fully advised of the plot to make you jeddak of helium he is however not inclined to withdraw the offer which he has made you  to gain your freedom you have but to request me to advise zat arrras that you accept the terms of his proposition  i but shook my head  the youth said no more and after placing the food upon the floor at my side returned up the corridor taking the light with him  twice a day for many days this youth came to my cell with food and ever the same greetings from zat arrras  for a long time i tried to engage him in conversation upon other matters but he would not talk and so at length i desisted  for months i sought to devise methods to inform carthoris of my whereabouts  for months i scraped and scraped upon a single link of the massive chain which held me hoping eventually to wear it through that i might follow the youth back through the winding tunnels to a point where i could make a break for liberty  i was beside myself with anxiety for knowledge of the progress of the expedition which was to rescue dejah thoris  i felt that carthoris would not let the matter drop were he free to act but in so far as i knew he also might be a prisoner in zat arrras pits  that zat arrras spy had overheard our conversation relative to the selection of a new jeddak i knew and scarcely a halfdozen minutes prior we had discussed the details of the plan to rescue dejah thoris the chances were that that matter too was well known to him carthoris kantos kan tars tarkas hor vastus and xodar might even now be the victims of zat arrras assassins or else his prisoners  i determined to make at least one more effort to learn something and to this end i adopted strategy when next the youth came to my cell  i had noticed that he was a handsome fellow about the size and age of carthoris  and i had also noticed that his shabby trappings but illy comported with his dignified and noble bearing  it was with these observations as a basis that i opened my negotiations with him upon his next subsequent visit  you have been very kind to me during my imprisonment here i said to him and as i feel that i have at best but a very short time to live i wish ere it is too late to furnish substantial testimony of my appreciation of all that you have done to render my imprisonment bearable  promptly you have brought my food each day seeing that it was pure and of sufficient quantity  never by word or deed have you attempted to take advantage of my defenceless condition to insult or torture me you have been uniformly courteous and considerateit is this more than any other thing which prompts my feeling of gratitude and my desire to give you some slight token of it  in the guardroom of my palace are many fine trappings  go thou there and select the harness which most pleases youit shall be yours  all i ask is that you wear it that i may know that my wish has been realized  tell me that you will do it  the boys eyes had lighted with pleasure as i spoke and i saw him glance from his rusty trappings to the magnificence of my own  for a moment he stood in thought before he spoke and for that moment my heart fairly ceased beatingso much for me there was which hung upon the substance of his answer  and i went to the palace of the prince of helium with any such demand they would laugh at me and into the bargain would more than likely throw me headforemost into the avenue  no it cannot be though i thank you for the offer  why if zat arrras even dreamed that i contemplated such a thing he would have my heart cut out of me  there can be no harm in it my boy i urged  by night you may go to my palace with a note from me to carthoris my son  you may read the note before you deliver it that you may know that it contains nothing harmful to zat arrras  my son will be discreet and so none but us three need know  it is very simple and such a harmless act that it could be condemned by no one  again he stood silently in deep thought  and there is a jewelled shortsword which i took from the body of a northern jeddak  when you get the harness see that carthoris gives you that also  with it and the harness which you may select there will be no more handsomely accoutred warrior in all zodanga  bring writing materials when you come next to my cell and within a few hours we shall see you garbed in a style befitting your birth and carriage  still in thought and without speaking he turned and left me  i could not guess what his decision might be and for hours i sat fretting over the outcome of the matter  if he accepted a message to carthoris it would mean to me that carthoris still lived and was free  if the youth returned wearing the harness and the sword i would know that carthoris had received my note and that he knew that i still lived  that the bearer of the note was a zodangan would be sufficient to explain to carthoris that i was a prisoner of zat arrras  it was with feelings of excited expectancy which i could scarce hide that i heard the youths approach upon the occasion of his next regular visit  i did not speak beyond my accustomed greeting of him  as he placed the food upon the floor by my side he also deposited writing materials at the same time  my heart fairly bounded for joy  i had won my point  for a moment i looked at the materials in feigned surprise but soon i permitted an expression of dawning comprehension to come into my face and then picking them up i penned a brief order to carthoris to deliver to parthak a harness of his selection and the shortsword which i described  that was all  but it meant everything to me and to carthoris  i laid the note open upon the floor  parthak picked it up and without a word left me  as nearly as i could estimate i had at this time been in the pits for three hundred days  if anything was to be done to save dejah thoris it must be done quickly for were she not already dead her end must soon come since those whom issus chose lived but a single year  the next time i heard approaching footsteps i could scarce await to see if parthak wore the harness and the sword but judge if you can my chagrin and disappointment when i saw that he who bore my food was not parthak  what has become of parthak i asked but the fellow would not answer and as soon as he had deposited my food turned and retraced his steps to the world above  days came and went and still my new jailer continued his duties nor would he ever speak a word to me either in reply to the simplest question or of his own initiative  i could only speculate on the cause of parthaks removal but that it was connected in some way directly with the note i had given him was most apparent to me  after all my rejoicing i was no better off than before for now i did not even know that carthoris lived for if parthak had wished to raise himself in the estimation of zat arrras he would have permitted me to go on precisely as i did so that he could carry my note to his master in proof of his own loyalty and devotion  thirty days had passed since i had given the youth the note  three hundred and thirty days had passed since my incarceration  as closely as i could figure there remained a bare thirty days ere dejah thoris would be ordered to the arena for the rites of issus  as the terrible picture forced itself vividly across my imagination i buried my face in my arms and only with the greatest difficulty was it that i repressed the tears that welled to my eyes despite my every effort  to think of that beautiful creature torn and rended by the cruel fangs of the hideous white apes  it was unthinkable  such a horrid fact could not be and yet my reason told me that within thirty days my incomparable princess would be fought over in the arena of the first born by those very wild beasts that her bleeding corpse would be dragged through the dirt and the dust until at last a part of it would be rescued to be served as food upon the tables of the black nobles  i think that i should have gone crazy but for the sound of my approaching jailer  it distracted my attention from the terrible thoughts that had been occupying my entire mind  now a new and grim determination came to me  i would make one superhuman effort to escape  kill my jailer by a ruse and trust to fate to lead me to the outer world in safety  with the thought came instant action  i threw myself upon the floor of my cell close by the wall in a strained and distorted posture as though i were dead after a struggle or convulsions  when he should stoop over me i had but to grasp his throat with one hand and strike him a terrific blow with the slack of my chain which i gripped firmly in my right hand for the purpose  nearer and nearer came the doomed man  now i heard him halt before me there was a muttered exclamation and then a step as he came to my side  i felt him kneel beside me  my grip tightened upon the chain he leaned close to me  i must open my eyes to find his throat grasp it and strike one mighty final blow all at the same instant  the thing worked just as i had planned  so brief was the interval between the opening of my eyes and the fall of the chain that i could not check it though in that minute interval i recognized the face so close to mine as that of my son carthoris  god  what cruel and malign fate had worked to such a frightful end what devious chain of circumstances had led my boy to my side at this one particular minute of our lives when i could strike him down and kill him in ignorance of his identity  a benign though tardy providence blurred my vision and my mind as i sank into unconsciousness across the lifeless body of my only son  when i regained consciousness it was to feel a cool firm hand pressed upon my forehead  for an instant i did not open my eyes  i was endeavouring to gather the loose ends of many thoughts and memories which flitted elusively through my tired and overwrought brain  at length came the cruel recollection of the thing that i had done in my last conscious act and then i dared not to open my eyes for fear of what i should see lying beside me  i wondered who it could be who ministered to me  carthoris must have had a companion whom i had not seen  well i must face the inevitable some time so why not now and with a sigh i opened my eyes  leaning over me was carthoris a great bruise upon his forehead where the chain had struck but alive thank god alive  there was no one with him  reaching out my arms i took my boy within them and if ever there arose from any planet a fervent prayer of gratitude it was there beneath the crust of dying mars as i thanked the eternal mystery for my sons life  the brief instant in which i had seen and recognized carthoris before the chain fell must have been ample to check the force of the blow  he told me that he had lain unconscious for a timehow long he did not know  how came you here at all i asked mystified that he had found me without a guide  it was by your wit in apprising me of your existence and imprisonment through the youth parthak  until he came for his harness and his sword we had thought you dead  when i had read your note i did as you had bid giving parthak his choice of the harnesses in the guardroom and later bringing the jewelled shortsword to him but the minute that i had fulfilled the promise you evidently had made him my obligation to him ceased  then i commenced to question him but he would give me no information as to your whereabouts  he was intensely loyal to zat arrras  finally i gave him a fair choice between freedom and the pits beneath the palacethe price of freedom to be full information as to where you were imprisoned and directions which would lead us to you but still he maintained his stubborn partisanship  despairing i had him removed to the pits where he still is  no threats of torture or death no bribes however fabulous would move him  his only reply to all our importunities was that whenever parthak died were it tomorrow or a thousand years hence no man could truly say a traitor is gone to his deserts  finally xodar who is a fiend for subtle craftiness evolved a plan whereby we might worm the information from him  and so i caused hor vastus to be harnessed in the metal of a zodangan soldier and chained in parthaks cell beside him  for fifteen days the noble hor vastus has languished in the darkness of the pits but not in vain  little by little he won the confidence and friendship of the zodangan until only today parthak thinking that he was speaking not only to a countryman but to a dear friend revealed to hor vastus the exact cell in which you lay  it took me but a short time to locate the plans of the pits of helium among the official papers  to come to you though was a trifle more difficult matter  as you know while all the pits beneath the city are connected there are but single entrances from those beneath each section and its neighbour and that at the upper level just underneath the ground  of course these openings which lead from contiguous pits to those beneath government buildings are always guarded and so while i easily came to the entrance to the pits beneath the palace which zat arrras is occupying i found there a zodangan soldier on guard  there i left him when i had gone by but his soul was no longer with him  and here i am just in time to be nearly killed by you he ended laughing  as he talked carthoris had been working at the lock which held my fetters and now with an exclamation of pleasure he dropped the end of the chain to the floor and i stood up once more freed from the galling irons i had chafed in for almost a year  he had brought a longsword and a dagger for me and thus armed we set out upon the return journey to my palace  at the point where we left the pits of zat arrras we found the body of the guard carthoris had slain  it had not yet been discovered and in order to still further delay search and mystify the jeds people we carried the body with us for a short distance hiding it in a tiny cell off the main corridor of the pits beneath an adjoining estate  some halfhour later we came to the pits beneath our own palace and soon thereafter emerged into the audience chamber itself where we found kantos kan tars tarkas hor vastus and xodar awaiting us most impatiently  no time was lost in fruitless recounting of my imprisonment  what i desired to know was how well the plans we had laid nearly a year ago had been carried out  it has taken much longer than we had expected replied kantos kan the fact that we were compelled to maintain utter secrecy has handicapped us terribly  zat arrras spies are everywhere  yet to the best of my knowledge no word of our real plans has reached the villains ear  tonight there lies about the great docks at hastor a fleet of a thousand of the mightiest battleships that ever sailed above barsoom and each equipped to navigate the air of omean and the waters of omean itself  upon each battleship there are five tenman cruisers and ten fiveman scouts and a hundred oneman scouts in all one hundred and sixteen thousand craft fitted with both air and water propellers  at thark lie the transports for the green warriors of tars tarkas nine hundred large troopships and with them their convoys  seven days ago all was in readiness but we waited in the hope that by so doing your rescue might be encompassed in time for you to command the expedition  it is well we waited my prince  how is it tars tarkas i asked that the men of thark take not the accustomed action against one who returns from the bosom of iss  they sent a council of fifty chieftains to talk with me here replied the thark  we are a just people and when i had told them the entire story they were as one man in agreeing that their action toward me would be guided by the action of helium toward john carter  in the meantime at their request i was to resume my throne as jeddak of thark that i might negotiate with neighboring hordes for warriors to compose the land forces of the expedition  i have done that which i agreed  two hundred and fifty thousand fighting men gathered from the ice cap at the north to the ice cap at the south and representing a thousand different communities from a hundred wild and warlike hordes fill the great city of thark tonight  they are ready to sail for the land of the first born when i give the word and fight there until i bid them stop  all they ask is the loot they take and transportation to their own territories when the fighting and the looting are over  i am done  and thou hor vastus i asked what has been thy success  a million veteran fightingmen from heliums thin waterways man the battleships the transports and the convoys he replied  each is sworn to loyalty and secrecy nor were enough recruited from a single district to cause suspicion  good i cried  each has done his duty and now kantos kan may we not repair at once to hastor and get under way before tomorrows sun  we should lose no time prince replied kantos kan  already the people of hastor are questioning the purpose of so great a fleet fully manned with fightingmen  i wonder much that word of it has not before reached zat arrras  a cruiser awaits above at your own dock let us leave at a fusillade of shots from the palace gardens just without cut short his further words  together we rushed to the balcony in time to see a dozen members of my palace guard disappear in the shadows of some distant shrubbery as in pursuit of one who fled  directly beneath us upon the scarlet sward a handful of guardsmen were stooping above a still and prostrate form  while we watched they lifted the figure in their arms and at my command bore it to the audience chamber where we had been in council  when they stretched the body at our feet we saw that it was that of a red man in the prime of lifehis metal was plain such as common soldiers wear or those who wish to conceal their identity  another of zat arrras spies said hor vastus  so it would seem i replied and then to the guard you may remove the body  wait said xodar  if you will prince ask that a cloth and a little thoat oil be brought  i nodded to one of the soldiers who left the chamber returning presently with the things that xodar had requested  the black kneeled beside the body and dipping a corner of the cloth in the thoat oil rubbed for a moment on the dead face before him then he turned to me with a smile pointing to his work  i looked and saw that where xodar had applied the thoat oil the face was white as white as mine and then xodar seized the black hair of the corpse and with a sudden wrench tore it all away revealing a hairless pate beneath  guardsmen and nobles pressed close about the silent witness upon the marble floor  many were the exclamations of astonishment and questioning wonder as xodars acts confirmed the suspicion which he had held  a thern whispered tars tarkas  worse than that i fear replied xodar  but let us see  with that he drew his dagger and cut open a locked pouch which had dangled from the therns harness and from it he brought forth a circlet of gold set with a large gemit was the mate to that which i had taken from sator throg  he was a holy thern said xodar  fortunate indeed it is for us that he did not escape  the officer of the guard entered the chamber at this juncture  my prince he said i have to report that this fellows companion escaped us  i think that it was with the connivance of one or more of the men at the gate  i have ordered them all under arrest  xodar handed him the thoat oil and cloth  with this you may discover the spy among you he said  i at once ordered a secret search within the city for every martian noble maintains a secret service of his own  a halfhour later the officer of the guard came again to report  this time it was to confirm our worst fearshalf the guards at the gate that night had been therns disguised as red men  come i cried  we must lose no time  on to hastor at once  should the therns attempt to check us at the southern verge of the ice cap it may result in the wrecking of all our plans and the total destruction of the expedition  ten minutes later we were speeding through the night toward hastor prepared to strike the first blow for the preservation of dejah thoris     chapter xx  the air battle   two hours after leaving my palace at helium or about midnight kantos kan xodar and i arrived at hastor  carthoris tars tarkas and hor vastus had gone directly to thark upon another cruiser  the transports were to get under way immediately and move slowly south the fleet of battleships would overtake them on the morning of the second day  at hastor we found all in readiness and so perfectly had kantos kan planned every detail of the campaign that within ten minutes of our arrival the first of the fleet had soared aloft from its dock and thereafter at the rate of one a second the great ships floated gracefully out into the night to form a long thin line which stretched for miles toward the south  it was not until after we had entered the cabin of kantos kan that i thought to ask the date for up to now i was not positive how long i had lain in the pits of zat arrras  when kantos kan told me i realized with a pang of dismay that i had misreckoned the time while i lay in the utter darkness of my cell  three hundred and sixtyfive days had passedit was too late to save dejah thoris  the expedition was no longer one of rescue but of revenge  i did not remind kantos kan of the terrible fact that ere we could hope to enter the temple of issus the princess of helium would be no more  in so far as i knew she might be already dead for i did not know the exact date on which she first viewed issus  what now the value of burdening my friends with my added personal sorrowsthey had shared quite enough of them with me in the past hereafter i would keep my grief to myself and so i said nothing to any other of the fact that we were too late  the expedition could yet do much if it could but teach the people of barsoom the facts of the cruel deception that had been worked upon them for countless ages and thus save thousands each year from the horrid fate that awaited them at the conclusion of the voluntary pilgrimage  if it could open to the red men the fair valley dor it would have accomplished much and in the land of lost souls between the mountains of otz and the ice barrier were many broad acres that needed no irrigation to bear rich harvests  here at the bottom of a dying world was the only naturally productive area upon its surface  here alone were dews and rains here alone was an open sea here was water in plenty and all this was but the stamping ground of fierce brutes and from its beauteous and fertile expanse the wicked remnants of two once mighty races barred all the other millions of barsoom  could i but succeed in once breaking down the barrier of religious superstition which had kept the red races from this el dorado it would be a fitting memorial to the immortal virtues of my princessi should have again served barsoom and dejah thoris martyrdom would not have been in vain  on the morning of the second day we raised the great fleet of transports and their consorts at the first flood of dawn and soon were near enough to exchange signals  i may mention here that radioaerograms are seldom if ever used in war time or for the transmission of secret dispatches at any time for as often as one nation discovers a new cipher or invents a new instrument for wireless purposes its neighbours bend every effort until they are able to intercept and translate the messages  for so long a time has this gone on that practically every possibility of wireless communication has been exhausted and no nation dares transmit dispatches of importance in this way  tars tarkas reported all well with the transports  the battleships passed through to take an advanced position and the combined fleets moved slowly over the ice cap hugging the surface closely to prevent detection by the therns whose land we were approaching  far in advance of all a thin line of oneman air scouts protected us from surprise and on either side they flanked us while a smaller number brought up the rear some twenty miles behind the transports  in this formation we had progressed toward the entrance to omean for several hours when one of our scouts returned from the front to report that the conelike summit of the entrance was in sight  at almost the same instant another scout from the left flank came racing toward the flagship  his very speed bespoke the importance of his information  kantos kan and i awaited him upon the little forward deck which corresponds with the bridge of earthly battleships  scarcely had his tiny flier come to rest upon the broad landingdeck of the flagship ere he was bounding up the stairway to the deck where we stood  a great fleet of battleships southsoutheast my prince he cried there must be several thousands and they are bearing down directly upon us  the thern spies were not in the palace of john carter for nothing said kantos kan to me  your orders prince  dispatch ten battleships to guard the entrance to omean with orders to let no hostile enter or leave the shaft  that will bottle up the great fleet of the first born  form the balance of the battleships into a great v with the apex pointing directly southsoutheast  order the transports surrounded by their convoys to follow closely in the wake of the battleships until the point of the v has entered the enemies line then the v must open outward at the apex the battleships of each leg engage the enemy fiercely and drive him back to form a lane through his line into which the transports with their convoys must race at top speed that they may gain a position above the temples and gardens of the therns  here let them land and teach the holy therns such a lesson in ferocious warfare as they will not forget for countless ages  it had not been my intention to be distracted from the main issue of the campaign but we must settle this attack with the therns once and for all or there will be no peace for us while our fleet remains near dor and our chances of ever returning to the outer world will be greatly minimized  kantos kan saluted and turned to deliver my instructions to his waiting aides  in an incredibly short space of time the formation of the battleships changed in accordance with my commands the ten that were to guard the way to omean were speeding toward their destination and the troopships and convoys were closing up in preparation for the spurt through the lane  the order of full speed ahead was given the fleet sprang through the air like coursing greyhounds and in another moment the ships of the enemy were in full view  they formed a ragged line as far as the eye could reach in either direction and about three ships deep  so sudden was our onslaught that they had no time to prepare for it  it was as unexpected as lightning from a clear sky  every phase of my plan worked splendidly  our huge ships mowed their way entirely through the line of thern battlecraft then the v opened up and a broad lane appeared through which the transports leaped toward the temples of the therns which could now be plainly seen glistening in the sunlight  by the time the therns had rallied from the attack a hundred thousand green warriors were already pouring through their courts and gardens while a hundred and fifty thousand others leaned from low swinging transports to direct their almost uncanny marksmanship upon the thern soldiery that manned the ramparts or attempted to defend the temples  now the two great fleets closed in a titanic struggle far above the fiendish din of battle in the gorgeous gardens of the therns  slowly the two lines of heliums battleships joined their ends and then commenced the circling within the line of the enemy which is so marked a characteristic of barsoomian naval warfare  around and around in each others tracks moved the ships under kantos kan until at length they formed nearly a perfect circle  by this time they were moving at high speed so that they presented a difficult target for the enemy  broadside after broadside they delivered as each vessel came in line with the ships of the therns  the latter attempted to rush in and break up the formation but it was like stopping a buzz saw with the bare hand  from my position on the deck beside kantos kan i saw ship after ship of the enemy take the awful sickening dive which proclaims its total destruction  slowly we manoeuvered our circle of death until we hung above the gardens where our green warriors were engaged  the order was passed down for them to embark  then they rose slowly to a position within the centre of the circle  in the meantime the therns fire had practically ceased  they had had enough of us and were only too glad to let us go on our way in peace but our escape was not to be encompassed with such ease for scarcely had we gotten under way once more in the direction of the entrance to omean than we saw far to the north a great black line topping the horizon  it could be nothing other than a fleet of war  whose or whither bound we could not even conjecture  when they had come close enough to make us out at all kantos kans operator received a radioaerogram which he immediately handed to my companion  he read the thing and handed it to me  kantos kan it read  surrender in the name of the jeddak of helium for you cannot escape and it was signed zat arrras  the therns must have caught and translated the message almost as soon as did we for they immediately renewed hostilities when they realized that we were soon to be set upon by other enemies  before zat arrras had approached near enough to fire a shot we were again hotly engaged with the thern fleet and as soon as he drew near he too commenced to pour a terrific fusillade of heavy shot into us ship after ship reeled and staggered into uselessness beneath the pitiless fire that we were undergoing  the thing could not last much longer  i ordered the transports to descend again into the gardens of the therns  wreak your vengeance to the utmost was my message to the green allies for by night there will be none left to avenge your wrongs  presently i saw the ten battleships that had been ordered to hold the shaft of omean  they were returning at full speed firing their stern batteries almost continuously  there could be but one explanation they were being pursued by another hostile fleet  well the situation could be no worse  the expedition already was doomed  no man that had embarked upon it would return across that dreary ice cap  how i wished that i might face zat arrras with my longsword for just an instant before i died  it was he who had caused our failure  as i watched the oncoming ten i saw their pursuers race swiftly into sight  it was another great fleet for a moment i could not believe my eyes but finally i was forced to admit that the most fatal calamity had overtaken the expedition for the fleet i saw was none other than the fleet of the first born that should have been safely bottled up in omean  what a series of misfortunes and disasters  what awful fate hovered over me that i should have been so terribly thwarted at every angle of my search for my lost love  could it be possible that the curse of issus was upon me  that there was indeed some malign divinity in that hideous carcass  i would not believe it and throwing back my shoulders i ran to the deck below to join my men in repelling boarders from one of the thern craft that had grappled us broadside  in the wild lust of handtohand combat my old dauntless hopefulness returned  and as thern after thern went down beneath my blade i could almost feel that we should win success in the end even from apparent failure  my presence among the men so greatly inspirited them that they fell upon the luckless whites with such terrible ferocity that within a few moments we had turned the tables upon them and a second later as we swarmed their own decks i had the satisfaction of seeing their commander take the long leap from the bows of his vessel in token of surrender and defeat  then i joined kantos kan  he had been watching what had taken place on the deck below and it seemed to have given him a new thought immediately he passed an order to one of his officers and presently the colours of the prince of helium broke from every point of the flagship  a great cheer arose from the men of our own ship a cheer that was taken up by every other vessel of our expedition as they in turn broke my colours from their upper works  then kantos kan sprang his coup  a signal legible to every sailor of all the fleets engaged in that fierce struggle was strung aloft upon the flagship  men of helium for the prince of helium against all his enemies it read  presently my colours broke from one of zat arrras ships  then from another and another  on some we could see fierce battles waging between the zodangan soldiery and the heliumetic crews but eventually the colours of the prince of helium floated above every ship that had followed zat arrras upon our trailonly his flagship flew them not  zat arrras had brought five thousand ships  the sky was black with the three enormous fleets  it was helium against the field now and the fight had settled to countless individual duels  there could be little or no manoeuvering of fleets in that crowded firesplit sky  zat arrras flagship was close to my own  i could see the thin features of the man from where i stood  his zodangan crew was pouring broadside after broadside into us and we were returning their fire with equal ferocity  closer and closer came the two vessels until but a few yards intervened  grapplers and boarders lined the contiguous rails of each we were preparing for the death struggle with our hated enemy  there was but a yard between the two mighty ships as the first grappling irons were hurled  i rushed to the deck to be with my men as they boarded  just as the vessels came together with a slight shock i forced my way through the lines and was the first to spring to the deck of zat arrras ship  after me poured a yelling cheering cursing throng of heliums best fightingmen  nothing could withstand them in the fever of battle lust which enthralled them  down went the zodangans before that surging tide of war and as my men cleared the lower decks i sprang to the forward deck where stood zat arrras  you are my prisoner zat arrras i cried  yield and you shall have quarter  for a moment i could not tell whether he contemplated acceding to my demand or facing me with drawn sword  for an instant he stood hesitating and then throwing down his arms he turned and rushed to the opposite side of the deck  before i could overtake him he had sprung to the rail and hurled himself headforemost into the awful depths below  and thus came zat arrras jed of zodanga to his end  on and on went that strange battle  the therns and blacks had not combined against us  wherever thern ship met ship of the first born was a battle royal and in this i thought i saw our salvation wherever messages could be passed between us that could not be intercepted by our enemies i passed the word that all our vessels were to withdraw from the fight as rapidly as possible taking a position to the west and south of the combatants  i also sent an air scout to the fighting green men in the gardens below to reembark and to the transports to join us  my commanders were further instructed that when engaged with an enemy to draw him as rapidly as possible toward a ship of his hereditary foeman and by careful manoeuvring to force the two to engage thus leaving himself free to withdraw  this stratagem worked to perfection and just before the sun went down i had the satisfaction of seeing all that was left of my once mighty fleet gathered nearly twenty miles southwest of the still terrific battle between the blacks and whites  i now transferred xodar to another battleship and sent him with all the transports and five thousand battleships directly overhead to the temple of issus  carthoris and i with kantos kan took the remaining ships and headed for the entrance to omean  our plan now was to attempt to make a combined assault upon issus at dawn of the following day  tars tarkas with his green warriors and hor vastus with the red men guided by xodar were to land within the garden of issus or the surrounding plains while carthoris kantos kan and i were to lead our smaller force from the sea of omean through the pits beneath the temple which carthoris knew so well  i now learned for the first time the cause of my ten ships retreat from the mouth of the shaft  it seemed that when they had come upon the shaft the navy of the first born were already issuing from its mouth  fully twenty vessels had emerged and though they gave battle immediately in an effort to stem the tide that rolled from the black pit the odds against them were too great and they were forced to flee  with great caution we approached the shaft under cover of darkness at a distance of several miles i caused the fleet to be halted and from there carthoris went ahead alone upon a oneman flier to reconnoitre  in perhaps half an hour he returned to report that there was no sign of a patrol boat or of the enemy in any form and so we moved swiftly and noiselessly forward once more toward omean  at the mouth of the shaft we stopped again for a moment for all the vessels to reach their previously appointed stations then with the flagship i dropped quickly into the black depths while one by one the other vessels followed me in quick succession  we had decided to stake all on the chance that we would be able to reach the temple by the subterranean way and so we left no guard of vessels at the shafts mouth  nor would it have profited us any to have done so for we did not have sufficient force all told to have withstood the vast navy of the first born had they returned to engage us  for the safety of our entrance upon omean we depended largely upon the very boldness of it believing that it would be some little time before the first born on guard there would realize that it was an enemy and not their own returning fleet that was entering the vault of the buried sea  and such proved to be the case  in fact four hundred of my fleet of five hundred rested safely upon the bosom of omean before the first shot was fired  the battle was short and hot but there could have been but one outcome for the first born in the carelessness of fancied security had left but a handful of ancient and obsolete hulks to guard their mighty harbour  it was at carthoris suggestion that we landed our prisoners under guard upon a couple of the larger islands and then towed the ships of the first born to the shaft where we managed to wedge a number of them securely in the interior of the great well  then we turned on the buoyance rays in the balance of them and let them rise by themselves to further block the passage to omean as they came into contact with the vessels already lodged there  we now felt that it would be some time at least before the returning first born could reach the surface of omean and that we would have ample opportunity to make for the subterranean passages which lead to issus  one of the first steps i took was to hasten personally with a goodsized force to the island of the submarine which i took without resistance on the part of the small guard there  i found the submarine in its pool and at once placed a strong guard upon it and the island where i remained to wait the coming of carthoris and the others  among the prisoners was yersted commander of the submarine  he recognized me from the three trips that i had taken with him during my captivity among the first born  how does it seem i asked him to have the tables turned  to be prisoner of your erstwhile captive  he smiled a very grim smile pregnant with hidden meaning  it will not be for long john carter he replied  we have been expecting you and we are prepared  so it would appear i answered for you were all ready to become my prisoners with scarce a blow struck on either side  the fleet must have missed you he said but it will return to omean and then that will be a very different matterfor john carter  i do not know that the fleet has missed me as yet i said but of course he did not grasp my meaning and only looked puzzled  many prisoners travel to issus in your grim craft yersted i asked  very many he assented  might you remember one whom men called dejah thoris  well indeed for her great beauty and then too for the fact that she was wife to the first mortal that ever escaped from issus through all the countless ages of her godhood  and the way that issus remembers her best as the wife of one and the mother of another who raised their hands against the goddess of life eternal  i shuddered for fear of the cowardly revenge that i knew issus might have taken upon the innocent dejah thoris for the sacrilege of her son and her husband  and where is dejah thoris now i asked knowing that he would say the words i most dreaded but yet i loved her so that i could not refrain from hearing even the worst about her fate so that it fell from the lips of one who had seen her but recently  it was to me as though it brought her closer to me  yesterday the monthly rites of issus were held replied yersted and i saw her then sitting in her accustomed place at the foot of issus  what i cried she is not dead then  why no replied the black it has been no year since she gazed upon the divine glory of the radiant face of  no year i interrupted  why no insisted yersted  it cannot have been upward of three hundred and seventy or eighty days  a great light burst upon me  how stupid i had been  i could scarcely retain an outward exhibition of my great joy  why had i forgotten the great difference in the length of martian and earthly years  the ten earth years i had spent upon barsoom had encompassed but five years and ninetysix days of martian time whose days are fortyone minutes longer than ours and whose years number six hundred and eightyseven days  i am in time  i am in time  the words surged through my brain again and again until at last i must have voiced them audibly for yersted shook his head  in time to save your princess he asked and then without waiting for my reply no john carter issus will not give up her own  she knows that you are coming and ere ever a vandal foot is set within the precincts of the temple of issus if such a calamity should befall dejah thoris will be put away for ever from the last faint hope of rescue  you mean that she will be killed merely to thwart me i asked  not that other than as a last resort he replied  hast ever heard of the temple of the sun  it is there that they will put her  it lies far within the inner court of the temple of issus a little temple that raises a thin spire far above the spires and minarets of the great temple that surrounds it  beneath it in the ground there lies the main body of the temple consisting in six hundred and eightyseven circular chambers one below another  to each chamber a single corridor leads through solid rock from the pits of issus  as the entire temple of the sun revolves once with each revolution of barsoom about the sun but once each year does the entrance to each separate chamber come opposite the mouth of the corridor which forms its only link to the world without  here issus puts those who displease her but whom she does not care to execute forthwith  or to punish a noble of the first born she may cause him to be placed within a chamber of the temple of the sun for a year  ofttimes she imprisons an executioner with the condemned that death may come in a certain horrible form upon a given day or again but enough food is deposited in the chamber to sustain life but the number of days that issus has allotted for mental anguish  thus will dejah thoris die and her fate will be sealed by the first alien foot that crosses the threshold of issus  so i was to be thwarted in the end although i had performed the miraculous and come within a few short moments of my divine princess yet was i as far from her as when i stood upon the banks of the hudson fortyeight million miles away     chapter xxi  through flood and flame   yersteds information convinced me that there was no time to be lost i must reach the temple of issus secretly before the forces under tars tarkas assaulted at dawn  once within its hated walls i was positive that i could overcome the guards of issus and bear away my princess for at my back i would have a force ample for the occasion  no sooner had carthoris and the others joined me than we commenced the transportation of our men through the submerged passage to the mouth of the gangways which lead from the submarine pool at the temple end of the watery tunnel to the pits of issus  many trips were required but at last all stood safely together again at the beginning of the end of our quest  five thousand strong we were all seasoned fightingmen of the most warlike race of the red men of barsoom  as carthoris alone knew the hidden ways of the tunnels we could not divide the party and attack the temple at several points at once as would have been most desirable and so it was decided that he lead us all as quickly as possible to a point near the temples centre  as we were about to leave the pool and enter the corridor an officer called my attention to the waters upon which the submarine floated  at first they seemed to be merely agitated as from the movement of some great body beneath the surface and i at once conjectured that another submarine was rising to the surface in pursuit of us but presently it became apparent that the level of the waters was rising not with extreme rapidity but very surely and that soon they would overflow the sides of the pool and submerge the floor of the chamber  for a moment i did not fully grasp the terrible import of the slowly rising water  it was carthoris who realized the full meaning of the thingits cause and the reason for it  haste he cried  if we delay we all are lost  the pumps of omean have been stopped  they would drown us like rats in a trap  we must reach the upper levels of the pits in advance of the flood or we shall never reach them  come  lead the way carthoris i cried  we will follow  at my command the youth leaped into one of the corridors and in column of twos the soldiers followed him in good order each company entering the corridor only at the command of its dwar or captain  before the last company filed from the chamber the water was ankle deep and that the men were nervous was quite evident  entirely unaccustomed to water except in quantities sufficient for drinking and bathing purposes the red martians instinctively shrank from it in such formidable depths and menacing activity  that they were undaunted while it swirled and eddied about their ankles spoke well for their bravery and their discipline  i was the last to leave the chamber of the submarine and as i followed the rear of the column toward the corridor i moved through water to my knees  the corridor too was flooded to the same depth for its floor was on a level with the floor of the chamber from which it led nor was there any perceptible rise for many yards  the march of the troops through the corridor was as rapid as was consistent with the number of men that moved through so narrow a passage but it was not ample to permit us to gain appreciably on the pursuing tide  as the level of the passage rose so too did the waters rise until it soon became apparent to me who brought up the rear that they were gaining rapidly upon us  i could understand the reason for this as with the narrowing expanse of omean as the waters rose toward the apex of its dome the rapidity of its rise would increase in inverse ratio to the everlessening space to be filled  long ere the last of the column could hope to reach the upper pits which lay above the danger point i was convinced that the waters would surge after us in overwhelming volume and that fully half the expedition would be snuffed out  as i cast about for some means of saving as many as possible of the doomed men i saw a diverging corridor which seemed to rise at a steep angle at my right  the waters were now swirling about my waist  the men directly before me were quickly becoming panicstricken  something must be done at once or they would rush forward upon their fellows in a mad stampede that would result in trampling down hundreds beneath the flood and eventually clogging the passage beyond any hope of retreat for those in advance  raising my voice to its utmost i shouted my command to the dwars ahead of me  call back the last twentyfive utans i shouted  here seems a way of escape  turn back and follow me  my orders were obeyed by nearer thirty utans so that some three thousand men came about and hastened into the teeth of the flood to reach the corridor up which i directed them  as the first dwar passed in with his utan i cautioned him to listen closely for my commands and under no circumstances to venture into the open or leave the pits for the temple proper until i should have come up with him or you know that i died before i could reach you  the officer saluted and left me  the men filed rapidly past me and entered the diverging corridor which i hoped would lead to safety  the water rose breast high  men stumbled floundered and went down  many i grasped and set upon their feet again but alone the work was greater than i could cope with  soldiers were being swept beneath the boiling torrent never to rise  at length the dwar of the 10th utan took a stand beside me  he was a valorous soldier gur tus by name and together we kept the now thoroughly frightened troops in the semblance of order and rescued many that would have drowned otherwise  djor kantos son of kantos kan and a padwar of the fifth utan joined us when his utan reached the opening through which the men were fleeing  thereafter not a man was lost of all the hundreds that remained to pass from the main corridor to the branch  as the last utan was filing past us the waters had risen until they surged about our necks but we clasped hands and stood our ground until the last man had passed to the comparative safety of the new passageway  here we found an immediate and steep ascent so that within a hundred yards we had reached a point above the waters  for a few minutes we continued rapidly up the steep grade which i hoped would soon bring us quickly to the upper pits that let into the temple of issus  but i was to meet with a cruel disappointment  suddenly i heard a cry of fire far ahead followed almost at once by cries of terror and the loud commands of dwars and padwars who were evidently attempting to direct their men away from some grave danger at last the report came back to us  they have fired the pits ahead we are hemmed in by flames in front and flood behind help john carter we are suffocating and then there swept back upon us at the rear a wave of dense smoke that sent us stumbling and blinded into a choking retreat  there was naught to do other than seek a new avenue of escape  the fire and smoke were to be feared a thousand times over the water and so i seized upon the first gallery which led out of and up from the suffocating smoke that was engulfing us  again i stood to one side while the soldiers hastened through on the new way  some two thousand must have passed at a rapid run when the stream ceased but i was not sure that all had been rescued who had not passed the point of origin of the flames and so to assure myself that no poor devil was left behind to die a horrible death unsuccoured i ran quickly up the gallery in the direction of the flames which i could now see burning with a dull glow far ahead  it was hot and stifling work but at last i reached a point where the fire lit up the corridor sufficiently for me to see that no soldier of helium lay between me and the conflagrationwhat was in it or upon the far side i could not know nor could any man have passed through that seething hell of chemicals and lived to learn  having satisfied my sense of duty i turned and ran rapidly back to the corridor through which my men had passed  to my horror however i found that my retreat in this direction had been blockedacross the mouth of the corridor stood a massive steel grating that had evidently been lowered from its restingplace above for the purpose of effectually cutting off my escape  that our principal movements were known to the first born i could not have doubted in view of the attack of the fleet upon us the day before nor could the stopping of the pumps of omean at the psychological moment have been due to chance nor the starting of a chemical combustion within the one corridor through which we were advancing upon the temple of issus been due to aught than wellcalculated design  and now the dropping of the steel gate to pen me effectually between fire and flood seemed to indicate that invisible eyes were upon us at every moment  what chance had i then to rescue dejah thoris were i to be compelled to fight foes who never showed themselves  a thousand times i berated myself for being drawn into such a trap as i might have known these pits easily could be  now i saw that it would have been much better to have kept our force intact and made a concerted attack upon the temple from the valley side trusting to chance and our great fighting ability to have overwhelmed the first born and compelled the safe delivery of dejah thoris to me  the smoke from the fire was forcing me further and further back down the corridor toward the waters which i could hear surging through the darkness  with my men had gone the last torch nor was this corridor lighted by the radiance of phosphorescent rock as were those of the lower levels  it was this fact that assured me that i was not far from the upper pits which lie directly beneath the temple  finally i felt the lapping waters about my feet  the smoke was thick behind me  my suffering was intense  there seemed but one thing to do and that to choose the easier death which confronted me and so i moved on down the corridor until the cold waters of omean closed about me and i swam on through utter blackness towardwhat  the instinct of selfpreservation is strong even when one unafraid and in the possession of his highest reasoning faculties knows that deathpositive and unalterablelies just ahead  and so i swam slowly on waiting for my head to touch the top of the corridor which would mean that i had reached the limit of my flight and the point where i must sink for ever to an unmarked grave  but to my surprise i ran against a blank wall before i reached a point where the waters came to the roof of the corridor  could i be mistaken  i felt around  no i had come to the main corridor and still there was a breathing space between the surface of the water and the rocky ceiling above  and then i turned up the main corridor in the direction that carthoris and the head of the column had passed a halfhour before  on and on i swam my heart growing lighter at every stroke for i knew that i was approaching closer and closer to the point where there would be no chance that the waters ahead could be deeper than they were about me  i was positive that i must soon feel the solid floor beneath my feet again and that once more my chance would come to reach the temple of issus and the side of the fair prisoner who languished there  but even as hope was at its highest i felt the sudden shock of contact as my head struck the rocks above  the worst then had come to me  i had reached one of those rare places where a martian tunnel dips suddenly to a lower level  somewhere beyond i knew that it rose again but of what value was that to me since i did not know how great the distance that it maintained a level entirely beneath the surface of the water  there was but a single forlorn hope and i took it  filling my lungs with air i dived beneath the surface and swam through the inky icy blackness on and on along the submerged gallery  time and time again i rose with upstretched hand only to feel the disappointing rocks close above me  not for much longer would my lungs withstand the strain upon them  i felt that i must soon succumb nor was there any retreating now that i had gone this far  i knew positively that i could never endure to retrace my path now to the point from which i had felt the waters close above my head  death stared me in the face nor ever can i recall a time that i so distinctly felt the icy breath from his dead lips upon my brow  one more frantic effort i made with my fast ebbing strength  weakly i rose for the last timemy tortured lungs gasped for the breath that would fill them with a strange and numbing element but instead i felt the revivifying breath of lifegiving air surge through my starving nostrils into my dying lungs  i was saved  a few more strokes brought me to a point where my feet touched the floor and soon thereafter i was above the water level entirely and racing like mad along the corridor searching for the first doorway that would lead me to issus  if i could not have dejah thoris again i was at least determined to avenge her death nor would any life satisfy me other than that of the fiend incarnate who was the cause of such immeasurable suffering upon barsoom  sooner than i had expected i came to what appeared to me to be a sudden exit into the temple above  it was at the right side of the corridor which ran on probably to other entrances to the pile above  to me one point was as good as another  what knew i where any of them led  and so without waiting to be again discovered and thwarted i ran quickly up the short steep incline and pushed open the doorway at its end  the portal swung slowly in and before it could be slammed against me i sprang into the chamber beyond  although not yet dawn the room was brilliantly lighted  its sole occupant lay prone upon a low couch at the further side apparently in sleep  from the hangings and sumptuous furniture of the room i judged it to be a livingroom of some priestess possibly of issus herself  at the thought the blood tingled through my veins  what indeed if fortune had been kind enough to place the hideous creature alone and unguarded in my hands  with her as hostage i could force acquiescence to my every demand  cautiously i approached the recumbent figure on noiseless feet  closer and closer i came to it but i had crossed but little more than half the chamber when the figure stirred and as i sprang rose and faced me  at first an expression of terror overspread the features of the woman who confronted methen startled incredulityhopethanksgiving  my heart pounded within my breast as i advanced toward hertears came to my eyesand the words that would have poured forth in a perfect torrent choked in my throat as i opened my arms and took into them once more the woman i loveddejah thoris princess of helium     chapter xxii  victory and defeat   john carter john carter she sobbed with her dear head upon my shoulder even now i can scarce believe the witness of my own eyes when the girl thuvia told me that you had returned to barsoom i listened but i could not understand for it seemed that such happiness would be impossible for one who had suffered so in silent loneliness for all these long years  at last when i realized that it was truth and then came to know the awful place in which i was held prisoner i learned to doubt that even you could reach me here  as the days passed and moon after moon went by without bringing even the faintest rumour of you i resigned myself to my fate  and now that you have come scarce can i believe it  for an hour i have heard the sounds of conflict within the palace  i knew not what they meant but i have hoped against hope that it might be the men of helium headed by my prince  and tell me what of carthoris our son  he was with me less than an hour since dejah thoris i replied  it must have been he whose men you have heard battling within the precincts of the temple  where is issus i asked suddenly  dejah thoris shrugged her shoulders  she sent me under guard to this room just before the fighting began within the temple halls  she said that she would send for me later she seemed very angry and somewhat fearful  never have i seen her act in so uncertain and almost terrified a manner  now i know that it must have been because she had learned that john carter prince of helium was approaching to demand an accounting of her for the imprisonment of his princess  the sounds of conflict the clash of arms the shouting and the hurrying of many feet came to us from various parts of the temple  i knew that i was needed there but i dared not leave dejah thoris nor dared i take her with me into the turmoil and danger of battle  at last i bethought me of the pits from which i had just emerged  why not secrete her there until i could return and fetch her away in safety and for ever from this awful place  i explained my plan to her  for a moment she clung more closely to me  i cannot bear to be parted from you now even for a moment john carter she said  i shudder at the thought of being alone again where that terrible creature might discover me  you do not know her none can imagine her ferocious cruelty who has not witnessed her daily acts for over half a year  it has taken me nearly all this time to realize even the things that i have seen with my own eyes  i shall not leave you then my princess i replied  she was silent for a moment then she drew my face to hers and kissed me  go john carter she said  our son is there and the soldiers of helium fighting for the princess of helium  where they are you should be  i must not think of myself now but of them and of my husbands duty  i may not stand in the way of that  hide me in the pits and go  i led her to the door through which i had entered the chamber from below  there i pressed her dear form to me and then though it tore my heart to do it and filled me only with the blackest shadows of terrible foreboding i guided her across the threshold kissed her once again and closed the door upon her  without hesitating longer i hurried from the chamber in the direction of the greatest tumult  scarce half a dozen chambers had i traversed before i came upon the theatre of a fierce struggle  the blacks were massed at the entrance to a great chamber where they were attempting to block the further progress of a body of red men toward the inner sacred precincts of the temple  coming from within as i did i found myself behind the blacks and without waiting to even calculate their numbers or the foolhardiness of my venture i charged swiftly across the chamber and fell upon them from the rear with my keen longsword  as i struck the first blow i cried aloud for helium and then i rained cut after cut upon the surprised warriors while the reds without took heart at the sound of my voice and with shouts of john carter  john carter redoubled their efforts so effectually that before the blacks could recover from their temporary demoralization their ranks were broken and the red men had burst into the chamber  the fight within that room had it had but a competent chronicler would go down in the annals of barsoom as a historic memorial to the grim ferocity of her warlike people  five hundred men fought there that day the black men against the red  no man asked quarter or gave it  as though by common assent they fought as though to determine once and for all their right to live in accordance with the law of the survival of the fittest  i think we all knew that upon the outcome of this battle would hinge for ever the relative positions of these two races upon barsoom  it was a battle between the old and the new but not for once did i question the outcome of it  with carthoris at my side i fought for the red men of barsoom and for their total emancipation from the throttling bondage of a hideous superstition  back and forth across the room we surged until the floor was ankle deep in blood and dead men lay so thickly there that half the time we stood upon their bodies as we fought  as we swung toward the great windows which overlooked the gardens of issus a sight met my gaze which sent a wave of exultation over me  look i cried  men of the first born look  for an instant the fighting ceased and with one accord every eye turned in the direction i had indicated and the sight they saw was one no man of the first born had ever imagined could be  across the gardens from side to side stood a wavering line of black warriors while beyond them and forcing them ever back was a great horde of green warriors astride their mighty thoats  and as we watched one fiercer and more grimly terrible than his fellows rode forward from the rear and as he came he shouted some fierce command to his terrible legion  it was tars tarkas jeddak of thark and as he couched his great fortyfoot metalshod lance we saw his warriors do likewise  then it was that we interpreted his command  twenty yards now separated the green men from the black line  another word from the great thark and with a wild and terrifying battlecry the green warriors charged  for a moment the black line held but only for a momentthen the fearsome beasts that bore equally terrible riders passed completely through it  after them came utan upon utan of red men  the green horde broke to surround the temple  the red men charged for the interior and then we turned to continue our interrupted battle but our foes had vanished  my first thought was of dejah thoris  calling to carthoris that i had found his mother i started on a run toward the chamber where i had left her with my boy close beside me  after us came those of our little force who had survived the bloody conflict  the moment i entered the room i saw that some one had been there since i had left  a silk lay upon the floor  it had not been there before there were also a dagger and several metal ornaments strewn about as though torn from their wearer in a struggle  but worst of all the door leading to the pits where i had hidden my princess was ajar  with a bound i was before it and thrusting it open rushed within dejah thoris had vanished  i called her name aloud again and again but there was no response  i think in that instant i hovered upon the verge of insanity  i do not recall what i said or did but i know that for an instant i was seized with the rage of a maniac  issus i cried  issus  where is issus  search the temple for her but let no man harm her but john carter  carthoris where are the apartments of issus  this way cried the boy and without waiting to know that i had heard him he dashed off at breakneck speed further into the bowels of the temple  as fast as he went however i was still beside him urging him on to greater speed  at last we came to a great carved door and through this carthoris dashed a foot ahead of me  within we came upon such a scene as i had witnessed within the temple once beforethe throne of issus with the reclining slaves and about it the ranks of soldiery  we did not even give the men a chance to draw so quickly were we upon them  with a single cut i struck down two in the front rank  and then by the mere weight and momentum of my body i rushed completely through the two remaining ranks and sprang upon the dais beside the carved sorapus throne  the repulsive creature squatting there in terror attempted to escape me and leap into a trap behind her  but this time i was not to be outwitted by any such petty subterfuge  before she had half arisen i had grasped her by the arm and then as i saw the guard starting to make a concerted rush upon me from all sides i whipped out my dagger and holding it close to that vile breast ordered them to halt  back i cried to them  back  the first black foot that is planted upon this platform sends my dagger into issus heart  for an instant they hesitated  then an officer ordered them back while from the outer corridor there swept into the throne room at the heels of my little party of survivors a full thousand red men under kantos kan hor vastus and xodar  where is dejah thoris i cried to the thing within my hands  for a moment her eyes roved wildly about the scene beneath her  i think that it took a moment for the true condition to make any impression upon hershe could not at first realize that the temple had fallen before the assault of men of the outer world  when she did there must have come too a terrible realization of what it meant to herthe loss of powerhumiliationthe exposure of the fraud and imposture which she had for so long played upon her own people  there was just one thing needed to complete the reality of the picture she was seeing and that was added by the highest noble of her realmthe high priest of her religionthe prime minister of her government  issus goddess of death and of life eternal he cried arise in the might of thy righteous wrath and with one single wave of thy omnipotent hand strike dead thy blasphemers  let not one escape  issus thy people depend upon thee  daughter of the lesser moon thou only art allpowerful  thou only canst save thy people  i am done  we await thy will  strike  and then it was that she went mad  a screaming gibbering maniac writhed in my grasp  it bit and clawed and scratched in impotent fury and then it laughed a weird and terrible laughter that froze the blood the slave girls upon the dais shrieked and cowered away  and the thing jumped at them and gnashed its teeth and then spat upon them from frothing lips  god but it was a horrid sight  finally i shook the thing hoping to recall it for a moment to rationality  where is dejah thoris i cried again  the awful creature in my grasp mumbled inarticulately for a moment then a sudden gleam of cunning shot into those hideous closeset eyes  dejah thoris  dejah thoris and then that shrill unearthly laugh pierced our ears once more  yes dejah thorisi know  and thuvia and phaidor daughter of matai shang  they each love john carter  haah  but it is droll  together for a year they will meditate within the temple of the sun but ere the year is quite gone there will be no more food for them  hooh what divine entertainment and she licked the froth from her cruel lips there will be no more foodexcept each other  haah  haah  the horror of the suggestion nearly paralysed me  to this awful fate the creature within my power had condemned my princess  i trembled in the ferocity of my rage  as a terrier shakes a rat i shook issus goddess of life eternal  countermand your orders i cried  recall the condemned  haste or you die  it is too late  haah  haah and then she commenced her gibbering and shrieking again  almost of its own volition my dagger flew up above that putrid heart but something stayed my hand and i am now glad that it did  it were a terrible thing to have struck down a woman with ones own hand  but a fitter fate occurred to me for this false deity  first born i cried turning to those who stood within the chamber you have seen today the impotency of issusthe gods are impotent issus is no god  she is a cruel and wicked old woman who has deceived and played upon you for ages  take her  john carter prince of helium would not contaminate his hand with her blood and with that i pushed the raving beast whom a short halfhour before a whole world had worshipped as divine from the platform of her throne into the waiting clutches of her betrayed and vengeful people  spying xodar among the officers of the red men i called him to lead me quickly to the temple of the sun and without waiting to learn what fate the first born would wreak upon their goddess i rushed from the chamber with xodar carthoris hor vastus kantos kan and a score of other red nobles  the black led us rapidly through the inner chambers of the temple until we stood within the central courta great circular space paved with a transparent marble of exquisite whiteness  before us rose a golden temple wrought in the most wondrous and fanciful designs inlaid with diamond ruby sapphire turquoise emerald and the thousand nameless gems of mars which far transcend in loveliness and purity of ray the most priceless stones of earth  this way cried xodar leading us toward the entrance to a tunnel which opened in the courtyard beside the temple  just as we were on the point of descending we heard a deeptoned roar burst from the temple of issus which we had but just quitted and then a red man djor kantos padwar of the fifth utan broke from a nearby gate crying to us to return  the blacks have fired the temple he cried  in a thousand places it is burning now  haste to the outer gardens or you are lost  as he spoke we saw smoke pouring from a dozen windows looking out upon the courtyard of the temple of the sun and far above the highest minaret of issus hung an evergrowing pall of smoke  go back  go back i cried to those who had accompanied me  the way  xodar point the way and leave me  i shall reach my princess yet  follow me john carter replied xodar and without waiting for my reply he dashed down into the tunnel at our feet  at his heels i ran down through a halfdozen tiers of galleries until at last he led me along a level floor at the end of which i discerned a lighted chamber  massive bars blocked our further progress but beyond i saw hermy incomparable princess and with her were thuvia and phaidor  when she saw me she rushed toward the bars that separated us  already the chamber had turned upon its slow way so far that but a portion of the opening in the temple wall was opposite the barred end of the corridor slowly the interval was closing  in a short time there would be but a tiny crack and then even that would be closed and for a long barsoomian year the chamber would slowly revolve until once more for a brief day the aperture in its wall would pass the corridors end  but in the meantime what horrible things would go on within that chamber  xodar i cried  can no power stop this awful revolving thing  is there none who holds the secret of these terrible bars  none i fear whom we could fetch in time though i shall go and make the attempt  wait for me here  after he had left i stood and talked with dejah thoris and she stretched her dear hand through those cruel bars that i might hold it until the last moment  thuvia and phaidor came close also but when thuvia saw that we would be alone she withdrew to the further side of the chamber  not so the daughter of matai shang  john carter she said this be the last time that you shall see any of us  tell me that you love me that i may die happy  i love only the princess of helium i replied quietly  i am sorry phaidor but it is as i have told you from the beginning  she bit her lip and turned away but not before i saw the black and ugly scowl she turned upon dejah thoris  thereafter she stood a little way apart but not so far as i should have desired for i had many little confidences to impart to my longlost love  for a few minutes we stood thus talking in low tones  ever smaller and smaller grew the opening  in a short time now it would be too small even to permit the slender form of my princess to pass  oh why did not xodar haste  above we could hear the faint echoes of a great tumult  it was the multitude of black and red and green men fighting their way through the fire from the burning temple of issus  a draught from above brought the fumes of smoke to our nostrils  as we stood waiting for xodar the smoke became thicker and thicker presently we heard shouting at the far end of the corridor and hurrying feet  come back john carter come back cried a voice even the pits are burning  in a moment a dozen men broke through the now blinding smoke to my side  there was carthoris and kantos kan and hor vastus and xodar with a few more who had followed me to the temple court  there is no hope john carter cried xodar  the keeper of the keys is dead and his keys are not upon his carcass  our only hope is to quench this conflagration and trust to fate that a year will find your princess alive and well  i have brought sufficient food to last them when this crack closes no smoke can reach them and if we hasten to extinguish the flames i believe they will be safe  go then yourself and take these others with you i replied  i shall remain here beside my princess until a merciful death releases me from my anguish  i care not to live  as i spoke xodar had been tossing a great number of tiny cans within the prison cell  the remaining crack was not over an inch in width a moment later  dejah thoris stood as close to it as she could whispering words of hope and courage to me and urging me to save myself  suddenly beyond her i saw the beautiful face of phaidor contorted into an expression of malign hatred  as my eyes met hers she spoke  think not john carter that you may so lightly cast aside the love of phaidor daughter of matai shang  nor ever hope to hold thy dejah thoris in thy arms again  wait you the long long year but know that when the waiting is over it shall be phaidors arms which shall welcome younot those of the princess of helium  behold she dies  and as she finished speaking i saw her raise a dagger on high and then i saw another figure  it was thuvias  as the dagger fell toward the unprotected breast of my love thuvia was almost between them  a blinding gust of smoke blotted out the tragedy within that fearsome cella shriek rang out a single shriek as the dagger fell  the smoke cleared away but we stood gazing upon a blank wall  the last crevice had closed and for a long year that hideous chamber would retain its secret from the eyes of men  they urged me to leave  in a moment it will be too late cried xodar  there is in fact but a bare chance that we can come through to the outer garden alive even now  i have ordered the pumps started and in five minutes the pits will be flooded  if we would not drown like rats in a trap we must hasten above and make a dash for safety through the burning temple  go i urged them  let me die here beside my princessthere is no hope or happiness elsewhere for me  when they carry her dear body from that terrible place a year hence let them find the body of her lord awaiting her  of what happened after that i have only a confused recollection  it seems as though i struggled with many men and then that i was picked bodily from the ground and borne away  i do not know  i have never asked nor has any other who was there that day intruded on my sorrow or recalled to my mind the occurrences which they know could but at best reopen the terrible wound within my heart  ah  if i could but know one thing what a burden of suspense would be lifted from my shoulders  but whether the assassins dagger reached one fair bosom or another only time will divulge
