35942540	louisa pallant  by henry james     i  never say you know the last words about any human heart i was once treated to a revelation which startled and touched me in the nature of a person with whom i had been acquaintedwell as i supposedfor years whose character i had had good reasons heaven knows to appreciate and in regard to whom i flattered myself i had nothing more to learn  it was on the terrace of the kursaal at homburg nearly ten years ago one beautiful night toward the end of july i had come to the place that day from frankfort with vague intentions and was mainly occupied in waiting for my young nephew the only son of my sister who had been entrusted to my care by a very fond mother for the summeri was expected to show him europe only the very best of itand was on his way from paris to join me the excellent band discoursed music not too abstruse while the air was filled besides with the murmur of different languages the smoke of many cigars the creak on the gravel of the gardens of strolling shoes and the thick tinkle of beerglasses there were a hundred people walking about there were some in clusters at little tables and many on benches and rows of chairs watching the others as if they had paid for the privilege and were rather disappointed i was among these last i sat by myself smoking my cigar and thinking of nothing very particular while families and couples passed and repassed me  i scarce know how long i had sat when i became aware of a recognition which made my meditations definite it was on my own part and the object of it was a lady who moved to and fro unconscious of my observation with a young girl at her side i hadnt seen her for ten years and what first struck me was the fact not that she was mrs henry pallant but that the girl who was with her was remarkably prettyor rather first of all that every one who passed appeared extremely to admire this led me also to notice the young lady myself and her charming face diverted my attention for some time from that of her companion the latter moreover though it was night wore a thin light veil which made her features vague the couple slowly walked and walked but though they were very quiet and decorous and also very well dressed they seemed to have no friends every one observed but no one addressed them they appeared even themselves to exchange very few words moreover they bore with marked composure and as if they were thoroughly used to it the attention they excited i am afraid it occurred to me to take for granted that they were of an artful intention and that if they hadnt been the elder lady would have handed the younger over a little less to public valuation and not have sought so to conceal her own face perhaps this question came into my mind too easily just thenin view of my prospective mentorship to my nephew if i was to show him only the best of europe i should have to be very careful about the people he should meetespecially the ladiesand the relations he should form i suspected him of great innocence and was uneasy about my office was i completely relieved and reassured when i became aware that i simply had louisa pallant before me and that the girl was her daughter linda whom i had known as a childlinda grown up to charming beauty  the question was delicate and the proof that i was not very sure is perhaps that i forbore to speak to my pair at once i watched them a whilei wondered what they would do no great harm assuredly but i was anxious to see if they were really isolated homburg was then a great resort of the englishthe london season took up its tale there toward the first of augustand i had an idea that in such a company as that louisa would naturally know people it was my impression that she cultivated the english that she had been much in london and would be likely to have views in regard to a permanent settlement there this supposition was quickened by the sight of lindas beauty for i knew there is no country in which such attractions are more appreciated you will see what time i took and i confess that as i finished my cigar i thought it all over there was no good reason in fact why i should have rushed into mrs pallants arms she had not treated me well and we had never really made it up somehow even the circumstance thatafter the first sorenessi was glad to have lost her had never put us quite right with each other nor for herself had it made her less ashamed of her heartless behaviour that poor pallant proved finally no great catch i had forgiven her i hadnt felt it anything but an escape not to have married a girl who had in her to take back her given word and break a fellows heart for mere fleshpotsor the shallow promise as it pitifully turned out of fleshpots moreover we had met since thenon the occasion of my former visit to europe had looked each other in the eyes had pretended to be easy friends and had talked of the wickedness of the world as composedly as if we were the only just the only pure i knew by that time what she had given outthat i had driven her off by my insane jealousy before she ever thought of henry pallant before she had ever seen him this hadnt been before and couldnt be today a ground of real reunion especially if you add to it that she knew perfectly what i thought of her it seldom ministers to friendship i believe that your friend shall know your real opinion for he knows it mainly when its unfavourable and this is especially the case iflet the solecism passhe be a woman i hadnt followed mrs pallants fortunes the years went by for me in my own country whereas she led her life which i vaguely believed to be difficult after her husbands deathvirtually that of a bankruptin foreign lands i heard of her from time to time always as established somewhere but on each occasion in a different place she drifted from country to country and if she had been of a hard composition at the beginning it could never occur to me that her struggle with society as it might be called would have softened the paste whenever i heard a woman spoken of as horribly worldly i thought immediately of the object of my early passion i imagined she had debts and when i now at last made up my mind to recall myself to her it was present to me that she might ask me to lend her money more than anything else however at this time of day i was sorry for her so that such an idea didnt operate as a deterrent  she pretended afterwards that she hadnt noticed meexpressing as we stood face to face great surprise and wishing to know where i had dropped from but i think the corner of her eye had taken me in and she had been waiting to see what i would do she had ended by sitting down with her girl on the same row of chairs with myself and after a little the seat next to her becoming vacant i had gone and stood before her she had then looked up at me a moment staring as if she couldnt imagine who i was or what i wanted after which smiling and extending her hands she had broken out ah my dear old friendwhat a delight if she had waited to see what i would do in order to choose her own line she thus at least carried out this line with the utmost grace she was cordial friendly artless interested and indeed im sure she was very glad to see me i may as well say immediately none the less that she gave me neither then nor later any sign of a desire to contract a loan she had scant meansthat i learnedyet seemed for the moment able to pay her way i took the empty chair and we remained in talk for an hour after a while she made me sit at her other side next her daughter whom she wished to know meto love meas one of their oldest friends it goes back back back doesnt it said mrs pallant and of course she remembers you as a child linda smiled all sweetly and blankly and i saw she remembered me not a whit when her mother threw out that they had often talked about me she failed to take it up though she looked extremely nice looking nice was her strong point she was prettier even than her mother had been she was such a little lady that she made me ashamed of having doubted however vaguely and for a moment of her position in the scale of propriety her appearance seemed to say that if she had no acquaintances it was because she didnt want thembecause nobody there struck her as attractive there wasnt the slightest difficulty about her choosing her friends linda pallant young as she was and fresh and fair and charming gentle and sufficiently shy looked somehow exclusiveas if the dust of the common world had never been meant to besprinkle her she was of thinner consistency than her mother and clearly not a young woman of professionsexcept in so far as she was committed to an interest in you by her bright pure candid smile no girl who had such a lovely way of parting her lips could pass for designing  as i sat between the pair i felt i had been taken possession of and that for better or worse my stay at homburg would be intimately associated with theirs we gave each other a great deal of news and expressed unlimited interest in each others history since our last meeting i mightnt judge of what mrs pallant kept back but for myself i quite overflowed she let me see at any rate that her life had been a good deal what i supposed though the terms she employed to describe it were less crude than those of my thought she confessed they had drifted she and her daughter and were drifting still her narrative rambled and took a wrong turn a false flight or two as i thought linda noted while she sat watching the passers in a manner that betrayed no consciousness of their attention without coming to her mothers aid once or twice mrs pallant made me rather feel a crossquestioner which i had had no intention of being i took it that if the girl never put in a word it was because she had perfect confidence in her parents ability to come out straight it was suggested to me i scarcely knew how that this confidence between the two ladies went to a great length that their union of thought their system of reciprocal divination was remarkable and that they probably seldom needed to resort to the clumsy and in some cases dangerous expedient of communicating by sound i suppose i made this reflexion not all at onceit was not wholly the result of that first meeting i was with them constantly for the next several days and my impressions had time to clarify  i do remember however that it was on this first evening that archies name came up she attributed her own stay at homburg to no refined nor exalted motivedidnt put it that she was there from force of habit or because a high medical authority had ordered her to drink the waters she frankly admitted the reason of her visit to have been simply that she didnt know where else to turn but she appeared to assume that my behaviour rested on higher grounds and even that it required explanation the place being frivolous and moderndevoid of that interest of antiquity which i had ever made so much of dont you rememberever so long agothat you wouldnt look at anything in europe that wasnt a thousand years old well as we advance in life i suppose we dont think that quite such a charm and when i mentioned that i had arrived because the place was as good as another for awaiting my nephew she exclaimed your nephewwhat nephew he must have come up of late i answered that his name was archie parker and that he was modern indeed he was to attain legal manhood in a few months and was in europe for the first time my last news of him had been from paris and i was expecting to hear further from one day to the other his father was dead and though a selfish bachelor little versed in the care of children i was considerably counted on by his mother to see that he didnt smoke nor flirt too much nor yet tumble off an alp  mrs pallant immediately guessed that his mother was my sister charlotte whom she spoke of familiarly though i knew she had scarce seen her then in a moment it came to her which of the parkers charlotte had married she remembered the family perfectly from the old new york daysthat disgustingly rich set she said it was very nice having the boy come out that way to my care to which i replied that it was very nice for the boy she pronounced the advantage rather minei ought to have had children there was something so parental about me and i would have brought them up so well she could make an allusion like thatto all that might have been and had not beenwithout a gleam of guilt in her eye and i foresaw that before i left the place i should have confided to her that though i detested her and was very glad we had fallen out yet our old relations had left me no heart for marrying another woman if i had remained so single and so sterile the fault was nobodys but hers she asked what i meant to do with my nephewto which i replied that it was much more a question of what he would do with me she wished to know if he were a nice young man and had brothers and sisters and any particular profession i assured her i had really seen little of him i believed him to be six feet high and of tolerable parts he was an only son but there was a little sister at home a delicate rather blighted child demanding all the mothers care  so that makes your responsibility greater as it were about the boy doesnt it said mrs pallant  greater im sure i dont know  why if the girls lifes uncertain he may become some moment all the mother has so that being in your hands  oh i shall keep him alive i suppose if you mean that i returned  well we wont kill him shall we linda my friend went on with a laugh  i dont knowperhaps we shall smiled the girl     ii  i called on them the next at their lodgings the modesty of which was enhanced by a hundred pretty feminine devicesflowers and photographs and portable knickknacks and a hired piano and morsels of old brocade flung over angular sofas i took them to drive i met them again at the kursaal i arranged that we should dine together after the homburg fashion at the same table dhote and during several days this revived familiar intercourse continued imitating intimacy if not quite achieving it i was pleased as my companions passed the time for me and the conditions of our life were soothingthe feeling of summer and shade and music and leisure in the german gardens and woods where we strolled and sat and gossiped to which may be added a vague sociable sense that among people whose challenge to the curiosity was mainly not irresistible we kept quite to ourselves we were on the footing of old friends who still had in regard to each other discoveries to make we knew each others nature but didnt know each others experience so that when mrs pallant related to me what she had been up to as i called it for so many years the former knowledge attached a hundred interpretative footnotesas if i had been editing an author who presented difficultiesto the interesting page there was nothing new to me in the fact that i didnt esteem her but there was relief in my finding that this wasnt necessary at homburg and that i could like her in spite of it she struck me in the oddest way as both improved and degenerate the two processes in her nature might have gone on together she was battered and worldworn and spiritually speaking vulgarised something fresh had rubbed off herit even included the vivacity of her early desire to do the best thing for herselfand something rather stale had rubbed on at the same time she betrayed a scepticism and that was rather becoming for it had quenched the eagerness of her prime the mercenary principle i had so suffered from she had grown weary and detached and since she affected me as more impressed with the evil of the world than with the good this was a gain in other words her accretion of indifference if not of cynicism showed a softer surface than that of her old ambitions furthermore i had to recognise that her devotion to her daughter was a kind of religion she had done the very best possible for linda  linda was curious linda was interesting ive seen girls i liked bettercharming as this one might bebut have never seen one who for the hour you were with her the impression passed somehow when she was out of sight occupied you so completely i can best describe the attention she provoked by saying that she struck you above all things as a felicitous final productafter the fashion of some plant or some fruit some waxen orchid or some perfect peach she was clearly the result of a process of calculation a process patiently educative a pressure exerted and all artfully so that she should reach a high point  this high point had been the star of her mothers heavenit hung before her so unquenchablyand had shed the only light in default of a better that was to shine on the poor ladys path it stood her instead of every other ideal the very most and the very bestthat was what the girl had been led on to achieve i mean of course since no real miracle had been wrought the most and the best she was capable of she was as pretty as graceful as intelligent as wellbred as wellinformed as welldressed as could have been conceived for her her music her singing her german her french her english her step her tone her glance her manner everything in her person and movement from the shade and twist of her hair to the way you saw her fingernails were pink when she raised her hand had been carried so far that one found ones self accepting them as the very measure of young grace i regarded her thus as a model yet it was a part of her perfection that she had none of the stiffness of a pattern if she held the observation it was because you wondered where and when she would break down but she never broke down either in her french accent or in her role of educated angel  after archie had come the ladies were manifestly his greatest resource and all the world knows why a party of four is more convenient than a party of three my nephew had kept me waiting a week with a serenity all his own but this very coolness was a help to harmonyso long that is as i didnt lose my temper with it i didnt for the most part because my young mans unperturbed acceptance of the most various forms of good fortune had more than anything else the effect of amusing me i had seen little of him for the last three or four years i wondered what his impending majority would have made of himhe didnt at all carry himself as if the wind of his fortune were risingand i watched him with a solicitude that usually ended in a joke he was a tall freshcoloured youth with a candid circular countenance and a love of cigarettes horses and boats which had not been sacrificed to more strenuous studies he was reassuringly natural in a supercivilised age and i soon made up my mind that the formula of his character was in the clearing of the inward scene by his so preordained lack of imagination if he was serene this was still further simplifying after that i had time to meditate on the line that divides the serene from the inane the simple from the silly he wasnt clever the fonder theory quite defied our cultivation though mrs pallant tried it once or twice but on the other hand it struck me his want of wit might be a good defensive weapon it wasnt the sort of density that would let him in but the sort that would keep him out by which i dont mean that he had shortsighted suspicions but that on the contrary imagination would never be needed to save him since she would never put him in danger he was in short a wellgrown wellwashed muscular young american whose extreme salubrity might have made him pass for conceited if he looked pleased with himself it was only because he was pleased with lifeas well he might be with the fortune that awaited the stroke of his twentyfirst yearand his big healthy independent person was an inevitable part of that i am bound to add that he was accommodatingfor which i was grateful his habits were active but he didnt insist on my adopting them and he made numerous and generous sacrifices for my society when i say he made them for mine i must duly remember that mine and that of mrs pallant and linda were now very much the same thing he was willing to sit and smoke for hours under the trees or adapting his long legs to the pace of his three companions stroll through the nearer woods of the charming little hillrange of the taunus to those rustic wirthschaften where coffee might be drunk under a trellis mrs pallant took a great interest in him she made him with his easy uncle a subject of discourse she pronounced him a delightful specimen as a young gentleman of his period and country she even asked me the sort of figure his fortune might really amount to and professed a rage of envy when i told her what i supposed it to be while we were so occupied archie on his side couldnt do less than converse with linda nor to tell the truth did he betray the least inclination for any different exercise they strolled away together while their elders rested two or three times in the evening when the ballroom of the kursaal was lighted and dancemusic played they whirled over the smooth floor in a waltz that stirred my memory whether it had the same effect on mrs pallants i know not she held her peace we had on certain occasions our moments almost our halfhours of unembarrassed silence while our young companions disported themselves but if at other times her enquiries and comments were numerous on this article of my ingenuous charge that might very well have passed for a courteous recognition of the frequent admiration i expressed for lindaan admiration that drew from her i noticed but scant direct response i was struck thus with her reserve when i spoke of her daughtermy remarks produced so little of a maternal flutter her detachment her air of having no fatuous illusions and not being blinded by prejudice seemed to me at times to savour of affectation either she answered me with a vague and impatient sigh and changed the subject or else she said before doing so oh yes yes shes a very brilliant creature she ought to be god knows what ive done for her the reader will have noted my fondness in all cases for the explanations of things as an example of which i had my theory here that she was disappointed in the girl where then had her special calculation failed as she couldnt possibly have wished her prettier or more pleasing the pang must have been for her not having made a successful use of her gifts had she expected her to land a prince the day after leaving the schoolroom there was after all plenty of time for this with linda but twoandtwenty it didnt occur to me to wonder if the source of her mothers tepidity was that the young lady had not turned out so nice a nature as she had hoped because in the first place linda struck me as perfectly innocent and because in the second i wasnt paid in the french phrase for supposing louisa pallant much concerned on that score the last hypothesis i should have invoked was that of private despair at bad moral symptoms and in relation to lindas nature i had before me the daily spectacle of her manner with my nephew it was as charming as it could be without betrayal of a desire to lead him on she was as familiar as a cousin but as a distant onea cousin who had been brought up to observe degrees she was so much cleverer than archie that she couldnt help laughing at him but she didnt laugh enough to exclude variety being well aware no doubt that a womans cleverness most shines in contrast with a mans stupidity when she pretends to take that stupidity for her law linda pallant moreover was not a chatterbox as she knew the value of many things she knew the value of intervals there were a good many in the conversation of these young persons my nephews own speech to say nothing of his thought abounding in comfortable lapses so that i sometimes wondered how their association was kept at that pitch of continuity of which it gave the impression it was friendly enough evidently when archie sat near hernear enough for low murmurs had such risen to his lipsand watched her with interested eyes and with freedom not to try too hard to make himself agreeable she had always something in handa flower in her tapestry to finish the leaves of a magazine to cut a button to sew on her glove she carried a little workbag in her pocket and was a person of the daintiest habits a pencil to ply ever so neatly in a sketchbook which she rested on her knee when we were indoorsmainly then at her mothers modest roomsshe had always the resource of her piano of which she was of course a perfect mistress  these pursuits supported her they helped her to an assurance under such narrow inspectioni ended by rebuking archie for it i told him he stared the poor girl out of countenanceand she sought further relief in smiling all over the place when my young mans eyes shone at her those of miss pallant addressed themselves brightly to the trees and clouds and other surrounding objects including her mother and me sometimes she broke into a sudden embarrassed happy pointless laugh when she wandered off with him she looked back at us in a manner that promised it wasnt for long and that she was with us still in spirit if i liked her i had therefore my good reason it was many a day since a pretty girl had had the air of taking me so much into account sometimes when they were so far away as not to disturb us she read aloud a little to mr archie i dont know where she got her booksi never provided them and certainly he didnt he was no reader and i fear he often dozed     iii  i remember the first timeit was at the end of about ten days of thisthat mrs pallant remarked to me my dear friend youre quite amazing you behave for all the world as if you were perfectly ready to accept certain consequences she nodded in the direction of our young companions but i nevertheless put her at the pains of saying what consequences she meant what consequences why the very same consequences that ensued when you and i first became acquainted  i hesitated but then looking her in the eyes said do you mean shed throw him over  youre not kind youre not generous she replied with a quick colour im giving you a warning  you mean that my boy may fall in love with your girl  certainly it looks even as if the harm might be already done  then your warning comes too late i significantly smiled but why do you call it a harm  havent you any sense of the rigour of your office she asked is that what his mother has sent him out to you for that you shall find him the first wife you can pick up that you shall let him put his head into the noose the day after his arrival  heaven forbid i should do anything of the kind i know moreover that his mother doesnt want him to marry young she holds it the worst of mistakes she feels that at that age a man never really chooses he doesnt choose till he has lived a while till he has looked about and compared  and what do you think then yourself  i should like to say i regard the fact of falling in love at whatever age as in itself an act of selection but my being as i am at this time of day would contradict me too much  well then youre too primitive you ought to leave this place tomorrow  so as not to see archie fall  you ought to fish him out nowfrom where he has fallenand take him straight away  i wondered a little do you think hes in very far  if i were his mother i know what i should think i can put myself in her placeim not narrowminded i know perfectly well how she must regard such a question  and dont you know i returned that in america thats not thought importantthe way the mother regards it  mrs pallant had a pauseas if i mystified or vexed her well were not in america we happen to be here  no my poor sisters up to her neck in new york  im almost capable of writing to her to come out said mrs pallant  you are warning me i cried but i hardly know of what it seems to me my responsibility would begin only at the moment your daughter herself should seem in danger  oh you neednt mind thatill take care of linda  but i went on if you think shes in danger already ill carry him off tomorrow  it would be the best thing you could do  i dont knowi should be very sorry to act on a false alarm im very well here i like the place and the life and your society besides it doesnt strike me thaton her sidetheres any real symptom  she looked at me with an air i had never seen in her face and if i had puzzled her she repaid me in kind youre very annoying you dont deserve what id fain do for you  what shed fain do for me she didnt tell me that day but we took up the subject again i remarked that i failed to see why we should assume that a girl like lindabrilliant enough to make one of the greatestwould fall so very easily into my nephews arms might i enquire if her mother had won a confession from her if she had stammered out her secret mrs pallant made me on this the point that they had no need to tell each other such thingsthey hadnt lived together twenty years in such intimacy for nothing to which i returned that i had guessed as much but that there might be an exception for a great occasion like the present if linda had shown nothing it was a sign that for her the occasion wasnt great and i mentioned that archie had spoken to me of the young lady only to remark casually and rather patronisingly after his first encounter with her that she was a regular little flower the little flower was nearly three years older than himself apart from this he hadnt alluded to her and had taken up no allusion of mine mrs pallant informed me againfor which i was preparedthat i was quite too primitive after which she said we neednt discuss the case if you dont wish to but i happen to knowhow i obtained my knowledge isnt importantthat the moment mr parker should propose to my daughter shed gobble him down surely its a detail worth mentioning to you  i sought to defer then to her judgement very good ill sound him ill look into the matter tonight  dont dont youll spoil everything she spoke as with some finer view remove him quicklythats the only thing  i didnt at all like the idea of removing him quickly it seemed too summary too extravagant even if presented to him on specious grounds and moreover as i had told mrs pallant i really had no wish to change my scene it was no part of my promise to my sister that with my middleaged habits i should duck and dodge about europe so i temporised should you really object to the boy so much as a soninlaw after all hes a good fellow and a gentleman  my poor friend youre incredibly superficial she made answer with an assurance that struck me  the contempt in it so nettled me in fact that i exclaimed possibly but it seems odd that a lesson in consistency should come from you  i had no retort from her on this rather to my surprise and when she spoke again it was all quietly i think linda and i had best withdraw weve been here a monthit will have served our purpose  mercy on us that will be a bore i protested and for the rest of the evening till we separatedour conversation had taken place after dinner at the kursaalshe said little preserving a subdued and almost injured air this somehow didnt appeal to me since it was absurd that louisa pallant of all women should propose to put me in the wrong if ever a woman had been in the wrong herself i had even no need to go into that archie and i at all events usually attended the ladies back to their own doorthey lived in a street of minor accommodation at a certain distance from the roomswhere we parted for the night late on the big cobblestones in the little sleeping german town under the closed windows of which suggesting stuffy interiors our cheerful english partings resounded on this occasion indeed they rather languished the question that had come up for me with mrs pallant appearedand by no intention of mineto have brushed the young couple with its chill archie and linda too struck me as conscious and dumb  as i walked back to our hotel with my nephew i passed my hand into his arm and put to him by no roundabout approach the question of whether he were in serious peril of love  i dont know i dont knowreally uncle i dont know was however all the satisfaction i could extract from the youth who hadnt the smallest vein of introspection he mightnt know but before we reached the innwe had a few more words on the subjectit seemed to me that i did his mind wasnt formed to accommodate at one time many subjects of thought but linda pallant certainly constituted for the moment its principal furniture she pervaded his consciousness she solicited his curiosity she associated herself in a manner as yet informal and undefined with his future i could see that she held that she beguiled him as no one had ever done i didnt betray to him however that perception and i spent my night a prey to the consciousness that after all it had been none of my business to provide him with the sense of being captivated to put him in relation with a young enchantress was the last thing his mother had expected of me or that i had expected of myself moreover it was quite my opinion that he himself was too young to be a judge of enchantresses mrs pallant was right and i had given high proof of levity in regarding her with her beautiful daughter as a resource there were other resourcesone of which would be most decidedly to clear out what did i know after all about the girl except that i rejoiced to have escaped from marrying her mother that mother it was true was a singular person and it was strange her conscience should have begun to fidget in advance of my own it was strange she should so soon have felt archies peril and even stranger that she should have then wished to save him the ways of women were infinitely subtle and it was no novelty to me that one never knew where they would turn up as i havent hesitated in this report to expose the irritable side of my own nature i shall confess that i even wondered if my old friends solicitude hadnt been a deeper artifice wasnt it possibly a plan of her own for making sure of my young manthough i didnt quite see the logic of it if she regarded him which she might in view of his large fortune as a great catch mightnt she have arranged this little comedy in their personal interest with the girl  that possibility at any rate only made it a happier thought that i should win my companion to some curiosity about other places there were many of course much more worth his attention than homburg in the course of the morningit was after our early luncheoni walked round to mrs pallants to let her know i was ready to take action but even while i went i again felt the unlikelihood of the part attributed by my fears and by the mothers own so far as they had been roused to linda certainly if she was such a girl as these fears represented her she would fly at higher game it was with an eye to high game mrs pallant had frankly admitted to me that she had been trained and such an education to say nothing of such a performer justified a hope of greater returns a young american the fruit of scant modelling who could give her nothing but pocketmoney was a very moderate prize and if she had been prepared to marry for ambitionthere was no such hardness in her face or tone but then there never isher mark would be inevitably a personage quelconque i was received at my friends lodging with the announcement that she had left homburg with her daughter half an hour before the good woman who had entertained the pair professed to know nothing of their movements beyond the fact that they had gone to frankfort where however it was her belief that they didnt intend to remain they were evidently travelling beyond sudden their decision to move oh yes the matter of a moment they must have spent the night in packing they had so many things and such pretty ones and their poor maid all the morning had scarce had time to swallow her coffee but they clearly were ladies accustomed to come and go it didnt matterwith such rooms as hers she never wanted there was a new family coming in at three     iv  this piece of strategy left me staring and made me i must confess quite furious my only consolation was that archie when i told him looked as blank as myself and that the trick touched him more nearly for i was not now in love with louisa we agreed that we required an explanation and we pretended to expect one the next day in the shape of a letter satisfactory even to the point of being apologetic when i say we pretended i mean that i did for my suspicion that he knew what had been on footthrough an arrangement with lindalasted only a moment if his resentment was less than my own his surprise was equally great i had been willing to bolt but i felt slighted by the ease with which mrs pallant had shown she could part with us archie professed no sense of a grievance because in the first place he was shy about it and because in the second it was evidently not definite to him that he had been encouragedequipped as he was i think with no very particular idea of what constituted encouragement he was fresh from the wonderful country in which there may between the ingenuous young be so little question of intentions he was but dimly conscious of his own and could by no means have told me whether he had been challenged or been jilted i didnt want to exasperate him but when at the end of three days more we were still without news of our late companions i observed that it was very simplethey must have been just hiding from us they thought us dangerous they wished to avoid entanglements they had found us too attentive and wished not to raise false hopes he appeared to accept this explanation and even had the airso at least i inferred from his asking me no questionsof judging the matter might be delicate for myself the poor youth was altogether much mystified and i smiled at the image in his mind of mrs pallant fleeing from his uncles importunities we decided to leave homburg but if we didnt pursue our fugitives it wasnt simply that we were ignorant of where they were i could have found that out with a little trouble but i was deterred by the reflexion that this would be louisas reasoning she was a dreadful humbug and her departure had been a provocationi fear it was in that stupid conviction that i made out a little independent itinerary with archie i even believed we should learn where they were quite soon enough and that our patienceeven my young manswould be longer than theirs therefore i uttered a small private cry of triumph when three weeks laterwe happened to be at interlakenhe reported to me that he had received a note from miss pallant the form of this confidence was his enquiring if there were particular reasons why we should longer delay our projected visit to the italian lakes mightnt the fear of the hot weather which was moreover at that season our native temperature cease to operate the middle of september having arrived i answered that we would start on the morrow if he liked and then pleased apparently that i was so easy to deal with he revealed his little secret he showed me his letter which was a graceful natural documentit covered with a few flowing strokes but a single page of notepapernot at all compromising to the young lady if however it was almost the apology i had looked forsave that this should have come from the motherit was not ostensibly in the least an invitation it mentioned casuallythe mention was mainly in the words at the head of her paperthat they were on the lago maggiore at baveno but it consisted mainly of the expression of a regret that they had had so abruptly to leave homburg linda failed to say under what necessity they had found themselves she only hoped we hadnt judged them too harshly and would accept this hasty line as a substitute for the omitted goodbye she also hoped our days were passing pleasantly and with the same lovely weather that prevailed south of the alps and she remained very sincerely and with the kindest remembrances  the note contained no message from her mother and it was open to me to suppose as i should prefer either that mrs pallant hadnt known she was writing or that they wished to make us think she hadnt known the letter might pass as a common civility of the girls to a person with whom she had been on easy terms it was however for something more than this that my nephew took it so at least i gathered from the touching candour of his determination to go to baveno i judged it idle to drag him another way he had money in his own pocket and was quite capable of giving me the slip yetsuch are the sweet incongruities of youthwhen i asked him to what tune he had been thinking of linda since they left us in the lurch he replied oh i havent been thinking at all why should i this fib was accompanied by an exorbitant blush since he was to obey his young womans signal i must equally make out where it would take him and one splendid morning we started over the simplon in a postchaise  i represented to him successfully that it would be in much better taste for us to alight at stresa which as every one knows is a resort of tourists also on the shore of the major lake at about a miles distance from baveno if we stayed at the latter place we should have to inhabit the same hotel as our friends and this might be awkward in view of a strained relation with them nothing would be easier than to go and come between the two points especially by the water which would give archie a chance for unlimited paddling his face lighted up at the vision of a pair of oars he pretended to take my plea for discretion very seriously and i could see that he had at once begun to calculate opportunities for navigation with linda our postchaisei had insisted on easy stages and we were three days on the waydeposited us at stresa toward the middle of the afternoon and it was within an amazingly short time that i found myself in a small boat with my nephew who pulled us over to baveno with vigorous strokes i remember the sweetness of the whole impression i had had it before but to my companion it was new and he thought it as pretty as the opera the enchanting beauty of the place and hour the stillness of the air and water with the romantic fantastic borromean islands set as great jewels in a crystal globe we disembarked at the steps by the gardenfoot of the hotel and somehow it seemed a perfectly natural part of the lovely situation that i should immediately become conscious of mrs pallant and her daughter seated on the terrace and quietly watching us they had the air of expectation which i think we had counted on i hadnt even asked archie if he had answered lindas note this was between themselves and in the way of supervision i had done enough in coming with him  there is no doubt our present address all round lacked a little the easiest graceor at least louisas and mine did i felt too much the appeal of her exhibition to notice closely the style of encounter of the young people i couldnt get it out of my head as i have sufficiently indicated that mrs pallant was playing a game and im afraid she saw in my face that this suspicion had been the motive of my journey i had come there to find her out the knowledge of my purpose couldnt help her to make me very welcome and thats why i speak of our meeting constrainedly we observed none the less all the forms and the admirable scene left us plenty to talk about i made no reference before linda to the retreat from homburg this young woman looked even prettier than she had done on the eve of that manoeuvre and gave no sign of an awkward consciousness she again so struck me as a charming clever girl that i was freshly puzzled to know why we should getor should have gotinto a tangle about her people had to want to complicate a situation to do it on so simple a pretext as that linda was in every way beautiful this was the clear fact so why shouldnt the presumptions be in favour of every result of it one of the effects of that cause on the spot was that at the end of a very short time archie proposed to her to take a turn with him in his boat which awaited us at the foot of the steps she looked at her mother with a smiling may i mamma and mrs pallant answered certainly darling if youre not afraid at thisi scarcely knew whyi sought the relief of laughter it must have affected me as comic that the girls general competence should suffer the imputation of that particular flaw she gave me a quick slightly sharp look as she turned away with my nephew it appeared to challenge me a littlepray whats the matter with you it was the first expression of the kind i had ever seen in her face mrs pallants attention on the other hand rather strayed from me after we had been left there together she sat silent not heeding me looking at the lake and mountainsat the snowy crests crowned with the flush of evening she seemed not even to follow our young companions as they got into their boat and pushed off for some minutes i respected her mood i walked slowly up and down the terrace and lighted a cigar as she had always permitted me to do at homburg i found in her it was true rather a new air of weariness her fine cold wellbred face was pale i noted in it new lines of fatigue almost of age at last i stopped in front of her andsince she looked so sadasked if she had been having bad news  the only bad news was when i learnedthrough your nephews note to lindathat you were coming to us  ah then he wrote  certainly he wrote  you take it all harder than i do i returned as i sat down beside her and then i added smiling have you written to his mother  slowly at last and more directly she faced me take care take care or youll have been more brutal than youll afterwards like she said with an air of patience before the inevitable  never never unless you think me brutal if i ask whether you knew when linda wrote  she had an hesitation yes she showed me her letter she wouldnt have done anything else i let it go because i didnt know what course was best im afraid to oppose her to her face  afraid my dear friend with that girl  that girl much you know about her it didnt follow youd come i didnt take that for granted  im like you i saidi too am afraid of my nephew i dont venture to oppose him to his face the only thing i could doonce he wished itwas to come with him  i see well there are grounds after all on which im glad she rather inscrutably added  oh i was conscientious about that but ive no authority i can neither drive him nor stay himi can use no force i explained look at the way hes pulling that boat and see if you can fancy me  you could tell him shes a bad hard girlone whod poison any good mans life my companion broke out with a passion that startled me  at first i could only gape dear lady what do you mean  she bent her face into her hands covering it over with them and so remained a minute then she continued a little differently though as if she hadnt heard my question i hoped you were too disgusted with usafter the way we left you planted  it was disconcerting assuredly and it might have served if linda hadnt written that patched it up i gaily professed but my gaiety was thin for i was still amazed at her violence of a moment before do you really mean that she wont do i added  she made no direct answer she only said after a little that it didnt matter whether the crisis should come a few weeks sooner or a few weeks later since it was destined to come at the first chance the favouring moment linda had marked my young manand when linda had marked a thing  bless my soulhow very grim but i didnt understand do you mean shes in love with him  its enough if she makes him think sothough even that isnt essential  still i was at sea if she makes him think so dear old friend whats your idea ive observed her ive watched her and when alls said what has she done she has been civil and pleasant to him but it would have been much more marked if she hadnt she has really shown him with her youth and her natural charm nothing more than common friendliness her note was nothing he let me see it  i dont think youve heard every word she has said to him mrs pallant returned with an emphasis that still struck me as perverse  no more have you i take it i promptly cried she evidently meant more than she said but if this excited my curiosity it also moved in a different connexion my indulgence  no but i know my own daughter shes a most remarkable young woman  youve an extraordinary tone about her i declared such a tone as i think ive never before heard on a mothers lips ive had the same impression from youthat of a disposition to give her away but never yet so strong  at this mrs pallant got up she stood there looking down at me you make my reparationmy expiationdifficult and leaving me still more astonished she moved along the terrace  i overtook her presently and repeated her words your reparationyour expiation what on earth are you talking about  you know perfectly what i meanits too magnanimous of you to pretend you dont  well at any rate i said i dont see what good it does me or what it makes up to me for that you should abuse your daughter  oh i dont care i shall save him she cried as we went and with an extravagance as i felt of sincerity at the same moment two ladies apparently english came toward usscattered groups had been sitting there and the inmates of the hotel were moving to and froand i observed the immediate charming transition the fruit of such years of social practice by which as they greeted us her tension and her impatience dropped to recognition and pleasure they stopped to speak to her and she enquired with sweet propriety as to the continued improvement of their sister i strolled on and she presently rejoined me after which she had a peremptory note come away from thiscome down into the garden we descended to that blander scene strolled through it and paused on the border of the lake     v  the charm of the evening had deepened the stillness was like a solemn expression on a beautiful face and the whole air of the place divine in the fading light my nephews boat was too far out to be perceived i looked for it a little and then as i gave it up remarked that from such an excursion as that on such a lake and at such an hour a young man and a young woman of common sensibility could only come back doubly pledged to each other  to this observation mrs pallants answer was superficially at least irrelevant she said after a pause with you my dear man one has certainly to dot ones is havent you discovered and didnt i tell you at homburg that were miserably poor  isnt miserably rather too muchliving as you are at an expensive hotel  well she promptly met this they take us en pension for ever so little a day ive been knocking about europe long enough to learn all sorts of horrid arts besides dont speak of hotels weve spent half our life in them and linda told me only last night that she hoped never to put her foot into one again she feels that when she comes to such a place as this she ought if things were decently right to find a villa of her own  then her companion theres perfectly competent to give her one dont think ive the least desire to push them into each others armsi only ask to wash my hands of them but i should like to know why you want as you said just now to save him when you speak as if your daughter were a monster i take it youre not serious  she was facing me in the rich short twilight and to describe herself as immeasurably more serious perhaps than she had ever been in her life she had only to look at me without protestation its lindas standard god knows i myself could get on shes ambitious luxurious determined to have what she wantsmore on the make than any one ive ever seen of course its open to you to tell me its my own fault that i was so before her and have made her so but does that make me like it any better  dear mrs pallant youre wonderful youre terrible i could only stammer lost in the desert of my thoughts  oh yes youve made up your mind about me you see me in a certain way and dont like the trouble of changing votre siege est fait but youll have to changeif youve any generosity her eyes shone in the summer dusk and the beauty of her youth came back to her  is this a part of the reparation of the expiation i demanded i dont see what you ever did to archie  its enough that he belongs to you but it isnt for you i do itits for myself she strangely went on  doubtless youve your own reasonswhich i cant penetrate but cant you sacrifice something else must you sacrifice your only child  my only childs my punishment my only childs my stigma she cried in her exaltation  it seems to me rather that youre hers  hers what does she know of such thingswhat can she ever feel shes cased in steel she has a heart of marble its trueits true said louisa pallant she appals me  i laid my hand on my poor friends i uttered with the intention of checking and soothing her the first incoherent words that came into my head and i drew her toward a bench a few steps away she dropped upon it i placed myself near her and besought her to consider well what she said she owed me nothing and i wished no one injured no one denounced or exposed for my sake  for your sake oh im not thinking of you she answered and indeed the next moment i thought my words rather fatuous its a satisfaction to my own consciencefor i have one little as you may think ive a right to speak of it ive been punished by my sin itself ive been hideously worldly ive thought only of that and ive taught her to be soto do the same thats the only instruction ive ever given her and she has learned the lesson so well that now i see it stamped there in all her nature on all her spirit and on all her form im horrified at my work for years weve lived that way weve thought of nothing else she has profited so well by my beautiful influence that she has gone far beyond the great original i say im horrified mrs pallant dreadfully wound up because shes horrible  my poor extravagant friend i pleaded isnt it still more so to hear a mother say such things  why so if theyre abominably true besides i dont care what i say if i save him  i could only gape again at this least expected of all my adventures do you expect me then to repeat to him  not in the least she broke in ill do it myself at this i uttered some strong inarticulate protest but she went on with the grimmest simplicity i was very glad at first but it would have been better if we hadnt met  i dont agree to that for you interest me i rather ruefully professed immensely  i dont care if i doso i interest him  you must reflect then that your denunciation can only strike me as for all its violence vague and unconvincing never had a girl less the appearance of bearing such charges out you know how ive admired her  you know nothing about her i do you see for shes the work of my hand and mrs pallant laughed for bitterness ive watched her for years and little by little for the last two or three it has come over me theres not a tender spot in her whole composition to arrive at a brilliant social position if it were necessary she would see me drown in this lake without lifting a finger she would stand there and see itshe would push me inand never feel a pang thats my young lady her lucidity chilled me to the soulit seemed to shine so flawless to climb up to the top and be splendid and envied there she went onto do that at any cost or by any meanness and cruelty is the only thing she has a heart for shed lie for it shed steal for it shed kill for it my companion brought out these words with a cold confidence that had evidently behind it some occult past process of growth i watched her pale face and glowing eyes she held me breathless and frowning but her strange vindictive or at least retributive passion irresistibly imposed itself i found myself at last believing her pitying her more than i pitied the subject of her dreadful analysis it was as if she had held her tongue for longer than she could bear suffering more and more the importunity of the truth it relieved her thus to drag that to the light and still she kept up the high and most unholy sacrifice god in his mercy has let me see it in time but his ways are strange that he has let me see it in my daughter its myself he has let me seemyself as i was for years but shes worseshe is i assure you shes worse than i intended or dreamed her hands were clasped tightly together in her lap her low voice quavered and her breath came short she looked up at the southern stars as if they would understand  have you ever spoken to her as you speak to me i finally asked have you ever put before her this terrible arraignment  put it before her how can i put it before her when all she would have to say would be you you you base one who made me  then why do you want to play her a trick  im not bound to tell you and you wouldnt see my point if i did i should play that boy a far worse one if i were to stay my hand  oh i had my view of this if he loves her he wont believe a word you say  very possibly but i shall have done my duty  and shall you say to him i asked simply what youve said to me  never mind what i shall say to him it will be something that will perhaps helpfully affect him only she added with her proud decision i must lose no time  if youre so bent on gaining time i said why did you let her go out in the boat with him  let her how could i prevent it  but she asked your permission  ah that she cried is all a part of all the comedy  it fairly hushed me to silence and for a moment more she said nothing then she doesnt know you hate her i resumed  i dont know what she knows she has depths and depths and all of them bad besides i dont hate her in the least i just pity her for what ive made of her but i pity still more the man who may find himself married to her  theres not much danger of there being any such person i wailed at the rate you go on  i beg your pardontheres a perfect possibility said my companion shell marryshell marry well shell marry a title as well as a fortune  its a pity my nephew hasnt a title i attempted the grimace of suggesting  she seemed to wonder i see you think i want that and that im acting a part god forgive you your suspicions perfectly natural how can any one tell asked louisa pallantwith people like us  her utterance of these words brought tears to my eyes i laid my hand on her arm holding her a while and we looked at each other through the dusk you couldnt do more if he were my son  oh if he had been your son hed have kept out of it i like him for himself hes simple and sane and honesthe needs affection  he would have quite the most remarkable of mothersinlaw i commented  mrs pallant gave a small dry laughshe wasnt joking we lingered by the lake while i thought over what she had said to me and while she herself apparently thought i confess that even close at her side and under the strong impression of her sincerity her indifference to the conventional graces my imagination my constitutional scepticism began to range queer ideas came into my head was the comedy on her side and not on the girls and was she posturing as a magnanimous woman at poor lindas expense was she determined in spite of the young ladys preference to keep her daughter for a grander personage than a young american whose dollars were not numerous enoughnumerous as they wereto make up for his want of high relationships and had she invented at once the boldest and the subtlest of games in order to keep the case in her hands if she was prepared really to address herself to archie she would have to go very far to overcome the mistrust he would be sure to feel at a proceeding superficially so sinister was she prepared to go far enough the answer to these doubts was simply the way i had been touchedit came back to me the next momentwhen she used the words people like us their effect was to wring my heart she seemed to kneel in the dust and i felt in a manner ashamed that i had let her sink to it she said to me at last that i must wait no longer i must go away before the young people came back they were staying long too long all the more reason then she should deal with my nephew that night i must drive back to stresa or if i liked i could go on foot it wasnt farfor an active man she disposed of me freely she was so full of her purpose and after we had quitted the garden and returned to the terrace above she seemed almost to push me to leave heri felt her fine consecrated hands fairly quiver on my shoulders i was ready to do as she prescribed she affected me painfully she had given me a turn and i wanted to get away from her but before i went i asked her why linda should regard my young man as such a parti it didnt square after all with her account of the girls fierce ambitions by that account these favours to one so graceless were a woeful waste of time  oh she has worked it all out she has regarded the question in every light said mrs pallant if she has made up her mind its because she sees what she can do  do you mean that she has talked it over with you  my friends wonderful face pitied my simplicity lord for what do you take us we dont talk things over today we know each others point of view and only have to act we observe the highest proprieties of speech we never for a moment name anything uglywe only just go at it we can take definitions which are awkward things for granted  but in this case i nevertheless urged the poor thing cant possibly be aware of your point of view  no she concededthats because i havent played fair of course she couldnt expect id cheat there ought to be honour among thieves but it was open to her to do the same  what do you mean by the same  she might have fallen in love with a poor man then i should have been done  a rich ones better he can do more i replied with conviction  at this she appeared to have in the oddest way a momentary revulsion so youd have reason to know if you had led the life that we have never to have had really enoughi mean to do just the few simple things weve wanted never to have had the sinews of war i suppose youd call them the funds for a campaign to have felt every day and every hour the hard eternal pinch and found the question of dollars and centsand so horridly few of themmixed up with every experience with every impulse that does make one mercenary does make money seem a good beyond all others which its quite natural it should and its why lindas of the opinion that a fortunes always a fortune she knows all about that of your nephew how its invested how it may be expected to increase exactly on what sort of footing it would enable her to live she has decided that its enough and enough is as good as a feast she thinks she could lead him by the nose and i dare say she could shell of course make him live in these countries she hasnt the slightest intention of casting her pearlsbut basta said my friend i think she has views upon london because in england he can hunt and shoot and that will make him leave her more or less to herself  i dont know about his leaving her to herself but it strikes me that he would like the rest of that matter very much i returned thats not at all a bad programme even from archies point of view  its no use thinking of princes she pursued as if she hadnt heard me theyre most of them more in want of money even than we therefore greatness is out of the questionwe really recognised that at an early stage your nephews exactly the sort of young man weve always built uponif he wasnt so impossibly your nephew from head to foot he was made on purpose dear linda was her mothers own daughter when she recognised him on the spot ones enough of a prince today when ones the right american such a wonderful price is set on ones not being the wrong it does as well as anything and its a great simplification if you dont believe me go to london and see she had come with me out to the road i had said i would walk back to stresa and we stood there in the sweet dark warmth as i took her hand bidding her goodnight i couldnt but exhale a compassion poor linda poor linda  oh shell live to do better said mrs pallant  how can she do bettersince youve described all she finds archie as perfection  she knew quite what she meant ah better for him  i still had her handi still sought her eyes how came it you could throw me oversuch a woman as you  well my friend if i hadnt thrown you over how could i do this for you on which disengaging herself she turned quickly away     vi  i dont know how deeply she flushed as she made in the form of her question this avowal which was a retraction of a former denial and the real truth as i permitted myself to believe but was aware of the colour of my own cheeks while i took my way to stresaa walk of half an hourin the attenuating night the new and singular character in which she had appeared to me produced in me an emotion that would have made sitting still in a carriage impossible this same stress kept me up after i had reached my hotel as i knew i shouldnt sleep it was useless to go to bed long however as i deferred this ceremony archie had not reappeared when the innlights began here and there to be dispensed with i felt even slightly anxious for him wondering at possible mischances then i reflected that in case of an accident on the lake that is of his continued absence from bavenomrs pallant would already have dispatched me a messenger it was foolish moreover to suppose anything could have happened to him after putting off from baveno by water to rejoin me for the evening was absolutely windless and more than sufficiently clear and the lake as calm as glass besides i had unlimited confidence in his power to take care of himself in a much tighter place i went to my room at last his own was at some distance the people of the hotel not having been ableit was the height of the autumn seasonto make us contiguous before i went to bed i had occasion to ring for a servant and i then learned by a chance enquiry that my nephew had returned an hour before and had gone straight to his own quarters i hadnt supposed he could come in without my seeing himi was wandering about the saloons and terracesand it had not occurred to me to knock at his door i had half a mind to do so nowi was so anxious as to how i should find him but i checked myself for evidently he had wanted to dodge me this didnt diminish my curiosity and i slept even less than i had expected his so markedly shirking our encounterfor if he hadnt perceived me downstairs he might have looked for me in my roomwas a sign that mrs pallants interview with him would really have come off what had she said to him what strong measures had she taken that almost morbid resolution i still seemed to hear the ring of pointed to conceivable extremities that i shrank from considering she had spoken of these things while we parted there as something she would do for me but i had made the mental comment in walking away from her that she hadnt done it yet it wouldnt truly be done till archie had truly backed out perhaps it was done by this time his avoiding me seemed almost a proof that was what i thought of most of the night i spent a considerable part of it at my window looking out to the couchant alps had he thought better of itwas he making up his mind to think better of it there was a strange contradiction in the matter there were in fact more contradictions than ever i had taken from louisa what she told me of linda and yet that other idea made me ashamed of my nephew i was sorry for the girl i regretted her loss of a great chance if loss it was to be and yet i hoped her mothers grand treacheryi didnt know what to call ithad been at least to her lover thoroughgoing it would need strong action in that lady to justify his retreat for him too i was sorryif she had made on him the impression she desired once or twice i was on the point of getting into my dressinggown and going forth to condole with him i was sure he too had jumped up from his bed and was looking out of his window at the everlasting hills  but i am bound to say that when we met in the morning for breakfast he showed few traces of ravage youth is strange it has resources that later experience seems only to undermine one of these is the masterly resource of beautiful blankness as we grow older and cleverer we think that too simple too crude we dissimulate more elaborately but with an effect much less baffling my young man looked not in the least as if he had lain awake or had something on his mind and when i asked him what he had done after my premature departurei explained this by saying i had been tired of waiting for him fagged with my journey i had wanted to go to bedhe replied oh nothing in particular i hung about the place i like it better than this one we had an awfully jolly time on the water i wasnt in the least fagged i didnt worry him with questions it struck me as gross to try to probe his secret the only indication he gave was on my saying after breakfast that i should go over again to see our friends and my appearing to take for granted he would be glad to come too then he let fall that hed stop at stresahe had paid them such a tremendous visit also that he had arrears of letters there was a freshness in his scruples about the length of his visits and i knew something about his correspondence which consisted entirely of twenty pages every week from his mother but he soothed my anxiety so little that it was really this yearning that carried me back to baveno this time i ordered a conveyance and as i got into it he stood watching me from the porch of the hotel with his hands in his pockets then it was for the first time that i saw in the poor youths face the expression of a person slightly dazed slightly foolish even to whom something disagreeable has happened our eyes met as i observed him and i was on the point of saying you had really better come with me when he turned away he went into the house as to escape my call i said to myself that he had been indeed warned off but that it wouldnt take much to bring him back  the servant to whom i spoke at baveno described my friends as in a summerhouse in the garden to which he led the way the place at large had an empty air most of the inmates of the hotel were dispersed on the lake on the hills in picnics excursions visits to the borromean islands my guide was so far right as that linda was in the summerhouse but she was there alone on finding this the case i stopped short rather awkwardlyi might have been from the way i suddenly felt an unmasked hypocrite a proved conspirator against her security and honour but there was no embarrassment in lovely linda she looked up with a cry of pleasure from the book she was reading and held out her hand with engaging frankness i felt again as if i had no right to that favour which i pretended not to have noticed this gave no chill however to her pretty manner she moved a roll of tapestry off the bench so that i might sit down she praised the place as a delightful shady corner she had never been fresher fairer kinder she made her mothers awful talk about her a hideous dream she told me her mother was coming to join her she had remained indoors to write a letter one couldnt write out there though it was so nice in other respects the table refused to stand firm they too then had pretexts of letters between themi judged this a token that the situation was tense it was the only one nevertheless that linda gave like archie she was young enough to carry it off she had been used to seeing us always together yet she made no comment on my having come over without him i waited in vain for her to speak of thisit would only be natural her omission couldnt but have a sense at last i remarked that my nephew was very unsociable that morning i had expected him to join me but he hadnt seemed to see the attraction  im very glad you can tell him that if you like said linda pallant  i wondered at her if i tell him hell come at once  then dont tell him i dont want him to come he stayed too long last night she went on and kept me out on the water till i dont know what oclock that sort of thing isnt done here you know and every one was shocked when we came backor rather you see when we didnt i begged him to bring me in but he wouldnt when we did returni almost had to take the oars myselfi felt as if every one had been sitting up to time us to stare at us it was awfully awkward  these words much impressed me and as i have treated the reader to most of the reflexionssome of them perhaps rather morbidin which i indulged on the subject of this young lady and her mother i may as well complete the record and let him know that i now wondered whether lindacandid and accomplished maidenentertained the graceful thought of strengthening her hold of archie by attempting to prove he had compromised her ah no doubt that was the reason he had a bad conscience last evening i made answer when he came back to stresa he sneaked off to his room he wouldnt look me in the face  but my young lady was not to be ruffled mamma was so vexed that she took him apart and gave him a scolding and to punish me she sent me straight to bed she has very oldfashioned ideashavent you mamma she added looking over my head at mrs pallant who had just come in behind me  i forget how her mother met lindas appeal louisa stood there with two letters sealed and addressed in her hand she greeted me gaily and then asked her daughter if she were possessed of postagestamps linda consulted a wellworn little pocketbook and confessed herself destitute whereupon her mother gave her the letters with the request that she would go into the hotel buy the proper stamps at the office carefully affix them and put the letters into the box she was to pay for the stamps not have them put on the billa preference for which mrs pallant gave reasons i had bought some at stresa that morning and was on the point of offering them when apparently having guessed my intention the elder lady silenced me with a look linda announced without reserve that she hadnt money and louisa then fumbled for a franc when she had found and bestowed it the girl kissed her before going off with the letters  darling mother you havent any too many of them have you she murmured and she gave me sidelong as she left us the prettiest halfcomical halfpitiful smile  shes amazingshes amazing said mrs pallant as we looked at each other  does she know what youve done  she knows ive done something and shes making up her mind what it is shell satisfy herself in the course of the next twentyfour hoursif your nephew doesnt come back i think i can promise you he wont  and wont she ask you  never  shant you tell her can you sit down together in this summerhouse this divine day with such a dreadful thing as that between you  my question found my friend quite ready dont you remember what i told you about our relationsthat everything was implied between us and nothing expressed the ideas we have had in commonour perpetual worldliness our always looking out for chancesare not the sort of thing that can be uttered conveniently between persons who like to keep up forms as we both do so that always if weve understood each other it has been enough we shall understand each other now as weve always done and nothing will be changed there has always been something between us that couldnt be talked about  certainly shes amazingshes amazing i repeated but so are you and then i asked her what she had said to my boy  she seemed surprised hasnt he told you  no and he never will  im glad of that she answered simply  but im not sure he wont come back he didnt this morning but he had already half a mind to  thats your imagination my companion said with her fine authority if you knew what i told him youd be sure  and you wont let me know  never dear friend  and did he believe you  time will showbut i think so  and how did you make it plausible to him that you should take so unnatural a course  for a moment she said nothing only looking at me then at last i told him the truth  the truth  take him awaytake him away she broke out thats why i got rid of linda to tell you you mustnt stayyou must leave stresa tomorrow this time its you who must do it i cant fly from you againit costs too much and she smiled strangely  dont be afraid dont be afraid well break camp again tomorrowah me but i want to go myself i added i took her hand in farewell but spoke again while i held it the way you put it about linda was very bad  it was horrible  i turned awayi felt indeed that i couldnt stay she kept me from going to the hotel as i might meet linda coming back which i was far from wishing to do and showed me another way into the road then she turned round to meet her daughter and spend the rest of the morning there with her spend it before the bright blue lake and the snowy crests of the alps when i reached stresa again i found my young man had gone off to milanto see the cathedral the servant saidleaving a message for me to the effect that as he shouldnt be back for a day or two though there were numerous trains he had taken a few clothes the next day i received telegramnotice that he had determined to go on to venice and begged i would forward the rest of his luggage please dont come after me this missive added i want to be alone i shall do no harm that sounded pathetic to me in the light of what i knew and i was glad to leave him to his own devices he proceeded to venice and i recrossed the alps for several weeks after this i expected to discover that he had rejoined mrs pallant but when we met that november in paris i saw he had nothing to hide from me save indeed the secret of what our extraordinary friend had said to him this he concealed from me then and has concealed ever since he returned to america before christmaswhen i felt the crisis over ive never again seen the wronger of my youth about a year after our more recent adventure her daughter linda married in london a young englishman the heir to a large fortune a fortune acquired by his father in some prosaic but flourishing industry mrs giminghams admired photographssuch is lindas present namemay be
