12210998	selections from the speeches and writings of edmund burke     introductory essay    id dico eum qui sit orator virum bonum esse oportere in omnibus quae dicit tanta auctoritas inest ut dissentire pudeat nec advocati studium sed testis aut judicis afferat fidemquintilianus  democracy is the most monstrous of all governments because it is impossible at once to act and control and consequently the sovereign power is then left without any restraint whatever that form of government is the best which places the efficient direction in the hands of the aristocracy subjecting them in its exercise to the control of the people at largesir james mackintosh    the intellectual homage of more than half a century has assigned to edmund burke a lofty preeminence in the aristocracy of mind and we may justly assume succeeding ages will confirm the judgment which the past has thus pronounced his biographical history is so popularly known that it is almost superfluous to record it in this brief introduction it may however be summed up in a few sentences he was born at dublin in 1730 his father was an attorney in extensive practice and his mothers maiden name was nogle whose family was respectable and resided near castletown roche where burke himself received five years of boyish education under the guidance of a rustic schoolmaster he was entered at trinity college dublin in 1746 but only remained there until 1749 in 1753 he became a member of the middle temple and maintained himself chiefly by literary toil bristol did itself the honour to elect him for her representative in 1774 and after years of splendid usefulness and mental triumph as an orator statesman and patriot he retired to his favourite retreat beaconsfield in buckinghamshire where he died on july 9th 1797 he was buried here and the pilgrim who visits the grave of this illustrious man when he gazes on the simple tomb which marks the earthly restingplace of himself brother son and widow may feelingly recall his own pathetic wish uttered some forty years before in londoni would rather sleep in the southern corner of a little country churchyard than in the tomb of the capulets i should like however that my dust should mingle with kindred dust the good old expression family buryingground has something pleasing in it at least to me alluding to his approaching dissolution he thus speaks in a letter addressed to a relative of his earliest schoolmasteri have been at bath these four months for no purpose and am therefore to be removed to my own house at beaconsfield tomorrow to be nearer a habitation more permanent humbly and fearfully hoping that my better part may find a better mansion it is a source of deep thankfulness for those who reverence the genius and eloquence of this great man to state that burkes religion was that of the cross and to find him speaking of the intercession of our redeeming lord as what he had long sought with unfeigned anxiety and to which he looked with trembling hope the commencing paragraph in his will also authenticates the genuine character of his personal christianity according to the ancient good and laudable custom of which my heart and understanding recognise the propriety i bequeath my soul to god hoping for his mercy only through the merits of our lord and saviour jesus christ my body i desire to be buried in the church of beaconsfield near to the bodies of my dearest brother and my dearest son in all humility praying that as we have lived in perfect unity together we may together have part in the resurrection of the just in the epistolary correspondence of the right hon edmund burke and dr french laurence rivingtons london 1827 are several touching allusions to that mastergrief which threw a mournful shadow over the closing period of burkes life in one letter the anxious father says the fever continues much as it was he sleeps in a very uneasy way from time to timebut his strength decays visibly and his voice is in a manner gone but god is allsufficientand surely his goodness and his mothers prayers may do much page 30 again in another communication addressed to his revered correspondent we find a beautiful allusion to his departed son which involves his belief in that most soothing doctrine of the churcha recognition of souls in the kingdom of the beatified here i am in the last retreat of hunted infirmity i am indeed aux abois but as through the whole of a various and long life i have been more indebted than thankful to providence so i am now singularly so in being dismissed as hitherto i appear to be so gently from life and sent to follow those who in course ought to have followed me whom i trust i shall yet in some inconceivable manner see and know and by whom i shall be seen and known pages 53 54  in reference to the intellectual grandeur the eloquent genius and prophetic wisdom of burke which have caused his writings to become oracles for future statesmen to consult it is quite unnecessary for contemporary criticism to speak by the concurring judgment both of political friends and foes as well as by the highest arbiters of taste throughout the civilized world burke has been pronounced not only primus inter pares but facile omnium princeps at the termination of these introductory remarks the reader will be presented with critical portraitures of burke from the writings and speeches of men who while opposed to him in their principles of legislative policy with all the chivalry and candour of genius paid a noble homage to the vastness and variety of his unrivalled powers meanwhile it may not be presumptuous for a writer on an occasion like the present to contemplate this great man under certain aspects which perhaps are not sufficiently regarded in their distinctive bearings on the worth and wisdom of his character and writings we say distinctive because the eloquence of burke beyond that of all other orators and statesmen which great britain has produced is featured with expressions and characterised by qualities as peculiar as they are immortal so far as invention imagination moral fervour and metaphorical richness of illustration combined with that intense pathos and ethos which the roman critic describes huc igitur incumbat orator hoc opus ejus hic labor est sine quo caetera nuda jejuna infirma ingrata sunt adeo velut spiritus operis hujus atque animus est in affectibus horum autem sicut antiquitus traditum accepimus duae sunt species alteram graeci pathos vocant quem nos vertentes recte ac proprie affectum dicimus alteram ethos cujus nomine ut ego quidem sentio caret sermo romanus mores appellanturquintilian instit orat lib vi cap 2 as essential to the true orator are concerned the author of reflections on the french revolution and letters on a regicide peace is justly admired and appreciated moreover if what we understand by the sublime in eloquence has ever been embodied the speeches and writings of burke appear to have been drawn from those five sources pegai to which longinus alludes in the 8th chapter of his fragment on the sublime he observes that if we assume an ability for speaking well as a common basis there are five copious fountains from whence sublimity in eloquence may be said to flow viz  1 boldness and grandeur of thought  2 the pathetic or the power of exciting the passions into an enthusiastic reach and noble degree  3 a skilful application of figures both from sentiment and language  4 a graceful finished and ornate style embellished by tropes and metaphors  5 lastly as that which completes all the restthe structure of periods in dignity and grandeur  these five sources of the sublime the same philosophical critic distinguishes into two classes the first two he asserts to be gifts of nature and the remaining three are considered to depend in a great measure upon literature and art again if we may linger for a moment in the attractive region of classical authorship how justly applicable are the words of cicero in his de oratore to the vastness and variety of burkes attainments ac mea quidem sententia nemo poterit esse omni laude cumulatus orator nisi erit omnium rerum magnarum atque artium scientiam consecutuscic de orat lib i cap 6 equally descriptive of burkes power in raising the dormant sensibilities of our moral nature by his intuitive perception of what that nature really and fundamentally is are the following expressions of the same great authorityquis enim nescit maximam vim existere oratoris in hominum mentibus vel ad iram aut ad odium aut dolorem incitandis vel ab hisce iisdem permonitionibus ad lenitatem misericordiamque revocandis quare nisi qui naturas hominum vimque omnem humanitatis causasque eas quibus mentes aut excitantur aut reflectuntur penitus perspexerit dicendo quod volet perficere non poteritcic de orat lib i cap 12  but to return if a critical analysis of burke as an exhibition of genius be attempted his characteristic endowments may probably be not incorrectly represented by the following succinct statement  1 endless variety in connection with exhaustless vigour of mind  2 a lofty power of generalisation both in speculative views and in his argumentative process  3 vivid intensity of conception which caused abstractions to stand out with almost living force and visible feature in his impassioned moments  4 an imagination of oriental luxuriance whose incessant play in tropes metaphors and analogies frequently causes his speeches to gleam on the intellectual eye as aeschylus says the ocean does when the sun irradiates its bosom with the anerithmon gelasma of countless beams 5 his positive acquirements in all the varied realms of art science and literature endowed him with such vast funds of knowledge in the wealth of his multitudinous acquirements burke seems to realise ciceros ideal of what a perfect orator should knowequidem omnia quae pertinent ad usum civium morem hominum quae versantur in consuetudine vitae in ratione reipublicae in hac societate civili in sensu hominum communi in natura in moribus co hendenda esse oratori putocicero de orat lib ii cap 16 that johnson declared of burkeenter upon what subject you will and burke is ready to meet you  6 in addition to these high gifts may be added an ability to wield the weapons of sarcasm and irony with a keenness of application and effect rarely equalled but in all candour it may be added that just as a profusion of figures and metaphors sometimes tempted this great orator into incongruous images and coarse analogies so his passion for irony was occasionally too intense hence there are occasions where his pungency is embittered into acrimony strength degenerates into vulgarism and the vehemence of satire is infuriated with the fierceness of invective  7 with regard to language and style it may be truly said they were the absolute vassals of his genius and did homage to its command in every possible mode by which it chose to employ them thus in his letters on a regicide peace and above all in french revolutions the reader will find almost every conceivable manner of style and mode of expression the english language can develop and what is moretogether with classical richness there are also the pointed seriousness and persuasive simplicity of our own vernacular saxon which increase the attractions of burkes style to a wonderful extent but beyond controversy among these great endowments the imaginative faculty is that which appears to be the most transcendent in the mental constitution of burke and so truly is this the case that both among his contemporaries as well as among his successors this predominance of imagination has caused his just claims as a philosophic thinker and statesman to be partially overlooked the union of ideal theory and practical realisation of imaginative creation with logical induction is indeed so rare we cannot be surprised at the injustice which the genius of burke has had to endure in this respect and yet in the nature of our faculties themselves there exists no necessity why a vivid power to conceive ideas should not be combined with a dialectic skill in expressing them degerando an admirable french writer in one of his treatises has some profound observations on this subject and does not hesitate to define poetry itself as a species of logique cachee  but when we assert that these excellencies which have thus been succinctly exhibited characterise the mental constitution of burke we do not mean that others have not in their degree possessed similar endowments such an inference would be an absurd extravagance but what we mean to affirm isthe qualifications enumerated have never been combined into cooperative harmony and developed in proportionable effect as they appear in the speeches and writings of this wonderful man but after all we have not reached what may be considered a peerless excellence the peculiar giftthe one great and glorious distinction which separates burkes oratory from that of all others and which has caused his speeches to be blended with political history and to incorporate themselves with the moral destiny of europenamely his intuitive perception of universal principles the truth of this statement may be verified by comparing the eloquence of burke with specimens of departed orators or by a reference to existing standards in the parliamentary debates compared then either with the speeches of chatham holland pitt fox etc etc we perceive at once the grand distinction to which we refer these illustrious men were effective debaters and in various senses orators of surpassing excellency but how is it that with all their allowed grandeur of intellect and political eminence they have ceased to operate upon the hearts and minds of the present age either as teachers of political truth or oracles of legislative wisdom simply because they were too popular in temporary effect ever to become influential by permanent inspiration in their highest moods and amid their noblest hours of triumph they were of the earth earthy party personality crushing rejoinders or satirical attacks a felicitous exposure of inconsistency or a triumphant selfvindication brilliant repartees and logical gladiatorshipsuch are among the prominent characteristics which caused parliamentary debates in burkes day to be so animating and interesting to those who heard or perused them amid the excitements of the hour it is not to be denied that commanding eloquence vast genius political ardour intellectual enthusiasm together with indignant denunciation and argumentative subtlety were thus summoned into exercise by the perils of the nation and the contentions of party nevertheless the local the temporal the conventional and the individual in all which relates to the science of politics or the tactics of partisanshipare sufficient to excite and employ the energies and qualities which made the general parliamentary debates of burkes period so captivating but when we revert to his own speeches and writings we at once perceive why as long as the mind can comprehend what is true the heart appreciate what is pure or the conscience authenticate the sanction of heaven and the distinctions between right and wrongedmund burke will continue to be admired revered and consulted not only as the greatest of english orators but as the profoundest teacher of political science it was not that he despised the arrangement of facts or overlooked the minutiae of detail on the contrary as may be proved by his speeches on economical reform and warren hastings in these respects his research was boundless and his industry inexhaustible moreover he was quite alive to the claims of a crisis and with the coolness and calm of a practical statesman knew how to confront a sudden emergency and to contend with a gigantic difficulty yet all these qualifications recede before burkes amazing power of expanding particulars into universals and of associating the accidents of a transient discussion with the essential properties of some permanent law in policy or abstract truth in morals his genius looked through the local to the universal in the temporal perceived the eternal and while facing the features of the individual was enabled to contemplate the attributes of a race cicero in many respects a counterpart of burke both in statesmanship and oratory appears to recognise what is here expressed when he saysplerique duo genera ad dicendum dederunt unum de certa definitaque causa quales sunt quae in litibus quae in deliberationibus versanturalterum quod appellant omnes fere scriptores explicat nemo infinitam generis sine tempore et sine persona quaestionemde orat lib ii cap 15 hence his speeches are virtual prophecies and his writings a storehouse of pregnant axioms and predictive enunciations as limitless in their range as they are undying in duration in one word no speeches delivered in the english parliament are so likely to be eternalized as burkes because he has combined with his treatment of some especial case or contingency before him the assertion of immutable principles which can be detached from what is local and national and thus made to stand forth alone in all the naked grandeur of their truth and their tendency let us be permitted to investigate this topic a little further if then what quintilian asserted of the roman orator may be applied to our own british ciceroille se profecisse sciat cui cicero valde placebit and if moreover this preeminence be chiefly discovered in burkes instinctive grasp of that moral essence which is incorporated with all questions of political science and social ethicsfrom whence came this diviner energy of his genius no believer in christian revelation will hesitate to appropriate even to this subject the apostolic axiom every good gift and every perfect gift is from above but while we subscribe with reverential sincerity to this announcement it is equally true that the infinite inspirer of all good adjusts his secret energies by certain laws and condescends to work by analogous means bearing this in mind we venture to think burkes gift of almost prescient insight into the recesses of our common nature and his consummate faculty of instructing the future through the medium of the presentwere partly derived from the elevation of his sentiments and the purity of his private life the action and reaction maintained between our moral and intellectual elements is but remotely discussed by quintilian in his institutes but still in more than one passage he most impressively declares that mental proficiency is greatly retarded by perversity of heart and will for instance on one occasion we find him speaking thusnihil enim est tam occupatum tam multiforme tot ac tam variis affectibus concisum atque laceratum quam mala ac improba mens quis inter haec literis aut ulli bonae arti locus non hercle magis quam frugibus in terra sentibus ac rubis occupatanothing is so flurried and agitated so selfcontradictory or so violently rent and shattered by conflicting passions as a bad heart in the distractions which it produces what room is there for the cultivation of letters or the pursuits of any honourable art assuredly no more than there is for the growth of corn in a field overrun with thorns and brambles it would be unwise to draw invidious comparisons but no student of the period in which burke was in parliament can deny that compared with some of his illustrious contemporaries he was indeed a model of what reason and conscience alike approve in all the relative duties and personal conduct of a man when beheld in his domestic career it is indeed a source of deep thankfulness the admirer of burkes genius in public has no reason to blush for his character in private and that when we have listened to his matchless oratory upon the arena of the house of commons we have not to mourn over dissipation impurity and depravity amid the circles of private history our theory then is that beyond what his distinctive genius inspired burkes wondrous power of enunciating everlasting principles and of associating the loftiest abstractions of wisdom with the commonest themes of the hourwas sustained and strengthened by the purity of his heart and the subjection of passion to the law of conscience and if the worshippers of mere intellect apart from or as opposed to moral elevation are inclined to ridicule this view of burkes genius we beg to remind them that one greater than the temple of mortal wisdom and all the idols enshrined therein has asserted a positive connection to exist between mental insight and moral purity we allude to the redeemers words when he declaresif any man wills to do his will he shall know of the doctrine how the passions act upon our perceptions and by what process the motions of the will elevate or depress the forces of the intellect is beyond our metaphysics to analyse but that there exists a real active and influential connection between our moral and mental life is undeniable and since burkes power of seizing the essential idea or fundamental principle of every complex detail which came before him was preeminently his giftthe intellectual insight such gift developed was not only an expression of senatorial wisdom but also a witness for the elevation of his moral character we must now allude to the public conduct of burke as a statesman and politician and only regret the limited range of a popular essay confines us to one view namely his alleged inconsistency there was a period when charges of apostasy were brought against him with reckless audacity but time the instructor of ignorance and the subduer of prejudice is now beginning to place the conduct of burke in its true light the facts of the case are briefly these up to the period of 1791 fox and burke fought in the same rank of opposition and stood together upon a basis of complete identity in principle and sentiment but even before the celebrated disruption of 1791 the progress of republicanism in america and the approaching separation of the colonies from their parent state burkes views of political liberty had received extensive modifications and the ardour of his confidence in the socalled friends of freedom had been greatly cooled but in 1791 the disruption between burke and fox became open absolute and final when the latter statesman uttered in the hearing of his friend this fearful eulogium on the french revolutionthe new constitution of france is the most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty which had been erected on the foundation of human integrity in any age or country that ancient sage unto whose political wisdom frequent reference has been made in this essay thus speaks on the reverence due unto an existing government even when contemplated from its weakest sideformidable as these arguments seem they may be opposed by others of not less weight arguments which prove that even the rust of government is to be respected and that its fabric is never to be touched but with a fearful and trembling hand when the evil of persevering in hereditary institutions is small it ought always to be endured because the evil of departing from them is certainly very great slight imperfections therefore whether in the laws themselves or in those who administer and execute the laws ought always to be overlooked because they cannot be corrected without occasioning a much greater mischief and tending to weaken that reverence which the safety of all governments requires that the citizens at large should entertain cultivate and cherish for the hereditary institutions of their country the comparison drawn from the improvement of arts does not apply to the amendment of laws to change or improve an art and to alter or amend a law are things as dissimilar in their operation as different in their tendency for laws operate as practical principles of moral action and like all the rules of morality derive their force and efficacy as even the name imports from the customary repetition of habitual acts and the slow operation of time every alteration of the laws therefore tends to subvert that authority on which the persuasive agency of all laws is founded and to abridge weaken and destroy the power of the law itselfaristotles politics the reply of burke to this burst of jacobinism with all its consequences in the political history of europe is far too well known to be quoted here but since it was at this point in the career of burke the charge of apostasy was commenced and which has never quite died away even in existing times we may be permitted first to cite a noble passage from burkes selfvindication and secondly to adduce a still more impressive evidence of his political rectitude and wisdom derived from the admission of those who were once his uncompromising opponents in relation to the attacks of fox upon his supposed inconsistency mr burke thus replies  i pass to the next head of chargemr burkes inconsistency it is certainly a great aggravation of his fault in embracing false opinions that in doing so he is not supposed to fill up a void but that he is guilty of a dereliction of opinions that are true and laudable this is the great gist of the charge against him it is not so much that he is wrong in his book that however is alleged also as that he has therein belied his whole life i believe if he could venture to value himself upon anything it is on the virtue of consistency that he would value himself the most strip him of this and you leave him naked indeed  in the case of any man who had written something and spoken a great deal upon very multifarious matter during upwards of twentyfive years public service and in as great a variety of important events as perhaps have ever happened in the same number of years it would appear a little hard in order to charge such a man with inconsistency to see collected by his friend a sort of digest of his sayings even to such as were merely sportive and jocular this digest however has been made with equal pains and partiality and without bringing out those passages of his writings which might tend to show with what restrictions any expressions quoted from him ought to have been understood from a great statesman he did not quite expect this mode of inquisition if it only appeared in the works of common pamphleteers mr burke might safely trust to his reputation when thus urged he ought perhaps to do a little more it shall be as little as possible for i hope not much is wanting to be totally silent on his charges would not be respectful to mr fox accusations sometimes derive a weight from the persons who make them to which they are not entitled for their matter a man who among various objects of his equal regard is secure of some and full of anxiety for the fate of others is apt to go to much greater lengths in his preference of the objects of his immediate solicitude than mr burke has ever done a man so circumstanced often seems to undervalue to vilify almost to reprobate and disown those that are out of danger this is the voice of nature and truth and not of inconsistency and false pretence the danger of anything very dear to us removes for the moment every other affection from the mind when priam had his whole thoughts employed on the body of his hector he repels with indignation and drives from him with a thousand reproaches his surviving sons who with an officious piety crowded about him to offer their assistance a good critic there is no better than mr fox would say that this is a masterstroke and marks a deep understanding of nature in the father of poetry he would despise a zoilus who would conclude from this passage that homer meant to represent this man of affliction as hating or being indifferent and cold in his affections to the poor relics of his house or that he preferred a dead carcass to his living children  mr burke does not stand in need of an allowance of this kind which if he did by candid critics ought to be granted to him if the principles of a mixed constitution be admitted he wants no more to justify to consistency everything he has said and done during the course of a political life just touching to its close i believe that gentleman has kept himself more clear of running into the fashion of wild visionary theories or of seeking popularity through every means than any man perhaps ever did in the same situation  he was the first man who on the hustings at a popular election rejected the authority of instructions from constituents or who in any place has argued so fully against it perhaps the discredit into which that doctrine of compulsive instructions under our constitution is since fallen may be due in a great degree to his opposing himself to it in that manner and on that occasion  the reformers in representation and the bills for shortening the duration of parliaments he uniformly and steadily opposed for many years together in contradiction to many of his best friends these friends however in his better days when they had more to hope from his service and more to fear from his loss than now they have never chose to find any inconsistency between his acts and expressions in favour of liberty and his votes on those questions but there is a time for all things we need not however confine our vindication of burke to his own eloquence but invite the especial attention of his accusers and defamers unto two forgotten facts 1st a few weeks before fox died he dictated a despatch to lord yarmouth which confirmed all the policy for which pitt for fifteen years had contended moreover in a debate on wyndhams military system 1806 fox thus delivered his own recantationindeed by the circumstances of europe i am ready to confess i have been weaned from the opinions i formerly held with respect to the force which might suffice in time of peace nor do i consider this any inconsistency because i see no rational prospect of any peace which would exempt us from the necessity of watchful preparation and powerful establishment but the change of foxs opinions and their similarity to those maintained by pitt with reference to our war with france are by no means all which history can produce in justification of burkes political wisdom and consistency the whole civilized world has read the reflections on the french revolution whose sale in one year achieved the enormous number of 30000 copies in connection with medals or marks of honour from almost every court in europe now of all the replies made to this masterpiece of reasoning and reflection mackintoshs vindiciae gallicae was incontestably the ablest and profoundest and yet the greatest of all his intellectual opponents thus addresses burke as appears from memoirs of mackintosh volume i page 87the enthusiasm with which i once embraced the instruction conveyed in your writings is now ripened into solid conviction by the experience and conviction of more mature age for a time seduced by the love of what i thought liberty i ventured to oppose without ceasing to venerate that writer who had nourished my understanding with the most wholesome principles of political wisdomsince that time a melancholy experience has undeceived me on many subjects in which i was the dupe of my own enthusiasm let us part from this branch of our subject by quoting burkes own words uttered as it were on the very brink of eternity they attest to the latest moment of his life with what a sacred intensity and unflinching sincerity he clung to his original sentiments touching the french revolution nor let the present writer shrink from adding they constitute but one of the many specimens of that instinctive prescience whereby this profoundest of philosophical statesmen was enabled to herald from afar the final triumphs of courage patriotism and truth the passage occurs towards the conclusion of his letters on a regicide peace and is as followsnever succumb it is a struggle for your existence as a nation if you must die die with the sword in your hand but i have no fear whatever for the result there is a salient living principle of energy in the public mind of england which only requires proper direction to enable her to withstand this or any other ferocious foe persevere therefore till this tyranny be overpast  if from the glare of public history we follow this great man into the shades of domestic seclusion or watch the features of his social character unfolding themselves in the varied circle which he graced by his presence or dignified by his worthhe is alike the object of respectful esteem and love warmth of heart chivalry of sentiment and that true highbreeding which springs from the soul rather than a pedigree eminently characterise the history of burke in private life above all a sympathising tendency for the children of genius and a catholic largeness of view in all which relates unto mental effort combined with the utmost charity for human failings and infirmitiescannot but endear him to our deepest affections while his unrivalled endowments command our highest admiration to illustrate what is here alluded to let the reader recall burkes noble generosity towards that erratic victim of genius and griefthe painter barry or his instantaneous sympathy in behalf of crabbe the poet when almost a foodless wanderer in our vast metropolis and our estimate of burkes excellencies as a man will not be deemed overdrawn  it now remains for the selector of the following pages to offer a few remarks on their nature and design accustomed from the earliest period of his mental life to read and study the writings of edmund burke he has long wished that such a selection as now appears should be published the works of burke extend through a vast range of large volumes and it is feared thousands have been deterred from holding communion with a masterspirit of british literature by the magnitude of his labours hence a concentrated specimen of his intellect may not only tempt the reading public coleridges horror yet an authors friend to study some of burkes noblest passages but even ultimately to introduce them into a full acquaintance with his entire products let it be distinctly understood the selection now published is not a secondhand one grafted on some preexisting volume but the result of a diligent careful and analytical perusal of burkes writings in attempting such a work there was one difficulty which none but those who have intimately studied this great orator can appreciatewe allude to the giving general titles or descriptive headings to passages selected for quotation there is a mental fulness a moral variety and such a rapid transition of idea in most of burkes speeches that it almost baffles ability to abbreviate the spirit of his paragraphs so as to exhibit under some general head the bearing of the whole the selector in this respect can only say he has done his best and those who are most competent to appreciate difficulty will be least inclined to criticise failure  finally as to the leading design of this volume its title first principles is sufficiently descriptive to save much explanation burke represents an unrivalled combination of patriot senator and orator and as such the moral and intellectual nature of the age will be purified and expanded when brought into contact with the attributes of his character and the productions of his mind nor can the meditative statesman whose party is his country and whose political creed is based upon a true philosophy of human nature forgetthat while the french revolution as involving facts belongs to history as enclosing principles it appertains to humanity and hence the abiding application of burkes profound views not only to france and england but to the world of course those who reverence the majesty of eloquence and are fascinated by a florid richness of style boundless imagination inexhaustible metaphor and all the attending graces of consummate rhetoric will also be charmed by the appropriate supply these pages afford but without seeking to be homiletical let the writer be permitted to add a far higher purpose than mere literary amusement or the gratification of taste is designed by the present volume it is the selectors most earnest hope that the first principles these pages so eloquently inculcate may be transcribed in all their purity loftiness and truth into the reason and conscience of his countrymen and among these for whose especial guidance he ventures to think the profound wisdom of these pages to be invaluable are the rising statesmen and senators of the day who are either being trained in our public schools at the universities or about to enter upon the difficult but inspiring arena of the house of commons in reference to this sphere of legislative action with all reverence to its claims and character let it be saidmaterial ends a boundless passion for physical good whether indulged in by a nation or professed by an individual is rebuked with solemn wisdom in the following passage from aristotlethe external advantages of power and fortune are acquired and maintained by virtue but virtue is not acquired and maintained by them and whether we consider the virtuous energies themselves or the fruits which they unceasingly produce the sovereign good of life must evidently be found in moral and intellectual excellence moderately supplied with external accommodations rather than in the greatest accumulation of external advantages unimproved and unadorned by virtue external prosperity is indeed instrumental in producing happiness and therefore like every other instrument must have its assigned limits beyond which it is inconvenient or hurtful but to mental excellence no limit can be assigned the further it extends the more useful it becomes if the epithet of useful need ever be added to that of honourable besides this the relative importance of qualities is best estimated by that of their respective subjects but the mind both in itself and in reference to man is far better than the body or than property the excellencies of the mind therefore are in the same proportion to be preferred to the highest perfection of the body and the best disposition of external circumstances the two last are of a far inferior and merely subservient nature since no man of sense covets or pursues them but for the sake of the mind with a view to promote its genuine improvement and augment its native joys let this great truth then be acknowledgeda truth evinced by the deity himself who is happy not from any external cause but through the inherent attributes of his divine naturepolitics lib iv commercial objects and secular aggrandizement are now receiving an idolatrous homage and passionate regard which no christian patriot can contemplate without anxiety the ideal the imaginative and the religious element is almost sneered out of the house of commons at the existing moment and any glowing exhibition of oratory or splendid manifestation of intellect is derided as being unpractical and illadapted to the sobriety of the english senate against this heartless materialism and unholy mammonworship burkes pages are a magnificent protest and are admirably suited to protect the political youth and dawning statesmen of our country from the blight and the blast of doctrines which decry enthusiasm as folly and condemn the beautiful as worthless and untrue ships colonies and commerce exports and imports taxes and imposts charters and civic arrangementsnone but a madman will depreciate what such themes involve of duty energy and zeal in political life still let it be fearlessly maintained neither wealth nor commerce in themselves can constitute the real greatness of an empire it is only because they stand in relation to the higher destinies and holier responsibilities of an empire that a true statesman will regard them as vitally wound up with the vigour and prosperity of national development such at least is the philosophy of politics breathed from the undying pages of edmund burke he who studies this great writer will more and more sympathise with what hooker taught and bishop sanderson inculcates in one word he will learn to venerate with increasing reverence the british constitution as      that peerless growth of patriotic mind      the great eternal wonder of mankind   burke traced the ultimate origin of civil government to the divine will both as declared in revelation and imaged forth by the moral constitution of man in this respect it is wellknown how fundamentally he differs from the theories of hobbes mandeville shaftesbury and hutcheson not less also is he opposed to locke who tells usthe original compact which begins and actually constitutes any political society is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society and this is that and that only which could give beginning to any lawful government in the world in one word locke declares that civil government is not from god in the way of principle but from man in the way of fact and thus being a mere contingency or moral accident in the history of human development selfgovernment is the essential prerogative of our nature in accordance with this irrational and unscriptural hypothesis we find price and priestly expanding lockes views at the period of burke while in the writings of that apostle of political antinomianism rousseau and his english counterpart tom painethe principles of the assumed contrat social display their utmost virulence this is not the place to discuss the origin of civil government but the classical reader who has been taught to revere the political wisdom of those ancient teachers whose insight was almost prophetical in abstract science will thank us for an extract from aristotles politics which bears upon this subject it presents a most striking coincidence of sentiment between two masterspirits on the philosophy of government and will at once remind the reader of burkes memorable passage beginning with society is a partnership etc etc the passage to which we allude in aristotles politics begins thus ote men oun e polis phusei proteron e ekastos ktl the whole passage may be thus freely translated a participation in rights and advantages forms the bond of political society an institution prior in the intention of nature to the families and individuals from whom it is constituted what members are to the body that citizens are to a commonwealth the hands or foot when separated from the body retains its name but totally changes its nature because it is completely divested of its uses and powers in the same manner a citizen is a constituent part of a whole system which invests him with powers and qualifies him for functions for which in his individual capacity he is totally unfit and independently of such system he might subsist indeed as a lonely savage but could never attain that improved and happy state to which his progressive nature invariably tends perfected by the offices and duties of social life man is the best but rude and undisciplined he is the very worst of animals for nothing is more detestable than armed improbity and man is armed with craft and courage which uncontrolled by justice he will most wickedly pervert and become at once the most impious and fiercest of monsters the most abominable in gluttony and shameless in personality but justice is the fundamental virtue of political society since the order of society cannot be maintained without law and laws are constituted to proclaim what is just let us add to this noble passage aristotle remarks in his ethics lib x c 8 that a higher destination than political virtue is the true end of man in this respect he concurs with plato who teaches us in his theaetetus the main object of human pursuit ought to be omoiosis to theo kata to dunaton etc etc ie a similitude unto god as far as possible which similitude consists in an imitation of his justice holiness and wisdom to conclude the noblest end of all policy on earth is to educate human nature for that august politeuma phil iii v 20 that eternal commonwealth which awaits perfected spirits above when through infinite grace they are finally admitted into a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god heb xi 10 the dim approximations of platonic philosophy to certain discoveries in divine revelation have rightly challenged the attention of theological enquirers the above quotation from st paul suggests a reference to one of these which occurs towards the termination of platos ninth book of the republic he is uttering a protest against our concluding that because degeneracy appears to be the invariable law or destiny of all human commonwealths therefore no archetypal model exists of any perfect state or polity and then in opposition to this political scepticism plato adds these remarkable wordsen ourano isos paradeigma anakeitai to boulomeno oran kai oronti eauton katoikizein etc etcthe state we have here established which exists only in our reasoning but it seems to me has no existence on earth but in heaven probably i replied there is a model of it for any one inclined to contemplate the same and by so contemplating it to regulate himself accordingly    appendix  the following are the critical sketches of burkes character alluded to in the commencement of this essay they are from the pens of his most distinguished contemporaries who were opposed to him in their political views and public career  from sir james mackintosh  there can be no hesitation in according to him a station among the most extraordinary men that ever appeared and we think there is now but little diversity of opinion as to the kind of place which it is fit to assign him he was a writer of the first class and excelled in almost every kind of composition possessed of most extensive knowledge and of the most various description acquainted alike with what different classes of men knew each in his own province and with much that hardly any one ever thought of learning he could either bring his masses of information to bear directly upon the subjects to which they severally belongedor he could avail himself of them generally to strengthen his faculties and enlarge his viewsor he could turn any of them to account for the purpose of illustrating his theme or enriching his diction hence when he is handling any one matter we perceive that we are conversing with a reasoner or a teacher to whom almost every other branch of knowledge is familiar his views range over all the cognate objects his reasonings are derived from principles applicable to other themes as well as the one in hand arguments pour in from all sides as well as those which start up under our feetthe natural growth of the path he is leading us over while to throw light round our steps and either explore its darkest places or serve for our recreation illustrations are fetched from a thousand quarters and an imagination marvellously quick to descry unthought of resemblances points to our use the stores which a love yet more marvellously has gathered from all ages and nations and arts and tongues we are in respect of the argument reminded of bacons multifarious knowledge and the exuberance of his learned fancy whilst the manylettered diction recalls to mind the first of english poets and his immortal verse rich with the spoils of all sciences and all times    he produced but one philosophical treatise but no man lays down abstract principles more soundly or better traces their application all his works indeed even his controversial are so infused with general reflection so variegated with speculative discussion that they wear the air of the lyceum as well as the academy  from lord erskine  i shall take care to put burkes work on the french revolution into the hands of those whose principles are left to my protection i shall take care that they have the advantage of doing in the regular progression of youthful studies what i have done even in the short intervals of laborious life that they shall transcribe with their own hands from all the works of this most extraordinary person and from this last among the rest the soundest truths of religion the justest principles of morals inculcated and rendered delightful by the most sublime eloquence the highest reach of philosophy brought down to the level of common minds by the most captivating taste the most enlightened observations on history and the most copious collection of useful maxims for the experience of common life  from king bishop of rochester  in the mind of mr burke political principles were not objects of barren speculation wisdom in him was always practical whatever his understanding adopted as truth made its way to his heart and sank deep into it and his ardent and generous feelings seized with promptitude every occasion of applying it to mankind where shall we find recorded exertions of active benevolence at once so numerous so varied and so important made by one man among those the redress of wrongs and the protection of weakness from the oppression of power were most conspicuous    the assumption of arbitrary power in whatever shape it appeared whether under the veil of legitimacy or skulking in the disguise of state necessity or presenting the shameless front of usurpationwhether the prescriptive claim of ascendancy or the career of official authority or the newlyacquired dominion of a mobwas the pure object of his detestation and hostility and this is not a fanciful enumeration of possible cases etc     selections from the speeches and writings of edmund burke   nature and functions of the house of commons  whatever alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business may have introduced this character can never be sustained unless the house of commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of the people at large it would among public misfortunes be an evil more natural and tolerable that the house of commons should be infected with every epidemical frenzy of the people as this would indicate some consanguinity some sympathy of nature with their constituents than that they should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors by this want of sympathy they would cease to be a house of commons for it is not the derivation of the power of that house from the people which makes it in a distinct sense their representative the king is the representative of the people so are the lords so are the judges they all are trustees for the people as well as the commons because no power is given for the sole sake of the holder and although government certainly is an institution of divine authority yet its forms and the persons who administer it all originate from the people  a popular origin cannot therefore be the characteristical distinction of a popular representative this belongs equally to all parts of government and in all forms the virtue spirit and essence of a house of commons consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation it was not instituted to be a control upon the people as of late it has been taught by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency it was designed as a control for the people other institutions have been formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses and they are i apprehend fully adequate to their object if not they ought to be made so the house of commons as it was never intended for the support of peace and subordination is miserably appointed for that service having no stronger weapon than its mace and no better officer than its serjeantatarms which it can command of its own proper authority a vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy an anxious care of public money an openness approaching towards facility to public complaint these seem to be the true characteristics of a house of commons but an addressing house of commons and a petitioning nation a house of commons full of confidence when the nation is plunged in despair in the utmost harmony with ministers whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence who vote thanks when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments who are eager to grant when the general voice demands account who in all disputes between the people and administration presume against the people who punish their disorders but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them this is an unnatural a monstrous state of things in this constitution such an assembly may be a great wise awful senate but it is not to any popular purpose a house of commons this change from an immediate state of procuration and delegation to a course of acting as from original power is the way in which all the popular magistracies in the world have been perverted from their purposes it is indeed their greatest and sometimes their incurable corruption for there is a material distinction between that corruption by which particular points are carried against reason this is a thing which cannot be prevented by human wisdom and is of less consequence and the corruption of the principle itself for then the evil is not accidental but settled the distemper becomes the natural habit   retrospect and resignation  you are but just entering into the world i am going out of it i have played long enough to be heartily tired of the drama whether i have acted my part in it well or ill posterity will judge with more candour than i or than the present age with our present passions can possibly pretend to for my part i quit it without a sigh and submit to the sovereign order without murmuring the nearer we approach to the goal of life the better we begin to understand the true value of our existence and the real weight of our opinions we set out much in love with both but we leave much behind us as we advance we first throw away the tales along with the rattles of our nurses those of the priest keep their hold a little longer those of our governors the longest of all but the passions which prop these opinions are withdrawn one after another and the cool light of reason at the setting of our life shows us what a false splendour played upon these objects during our more sanguine seasons   modesty of mind  if any inquiry thus carefully conducted should fail at last of discovering the truth it may answer an end perhaps as useful in discovering to us the weakness of our own understanding if it does not make us knowing it may make us modest if it does not preserve us from error it may at least from the spirit of error and may make us cautious of pronouncing with positiveness or with haste when so much labour may end in so much uncertainty   newton and nature  when newton first discovered the property of attraction and settled its laws he found it served very well to explain several of the most remarkable phenomena in nature but yet with reference to the general system of things he could consider attraction but as an effect whose cause at that time he did not attempt to trace but when he afterwards began to account for it by a subtle elastic aether this great man if in so great a man it be not impious to discover anything like a blemish seemed to have quitted his usual cautious manner of philosophising since perhaps allowing all that has been advanced on this subject to be sufficiently proved i think it leaves us with as many difficulties as it found us that great chain of causes which linking one to another even to the throne of god himself can never be unravelled by any industry of ours when we go but one step beyond the immediate sensible qualities of things we go out of our depth all we do after is but a faint struggle that shows we are in an element which does not belong to us   theory and practice    it is i own not uncommon to be wrong in theory and right in practice and we are happy that it is so men often act right from their feelings who afterwards reason but ill on them from principle but as it is impossible to avoid an attempt at such reasoning and equally impossible to prevent its having some influence on our practice surely it is worth taking some pains to have it just and founded on the basis of sure experience   induction and comparison  we must not attempt to fly when we can scarcely pretend to creep in considering any complex matter we ought to examine every distinct ingredient in the composition one by one and reduce everything to the utmost simplicity since the condition of our nature binds us to a strict law and vary narrow limits we ought afterwards to reexamine the principles by the effect of the composition as well as the composition by that of the principles we ought to compare our subject with things of a similar nature and even with things of a contrary nature for discoveries may be and often are made by the contrast which would escape us on the single view the greater number of the comparisons we make the more general and the more certain our knowledge is likely to prove as built upon a more extensive and perfect induction   divine power on the human idea  whilst we consider the godhead merely as he is an object of the understanding which forms a complex idea of power wisdom justice goodness all stretched to a degree far exceeding the bounds of our comprehension whilst we consider the divinity in this refined and abstracted light the imagination and passions are little or nothing affected but because we are bound by the condition of our nature to ascend to these pure and intellectual ideas through the medium of sensible images to judge of these divine qualities by their evident acts and exertions it becomes extremely hard to disentangle our idea of the cause from the effect by which we are led to know it thus when we contemplate the deity his attributes and their operation coming united on the mind form a sort of sensible image and as such are capable of affecting the imagination now though in a just idea of the deity perhaps none of his attributes are predominant yet to our imagination his power is by far the most striking some reflection some comparing is necessary to satisfy us of his wisdom his justice and his goodness to be struck with his power it is only necessary that we should open our eyes but whilst we contemplate so vast an object under the arm as it were of almighty power and invested upon every side with omnipresence we shrink into the minuteness of our own nature and are in a manner annihilated before him   union of love and dread in religion  true religion has and must have a large mixture of salutary fear and false religions have generally nothing else but fear to support them before the christian religion had as it were humanized the idea of the divinity and brought it somewhat nearer to us there was very little said of the love of god the followers of plato have something of it and only something the other writers of pagan antiquity whether poets or philosophers nothing at all and they who consider with what infinite attention by what a disregard of every perishable object through what long habits of piety and contemplation it is that any man is able to attain an entire love and devotion to the deity will easily perceive that it is not the first the most natural and the most striking effect which proceeds from that idea   office of sympathy    whenever we are formed by nature to any active purpose the passion which animates us to it is attended with delight or a pleasure of some kind let the subjectmatter be what it will and as our creator had designed that we should be united by the bond of sympathy he has strengthened that bond by a proportionable delight and there most where our sympathy is most wantedin the distresses of others   words  natural objects affect us by the laws of that connexion which providence has established between certain motions and configurations of bodies and certain consequent feelings in our mind painting affects in the same manner but with the superadded pleasure of imitation architecture affects by the laws of nature and the law of reason from which latter result the rules of proportion which make a work to be praised or censured in the whole or in some part when the end for which it was designed is or is not properly answered but as to words they seem to me to affect us in a manner very different from that in which we are affected by natural objects or by painting or architecture yet words have as considerable a share in exciting ideas of beauty and of the sublime as many of those and sometimes a much greater than any of them   nature anticipates man  whenever the wisdom of our creator intended that we should be affected with anything he did not confide the execution of his design to the languid and precarious operation of our reason but he endued it with powers and properties that prevent the understanding and even the will which seizing upon the senses and imagination captivate the soul before the understanding is ready either to join with them or to oppose them it is by a long deduction and much study that we discover the adorable wisdom of god in his works when we discover it the effect is very different not only in the manner of acquiring it but in its own nature from that which strikes us without any preparation from the sublime or the beautiful   selfinspection  whatever turns the soul inward on itself tends to concentre its forces and to fit it for greater and stronger flights of science by looking into physical causes our minds are opened and enlarged and in this pursuit whether we take or whether we lose our game the chase is certainly of service   power of the obscure  poetry with all its obscurity has a more general as well as a more powerful dominion over the passions than the other art and i think there are reasons in nature why the obscure idea when properly conveyed should be more affecting than the clear it is our ignorance of things that causes all our admiration and chiefly excites our passions knowledge and acquaintance make the most striking causes affect but little it is thus with the vulgar and all men are as the vulgar in what they do not understand the ideas of eternity and infinity are among the most affecting we have and yet perhaps there is nothing of which we really understand so little as of infinity and eternity   female beauty  the object therefore of this mixed passion which we call love is the beauty of the sex men are carried to the sex in general as it is the sex and by the common law of nature but they are attached to particulars by personal beauty i call beauty a social quality for where women and men and not only they but when other animals give us a sense of joy and pleasure in beholding them and there are many that do so they inspire us with sentiments of tenderness and affection towards their persons we like to have them near us and we enter willingly into a kind of relation with them unless we should have strong reasons to the contrary   novelty and curiosity  curiosity is the most superficial of all the affections it changes its object perpetually it has an appetite which is very sharp but very easily satisfied and it has always an appearance of giddiness restlessness and anxiety curiosity from its nature is a very active principle it quickly runs over the greatest part of its objects and soon exhausts the variety which is commonly to be met with in nature the same things make frequent returns and they return with less and less of any agreeable effect in short the occurrences of life by the time we come to know it a little would be incapable of affecting the mind with any other sensations than those of loathing and weariness if many things were not adapted to affect the mind by means of other powers besides novelty in them and of other passions besides curiosity in ourselves   pleasures of analogy  the mind of man has naturally a far greater alacrity and satisfaction in tracing resemblances than in searching for differences because by making resemblances we produce new images we unite we create we enlarge our stock but in making distinctions we offer no food at all to the imagination the task itself is more severe and irksome and what pleasure we derive from it is something of a negative and indirect nature   ambition  god has planted in man a sense of ambition and a satisfaction arising from the contemplation of his excelling his fellows in something deemed valuable amongst them it is this passion that drives men to all the ways we see in use of signalizing themselves and that tends to make whatever excites in a man the idea of this distinction so very pleasant it has been so strong as to make very miserable men take comfort that they were supreme in misery and certain it is that where we cannot distinguish ourselves by something excellent we begin to take a complacency in some singular infirmities follies or defects of one kind or other it is on this principle that flattery is so prevalent for flattery is no more than what raises in a mans mind an idea of a preference which he has not   extensions of sympathy  for sympathy must be considered as a sort of substitution by which we are put into the place of another man and affected in many respects as he is affected so that this passion may either partake of the nature of those which regard selfpreservation and turning upon pain may be a source of the sublime or it may turn upon ideas of pleasure and then whatever has been said of the social affections whether they regard society in general or only some particular modes of it may be applicable here it is by this principle chiefly that poetry painting and other affecting arts transfuse their passions from one breast to another and are often capable of grafting a delight on wretchedness misery and death itself   philosophy of taste  so far then as taste belongs to the imagination its principle is the same in all men there is no different in the manner of their being affected nor in the causes of the affection but in the degree there is a difference which arises from two causes principally either from a greater degree of natural sensibility or from a closer and longer attention to the object   clearness and strength in style    we do not sufficiently distinguish in our observations upon language between a clear expression and a strong expression these are frequently confounded with each other though they are in reality extremely different the former regards the understanding the latter belongs to the passions the one describes a thing as it is the latter describes it as it is felt now as there is a moving tone of voice an impassioned countenance an agitated gesture which affect independently of the things about which they are exerted so there are words and certain dispositions of words which being peculiarly devoted to passionate subjects and always used by those who are under the influence of any passion touch and move us more than those which far more clearly and distinctly express the subjectmatter we yield to sympathy what we refuse to description the truth is all verbal description merely as naked description though never so exact conveys so poor and insufficient an idea of the thing described that it could scarcely have the smallest effect if the speaker did not call in to his aid those modes of speech that mark a strong and lively feeling in himself then by the contagion of our passions we catch a fire already kindled in another which probably might never have been struck out by the object described words by strongly conveying the passions by those means which we have already mentioned fully compensate for their weakness in other respects   unity of imagination  since the imagination is only the representation of the senses it can only be pleased or displeased with the images from the same principle on which the sense is pleased or displeased with the realities and consequently there must be just as close an agreement in the imaginations as in the senses of men a little attention will convince us that this must of necessity be the case   effect of words  if words have all their possible extent of power three effects arise in the mind of the hearer the first is the sound the second the picture or representation of the thing signified by the sound the third is the affection of the soul produced by one or by both of the foregoing compounded abstract words of which we have been speaking honour justice liberty and the like produce the first and the last of these effects but not the second simple abstracts are used to signify some one simple idea without much adverting to others which may chance to attend it as blue green hot cold and the like these are capable of effecting all three of the purposes of words as the aggregate words man castle horse etc are in a yet higher degree but i am of opinion that the most general effect even of these words does not arise from their forming pictures of the several things they would represent in the imagination because on a very diligent examination of my own mind and getting others to consider theirs i do not find that once in twenty times any such picture is formed and when it is there is most commonly a particular effort of the imagination for that purpose but the aggregate words operate as i said of the compoundabstracts not by presenting any image to the mind but by having from use the same effect on being mentioned that their original has when it is seen   investigation  i am convinced that the method of teaching which approaches most nearly to the method of investigation is incomparably the best since not content with serving up a few barren and lifeless truths it leads to the stock on which they grew it tends to set the reader himself in the track of invention and to direct him into those paths in which the author has made his own discoveries if he should be so happy as to have made any that are valuable  the sublime  whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain and danger that is to say whatever is in any sort terrible or is conversant about terrible objects or operates in a manner analogous to terror is a source of the sublime that is it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling   obscurity  those despotic governments which are founded on the passions of men and principally upon the passion of fear keep their chief as much as may be from the public eye the policy has been the same in many cases of religion almost all the heathen temples were dark even in the barbarous temples of the americans at this day they keep their idol in a dark part of the hut which is consecrated to his worship for this purpose too the druids performed all their ceremonies in the bosom of the darkest woods and in the shade of the oldest and most spreading oaks no person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening or of setting terrible things if i may use the expression in their strongest light by the force of a judicious obscurity than milton   principles of taste  whatever certainty is to be acquired in morality and the science of life just the same degree of certainty have we in what relates to them in works of imitation indeed it is for the most part in our skill in manners and in the observances of time and place and of decency in general which is only to be learned in those schools to which horace recommends us that what is called taste by way of distinction consists and which is in reality no other than a more refined judgment on the whole it appears to me that what is called taste in its most general acceptation is not a simple idea but is partly made up of a perception of the primary pleasures of sense of the secondary pleasures of the imagination and of the conclusions of the reasoning faculty concerning the various relations of these and concerning the human passions manners and actions all this is requisite to form taste and the groundwork of all these is the same in the human mind for as the senses are the great originals of all our ideas and consequently of all our pleasures if they are not uncertain and arbitrary the whole groundwork of taste is common to all and therefore there is a sufficient foundation for a conclusive reasoning on these matters   the beautiful  beauty is a thing much too affecting not to depend upon some positive qualities and since it is no creature of our reason since it strikes us without any reference to use and even where no use at all can be discerned since the order and method of nature is generally very different from our measures and proportions we must conclude that beauty is for the greater part some quality in bodies acting mechanically upon the human mind by the intervention of the senses   the real and the ideal    choose a day on which to represent the most sublime and affecting tragedy we have appoint the most favourite actors spare no cost upon the scenes and decorations unite the greatest efforts of poetry painting and music and when you have collected your audience just at the moment when their minds are erect with expectation let it be reported that a state criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining square in a moment the emptiness of the theatre would demonstrate the comparative weakness of the imitative arts and proclaim the triumph of the real sympathy i believe that this notion of our having a simple pain in the reality yet a delight in the representation arises from hence that we do not sufficiently distinguish what we would by no means choose to do from what we should be eager enough to see if it was once done we delight in seeing things which so far from doing our heartiest wishes would be to see redressed this noble capital the pride of england and of europe i believe no man is so strangely wicked as to desire to see destroyed by a conflagration or an earthquake though he should be removed himself to the greatest distance from the danger but suppose such a fatal accident to have happened what numbers from all parts would crowd to behold the ruins and amongst them many who would have been content never to have seen london in its glory   judgment in art  a rectitude of judgment in the arts which may be called a good taste does in a great measure depend upon sensibility because if the mind has no bent to the pleasures of the imagination it will never apply itself sufficiently to works of that species to acquire a competent knowledge in them but though a degree of sensibility is requisite to form a good judgment yet a good judgment does not necessarily arise from a quick sensibility of pleasure   moral effects of language  this arises chiefly from these three causes first that we take an extraordinary part in the passions of others and that we are easily affected and brought into sympathy by any tokens which are shown of them and there are no tokens which can express all the circumstances of most passions so fully as words so that if a person speaks upon any subject he can not only convey the subject to you but likewise the manner in which he is himself affected by it certain it is that the influence of most things on our passions is not so much from the things themselves as from our opinions concerning them and these again depend very much on the opinions of other men conveyable for the most part by words only secondly there are many things of a very affecting nature which can seldom occur in the reality but the words that represent them often do and thus they have an opportunity of making a deep impression and taking root in the mind whilst the idea of the reality was transient and to some perhaps never really occurred in any shape to whom it is notwithstanding very affecting as war death famine etc besides many ideas have never been at all presented to the senses of any men but by words as god angels devils heaven and hell all of which have however a great influence over the passions thirdly by words we have it in our power to make such combinations as we cannot possibly do otherwise by this power of combining we are able by the addition of wellchosen circumstances to give a new life and force to the simple object in painting we may represent any fine figure we please but we never can give it those enlivening touches which it may receive from words to represent an angel in a picture you can only draw a beautiful young man winged but what painting can furnish out anything so grand as the addition of one word the angel of the lord   security of truth  i then thought and am still of the same opinion that error and not truth of any kind is dangerous that ill conclusions can only flow from false propositions and that to know whether any proposition be true or false it is a preposterous method to examine it by its apparent consequences   imitation an instinctive law  for as sympathy makes us take a concern in whatever men feel so this affection prompts us to copy whatever they do and consequently we have a pleasure in imitating and in whatever belongs to imitation merely as it is such without any intervention of the reasoning faculty but solely from our natural constitution which providence has framed in such a manner as to find either pleasure or delight according to the nature of the object in whatever regards the purposes of our being it is by imitation far more than by precept that we learn everything and what we learn thus we acquire not only more effectually but more pleasantly this forms our manners our opinions our lives it is one of the strongest links of society it is a species of mutual compliance which all men yield to each other without constraint to themselves and which is extremely flattering to all   standard of reason and taste  it is probable that the standard both of reason and taste is the same in all human creatures for if there were not some principles of judgment as well as of sentiment common to all mankind no hold could possibly be taken either on their reason or their passions sufficient to maintain the ordinary correspondence of life   use of theory  a theory founded on experiment and not assumed is always good for so much as it explains our inability to push it indefinitely is no argument at all against it this inability may be owing to our ignorance of some necessary mediums to a want of proper application to many other causes besides a defect in the principles we employ   political outcasts  in the mean time that power which all these changes aimed at securing remains still as tottering and as uncertain as ever they are delivered up into the hands of those who feel neither respect for their persons nor gratitude for their favours who are put about them in appearance to serve in reality to govern them and when the signal is given to abandon and destroy them in order to set up some new dupe of ambition who in his turn is to be abandoned and destroyed thus living in a state of continual uneasiness and ferment softened only by the miserable consolation of giving now and then preferments to those for whom they have no value they are unhappy in their situation yet find it impossible to resign until at length soured in temper and disappointed by the very attainment of their ends in some angry in some haughty or some negligent moment they incur the displeasure of those upon whom they have rendered their very being dependent then perierunt tempora longi servitii they are cast off with scorn they are turned out emptied of all natural character of all intrinsic worth of all essential dignity and deprived of every consolation of friendship having rendered all retreat to old principles ridiculous and to old regards impracticable not being able to counterfeit pleasure or to discharge discontent nothing being sincere or right or balanced in their minds it is more than a chance that in the delirium of the last stage of their distempered power they make an insane political testament by which they throw all their remaining weight and consequence into the scale of their declared enemies and the avowed authors of their destruction   injustice to our own age    if these evil dispositions should spread much farther they must end in our destruction for nothing can save a people destitute of public and private faith however the author for the present state of things has extended the charge by much too widely as men are but too apt to take the measure of all mankind from their own particular acquaintance barren as this age may be in the growth of honour and virtue the country does not want at this moment as strong and those not a few examples as were ever known of an unshaken adherence to principle and attachment to connexion against every allurement of interest those examples are not furnished by the great alone nor by those whose activity in public affairs may render it suspected that they make such a character one of the rounds in their ladder of ambition but by men more quiet and more in the shade on whom an unmixed sense of honour alone could operate   false coalitions  no system of that kind can be formed which will not leave room fully sufficient for healing coalitions but no coalition which under the specious name of independency carries in its bosom the unreconciled principles of the original discord of parties ever was or will be an healing coalition nor will the mind of our sovereign ever know repose his kingdom settlement or his business order in efficiency or grace with his people until things are established upon the basis of some set of men who are trusted by the public and who can trust one another   political empiricism  men of sense when new projects come before them always think a discourse proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner proposed to be no more than a very unpleasant way of mispending time they must see the object to be of proper magnitude to engage them they must see the means of compassing it to be next to certain the mischiefs not to counterbalance the profit they will examine how a proposed imposition or regulation agrees with the opinion of those who are likely to be affected by it they will not despise the consideration even of their habitudes and prejudices they wish to know how it accords or disagrees with the true spirit of prior establishments whether of government or of finance because they well know that in the complicated economy of great kingdoms and immense revenues which in a length of time and by a variety of accidents have coalesced into a sort of body an attempt towards a compulsory equality in all circumstances and an exact practical definition of the supreme rights in every case is the most dangerous and chimerical of all enterprises the old building stands well enough though part gothic part grecian and part chinese until an attempt is made to square it into uniformity then it may come down upon our heads altogether in much uniformity of ruin and great will be the fall thereof   a visionary  enough of this visionary union in which much extravagance appears without any fancy and the judgment is shocked without anything to refresh the imagination it looks as if the author had dropped down from the moon without any knowledge of the general nature of this globe of the general nature of its inhabitants without the least acquaintance with the affairs of this country   party divisions  party divisions whether on the whole operating for good or evil are things inseparable from free government this is a truth which i believe admits little dispute having been established by the uniform experience of all ages the part a good citizen ought to take in these divisions has been a matter of much deeper controversy but god forbid that any controversy relating to our essential morals should admit of no decision it appears to me that this question like most of the others which regard our duties in life is to be determined by our station in it private men may be wholly neutral and entirely innocent but they who are legally invested with public trust or stand on the high ground of rank and dignity which is trust implied can hardly in any case remain indifferent without the certainty of sinking into insignificance and thereby in effect deserting that post in which with the fullest authority and for the wisest purposes the laws and institutions of their country have fixed them however if it be the office of those who are thus circumstanced to take a decided part it is no less their duty that it should be a sober one   decorum in party  it ought to be circumscribed by the same laws of decorum and balanced by the same temper which bound and regulate all the virtues in a word we ought to act in party with all the moderation which does not absolutely enervate that vigour and quench that fervency of spirit without which the best wishes for the public good must evaporate in empty speculation   not so bad as we seem  our circumstances are indeed critical but then they are the critical circumstances of a strong and mighty nation if corruption and meanness are greatly spread they are not spread universally many public men are hitherto examples of public spirit and integrity whole parties as far as large bodies can be uniform have preserved character however they may be deceived in some particulars i know of no set of men amongst us which does not contain persons on whom the nation in a difficult exigence may well value itself private life which is the nursery of the commonwealth is yet in general pure and on the whole disposed to virtue and the people at large want neither generosity nor spirit no small part of that very luxury which is so much the subject of the authors declamation but which in most parts of life by being well balanced and diffused is only decency and convenience has perhaps as many or more good than evil consequences attending it it certainly excites industry nourishes emulation and inspires some sense of personal value into all ranks of people what we want is to establish more fully an opinion of uniformity and consistency of character in the leading men of the state such as will restore some confidence to profession and appearance such as will fix subordination upon esteem without this all schemes are begun at the wrong end   politics without principle  people not very well grounded in the principles of public morality find a set of maxims in office ready made for them which they assume as naturally and inevitably as any of the insignia or instruments of the situation a certain tone of the solid and practical is immediately acquired every former profession of public spirit is to be considered as a debauch of youth or at best as a visionary scheme of unattainable perfection the very idea of consistency is exploded the convenience of the business of the day is to furnish the principle for doing it then the whole ministerial cant is quickly got by heart the prevalence of faction is to be lamented all opposition is to be regarded as the effect of envy and disappointed ambition all administrations are declared to be alike the same necessity justifies all their measures it is no longer a matter of discussion who or what administration is but that administration is to be supported is a general maxim flattering themselves that their power is become necessary to the support of all order and government everything which tends to the support of that power is sanctified and becomes a part of the public interest   moral debasement progressive    i believe the instances are exceedingly rare of men immediately passing over a clear marked line of virtue into declared vice and corruption there are a sort of middle tints and shades between the two extremes there is something uncertain on the confines of the two empires which they first pass through and which renders the change easy and imperceptible there are even a sort of splendid impositions so well contrived that at the very time the path of rectitude is quitted for ever men seem to be advancing into some higher and nobler road of public conduct not that such impositions are strong enough in themselves but a powerful interest often concealed from those whom it affects works at the bottom and secures the operation men are thus debauched away from those legitimate connexions which they had formed on a judgment early perhaps but sufficiently mature and wholly unbiassed   despotism  it is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleasure and to annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part and total debility on the part of the people   judgment and policy  nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation but what must either render us totally desperate or sooth us into the security of idiots we must soften into a credulity below the milkiness of infancy to think all men virtuous we must be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt men are in public as in private some good some evil the elevation of the one and the depression of the other are the first objects of all true policy but that form of government which neither in its direct institutions nor in their immediate tendency has contrived to throw its affairs into the most trustworthy hands but has left its whole executory system to be disposed of agreeably to the uncontrolled pleasures of any one man however excellent or virtuous is a plan of polity defective not only in that member but consequentially erroneous in every part of it   popular discontent  to complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors of power to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the future are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar such complaints and humours have existed in all times yet as all times have not been alike true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint which only characterises the general infirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and season   the people and their rulers  i am not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong they have been so frequently and outrageously both in other countries and in this but i do say that in all disputes between them and their rulers the presumption is at least upon a par in favour of the people experience may perhaps justify me in going farther when popular discontents have been very prevalent it may well be affirmed and supported that there has been generally something found amiss in the constitution or in the conduct of government the people have no interest in disorder when they do wrong it is their error and not their crime   government favouritism    it is this unnatural infusion of a government which in a great part of its constitution is popular that has raised the present ferment in the nation the people without entering deeply into its principles could plainly perceive its effects in much violence in a great spirit of innovation and a general disorder in all the functions of government i keep my eye solely on this system if i speak of those measures which have arisen from it it will be so far only as they illustrate the general scheme this is the fountain of all those bitter waters of which through an hundred different conduits we have drunk until we are ready to burst the discretionary power of the crown in the formation of ministry abused by bad or weak men has given rise to a system which without directly violating the letter of any law operates against the spirit of the whole constitution  a plan of favouritism for our executory government is essentially at variance with the plan of our legislature one great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours composed of monarchy and of controls on the part of the higher people and the lower is that the prince shall not be able to violate the laws this is useful indeed and fundamental but this even at first view in no more than a negative advantage an armour merely defensive it is therefore next in order and equal in importance that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested in the monarch whether for the execution of the laws or for the nomination to magistracy and office or for conducting the affairs of peace and war or for ordering the revenue should all be exercised upon public principles and national grounds and not on the likings or prejudices the intrigues or policies of a court   administration and legislation  in arbitrary governments the constitution of the ministry follows the constitution of the legislature both the law and the magistrate are the creatures of will it must be so nothing indeed will appear more certain on any tolerable consideration of this matter than that every sort of government ought to have its administration correspondent to its legislature if it should be otherwise things must fall into a hideous disorder the people of a free commonwealth who have taken such care that their laws should be the result of general consent cannot be so senseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons on whom they have no dependence and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to those powers upon the use of which the very being of the state depends   influence of the crown  the power of the crown almost dead and rotten as prerogative has grown up anew with much more strength and far less odium under the name of influence an influence which operated without noise and without violence an influence which converted the very antagonist into the instrument of power which contained in itself a perpetual principle of growth and renovation and which the distresses and the prosperity of the country equally tend to augment was an admirable substitute for a prerogative that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices had moulded into its original stamina irresistible principles of decay and dissolution the ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary system the interest of active men in the state is a foundation perpetual and infallible   voice of the people  government is deeply interested in everything which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subjects and to conciliate their affections i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people but as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to governments nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiorsby a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted and when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions the temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman and the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn   fallacy of extremes  it is a fallacy in constant use with those who would level all things and confound right with wrong to insist upon the inconveniences which are attached to every choice without taking into consideration the different weight and consequence of those inconveniences the question is not concerning absolute discontent or perfect satisfaction in government neither of which can be pure and unmixed at any time or upon any system the controversy is about that degree of good humour in the people which may possibly be attained and ought certainly to be looked for while some politicians may be waiting to know whether the sense of every individual be against them accurately distinguishing the vulgar from the better sort drawing lines between the enterprises of a faction and the efforts of a people they may chance to see the government which they are so nicely weighing and dividing and distinguishing tumble to the ground in the midst of their wise deliberation prudent men when so great an object as the security of government or even its peace is at stake will not run the risk of a decision which may be fatal to it they who can read the political sky will see a hurricane in a cloud no bigger than a hand at the very edge of the horizon and will run into the first harbour no lines can be laid down for civil or political wisdom they are a matter incapable of exact definition but though no man can draw a stroke between the confines of day and night yet light and darkness are upon the whole tolerably distinguishable nor will it be impossible for a prince to find out such a mode of government and such persons to administer it as will give a great degree of content to his people without any curious and anxious research for that abstract universal perfect harmony which while he is seeking he abandons those means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any research at all   private character a basis for public confidence  before men are put forward into the great trusts of the state they ought by their conduct to have obtained such a degree of estimation in their country as may be some sort of pledge and security to the public that they will not abuse those trusts it is no mean security for a proper use of power that a man has shown by the general tenor of his actions that the affection the good opinion the confidence of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life and that he has owed none of the degradations of his power or fortune to a settled contempt or occasional forfeiture of their esteem  that man who before he comes into power has no friends or who coming into power is obliged to desert his friends or who losing it has no friends to sympathise with him he who has no sway among any part of the landed or commercial interest but whose whole importance has begun with his office and is sure to end with it is a person who ought never to be suffered by a controlling parliament to continue in any of those situations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs because such a man has no connection with the interest of the people those knots or cabals of men who have got together avowedly without any public principle in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate and are therefore universally odious ought never to be suffered to domineer in the state because they have no connection with the sentiments and opinions of the people   prevention  every good political institution must have a preventive operation as well as a remedial it ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men from government and not to trust for the safety of the state to subsequent punishment alone punishment which has ever been tardy and uncertain and which when power is suffered in bad hands may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal   confidence in the people  they may be assured that however they amuse themselves with a variety of projects for substituting something else in the place of that great and only foundation of government the confidence of the people every attempt will but make their condition worse when men imagine that their food is only a cover for poison and when they neither love nor trust the hand that serves it it is not the name of the roast beef of old england that will persuade them to sit down to the table that is spread for them when the people conceive that laws and tribunals and even popular assemblies are perverted from the ends of their institution they find in those names of degenerated establishments only new motives to discontent those bodies which when full of life and beauty lay in their arms and were their joy and comfort when dead and putrid become but the more loathsome from remembrance of former endearments a sullen gloom and furious disorder prevail by fits the nation loses its relish for peace and prosperity as it did in that season of fulness which opened our troubles in the time of charles the first a species of men to whom a state of order would become a sentence of obscurity are nourished into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of intestine disturbances and it is no wonder that by a sort of sinister piety they cherish in their turn the disorders which are the parents of all their consequence   false maxims assumed as first principles    it is an advantage to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals that their maxims have a plausible air and on a cursory view appear equal to first principles they are light and portable they are as current as copper coin and about as valuable they serve equally the first capacities and the lowest and they are at least as useful to the worst men as to the best of this stamp is the cant of not men but measures a sort of charm by which many people get loose from every honourable engagement when i see a man acting this desultory and disconnected part with as much detriment to his own fortune as prejudice to the cause of any party i am not persuaded that he is right but i am ready to believe he is in earnest i respect virtue in all its situations even when it is found in the unsuitable company of weakness i lament to see qualities rare and valuable squandered away without any public utility but when a gentleman with great visible emoluments abandons the party in which he has long acted and tells you it is because he proceeds upon his own judgment that he acts on the merits of the several measures as they arise and that he is obliged to follow his own conscience and not that of others he gives reasons which it is impossible to controvert and discovers a character which it is impossible to mistake what shall we think of him who never differed from a certain set of men until the moment they lost their power and who never agreed with them in a single instance afterwards would not such a coincidence of interest and opinion be rather fortunate would it not be an extraordinary cast upon the dice that a mans connexions should degenerate into faction precisely at the critical moment when they lose their power or he accepts a place when people desert their connexions the desertion is a manifest fact upon which a direct simple issue lies triable by plain men whether a measure of government be right or wrong is no matter of fact but a mere affair of opinion on which men may as they do dispute and wrangle without end but whether the individual thinks the measure right or wrong is a point at still a greater distance from the reach of all human decision it is therefore very convenient to politicians not to put the judgment of their conduct on overt acts cognizable in any ordinary court but upon such matter as can be triable only in that secret tribunal where they are sure of being heard with favour or where at worst the sentence will be only private whipping   lord chatham  another scene was opened and other actors appeared on the stage the state in the condition i have described it was delivered into the hands of lord chathama great and celebrated name a name that keeps the name of this country respectable in every other on the globe it may be truly called      clarum et venerabile nomen     gentibus et multum nostrae quod proderat urbi  sir the venerable age of this great man his merited rank his superior eloquence his splendid qualities his eminent services the vast space he fills in the eye of mankind and more than all the rest his fall from power which like death canonizes and sanctifies a great character will not suffer me to censure any part of his conduct i am afraid to flatter him i am sure i am not disposed to blame him let those who have betrayed him by their adulation insult him with their malevolence but what i do not presume to censure i may have leave to lament for a wise man he seemed to me at that time to be governed too much by general maxims i speak with the freedom of history and i hope without offence one or two of these maxims flowing from an opinion not the most indulgent to our unhappy species and surely a little too general led him into measures that were greatly mischievous to himself and for that reason among others perhaps fatal to his country measures the effects of which i am afraid are for ever incurable he made an administration so checkered and speckled he put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed a cabinet so variously inlaid such a piece of diversified mosaic such a tesselated pavement without cement here a bit of black stone and there a bit of white patriots and courtiers kings friends and republicans whigs and tories treacherous friends and open enemies that it was indeed a very curious show but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand on the colleagues whom he had assorted at the same boards stared at each other and were obliged to ask sir your namesir you have the advantage of memr suchaonei beg a thousand pardons i venture to say it did so happen that persons had a single office divided between them who had never spoken to each other in their lives until they found themselves they knew not how pigging together heads and points in the same trucklebed  sir in consequence of this arrangement having put so much the larger part of his enemies and opposers into power the confusion was such that his own principles could not possibly have any effect or influence in the conduct of affairs if ever he fell into a fit of the gout or if any other cause withdrew him from public cares principles directly the contrary were sure to predominate when he had executed his plan he had not an inch of ground to stand upon when he had accomplished his scheme of administration he was no longer a minister when his face was hid but for a moment his whole system was on a wide sea without chart or compass the gentlemen his particular friends who with the names of various departments of ministry were admitted to seem as if they acted a part under him with a modesty that becomes all men and with a confidence in him which was justified even in its extravagance by his superior abilities had never in any instance presumed upon any opinion of their own deprived of his guiding influence they were whirled about the sport of every gust and easily driven into any port and as those who joined with them in manning the vessel were the most directly opposite to his opinions measures and character and far the most artful and most powerful of the set they easily prevailed so as to seize upon the vacant unoccupied and derelict minds of his friends and instantly they turned the vessel wholly out of the course of his policy as if it were to insult as well as to betray him even long before the close of the first session of his administration when everything was publicly transacted and with great parade in his name they made an act declaring it highly just and expedient to raise a revenue in america for even then sir even before this splendid orb was entirely set and while the western horizon was in a blaze with his descending glory on the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another luminary and for his hour became lord of the ascendant   grenville  mr grenville was a firstrate figure in this country with a masculine understanding and a stout and resolute heart he had an application undissipated and unwearied he took public business not as a duty which he was to fulfil but as a pleasure he was to enjoy and he seemed to have no delight out of this house except in such things as some way related to the business that was to be done within it if he was ambitious i will say this for him his ambition was of a noble and generous strain it was to raise himself not by the low pimping politics of a court but to win his way to power through the laborious gradations of public service and to secure himself a wellearned rank in parliament by a thorough knowledge of its constitution and a perfect practice in all its business  sir if such a man fell into errors it must be from defects not intrinsical they must be rather sought in the particular habits of his life which though they do not alter the groundwork of character yet tinge it with their own hue he was bred in a profession he was bred to the law which is in my opinion one of the first and noblest of human sciences a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than all the other kinds of learning put together but it is not apt except in persons very happily born to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the same proportion passing from that study he did not go very largely into the world but plunged into business i mean into the business of office and the limited and fixed methods and forms established there much knowledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line and there is no knowledge which is not valuable but it may be truly said that men too much conversant in office are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the substance of business not to be much more important than the forms in which it is conducted these forms are adapted to ordinary occasions and therefore persons who are nurtured in office do admirably well as long as things go on in their common order but when the high roads are broken up and the waters out when a new and troubled scene is opened and the file affords no precedent then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind and a far more extensive comprehension of things is requisite than ever office gave or than office can ever give   charles townshend    this light too is passed and set for ever you understand to be sure that i speak of charles townshend officially the reproducer of this fatal scheme whom i cannot even now remember without some degree of sensibility in truth sir he was the delight and ornament of this house and the charm of every private society which he honoured with his presence perhaps there never arose in this country nor in any country a man of a more pointed and finished wit and where his passions were not concerned of a more refined exquisite and penetrating judgment if he had not so great a stock as some have had who flourished formerly of knowledge long treasured up he knew better by far than any man i ever was acquainted with how to bring together within a short time all that was necessary to establish to illustrate and to decorate that side of the question he supported he stated his matter skilfully and powerfully he particularly excelled in a most luminous explanation and display of his subject his style of argument was neither trite and vulgar nor subtle and abstruse he hit the house just between wind and water and not being troubled with too anxious a zeal for any matter in question he was never more tedious or more earnest than the preconceived opinions and present temper of his hearers required to whom he was always in perfect unison he conformed exactly to the temper of the house and he seemed to guide because he was always sure to follow it   party and place  party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed for my part i find it impossible to conceive that any one believes in his own politics or thinks them to be of any weight who refuses to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice it is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the proper ends of government it is the business of the politician who is the philosopher in action to find out proper means towards those ends and to employ them with effect therefore every honourable connection will avow it is their first purpose to pursue every just method to put the men who hold their opinions into such a condition as may enable them to carry their common plans into execution with all the power and authority of the state as this power is attached to certain situations it is their duty to contend for these situations without a proscription of others they are bound to give to their own party the preference in all things and by no means for private considerations to accept any offers of power in which the whole body is not included nor to suffer themselves to be led or to be controlled or to be overbalanced in office or in council by those who contradict the very fundamental principles on which their party is formed and even those upon which every fair connection must stand such a generous contention for power on such manly and honourable maxims will easily be distinguished from the mean and interested struggle for place and emolument the very style of such persons will serve to discriminate them from those numberless imposters who have deluded the ignorant with professions incompatible with human practice and have afterwards incensed them by practices below the level of vulgar rectitude   political connections  every profession not excepting the glorious one of a soldier or the sacred one of a priest is liable to its own particular vices which however form no argument against those ways of life nor are the vices themselves inevitable to every individual in those professions of such a nature are connections in politics essentially necessary for the full performance of our public duty accidentally liable to degenerate into faction commonwealths are made of families free commonwealths of parties also and we may as well affirm that our natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens as that the bonds of our party weaken those by which we are held to our country  some legislators went so far as to make neutrality in party a crime against the state i do not know whether this might not have been rather to overstrain the principle certain it is the best patriots in the greatest commonwealths have always commended and promoted such connections idem sentire de republica was with them a principal ground of friendship and attachment nor do i know any other capable of forming firmer dearer more pleasing more honourable and more virtuous habitudes the romans carried this principle a great way even the holding of offices together the disposition of which arose from chance not selection gave rise to a relation which continued for life it was called necessitudo sortis and it was looked upon with a sacred reverence breaches of any of these kinds of civil relation were considered as acts of the most distinguished turpitude the whole people was distributed into political societies in which they acted in support of such interests in the state as they severally affected for it was then thought no crime to endeavour by every honest means to advance to superiority and power those of your own sentiments and opinions this wise people was far from imagining that those connections had no tie and obliged to no duty but that men might quit them without shame upon every call of interest they believed private honour to be the great foundation of public trust that friendship was no mean step towards patriotism that he who in the common intercourse of life showed he regarded somebody besides himself when he came to act in a public situation might probably consult some other interest than his own   neutrality  they were a race of men i hope in god the species is extinct who when they rose in their place no man living could divine from any known adherence to parties to opinions or to principles from any order or system in their politics or from any sequel or connection in their ideas what part they were going to take in any debate it is astonishing how much this uncertainty especially at critical times called the attention of all parties on such men all eyes were fixed on them all ears open to hear them each party gaped and looked alternately for their vote almost to the end of their speeches while the house hung on this uncertainty now the hear hims rose from this sidenow they rebellowed from the other and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance always received them in a tempest of applause the fortune of such men was a temptation too great to be resisted by one to whom a single whiff of incense withheld gave much greater pain than he received delight in the clouds of it which daily rose about him from the prodigal superstition of innumerable admirers he was a candidate for contradictory honours and his great aim was to make those agree in admiration of him who never agreed in anything else   weakness in government    let us learn from our experience it is not support that is wanting to government but reformation when ministry rests upon public opinion it is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant it has however some stability but when it stands upon private humour its structure is of stubble and its foundation is on quicksand i repeat it againhe that supports every administration subverts all government the reason is this the whole business in which a court usually takes an interest goes on at present equally well in whatever hands whether high or low wise or foolish scandalous or reputable there is nothing therefore to hold it firm to any one body of men or to any one consistent scheme of politics nothing interposes to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the passions of a court upon the servants of the public the system of administration is open to continual shocks and changes upon the principles of the meanest cabal and the most contemptible intrigue nothing can be solid and permanent all good men at length fly with horror from such a service men of rank and ability with the spirit which ought to animate such men in a free state while they decline the jurisdiction of dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes will for both cheerfully put themselves upon their country they will trust an inquisitive and distinguishing parliament because it does inquire and does distinguish if they act well they know that in such a parliament they will be supported against any intrigue if they act ill they know that no intrigue can protect them this situation however awful is honourable but in one hour and in the selfsame assembly without any assigned or assignable cause to be precipitated from the highest authority to the most marked neglect possibly into the greatest peril of life and reputation is a situation full of danger and destitute of honour it will be shunned equally by every man of prudence and every man of spirit   american progress  nothing in the history of mankind is like their progress for my part i never cast an eye on their flourishing commerce and their cultivated and commodious life but they seem to me rather ancient nations grown to perfection through a long series of fortunate events and a train of successful industry accumulating wealth in many centuries than the colonies of yesterday than a set of miserable outcasts a few years ago not so much sent as thrown out on the bleak and barren shore of a desolate wilderness three thousand miles from all civilized intercourse   combination not faction  that connection and faction are equivalent terms is an opinion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by unconstitutional statesmen the reason is evident whilst men are linked together they easily and speedily communicate the alarm of any evil design they are enabled to fathom it with common counsel and to oppose it with united strength whereas when they lie dispersed without concert order or discipline communication is uncertain counsel difficult and resistance impracticable where men are not acquainted with each others principles nor experienced in each others talents nor at all practised in their mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts in business no personal confidence no friendship no common interest subsisting among them it is evidently impossible that they can act a public part with uniformity perseverance or efficacy in a connection the most inconsiderable man by adding to the weight of the whole has his value and his use out of it the greatest talents are wholly unserviceable to the public no man who is not inflamed by vainglory into enthusiasm can flatter himself that his single unsupported desultory unsystematic endeavours are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle   great men  great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state the credit of such men at court or in the nation is the sole cause of all the public measures it would be an invidious thing most foreign i trust to what you think my disposition to remark the errors into which the authority of great names has brought the nation without doing justice at the same time to the great qualities whence that authority arose the subject is instructive to those who wish to form themselves on whatever of excellence has gone before them there are many young members in the house such of late has been the rapid succession of public men who never saw that prodigy charles townshend nor of course know what a ferment he was able to excite in everything by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings for failings he had undoubtedlymany of us remember them we are this day considering the effect of them but he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cause to an ardent generous perhaps an immoderate passion for fame a passion which is the instinct of all great souls   power of constituents    the power of the people within the laws must show itself sufficient to protect every representative in the animated performance of his duty or that duty cannot be performed the house of commons can never be a control on other parts of government unless they are controlled themselves by their constituents and unless these constituents possess some right in the choice of that house which it is not in the power of that house to take away if they suffer this power of arbitrary incapacitation to stand they have utterly perverted every other power of the house of commons the late proceeding i will not say is contrary to law it must be so for the power which is claimed cannot by any possibility be a legal power in any limited member of government   influence of place in government  it is no inconsiderable part of wisdom to know how much of an evil ought to be tolerated lest by attempting a degree of purity impracticable in degenerate times and manners instead of cutting off the subsisting ill practices new corruptions might be produced for the concealment and security of the old it were better undoubtedly that no influence at all could affect the mind of a member of parliament but of all modes of influence in my opinion a place under the government is the least disgraceful to the man who holds it and by far the most safe to the country i would not shut out that sort of influence which is open and visible which is connected with the dignity and the service of the state when it is not in my power to prevent the influence of contracts of subscriptions of direct bribery and those innumerable methods of clandestine corruption which are abundantly in the hands of the court and which will be applied as long as these means of corruption and the disposition to be corrupted have existence among us our constitution stands on a nice equipoise with steep precipices and deep waters upon all sides of it in removing it from a dangerous leaning towards one side there may be a risk of oversetting it on the other every project of a material change in a government so complicated as ours combined at the same time with external circumstances still more complicated is a matter full of difficulties in which a considerate man will not be too ready to decide a prudent man too ready to undertake or an honest man too ready to promise they do not respect the public nor themselves who engage for more than they are sure that they ought to attempt or that they are able to perform   taxation involves principle  no man ever doubted that the commodity of tea could bear an imposition of threepence but no commodity will bear threepence or will bear a penny when the general feelings of men are irritated and two millions of people are resolved not to pay the feelings of the colonies were formerly the feelings of great britain theirs were formerly the feelings of mr hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings would twenty shillings have ruined mr hampdens fortune no but the payment of half twenty shillings on the principle it was demanded would have made him a slave   good member of parliament    to be a good member of parliament is let me tell you no easy task especially at this time when there is so strong a disposition to run into the perilous extremes of servile compliance or wild popularity to unite circumspection with vigour is absolutely necessary but it is extremely difficult we are now members for a rich commercial city this city however is but a part of a rich commercial nation the interests of which are various multiform and intricate we are members for that great nation which however is itself but part of a great empire extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthest limits of the east and of the west all these widespread interests must be considered must be compared must be reconciled if possible we are members for a free country and surely we all know that the machine of a free constitution is no simple thing but as intricate and as delicate as it is valuable we are members in a great and ancient monarchy and we must preserve religiously the true legal rights of the sovereign which form the keystone that binds together the noble and wellconstructed arch of our empire and our constitution   fisheries of new england  as to the wealth which the colonies have drawn from the sea by their fisheries you had all that matter fully opened at your bar you surely thought those acquisitions of value for they seemed even to excite your envy and yet the spirit by which that enterprising employment has been exercised ought rather in my opinion to have raised your esteem and admiration and pray sir what in the world is equal to it pass by the other parts and look at the manner in which the people of new england have of late carried on the whale fishery whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of hudsons bay and daviss straits whilst we are looking for them beneath the arctic circle we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar cold that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen serpent of the south falkland island which seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of national ambition is but a stage and restingplace in the progress of their victorious industry nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging to them than the accumulated winter of both the poles we know that whilst some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of africa others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along the coast of brazil no sea but what is vexed by their fisheries no climate that is not witness to their toils neither the perseverance of holland nor the activity of france nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of english enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent people a people who are still as it were but in the gristle and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood   preparation for parliament  when i first devoted myself to the public service i considered how i should render myself fit for it and this i did by endeavouring to discover what it was that gave this country the rank it holds in the world i found that our prosperity and dignity arose principally if not solely from two sourcesour constitution and commerce both these i have spared no study to understand and no endeavour to support  the distinguishing part of our constitution is its liberty to preserve that liberty inviolate seems the particular duty and proper trust of a member of the house of commons but the liberty the only liberty i mean is a liberty connected with order that not only exists along with order and virtue but which cannot exist at all without them it inheres in good and steady government as in its substance and vital principle  the other source of our power is commerce of which you are so large a part and which cannot exist no more than your liberty without a connection with many virtues it has ever been a very particular and a very favourite object of my study in its principles and in its details i think many here are acquainted with the truth of what i say this i know that i have ever had my house open and my poor services ready for traders and manufacturers of every denomination my favourite ambition is to have those services acknowledged i now appear before you to make trial whether my earnest endeavours have been so wholly oppressed by the weakness of my abilities as to be rendered insignificant in the eyes of a great trading city or whether you choose to give a weight to humble abilities for the sake of the honest exertions with which they are accompanied this is my trial today my industry is not on trial of my industry i am sure as far as my constitution of mind and body admitted   bathurst and americas future    let us however before with descend from this noble eminence reflect that this growth of our national prosperity has happened within the short period of the life of man it has happened within sixtyeight years there are those alive whose memory might touch the two extremities for instance my lord bathurst might remember all the stages of the progress he was in 1704 of an age at least to be made to comprehend such things he was then old enough acta parentum jam legere et quae sit poterit cognoscere virtus suppose sir that the angel of this auspicious youth foreseeing the many virtues which made him one of the most amiable as he is one of the most fortunate men of his age had opened to him in vision that when in the fourth generation the third prince of the house of brunswick had sat twelve years on the throne of that nation which by the happy issue of moderate and healing councils was to be made great britain he should see his son lord chancellor of england turn back the current of hereditary dignity to its fountain and raise him to a higher rank of peerage whilst he enriched the family with a new one if amidst these bright and happy scenes of domestic honour and prosperity that angel should have drawn up the curtain and unfolded the rising glories of his country and whilst he was gazing with admiration on the then commercial grandeur of england the genius should point out to him a little speck scarce visible in the mass of the national interest a small seminal principle rather than a formed body and should tell himyoung man there is americawhich at this day serves for little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners yet shall before you taste of death show itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world whatever england has been growing to by a progressive increase of improvement brought in by varieties of people by succession of civilizing conquests and civilizing settlements in a series of seventeen hundred years you shall see as much added to her by america in the course of a single life if this state of his country had been foretold to him would it not require all the sanguine credulity of youth and all the fervid glow of enthusiasm to make him believe it fortunate man he has lived to see it fortunate indeed if he lives to see nothing that shall vary the prospect and cloud the setting of his day   candid policy  refined policy ever has been the parent of confusion and ever will be so as long as the world endures plain good intention which is as easily discovered at the first view as fraud is surely detected at last is let me say of no mean force in the government of mankind genuine simplicity of heart is a healing and cementing principle my plan therefore being formed upon the most simple grounds imaginable may disappoint some people when they hear it it has nothing to recommend it to the pruriency of curious ears there is nothing at all new and captivating in it it has nothing of the splendour of the project which has been lately laid upon your table by the noble lord in the blue riband it does not propose to fill your lobby with squabbling colony agents who will require the interposition of your mace at every instant to keep the peace amongst them it does not institute a magnificent auction of finance where captivated provinces come to general ransom by bidding against each other until you knock down the hammer and determine a proportion of payments beyond all the powers of algebra to equalize and settle   wisdom of concession  peace implies reconciliation and where there has been a material dispute reconciliation does in a manner always imply concession on the one part or the other in this state of things i make no difficulty in affirming that the proposal ought to originate from us great and acknowledged force is not impaired either in effect or in opinion by an unwillingness to exert itself the superior power may offer peace with honour and with safety such an offer from such a power will be attributed to magnanimity but the concessions of the weak are the concessions of fear when such a one is disarmed he is wholly at the mercy of his superior and he loses for ever that time and those chances which as they happen to all men are the strength and resources of all inferior power   magnanimity  as for the trifling petulance which the rage of party stirs up in little minds though it should show itself even in this court it has not made the slightest impression on me the highest flight of such clamorous birds is winged in an inferior region of the air we hear them and we look upon them just as you gentlemen when you enjoy the serene air on your lofty rocks look down upon the gulls that skim the mud of your river when it is exhausted of its tide   duty of representatives  it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union the closest correspondence and the most unreserved communication with his constituents their wishes ought to have great weight with him their opinion high respect their business unremitted attention it is his duty to sacrifice his repose his pleasures his satisfactions to theirs and above all ever and in all cases to prefer their interest to his own but his unbiassed opinion his mature judgment his enlightened conscience he ought not to sacrifice to you to any man or to any set of men living these he does not derive from your pleasure no nor from the law and the constitution they are a trust from providence for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion   prudential silence  though i gave so far into his opinion that i immediately threw my thoughts into a sort of parliamentary form i was by no means equally ready to produce them it generally argues some degree of natural impotence of mind or some want of knowledge of the world to hazard plans of government except from a seat of authority propositions are made not only ineffectually but somewhat disreputably when the minds of men are not properly disposed for their reception and for my part i am not ambitious of ridicule not absolutely a candidate for disgrace   colonial ties  they are our children but when children ask for bread we are not to give a stone is it because the natural resistance of things and the various mutations of time hinders our government or any scheme of government from being any more than a sort of approximation to the right is it therefore that the colonies are to recede from it infinitely when this child of ours wishes to assimilate to its parent and to reflect with a true filial resemblance the beauteous countenance of british liberty are we to turn to them the shameful parts of our constitution are we to give them our weakness for their strength our opprobrium for their glory and the slough of slavery which we are not able to work off to serve them for their freedom   government and legislation    if government were a matter of will upon any side yours without question ought to be superior but government and legislation are matters of reason and judgment and not of inclination and what sort of reason is that in which the determination precedes the discussion in which one set of men deliberate and another decide and where those who form the conclusion are perhaps three hundred miles distant from those who hear the arguments   parliament  parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests which interests each must maintain as an agent and advocate against other agents and advocates but parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation with one interest that of the whole where not local purposes not local prejudices ought to guide but the general good resulting from the general reason of the whole you choose a member indeed but when you have chosen him he is not member of bristol but he is a member of parliament   moral levellers  this moral levelling is a servile principle it leads to practical passive obedience far better than all the doctrines which the pliant accommodation of theology to power has ever produced it cuts up by the roots not only all idea of forcible resistance but even of civil opposition it disposes men to an abject submission not by opinion which may be shaken by argument or altered by passion but by the strong ties of public and private interest for if all men who act in a public situation are equally selfish corrupt and venal what reason can be given for desiring any sort of change which besides the evils which must attend all changes can be productive of no possible advantage the active men in the state are true samples of the mass if they are universally depraved the commonwealth itself is not sound we may amuse ourselves with talking as much as we please of the virtue of middle or humble life that is we may place our confidence in the virtue of those who have never been tried but if the persons who are continually emerging out of that sphere be no better than those whom birth has placed above it what hopes are there in the remainder of the body which is to furnish the perpetual succession of the state all who have ever written on government are unanimous that among a people generally corrupt liberty cannot long exist and indeed how is it possible when those who are to make the laws to guard to enforce or to obey them are by a tacit confederacy of manners indisposed to the spirit of all generous and noble institutions   public salary and patriotic service  i am not possessed of an exact common measure between real service and its reward i am very sure that states do sometimes receive services which it is hardly in their power to reward according to their worth if i were to give my judgment with regard to this country i do not think the great efficient offices of the state to be overpaid the service of the public is a thing which cannot be put to auction and struck down to those who will agree to execute it the cheapest when the proportion between reward and service is our object we must always consider of what nature the service is and what sort of men they are that must perform it what is just payment for one kind of labour and full encouragement for one kind of talents is fraud and discouragement to others many of the great offices have much duty to do and much expense of representation to maintain a secretary of state for instance must not appear sordid in the eyes of the ministers of other nations neither ought our ministers abroad to appear contemptible in the courts where they reside in all offices of duty there is almost necessarily a great neglect of all domestic affairs a person in high office can rarely take a view of his family house if he sees that the state takes no detriment the state must see that his affairs should take as little i will even go so far as to affirm that if men were willing to serve in such situations without salary they ought not to be permitted to do it ordinary service must be secured by the motives to ordinary integrity i do not hesitate to say that that state which lays its foundations in rare and heroic virtues will be sure to have its superstructure in the basest profligacy and corruption an honourable and fair profit is the best security against avarice and rapacity as in all things else a lawful and regulated enjoyment is the best security against debauchery and excess for as wealth is power so all power will infallibly draw wealth to itself by some means or other and when men are left no way of ascertaining their profits but by their means of obtaining them those means will be increased to infinity this is true in all the parts of administration as well as in the whole if any individual were to decline his appointments it might give an unfair advantage to ostentatious ambition over unpretending service it might breed invidious comparisons it might tend to destroy whatever little unity and agreement may be found among ministers and after all when an ambitious man had run down his competitors by a fallacious show of disinterestedness and fixed himself in power by that means what security is there that he would not change his course and claim as an indemnity ten times more than he has given up   rational liberty  liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed the degree of restraint it is impossible in any case to settle precisely but it ought to be the constant aim of every wise public council to find out by cautious experiments and rational cool endeavours with how little not how much of this restraint the community can subsist for liberty is a good to be improved and not an evil to be lessened it is not only a private blessing of the first order but the vital spring and energy of the state itself which has just so much life and vigour as there is liberty in it but whether liberty be advantageous or not for i know it is a fashion to decry the very principle none will dispute that peace is a blessing and peace must in the course of human affairs be frequently bought by some indulgence and toleration at least to liberty for as the sabbath though of divine institution was made for man not man for the sabbath government which can claim no higher origin or authority in its exercise at least ought to conform to the exigencies of the time and the temper and character of the people with whom it is concerned and not always to attempt violently to bend the people to their theories of subjection the bulk of mankind on their part are not excessively curious concerning any theories whilst they are really happy and one sure symptom of an illconducted state is the propensity of the people to resort to them   ireland and magna charta    the feudal baronage and the feudal knighthood the roots of our primitive constitution were early transplanted into that soil and grew and flourished there magna charta if it did not give us originally the house of commons gave us at least a house of commons of weight and consequence but your ancestors did not churlishly sit down alone to the feast of magna charta ireland was made immediately a partaker this benefit of english laws and liberties i confess was not at first extended to all ireland mark the consequence english authority and english liberty had exactly the same boundaries your standard could never be advanced an inch beyond your privileges sir john davis shows beyond a doubt that the refusal of a general communication of these rights was the true cause why ireland was five hundred years in subduing and after the vain projects of a military government attempted in the reign of queen elizabeth it was soon discovered that nothing could make that country english in civility and allegiance but your laws and your forms of legislature it was not english arms but the english constitution that conquered ireland from that time ireland has ever had a general parliament as she had before a partial parliament you changed the people you altered the religion but you never touched the form or the vital substance of free government in that kingdom you deposed kings you restored them you altered the succession to theirs as well as to your own crown but you never altered their constitution the principle of which was respected by usurpation restored with the restoration of monarchy and established i trust for ever by the glorious revolution   colonies and british constitution  for that service for all service whether of revenue trade or empire my trust is in her interest in the british constitution my hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names from kindred blood from similar privileges and equal protection these are ties which though light as air are as strong as links of iron let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your governmentthey will cling and grapple to you and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance but let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another that these two things may exist without any mutual relation the cement is gone the cohesion is loosened and everything hastens to decay and dissolution as long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith wherever the chosen race and sons of england worship freedom they will turn their faces towards you the more they multiply the more friends you will have the more ardently they love liberty the more perfect will be their obedience slavery they can have anywhere it is a weed that grows in every soil they may have it from spain they may have it from prussia but until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity freedom they can have from none but you this is the commodity of price of which you have the monopoly this is the true act of navigation which binds to you the commerce of the colonies and through them secures to you the wealth of the world deny them this participation of freedom and you break that sole bond which originally made and must still preserve the unity of the empire do not entertain so weak an imagination as that your registers and your bonds your affidavits and your sufferances your cockets and your clearances are what form the great securities of your commerce do not dream that your letters of office and your instructions and your suspending clauses are the things that hold together the great contexture of this mysterious whole these things do not make your government dead instruments passive tools as they are it is the spirit of the english communion that gives all their life and efficacy to them it is the spirit of the english constitution which infused through the mighty mass pervades feeds unites invigorates vivifies every part of the empire even down to the minutest member   reciprocal confidence  at the first fatal opening of this contest the wisest course seemed to be to put an end as soon as possible to the immediate causes of the dispute and to quiet a discussion not easily settled upon clear principles and arising from claims which pride would permit neither party to abandon by resorting as nearly as possible to the old successful course a mere repeal of the obnoxious tax with a declaration of the legislative authority of this kingdom was then fully sufficient to procure peace to both sides man is a creature of habit and the first breach being of very short continuance the colonies fell back exactly into their ancient state the congress has used an expression with regard to this pacification which appears to me truly significant after the repeal of the stamp act the colonies fell says this assembly into their ancient state of unsuspecting confidence in the mother country this unsuspecting confidence is the true centre of gravity amongst mankind about which all the parts are at rest it is this unsuspecting confidence that removes all difficulties and reconciles all the contradictions which occur in the complexity of all ancient puzzled political establishments happy are the rulers which have the secret of preserving it   pensions and the crown  when men receive obligations from the crown through the pious hands of fathers or of connections as venerable as the paternal the dependencies which arise from thence are the obligations of gratitude and not the fetters of servility such ties originate in virtue and they promote it they continue men in those habitudes of friendship those political connexions and those political principles in which they began life they are antidotes against a corrupt levity instead of causes of it what an unseemly spectacle would it afford what a disgrace would it be to the commonwealth that suffered such things to see the hopeful son of a meritorious minister begging his bread at the door of that treasury from whence his father dispensed the economy of an empire and promoted the happiness and glory of his country why should he be obliged to prostrate his honour and to submit his principles at the levee of some proud favourite shouldered and thrust aside by every impudent pretender on the very spot where a few days before he saw himself adoredobliged to cringe to the author of the calamities of his house and to kiss the hands that are red with his fathers blood   colonial progress  but nothing in progression can rest on its original plan we may as well think of rocking a grown man in the cradle of an infant therefore as the colonies prospered and increased to a numerous and mighty people spreading over a very great tract of the globe it was natural that they should attribute to assemblies so respectable in their formal constitution some part of the dignity of the great nations which they represented no longer tied to bylaws these assemblies made acts of all sorts and in all cases whatsoever they levied money not for parochial purposes but upon regular grants to the crown following all the rules and principles of a parliament to which they approached every day more and more nearly those who think themselves wiser than providence and stronger than the course of nature may complain of all this variation on the one side or the other as their several humours and prejudices may lead them but things could not be otherwise and english colonies must be had on these terms or not had at all   feudal principles and modern times  in the first place it is formed in many respects upon feudal principles in the feudal times it was not uncommon even among subjects for the lowest offices to be held by considerable persons persons as unfit by their incapacity as improper from their rank to occupy such employments they were held by patent sometimes for life and sometimes by inheritance if my memory does not deceive me a person of no slight consideration held the office of patent hereditary cook to an earl of warwick the earl of warwicks soups i fear were not the better for the dignity of his kitchen i think it was an earl of gloucester who officiated as steward of the household to the archbishops of canterbury instances of the same kind may in some degree be found in the northumberland housebook and other family records there was some reason in ancient necessities for these ancient customs protection was wanted and the domestic tie thought not the highest was the closest the kings household has not only several strong traces of this feudality but it is formed also upon the principles of a body corporate it has its own magistrates courts and bylaws this might be necessary in the ancient times in order to have a government within itself capable of regulating the vast and often unruly multitude which composed and attended it this was the origin of the ancient court called the green clothcomposed of the marshal treasurer and other great officers of the household with certain clerks the rich subjects of the kingdom who had formerly the same establishments only on a reduced scale have since altered their economy and turned the course of their expense from the maintenance of vast establishments within their walls to the employment of a great variety of independent trades abroad their influence is lessened but a mode of accommodation and a style of splendour suited to the manners of the times has been increased royalty itself has insensibly followed and the royal household has been carried away by the resistless tide of manners but with this very material differenceprivate men have got rid of the establishments along with the reasons of them whereas the royal household has lost all that was stately and venerable in the antique manners without retrenching anything of the cumbrous charge of a gothic establishment it is shrunk into the polished littleness of modern elegance and personal accommodation it has evaporated from the gross concrete into an essence and rectified spirit of expense where you have tuns of ancient pomp in a vial of modern luxury   restrictive virtues  i know that all parsimony is of a quality approaching to unkindness and that on some person or other every reform must operate as a sort of punishment indeed the whole class of the severe and restrictive virtues are at a market almost too high for humanity what is worse there are very few of those virtues which are not capable of being imitated and even outdone in many of their most striking effects by the worst of vices malignity and envy will carve much more deeply and finish much more sharply in the work of retrenchment than frugality and providence i do not therefore wonder that gentlemen have kept away from such a task as well from goodnature as from prudence private feeling might indeed be overborne by legislative reason and a man of a longdsighted and a strongnerved humanity might bring himself not so much to consider from whom he takes a superfluous enjoyment as for whom in the end he may preserve the absolute necessaries of life   libellers of human nature  i hope there are none of you corrupted with the doctrine taught by wicked men for the worst purposes and received by the malignant credulity of envy and ignorance which is that the men who act upon the public stage are all alike all equally corrupt all influenced by no other views than the sordid lure of salary and pension the thing i know by experience to be false never expecting to find perfection in men and not looking for divine attributes in created beings in my commerce with my contemporaries i have found much human virtue i have seen not a little public spirit a real subordination of interest to duty and a decent and regulated sensibility to honest fame and reputation the age unquestionably produces whether in a greater or less number than former times i know not daring profligates and insidious hypocrites what then am i not to avail myself of whatever good is to be found in the world because of the mixture of evil that will always be in it the smallness of the quantity in currency only heightens the value they who raise suspicions on the good on account of the behaviour of ill men are of the party of the latter the common cant is no justification for taking this party i have been deceived say they by titius and maevius i have been the dupe of this pretender or of that mountebank and i can trust appearances no longer but my credulity and want of discernment cannot as i conceive amount to a fair presumption against any mans integrity a conscientious person would rather doubt his own judgment than condemn his species he would say i have observed without attention or judged upon erroneous maxims i trusted to profession when i ought to have attended to conduct such a man will grow wise not malignant by his acquaintance with the world but he that accuses all mankind of corruption ought to remember that he is sure to convict only one in truth i should much rather admit those whom at any time i have disrelished the most to be patterns of perfection than seek a consolation to my own unworthiness in a general communion of depravity with all about me   refusal a revenue  what says the financier is peace to us without money your plan gives us no revenue no but it doesfor it secures to the subject the power of refusal the first of all revenues experience is a cheat and fact a liar if this power in the subject of proportioning his grant or of not granting at all has not been found the richest mine of revenue ever discovered by the skill or by the fortune of man it does not indeed vote you 152752 pounds  11  2 34ths nor any other paltry limited sum but it gives the strong box itself the fund the bank from whence only revenues can arise amongst a people sensible of freedom posita luditur arca cannot you in england cannot you at this time of day cannot you a house of commons trust to the principle which has raised so mighty a revenue and accumulated a debt of near 140 millions in this country is this principle to be true in england and false everywhere else is it not true in ireland has it not hitherto been true in the colonies why should you presume that in any country a body duly constituted for any function will neglect to perform its duty and abdicate its trust such a presumption would go against all governments in all modes but in truth this dread of penury of supply from a free assembly has no foundation in nature for first observe that besides the desire which all men have naturally of supporting the honour of their own government that sense of dignity and that security to property which ever attend freedom have a tendency to increase the stock of the free community most may be taken where most is accumulated and what is the soil or climate where experience has not uniformly proved that the voluntary flow of heapedup plenty bursting from the weight of its own rich luxuriance has ever run with a more copious stream of revenue than could be squeezed from the dry husks of oppressed indigence by the straining of all the politic machinery in the world   a party man  the only method which has ever been found effectual to preserve any man against the corruption of nature and example is a habit of life and communication of counsels with the most virtuous and publicspirited men of the age you live in such a society cannot be kept without advantage or deserted without shame for this rule of conduct i may be called in reproach a party man but i am little affected with such aspersions in the way which they call party i worship the constitution of your fathers and i shall never blush for my political company all reverence to honour all idea of what it is will be lost out of the world before it can be imputed as a fault to any man that he has been closely connected with those incomparable persons living and dead with whom for eleven years i have constantly thought and acted if i have wandered out of the paths of rectitude into those of interested faction it was in company with the saviles the dowdeswells the wentworths the bentincks with the lenoxes the manchesters the keppels the saunderses with the temperate permanent hereditary virtue of the whole house of cavendish names among which some have extended your fame and empire in arms and all have fought the battle of your liberties in fields not less glorious these and many more like these grafting public principles on private honour have redeemed the present age and would have adorned the most splendid period in your history   patriotism and public income    is it not the same virtue which does everything for us here in england do you imagine then that it is the landtax which raises your revenue that it is the annual vote in the committee of supply which gives you your army or that it is the mutiny bill which inspires it with bravery and discipline no surely no it is the love of the people it is their attachment to their government from the sense of the deep stake they have in such a glorious institution which gives you your army and your navy and infuses into both that liberal obedience without which your army would be a base rabble and your navy nothing but rotten timber  all this i know well enough will sound wild and chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and mechanical politicians who have no place among us a sort of people who think that nothing exists but what is gross and material and who therefore far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine but to men truly initiated and rightly taught these ruling and master principles which in the opinion of such men as i have mentioned have no substantial existence are in truth everything and all in all magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom and a great empire and little minds go ill together if we are conscious of our situation and glow with zeal to fill our places as becomes our station and ourselves we ought to auspicate all our public proceedings on america with the old warning of the church sursum corda we ought to elevate our minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order of providence has called us by adverting to the dignity of this high calling our ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious empire and have made the most extensive and the only honourable conquests not by destroying but by promoting the wealth the number the happiness of the human race let us get an american revenue as we have got an american empire english privileges have made it all that it is english privileges alone will make it all it can be   american protestantism  if anything were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of government religion would have given it a complete effect religion always a principle of energy in this new people is no way worn out or impaired and their mode of professing it is also one main cause of this free spirit the people are protestants and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion this is a persuasion not only favourable to liberty but built upon it i do not think sir that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting churches from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be sought in their religious tenets as in their history every one knows that the roman catholic religion is at least coeval with most of the governments where it prevails that it has generally gone hand in hand with them and received great favour and every kind of support from authority the church of england too was formed from her cradle under the nursing care of regular government but the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty their very existence depended on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim all protestantism even the most cold and passive is a sort of dissent but the religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance it is the dissidence of dissent and the protestantism of the protestant religion   right of taxation    i am resolved this day to have nothing at all to do with the question of the right of taxation some gentlemen startle but it is true i put it totally out of the question it is less than nothing in my consideration i do not indeed wonder nor will you sir that gentlemen of profound learning are fond of displaying it on this profound subject but my consideration is narrow confined and wholly limited to the policy of the question i do not examine whether the giving away a mans money be a power excepted and reserved out of the general trust of government and how far all mankind in all forms of polity are entitled to an exercise of that right by the charter of nature or whether on the contrary a right of taxation is necessarily involved in the general principle of legislation and inseparable from the ordinary supreme power these are deep questions where great names militate against each other where reason is perplexed and an appeal to authorities only thickens the confusion for high and reverend authorities lift up their heads on both sides and there is no sure footing in the middle this point is the great serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old where armies whole have sunk i do not intend to be overwhelmed in that bog though in such respectable company the question with me is not whether you have a right to render your people miserable but whether it is not your interest to make them happy it is not what a lawyer tells me i may do but what humanity reason and justice tell me i ought to do is a politic act the worse for being a generous one is no concession proper but that which is made from your want of right to keep what you grant or does it lessen the grace or dignity of relaxing in the exercise of an odious claim because you have your evidenceroom full of titles and your magazines stuffed with arms to enforce them what signify all those titles and all those arms of what avail are they when the reason of the thing tells me that the assertion of my title is the loss of my suit and that i could do nothing but wound myself by the use of my own weapons   contracted views  it is exceedingly common for men to contract their love to their country into an attachment to its petty subdivisions and they sometimes even cling to their provincial abuses as if they were franchises and local privileges accordingly in places where there is much of this kind of estate persons will be always found who would rather trust to their talents in recommending themselves to power for the renewal of their interests than to incumber their purses though never so lightly in order to transmit independence to their posterity it is a great mistake that the desire of securing property is universal among mankind gaming is a principle inherent in human nature it belongs to us all i would therefore break those tables i would furnish no evil occupation for that spirit i would make every man look everywhere except to the intrigue of a court for the improvement of his circumstances or the security of his fortune   assimilating power of contact  i am sure that the only means of checking precipitate degeneracy is heartily to concur with whatever is the best in our time and to have some more correct standard of judging what that best is than the transient and uncertain favour of a court if once we are able to find and can prevail on ourselves to strengthen a union of such men whatever accidentally becomes indisposed to illexercised power even by the ordinary operation of human passions must join with that society and cannot long be joined without in some degree assimilating to it virtue will catch as well as vice by contact and the public stock of honest manly principle will daily accumulate we are not too nicely to scrutinize motives as long as action is irreproachable it is enough and for a worthy man perhaps too much to deal out its infamy to convicted guilt and declared apostacy   prudence of timely reform    but there is a time when men will not suffer bad things because their ancestors have suffered worse there is a time when the hoary head of inveterate abuse will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection if the noble lord in the blue riband pleads not guilty to the charges brought against the present system of public economy it is not possible to give a fair verdict by which he will not stand acquitted but pleading is not our present business his plea or his traverse may be allowed as an answer to a charge when a charge is made but if he puts himself in the way to obstruct reformation then the faults of his office instantly become his own instead of a public officer in an abusive department whose province is an object to be regulated he becomes a criminal who is to be punished i do most seriously put it to administration to consider the wisdom of a timely reform early reformations are amicable arrangements with a friend in power late reformations are terms imposed upon a conquered enemy early reformations are made in cool blood late reformations are made under a state of inflammation in that state of things people behold in government nothing that is respectable they see the abuse and they will see nothing else they fall into the temper of a furious populace provoked at the disorder of a house of illfame they never attempt to correct or regulate they go to work by the shortest waythey abate the nuisance they pull down the house   difficulties of reformers  nothing you know is more common than for men to wish and call loudly too for a reformation who when it arrives do by no means like the severity of its aspect reformation is one of those pieces which must be put at some distance in order to please its greatest favourers love it better in the abstract than in the substance when any old prejudice of their own or any interest that they value is touched they become scrupulous they become captious and every man has his separate exception some pluck out the black hairs some the gray one point must be given up to one another point must be yielded to another nothing is suffered to prevail upon its own principle the whole is so frittered down and disjointed that scarcely a trace of the original scheme remains thus between the resistance of power and the unsystematical process of popularity the undertaker and the undertaking are both exposed and the poor reformer is hissed off the stage both by friends and foes   philosophy of commerce  if honesty be true policy with regard to the transient interest of individuals it is much more certainly so with regard to the permanent interests of communities i know that it is but too natural for us to see our own certain ruin in the possible prosperity of other people it is hard to persuade us that everything which is got by another is not taken from ourselves but it is fit that we should get the better of these suggestions which come from what is not the best and soundest part of our nature and that we should form to ourselves a way of thinking more rational more just and more religious trade is not a limited thing as if the objects of mutual demand and consumption could not stretch beyond the bounds of our jealousies god has given the earth to the children of men and he has undoubtedly in giving it to them given them what is abundantly sufficient for all their exigencies not a scanty but a most liberal provision for them all the author of our nature has written it strongly in that nature and has promulgated the same law in his written word that man shall eat his bread by his labour and i am persuaded that no man and no combination of men for their own ideas of their particular profit can without great impiety undertake to say that he shall not do so that they have no sort of right either to prevent the labour or to withhold the bread   theorizing politicians    there are people who have split and anatomised the doctrine of free government as if it were an abstract question concerning metaphysical liberty and necessity and not a matter of moral prudence and natural feeling they have disputed whether liberty be a positive or a negative idea whether it does not consist in being governed by laws without considering what are the laws or who are the makers whether man has any rights by nature and whether all the property he enjoys be not the alms of his government and his life itself their favour and indulgence others corrupting religion as these have perverted philosophy contend that christians are redeemed into captivity and the blood of the saviour of mankind has been shed to make them the slaves of a few proud and insolent sinners these shocking extremes provoking to extremes of another kind speculations are let loose as destructive to all authority as the former are to all freedom and every government is called tyranny and usurpation which is not formed on their fancies in this manner the stirrersup of this contention not satisfied with distracting our dependencies and filling them with blood and slaughter are corrupting our understandings they are endeavouring to tear up along with practical liberty all the foundations of human society all equity and justice religion and order   economy and public spirit  economy and public spirit have made a beneficent and an honest spoil they have plundered from extravagance and luxury for the use of substantial service a revenue of near four hundred thousand pounds the reform of the finances joined to this reform of the court gives to the public nine hundred thousand pounds a year and upwards  the minister who does these things is a great manbut the king who desires that they should be done is a far greater we must do justice to our enemiesthese are the acts of a patriot king i am not in dread of the vast armies of france i am not in dread of the gallant spirit of its brave and numerous nobility i am not alarmed even at the great navy which has been so miraculously created all these things louis the fourteenth had before with all these things the french monarchy has more than once fallen prostrate at the feet of the public faith of great britain it was the want of public credit which disabled france from recovering after her defeats or recovering even from her victories and triumphs it was a prodigal court it was an illordered revenue that sapped the foundations of all her greatness credit cannot exist under the arm of necessity necessity strikes at credit i allow with a heavier and quicker blow under an arbitrary monarchy than under a limited and balanced government but still necessity and credit are natural enemies and cannot be long reconciled in any situation from necessity and corruption a free state may lose the spirit of that complex constitution which is the foundation of confidence   reform ought to be progressive  whenever we improve it is right to leave room for a further improvement it is right to consider to look about us to examine the effect of what we have done then we can proceed with confidence because we can proceed with intelligence whereas in hot reformations in what men more zealous than considerate call making clear work the whole is generally so crude so harsh so indigested mixed with so much imprudence and so much injustice so contrary to the whole course of human nature and human institutions that the very people who are most eager for it are among the first to grow disgusted at what they have done then some part of the abdicated grievance is recalled from its exile in order to become a corrective of the correction then the abuse assumes all the credit and popularity of a reform the very idea of purity and disinterestedness in politics falls into disrepute and is considered as a vision of hot and inexperienced men and thus disorders become incurable not by the virulence of their own quality but by the unapt and violent nature of the remedies a great part therefore of my idea of reform is meant to operate gradually some benefits will come at a nearer some at a more remote period we must no more make haste to be rich by parsimony than by intemperate acquisition   civil freedom    civil freedom gentlemen is not as many have endeavoured to persuade you a thing that lies hid in the depth of abstruse science it is a blessing and a benefit not an abstract speculation and all the just reasoning that can be upon it is of so coarse a texture as perfectly to suit the ordinary capacities of those who are to enjoy and of those who are to defend it far from any resemblance to those propositions in geometry and metaphysics which admit no medium but must be true or false in all their latitude social and civil freedom like all other things in common life are variously mixed and modified enjoyed in very different degrees and shaped into an infinite diversity of forms according to the temper and circumstances of every community the extreme of liberty which is its abstract perfection but its real fault obtains nowhere nor ought to obtain anywhere because extremes as we all know in every point which relates either to our duties or satisfactions in life are destructive both to virtue and enjoyment   tendencies of power  when any community is subordinately connected with another the great danger of the connection is the extreme pride and selfcomplacency of the superior which in all matters of controversy will probably decide in its own favour it is a powerful corrective to such a very rational cause of fear if the inferior body can be made to believe that the party inclination or political views of several in the principal state will induce them in some degree to counteract this blind and tyrannical partiality there is no danger that any one acquiring consideration or power in the presiding state should carry this leaning to the inferior too far the fault of human nature is not of that sort power in whatever hands is rarely guilty of too strict limitations on itself but one great advantage to the support of authority attends such an amicable and protecting connection that those who have conferred favours obtain influence and from the foresight of future events can persuade men who have received obligations sometimes to return them thus by the mediation of those healing principles call them good or evil troublesome discussions are brought to some sort of adjustment and every hot controversy is not a civil war   individual good and public benefit  the individual good felt in a public benefit is comparatively so small comes round through such an involved labyrinth of intricate and tedious revolutions whilst a present personal detriment is so heavy where it falls and so instant in its operation that the cold commendation of a public advantage never was and never will be a match for the quick sensibility of a private loss and you may depend upon it sir that when many people have an interest in railing sooner or later they will bring a considerable degree of unpopularity upon any measure so that for the present at least the reformation will operate against the reformers and revenge as against them at the least will produce all the effects of corruption   public corruption  nor is it the worst effect of this unnatural contention that our laws are corrupted whilst manners remain entire they will correct the vices of law and soften it at length to their own temper but we have to lament that in most of the late proceedings we see very few traces of that generosity humanity and dignity of mind which formerly characterized this nation war suspends the rules of moral obligation and what is long suspended is in danger of being totally abrogated civil wars strike deepest of all into the manners of the people they vitiate their politics they corrupt their morals they pervert even the natural taste and relish of equity and justice by teaching us to consider our fellowcitizens in a hostile light the whole body of our nation becomes gradually less dear to us the very names of affection and kindred which were the bond of charity whilst we agreed become new incentives to hatred and rage when the communion of our country is dissolved we may flatter ourselves that we shall not fall into this misfortune but we have no charter of exemption that i know of from the ordinary frailties of our nature   cruelty and cowardice    a conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood he would feel some apprehension at being called to a tremendous account for engaging in so deep a play without any sort of knowledge of the game it is no excuse for presumptuous ignorance that it is directed by insolent passion the poorest being that crawls on earth contending to save itself from injustice and oppression is an object respectable in the eyes of god and man but i cannot conceive any existence under heaven which in the depths of its wisdom tolerates all sorts of things that is more truly odious and disgusting than an impotent helpless creature without civil wisdom or military skill without a consciousness of any other qualification for power but his servility to it bloated with pride and arrogance calling for battles which he is not to fight contending for a violent dominion which he can never exercise and satisfied to be himself mean and miserable in order to render others contemptible and wretched   bad laws produce base subserviency  bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny in such a country as this they are of all bad things the worst worse by far than anywhere else and they derive a particular malignity even from the wisdom and soundness of the rest of our institutions for very obvious reasons you cannot trust the crown with a dispensing power over any of your laws however a government be it as bad as it may will in the exercise of a discretionary power discriminate times and persons and will not ordinarily pursue any man when its own safety is not concerned a mercenary informer knows no distinction under such a system the obnoxious people are slaves not only to the government but they live at the mercy of every individual they are at once the slaves of the whole community and of every part of it and the worst and most unmerciful men are those on whose goodness they most depend  in this situation men not only shrink from the frowns of a stern magistrate but they are obliged to fly from their very species the seeds of destruction are sown in civil intercourse in social habitudes the blood of wholesome kindred is infected their tables and beds are surrounded with snares all the means given by providence to make life safe and comfortable are perverted into instruments of terror and torment this species of universal subserviency that makes the very servant who waits behind your chair the arbiter of your life and fortune has such a tendency to degrade and abase mankind and to deprive them of that assured and liberal state of mind which alone can make us what we ought to be that i vow to god i would sooner bring myself to put a man to immediate death for opinions i disliked and so to get rid of the man and his opinions at once than to fret him with a feverish being tainted with the jaildistemper of a contagious servitude to keep him above ground an animated mass of putrefaction corrupted himself and corrupting all about him   false regret  if we repent of our good actions what i pray you is left for our faults and follies it is not the beneficence of the laws it is the unnatural temper which beneficence can fret and sour that is to be lamented it is this temper which by all rational means ought to be sweetened and corrected if froward men should refuse this cure can they vitiate anything but themselves does evil so react upon good as not only to retard its motion but to change its nature if it can so operate then good men will always be in the power of the bad and virtue by a dreadful reverse of order must lie under perpetual subjection and bondage to vice   british dominion in east india    with very few and those inconsiderable intervals the british dominion either in the companys name or in the names of princes absolutely dependent upon the company extends from the mountains that separate india from tartary to cape comorinthat is oneandtwenty degrees of latitude  in the northern parts it is a solid mass of land about eight hundred miles in length and four or five hundred broad as you go southward it becomes narrower for a space it afterwards dilates but narrower or broader you possess the whole eastern and northeastern coast of that vast country quite from the borders of pegu bengal bahar and orissa with benares now unfortunately in our immediate possession measure 161978 square english miles a territory considerably larger than the whole kingdom of france oude with its dependent provinces is 53286 square miles not a great deal less than england the carnatic with tanjore and the circars is 65948 square miles very considerably larger than england and the whole of the companys dominions comprehending bombay and salsette amounts to 281412 square miles which forms a territory larger than any european dominion russia and turkey excepted through all that vast extent of country there is not a man who eats a mouthful of rice but by permission of the eastindia company  so far with regard to the extent the population of this great empire is not easily to be calculated when the countries of which it is composed came into our possession they were all eminently peopled and eminently productive though at that time considerably declined from their ancient prosperity but since they are come into our hands however if we make the period of our estimate immediately before the utter desolation of the carnatic and if we allow for the havoc which our government had even then made in these regions we cannot in my opinion rate the population at much less than thirty millions of soulsmore than four times the number of persons in the island of great britain  my next inquiry to that of the number is the quality and description of the inhabitants this multitude of men does not consist of an abject and barbarous populace much less of gangs of savages like the guaranies and chiquitos who wander on the waste borders of the river of amazons or the plate but a people for ages civilized and cultivated cultivated by all the arts of polished life whilst we were yet in the woods there have been and still the skeletons remain princes once of great dignity authority and opulence there are to be found the chiefs of tribes and nations there is to be found an ancient and venerable priesthood the depository of their laws learning and history the guides of the people whilst living and their consolation in death a nobility of great antiquity and renown a multitude of cities not exceeded in population and trade by those of the first class in europe merchants and bankers individual houses of whom have once vied in capital with the bank of england whose credit had often supported a tottering state and preserved their governments in the midst of war and desolation millions of ingenious manufacturers and mechanics millions of the most diligent and not the least intelligent tillers of the earth there are to be found almost all the religions professed by menthe brahminical the mussulman the eastern and the western christian  if i were to take the whole aggregate of our possessions there i should compare it as the nearest parallel i can find with the empire of germany our immediate possessions i should compare with the austrian dominionsand they would not suffer in the comparison the nabob of oude might stand for the king of prussia the nabob of arcot i would compare as superior in territory and equal in revenue to the elector of saxony cheyt sing the rajah of benares might well rank with the prince of hesse at least and the rajah of tanjore though hardly equal in extent of dominion superior in revenue to the elector of bavaria the polygars and the northern zemindars and other great chiefs might well class with the rest of the princes dukes counts marquises and bishops in the empire all of whom i mention to honour and surely without disparagement to any or all of those most respectable princes and grandees all this vast mass composed of so many orders and classes of men is again infinitely advocated by manners by religion by hereditary employment through all their possible combinations this renders the handling of india a matter in a high degree critical and delicate but oh it has been handled rudely indeed even some of the reformers seem to have forgot that they had anything to do but to regulate the tenants of a manor or the shopkeepers of the next county town  it is an empire of this extent of this complicated nature of this dignity and importance that i have compared to germany and the german government not for an exact resemblance but as a sort of a middle term by which india might be approximated to our understandings and if possible to our feelings in order to awaken something of sympathy for the unfortunate natives of which i am afraid we are not perfectly susceptible whilst we look at this very remote object through a false and cloudy medium   political charity  honest men will not forget either their merit or their sufferings there are men and many i trust there are who out of love to their country and their kind would torture their invention to find excuses for the mistakes of their brethren and who to stifle dissension would construe even doubtful appearances with the utmost favour such men will never persuade themselves to be ingenious and refined in discovering disaffection and treason in the manifest palpable signs of suffering loyalty persecution is so unnatural to them that they gladly snatch the very first opportunity of laying aside all the tricks and devices of penal politics and of returning home after all their irksome and vexatious wanderings to our natural family mansion to the grand social principle that unites all men in all descriptions under the shadow of an equal and impartial justice   evils of distraction  the very attempt towards pleasing everybody discovers a temper always flashy and often false and insincere therefore as i have proceeded straight onward in my conduct so i will proceed in my account of those parts of it which have been most excepted to but i must first beg leave just to hint to you that we may suffer very great detriment by being open to every talker it is not to be imagined how much of service is lost from spirits full of activity and full of energy who are pressing who are rushing forward to great and capital objects when you oblige them to be continually looking back whilst they are defending one service they defraud you of an hundred applaud us when we run console us when we fall cheer us when we recover but let us pass onfor gods sake let us pass on   charles fox    and now having done my duty to the bill let me say a word to the author i should leave him to his own noble sentiments if the unworthy and illiberal language with which he has been treated beyond all example of parliamentary liberty did not make a few words necessary not so much in justice to him as to my own feelings i must say then that it will be a distinction honourable to the age that the rescue of the greatest number of the human race that ever were so grievously oppressed from the greatest tyranny that was ever exercised has fallen to the lot of abilities and dispositions equal to the task that it has fallen to one who has the enlargement to comprehend the spirit to undertake and the eloquence to support so great a measure of hazardous benevolence his spirit is not owing to his ignorance of the state of men and things he well knows what snares are spread about his path from personal animosity from court intrigues and possibly from popular delusion but he has put to hazard his ease his security his interest his power even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he has never seen this is the road that all heroes have trod before him he is traduced and abused for his supposed motives he will remember that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true glory he will remember that it was not only in the roman customs but it is in the nature and constitution of things that calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph these thoughts will support a mind which only exists for honour under the burthen of temporary reproach he is doing indeed a great good such as rarely falls to the lot and almost as rarely coincides with the desires of any man let him use his time let him give the whole length of the reins to his benevolence he is now on a great eminence where the eyes of mankind are turned to him he may live long he may do much but here is the summit he never can exceed what he does this day  he has faults but they are faults that though they may in a small degree tarnish the lustre and sometimes impede the march of his abilities have nothing in them to extinguish the fire of great virtues in those faults there is no mixture of deceit of hypocrisy of pride of ferocity of complexional despotism or want of feeling for the distresses of mankind his are faults which might exist in a descendant of henry the fourth of france as they did exist in that father of his country henry the fourth wished that he might live to see a fowl in the pot of every peasant in his kingdom that sentiment of homely benevolence was worth all the splendid sayings that are recorded of kings but he wished perhaps for more than could be obtained and the goodness of the man exceeded the power of the king but this gentleman a subject may this day say this at least with truth that he secures the rice in his pot to every man in india a poet of antiquity thought it one of the first distinctions to a prince whom he meant to celebrate that through a long succession of generations he had been the progenitor of an able and virtuous citizen who by force of the arts of peace had corrected governments of oppression and suppressed wars of rapine      indole proh quanta juvenis quantumque daturus     ausoniae populis ventura in saecula civem     ille super gangem super exauditus et indos      implebit terras voce et furialia bella     fulmine compescet linguae  this was what was said of the predecessor of the only person to whose eloquence it does not wrong that of the mover of this bill to be compared but the ganges and the indus are the patrimony of the fame of my honourable friend and not of cicero i confess i anticipate with joy the reward of those whose whole consequence power and authority exist only for the benefit of mankind and i carry my mind to all the people and all the names and descriptions that relieved by this bill will bless the labours of this parliament and the confidence which the best house of commons has given to him who the best deserves it the little cavils of party will not be heard where freedom and happiness will be felt there is not a tongue a nation or religion in india which will not bless the presiding care and manly beneficence of this house and of him who proposes to you this great work your names will never be separated before the throne of the divine goodness in whatever language or with whatever rites pardon is asked for sin and reward for those who imitate the godhead in his universal bounty to his creatures these honours you deserve and they will surely be paid when all the jargon of influence and party and patronage are swept into oblivion   the impracticable undesirable    i know it is common for men to say that such and such things are perfectly rightvery desirable but that unfortunately they are not practicable oh no sir no those things which are not practicable are not desirable there is nothing in the world really beneficial that does not lie within the reach of an informed understanding and a welldirected pursuit there is nothing that god has judged good for us that he has not given us the means to accomplish both in the natural and the moral world if we cry like children for the moon like children we must cry on   constitution of the commons  the late house of commons has been punished for its independence that example is made have we an example on record of a house of commons punished for its servility the rewards of a senate so disposed are manifest to the world several gentlemen are very desirous of altering the constitution of the house of commons but they must alter the frame and constitution of human nature itself before they can so fashion it by any mode of election that its conduct will not be influenced by reward and punishment by fame and by disgrace if these examples take root in the minds of men what members hereafter will be bold enough not to be corrupt especially as the kings highway of obsequiousness is so very broad and easy to make a passive member of parliament no dignity of mind no principles of honour no resolution no ability no industry no learning no experience are in the least degree necessary to defend a post of importance against a powerful enemy requires an elliot a drunken invalid is qualified to hoist a white flag or to deliver up the keys of the fortress on his knees   emoluments of office  no man knows when he cuts off the incitements to a virtuous ambition and the just rewards of public service what infinite mischief he may do his country through all generations such saving to the public may prove the worst mode of robbing it the crown which has in its hands the trust of the daily pay for national service ought to have in its hands also the means for the repose of public labour and the fixed settlement of acknowledged merit there is a time when the weatherbeaten vessels of the state ought to come into harbour they must at length have a retreat from the malice of rivals from the perfidy of political friends and the inconstancy of the people many of the persons who in all times have filled the great offices of state have been younger brothers who had originally little if any fortune these offices do not furnish the means of amassing wealth there ought to be some power in the crown of granting pensions out of the reach of its own caprices an entail of dependence is a bad reward of merit   moral distinctions  those who are least anxious about your conduct are not those that love you most moderate affection and satiated enjoyment are cold and respectful but an ardent and injured passion is tempered up with wrath and grief and shame and conscious worth and the maddening sense of violated right a jealous love lights his torch from the firebrands of the furies they who call upon you to belong wholly to the people are those who wish you to return to your proper home to the sphere of your duty to the post of your honour to the mansionhouse of all genuine serene and solid satisfaction   electors and representatives    look gentlemen to the whole tenour of your members conduct try whether his ambition or his avarice have jostled him out of the straight line of duty or whether that grand foe of the offices of active life that master vice in men of business a degenerate and inglorious slothhas made him flag and languish in his course this is the object of our inquiry if our members conduct can bear this touch mark it for sterling he may have fallen into errors he must have faults but our error is greater and our fault is radically ruinous to ourselves if we do not bear if we do not even applaud the whole compound and mixed mass of such a character not to act thus is folly i had almost said it is impiety he censures god who quarrels with the imperfections of man  gentlemen we must not be peevish with those who serve the people for none will serve us whilst there is a court to serve but those who are of a nice and jealous honour they who think everything in comparison of that honour to be dust and ashes will not bear to have it soiled and impaired by those for whose sake they make a thousand sacrifices to preserve it immaculate and whole we shall either drive such men from the public stage or we shall send them to the court for protection where if they must sacrifice their reputation they will at least secure their interest depend upon it that the lovers of freedom will be free none will violate their conscience to please us in order afterwards to discharge that conscience which they have violated by doing us faithful and affectionate service if we degrade and deprave their minds by servility it will be absurd to expect that they who are creeping and abject towards us will ever be bold and incorruptible assertors of our freedom against the most seducing and the most formidable of all powers no human nature is not so formed nor shall we improve the faculties or better the morals of public men by our possession of the most infallible receipt in the world for making cheats and hypocrites  let me say with plainness i who am no longer in a public character that if by a fair by an indulgent by a gentlemanly behaviour to our representatives we do not give confidence to their minds and a liberal scope to their understandings if we do not permit our members to act upon a very enlarged view of things we shall at length infallibly degrade our national representation into a confused and scuffling bustle of local agency when the popular member is narrowed in his ideas and rendered timid in his proceedings the service of the crown will be the sole nursery of statesmen among the frolics of the court it may at length take that of attending to its business then the monopoly of mental power will be added to the power of all other kinds it possesses on the side of the people there will be nothing but impotence for ignorance is impotence narrowness of mind is impotence timidity is itself impotence and makes all other qualities that go along with it impotent and useless   popular opinion a fallacious standard  when we know that the opinions of even the greatest multitudes are the standard of rectitude i shall think myself obliged to make those opinions the masters of my conscience but if it may be doubted whether omnipotence itself is competent to alter the essential constitution of right and wrong sure i am that such things as they and i are possessed of no such power no man carries further than i do the policy of making government pleasing to the people but the widest range of this politic complaisance is confined within the limits of justice i would not only consult the interest of the people but i would cheerfully gratify their humours we are all a sort of children that must be soothed and managed i think i am not austere or formal in my nature i would bear i would even myself play my part in any innocent buffooneries to divert them but i never will act the tyrant for their amusement if they will mix malice in their sports i shall never consent to throw them any living sentient creature whatsoeverno not so much as a kitling to torment   english reformation    the condition of our nature is such that we buy our blessings at a price the reformation one of the greatest periods of human improvement was a time of trouble and confusion the vast structure of superstition and tyranny which had been for ages in rearing and which was combined with the interest of the great and of the many which was moulded into the laws the manners and civil institutions of nations and blended with the frame and policy of states could not be brought to the ground without a fearful struggle nor could it fall without a violent concussion of itself and all about it when this great revolution was attempted in a more regular mode by government it was opposed by plots and seditions of the people when by popular efforts it was repressed as a rebellion by the hand of power and bloody executions often bloodily returned marked the whole of its progress through all its stages the affairs of religion which are no longer heard of in the tumult of our present contentions made a principal ingredient in the wars and politics of that time the enthusiasm of religion threw a gloom over the politics and political interests poisoned and perverted the spirit of religion upon all sides the protestant religion in that violent struggle infected as the popish had been before by worldly interests and worldly passions became a persecutor in its turn sometimes of the new sects which carried their own principles further than it was convenient to the original reformers and always of the body from whom they parted and this persecuting spirit arose not only from the bitterness of retaliation but from the merciless policy of fear  it was long before the spirit of true piety and true wisdom involved in the principles of the reformation could be depurated from the dregs and feculence of the contention with which it was carried through however until this be done the reformation is not complete and those who think themselves good protestants from their animosity to others are in that respect no protestants at all   proscription  this way of proscribing the citizens by denominations and general descriptions dignified by the name of reason of state and security for constitutions and commonwealths is nothing better at bottom than the miserable invention of an ungenerous ambition which would fain hold the sacred trust of power without any of the virtues or any of the energies that give a title to it a receipt of policy made up of a detestable compound of malice cowardice and sloth they would govern men against their will but in that government they would be discharged from the exercise of vigilance providence and fortitude and therefore that they may sleep on their watch they consent to take some one division of the society into partnership of the tyranny over the rest but let government in what form it may be comprehend the whole in its justice and restrain the suspicious by its vigilance let it keep watch and ward let it discover by its sagacity and punish by its firmness all delinquency against its power whenever delinquency exists in the overt acts and then it will be as safe as ever god and nature intended it should be crimes are the acts of individuals and not of denominations and therefore arbitrarily to class men under general descriptions in order to proscribe and punish them in the lump for a presumed delinquency of which perhaps but a part perhaps none at all are guilty is indeed a compendious method and saves a world of trouble about proof but such a method instead of being law is an act of unnatural rebellion against the legal dominion of reason and justice and this vice in any constitution that entertains it at one time or other will certainly bring on its ruin   just freedom    i must fairly tell you that so far as my principles are concerned principles that i hope will only depart with my last breath i have no idea of a liberty unconnected with honesty and justice nor do i believe that any good constitutions of government or of freedom can find it necessary for their security to doom any part of the people to a permanent slavery such a constitution of freedom if such can be is in effect no more than another name for the tyranny of the strongest faction and factions in republics have been and are full as capable as monarchs of the most cruel oppression and injustice it is but too true that the love and even the very idea of genuine liberty is extremely rare it is but too true that there are many whose whole scheme of freedom is made up of pride perverseness and insolence they feel themselves in a state of thraldom they imagine that their souls are cooped and cabined in unless they have some man or some body of men dependent on their mercy the desire of having some one below them descends to those who are the very lowest of alland a protestant cobbler debased by his poverty but exalted by his share of the ruling church feels a pride in knowing it is by his generosity alone that the peer whose footmans instep he measures is able to keep his chaplain from a gaol   englands embassy to america  they enter the capital of america only to abandon it and these assertors and representatives of the dignity of england at the tail of a flying army let fly their parthian shafts of memorials and remonstrances at random behind them their promises and their offers their flatteries and their menaces were all despised and we were saved from the disgrace of their formal reception only because the congress scorned to receive them whilst the statehouse of independent philadelphia opened her doors to the public entry of the ambassador of france from war and blood we went to submission and from submission plunged back again to war and blood to desolate and be desolated without measure hope or end i am a royalist i blushed for this degradation of the crown i am a whig i blushed for the dishonour of parliament i am a true englishman i felt to the quick for the disgrace of england i am a man i felt for the melancholy reverse of human affairs in the fall of the first power in the world   howard the philanthropist  i cannot name this gentleman without remarking that his labours and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind he has visited all europenot to survey the sumptuousness of palaces or the stateliness of temples not to make accurate measurements of the remains of ancient grandeur nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art not to collect medals or collate manuscriptsbut to dive into the depths of dungeons to plunge into the infection of hospitals to survey the mansions of sorrow and pain to take the gauge and dimensions of misery depression and contempt to remember the forgotten to attend to the neglected to visit the forsaken and to compare and collate the distresses of all men in all countries his plan is original and is as full of genius as it is of humanity it was a voyage of discovery a circumnavigation of charity already the benefit of his labour is felt more or less in every country i hope he will anticipate his final reward by seeing all its effects fully realized in his own he will receive not by detail but in gross the reward of those who visit the prisoner and he has so forestalled and monopolized this branch of charity that there will be i trust little room to merit by such acts of benevolence hereafter   parliamentary retrospect    it is certainly not pleasing to be put out of the public service but i wish to be a member of parliament to have my share of doing good and resisting evil it would therefore be absurd to renounce my objects in order to obtain my seat i deceive myself indeed most grossly if i had not much rather pass the remainder of my life hidden in the recesses of the deepest obscurity feeding my mind even with the visions and imaginations of such things than to be placed on the most splendid throne of the universe tantalized with a denial of the practice of all which can make the greatest situation any other than the greatest curse gentlemen i have had my day i can never sufficiently express my gratitude to you for having set me in a place wherein i could lend the slightest help to great and laudable designs if i have had my share in any measure giving quiet to private property and private conscience if by my vote i have aided in securing to families the best possession peace if i have joined in reconciling kings to their subjects and subjects to their prince if i have assisted to loosen the foreign holdings of the citizen and taught him to look for his protection to the laws of his country and for his comfort to the goodwill of his countrymenif i have thus taken my part with the best of men in the best of their actions i can shut the booki might wish to read a page or two morebut this is enough for my measurei have not lived in vain   people and parliament  let the commons in parliament assembled be one and the same thing with the commons at large the distinctions that are made to separate us are unnatural and wicked contrivances let us identify let us incorporate ourselves with the people let us cut all the cables and snap the chains which tie us to an unfaithful shore and enter the friendly harbour that shoots far out into the main its moles and jettees to receive uswar with the world and peace with our constituents be this our motto and our principle then indeed we shall be truly great respecting ourselves we shall be respected by the world at present all is troubled and cloudy and distracted and full of anger and turbulence both abroad and at home but the air may be cleared by this storm and light and fertility may follow it let us give a faithful pledge to the people that we honour indeed the crown but that we belong to them that we are their auxiliaries and not their taskmastersthe fellowlabourers in the same vineyardnot lording over their rights but helpers of their joy that to tax them is a grievance to ourselves but to cut off from our enjoyments to forward theirs is the highest gratification we are capable of receiving   reformed civil list  as things now stand every man in proportion to his consequence at court tends to add to the expense of the civil list by all manner of jobs if not for himself yet for his dependents when the new plan is established those who are now suitors for jobs will become the most strenuous opposers of them they will have a common interest with the minister in public economy every class as it stands low will become security for the payment of the preceding class and thus the persons whose insignificant services defraud those that are useful would then become interested in their payment then the powerful instead of oppressing would be obliged to support the weak and idleness would become concerned in the reward of industry the whole fabric of the civil economy would become compact and connected in all its parts it would be formed into a wellorganized body where every member contributes to the support of the whole and where even the lazy stomach secures the vigour of the active arm   french and english revolution  he felt some concern that this strange thing called a revolution in france should be compared with the glorious event commonly called the revolution in england and the conduct of the soldiery on that occasion compared with the behaviour of some of the troops of france in the present instance at that period the prince of orange a prince of the bloodroyal in england was called in by the flower of the english aristocracy to defend its ancient constitution and not to level all distinctions to this prince so invited the aristocratic leaders who commanded the troops went over with their several corps in bodies to the deliverer of their country aristocratic leaders brought up the corps of citizens who newly enlisted in this cause military obedience changed its object but military discipline was not for a moment interrupted in its principle the troops were ready for war but indisposed to mutiny but as the conduct of the english armies was different so was that of the whole english nation at that time in truth the circumstances of our revolution as it is called and that of france are just the reverse of each other in almost every particular and in the whole spirit of the transaction with us it was the case of a legal monarch attempting arbitrary powerin france it is the case of an arbitrary monarch beginning from whatever cause to legalize his authority the one was to be resisted the other was to be managed and directed but in neither case was the order of the state to be changed lest government might be ruined which ought only to be corrected and legalized with us we got rid of the man and preserved the constituent parts of the state there they get rid of the constituent parts of the state and keep the man what we did was in truth and substance and in a constitutional light a revolution not made but prevented we took solid securities we settled doubtful questions we corrected anomalies in our law in the stable fundamental parts of our constitution we made no revolution no nor any alteration at all we did not impair the monarchy perhaps it might be shown that we strengthened it very considerably the nation kept the same ranks the same orders the same privileges the same franchises the same rules for property the same subordinations the same order in the law in the revenue and in the magistracy the same lords the same commons the same corporations the same electors  the church was not impaired her estates her majesty her splendour her orders and gradations continued the same she was preserved in her full efficiency and cleared only of a certain intolerance which was her weakness and disgrace the church and the state were the same after the revolution that they were before but better secured in every part  was little done because a revolution was not made in the constitution no everything was done because we commenced with reparation not with ruin accordingly the state flourished instead of laying as dead in a sort of trance or exposed as some others in an epileptic fit to the pity or derision of the world for her wild ridiculous convulsive movements impotent to every purpose but that of dashing out her brains against the pavement great britain rose above the standard even of her former self an era of a more improved domestic prosperity then commenced and still continues not only unimpaired but growing under the wasting hand of time all the energies of the country were awakened england never preserved a firmer countenance nor a more vigorous arm to all her enemies and to all her rivals europe under her respired and revived everywhere she appeared as the protector assertor or avenger of liberty a war was made and supported against fortune itself the treaty of ryswick which first limited the power of france was soon after made the grand alliance very shortly followed which shook to the foundations the dreadful power which menaced the independence of mankind the states of europe lay happy under the shade of a great and free monarchy which knew how to be great without endangering its own peace at home or the internal or external peace of any of its neighbours   armed discipline  he knew too well and he felt as much as any man how difficult it was to accommodate a standing army to a free constitution or to any constitution an armed disciplined body is in its essence dangerous to liberty undisciplined it is ruinous to society its component parts are in the latter case neither good citizens nor good soldiers what have they thought of in france under such a difficulty as almost puts the human faculties to a stand they have put their army under such a variety of principles of duty that it is more likely to breed litigants pettifoggers and mutineers than soldiers they have set up to balance their crown army another army deriving under another authority called a municipal armya balance of armies not of orders these latter they have destroyed with every mark of insult and oppression states may and they will best exist with a partition of civil powers armies cannot exist under a divided command this state of things he thought in effect a state of war or at best but a truce instead of peace in the country   gilded despotism  in the last century louis the fourteenth had established a greater and better disciplined military force than ever had been before seen in europe and with it a perfect despotism though that despotism was proudly arrayed in manners gallantry splendour magnificence and even covered over with the imposing robes of science literature and arts it was in government nothing better than a painted and gilded tyranny in religion a hard stern intolerance the fit companion and auxiliary to the despotic tyranny which prevailed in its government the same character of despotism insinuated itself into every court of europe the same spirit of disproportioned magnificencethe same love of standing armies above the ability of the people in particular our then sovereigns king charles and king james fell in love with the government of their neighbour so flattering to the pride of kings a similarity of sentiments brought on connections equally dangerous to the interests and liberties of their country it were well that the infection had gone no farther than the throne the admiration of a government flourishing and successful unchecked in its operations and seeming therefore to compass its objects more speedily and effectually gained something upon all ranks of people the good patriots of that day however struggled against it they sought nothing more anxiously than to break off all communication with france and to be get a total alienation from its councils and its example which by the animosity prevalent between the abettors of their religious system and the assertors of ours was in some degree effected   our french dangers  in the last age we were in danger of being entangled by the example of france in the net of a relentless despotism it is not necessary to say anything upon that example it exists no longer our present danger from the example of a people whose character knows no medium is with regard to government a danger from anarchy a danger of being led through an admiration of successful fraud and violence to an imitation of the excesses of an irrational unprincipled proscribing confiscating plundering ferocious bloody and tyrannical democracy on the side of religion the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance but from atheism a foul unnatural vice foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind which seems in france for a long time to have been embodied into a faction accredited and almost avowed   sir george saville  when an act of great and signal humanity was to be done and done with all the weight and authority that belonged to it the world would cast its eyes upon none but him i hope that few things which have a tendency to bless or to adorn life have wholly escaped my observation in my passage through it i have sought the acquaintance of that gentleman and have seen him in all situations he is a true genius with an understanding vigorous and acute and refined and distinguishing even to excess and illuminated with a most unbounded peculiar and original cast of imagination with these he possesses many external and instrumental advantages and he makes use of them all his fortune is among the largest a fortune which wholly unincumbered as it is with one single charge from luxury vanity or excess sinks under the benevolence of its dispenser this private benevolence expanding itself into patriotism renders his whole being the estate of the public in which he has not reserved a peculium for himself of profit diversion or relaxation during the session the first in and the last out of the house of commons he passes from the senate to the camp and seldom seeing the seat of his ancestors he is always in the senate to serve his country or in the field to defend it   corruption not selfreformed    those who would commit the reformation of india to the destroyers of it are the enemies to that reformation they would make a distinction between directors and proprietors which in the present state of things does not cannot exist but a right honourable gentleman says he would keep the present government of india in the court of directors and would to curb them provide salutary regulationswonderful that is he would appoint the old offenders to correct the old offences and he would render the vicious and the foolish wise and virtuous by salutary regulations he would appoint the wolf as guardian of the sheep but he has invented a curious muzzle by which this protecting wolf shall not be able to open his jaws above an inch or two at the utmost thus his work is finished but i tell the right honourable gentleman that controlled depravity is not innocence and that it is not the labour of delinquency in chains that will correct abuses will these gentlemen of the direction animadvert on the partners of their own guilt never did a serious plan of amending any old tyrannical establishment propose the authors and abettors of the abuses as the reformers of them   the bribed and the bribers  if i am to speak my private sentiments i think that in a thousand cases for one it would be far less mischievous to the public and full as little dishonourable to themselves to be polluted with direct bribery than thus to become a standing auxiliary to the oppression usury and peculation of multitudes in order to obtain a corrupt support to their power it is by bribing not so often by being bribed that wicked politicians bring ruin on mankind avarice is a rival to the pursuits of many it finds a multitude of checks and many opposers in every walk of life but the objects of ambition are for the few and every person who aims at indirect profit and therefore wants other protection than innocence and law instead of its rival becomes its instrument there is a natural allegiance and fealty do you to this domineering paramount evil from all the vassal vices which acknowledge its superiority and readily militate under its banners and it is under that discipline alone that avarice is able to spread to any considerable extent or to render itself a general public mischief   hyder ali  when at length hyder ali found that he had to do with men who either would sign no convention or whom no treaty and no signature could bind and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself he decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind he resolved in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things to leave the whole carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection he became at length so confident of his force so collected in his might that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of the nabob of arcot he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction and compounding all the materials of fury havoc and desolation into one black cloud he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the carnatic then ensued a scene of woe the like of which no eye had seen no heart conceived and which no tongue can adequately tell all the horrors of war before known or heard of were mercy to that new havoc a storm of universal fire blasted every field consumed every house destroyed every temple the miserable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages in part were slaughtered others without regard to sex to age to the respect of rank or sacredness of function fathers torn from children husbands from wives enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry and amidst the goading spears of drivers and the trampling of pursuing horses were swept into captivity in an unknown and hostile land those who were able to evade the tempest fled to the walled cities but escaping from fire sword and exile they fell into the jaws of famine  the alms of the settlement in this dreadful exigency were certainly liberal and all was done by charity that private charity could do but it was a people in beggary it was a nation which stretched out its hands for food for months together these creatures of sufferance whose very excess and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of our austerest fasts silent patient resigned without sedition or disturbance almost without complaint perished by an hundred a day in the streets of madras every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the streets or on the glacis of tanjore and expired of famine in the granary of india i was going to awake your justice towards this unhappy part of our fellowcitizens by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this plague of hunger of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of man this comes the nearest to our heart and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is but i find myself unable to manage it with decorum these details are of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the hearers they are so humiliating to human nature itself that on better thoughts i think it more advisable to throw a pall over this hideous object and to leave it to your general conceptions   reformation and anarchy contrasted and compared  that the house must perceive from his coming forward to mark an expression or two of his best friend how anxious he was to keep the distemper of france from the least countenance in england where he was sure some wicked persons had shown a strong disposition to recommend an imitation of the french spirit of reform he was so strongly opposed to any the least tendency towards the means of introducing a democracy like theirs as well as to the end itself that much as it would afflict him if such a thing could be attempted and that any friend of his could concur in such measures he was far very far from believing they could he would abandon his best friends and join with his worst enemies to oppose either the means or the end and to resist all violent exertions of the spirit of innovation so distant from all principles of true and safe reformation a spirit well calculated to overturn states but perfectly unfit to amend them  that he was no enemy to reformation almost every business in which he was much concerned from the first day he sat in that house to that hour was a business of reformation and when he had not been employed in correcting he had been employed in resisting abuses some traces of this spirit in him now stand on their statutebook in his opinion anything which unnecessarily tore to pieces the contexture of the state not only prevented all real reformation but introduced evils which would call but perhaps call in vain for new reformation  that he thought the french nation very unwise what they valued themselves on was a disgrace to them they had gloried and some people in england had thought fit to take share in that glory in making a revolution as if revolutions were good things in themselves all the horrors and all the crimes of the anarchy which led to their revolution which attend its progress and which may virtually attend it in its establishment pass for nothing with the lovers of revolutions the french have made their way through the destruction of their country to a bad constitution when they were absolutely in possession of a good one they were in possession of it the day the states met in separate orders their business had they been either virtuous or wise or had they been left to their own judgment was to secure the stability and independence of the states according to those orders under the monarch on the throne it was then their duty to redress grievances  instead of redressing grievances and improving the fabric of their state to which they were called by their monarch and sent by their country they were made to take a very different course they first destroyed all the balances and counterpoises which serve to fix the state and to give it a steady direction and which furnish sure correctives to any violent spirit which may prevail in any of the orders these balances existed in their oldest constitution and in the constitution of this country and in the constitution of all the countries in europe these they rashly destroyed and then they melted down the whole into one incongruous illconnected mass  when they had done this they instantly and with the most atrocious perfidy and breach of all faith among men laid the axe to the root of all property and consequently of all national prosperity by the principles they established and the example they set in confiscating all the possessions of the church they made and recorded a sort of institute and digest of anarchy called the rights of man in such a pedantic abuse of elementary principles as would have disgraced boys at school but this declaration of rights was worse than trifling and pedantic in them as by their name and authority they systematically destroyed every hold of authority by opinion religious or civil on the minds of the people by this mad declaration they subverted the state and brought on such calamities as no country without a long war has ever been known to suffer and which may in the end produce such a war and perhaps many such  with them the question was not between despotism and liberty the sacrifice they made of the peace and power of their country was not made on the altar of freedom freedom and a better security for freedom than that they have taken they might have had without any sacrifice at all they brought themselves into all the calamities they suffer not that through them they might obtain a british constitution they plunged themselves headlong into those calamities to prevent themselves from settling into that constitution or into anything resembling it   confidence and jealousy  confidence might become a vice and jealousy a virtue according to circumstances that confidence of all public virtues was the most dangerous and jealousy in a house of commons of all public vices the most tolerable especially where the number and the charge of standing armies in time of peace was the question   economy of injustice  strange as this scheme of conduct in ministry is and inconsistent with all just policy it is still true to itself and faithful to its own perverted order those who are bountiful to crimes will be rigid to merit and penurious to service their penury is even held out as a blind and cover to their prodigality the economy of injustice is to furnish resources for the fund of corruption then they pay off their protection to great crimes and great criminals by being inexorable to the paltry frailties of little men and these modern flagellants are sure with a rigid fidelity to whip their own enormities on the vicarious back of every small offender   subsistence and revenue    the benefits of heaven to any community ought never to be connected with political arrangements or made to depend on the personal conduct of princes in which the mistake or error or neglect or distress or passion of a moment on either side may bring famine on millions and ruin an innocent nation perhaps for ages the means of the subsistence of mankind should be as immutable as the laws of nature let power and dominion take what course they may   authority and venality  it is difficult for the most wise and upright government to correct the abuses of remote delegated power productive of unmeasured wealth and protected by the boldness and strength of the same illgot riches these abuses full of their own wild native vigour will grow and flourish under mere neglect but where the supreme authority not content with winking at the rapacity of its inferior instruments is so shameless and corrupt as openly to give bounties and premiums for disobedience to its laws when it will not trust to the activity of avarice in the pursuit of its own gains when it secures public robbery by all the careful jealousy and attention with which it ought to protect property from such violence the commonwealth then is become totally perverted from its purposes neither god nor man will long endure it nor will it long endure itself in that case there is an unnatural infection a pestilential taint fermenting in the constitution of society which fever and convulsions of some kind or other must throw off or in which the vital powers worsted in an unequal struggle are pushed back upon themselves and by a reversal of their whole functions fester to gangrene to death and instead of what was but just now the delight and boast of the creation there will be cast out in the face of the sun a bloated putrid noisome carcass full of stench and poison an offence a horror a lesson to the world   prerogative of the crown and privilege of parliament  it is the undoubted prerogative of the crown to dissolve parliament but we beg leave to lay before his majesty that it is of all the trusts vested in his majesty the most critical and delicate and that in which this house has the most reason to require not only the good faith but the favour of the crown his commons are not always upon a par with his ministers in an application to popular judgment it is not in the power of the members of this house to go to their election at the moment the most favourable to them it is in the power of the crown to choose a time for their dissolution whilst great and arduous matters of state and legislation are depending which may be easily misunderstood and which cannot be fully explained before that misunderstanding may prove fatal to the honour that belongs and to the consideration that is due to members of parliament with his majesty is the gift of all the rewards the honours distinctions favour and graces of the state with his majesty is the mitigation of all the rigours of the law and we rejoice to see the crown possessed of trusts calculated to obtain goodwill and charged with duties which are popular and pleasing our trusts are of a different kind our duties are harsh and invidious in their nature and justice and safety is all we can expect in the exercise of them we are to offer salutary which is not always pleasing counsel we are to inquire and to accuse and the objects of our inquiry and charge will be for the most part persons of wealth power and extensive connections we are to make rigid laws for the preservation of revenue which of necessity more or less confine some action or restrain some function which before was free what is the most critical and invidious of all the whole body of the public impositions originate from us and the hand of the house of commons is seen and felt in every burthen that presses on the people whilst ultimately we are serving them and in the first instance whilst we are serving his majesty it will be hard indeed if we should see a house of commons the victim of its zeal and fidelity sacrificed by his ministers to those very popular discontents which shall be excited by our dutiful endeavours for the security and greatness of his throne no other consequence can result from such an example but that in future the house of commons consulting its safety at the expense of its duties and suffering the whole energy of the state to be relaxed will shrink from every service which however necessary is of a great and arduous nature or that willing to provide for the public necessities and at the same time to secure the means of performing that task they will exchange independence for protection and will court a subservient existence through the favour of those ministers of state or those secret advisers who ought themselves to stand in awe of the commons of this realm  a house of commons respected by his ministers is essential to his majestys service it is fit that they should yield to parliament and not that parliament should be new modelled until it is fitted to their purposes if our authority is only to be held up when we coincide in opinion with his majestys advisers but is to be set at nought the moment it differs from them the house of commons will sink into a mere appendage of administration and will lose that independent character which inseparably connecting the honour and reputation with the acts of this house enables us to afford a real effective and substantial support to his government it is the deference shown to our opinion when we dissent from the servants of the crown which alone can give authority to the proceedings of this house when it concurs with their measures  that authority once lost the credit of his majestys crown will be impaired in the eyes of all nations foreign powers who may yet wish to revive a friendly intercourse with this nation will look in vain for that hold which gave a connection with great britain the preference to an alliance with any other state a house of commons of which ministers were known to stand in awe where everything was necessarily discussed on principles fit to be openly and publicly avowed and which could not be retracted or varied without danger furnished a ground of confidence in the public faith which the engagement of no state dependent on the fluctuation of personal favour and private advice can ever pretend to if faith with the house of commons the grand security for the national faith itself can be broken with impunity a wound is given to the political importance of great britain which will not easily be healed   burke and fox  his confidence in mr fox was such and so ample as to be almost implicit that he was not ashamed to avow that degree of docility that when the choice is well made it strengthens instead of oppressing our intellect that he who calls in the aid of an equal understanding doubles his own he who profits of a superior understanding raises his powers to a level with the height of the superior understanding he unites with he had found the benefit of such a junction and would not lightly depart from it he wished almost on all occasions that his sentiments were understood to be conveyed in mr foxs words and he wished as amongst the greatest benefits he could wish the country an eminent share of power to that right honourable gentleman because he knew that to his great and masterly understanding he had joined the greatest possible degree of that natural moderation which is the best corrective of power that he was of the most artless candid open and benevolent disposition disinterested in the extreme of a temper mild and placable even to a fault without one drop of gall in his whole constitution   peers and commons    the commons have the deepest interest in the purity and integrity of the peerage the peers dispose of all the property in the kingdom in the last resort and they dispose of it on their honour and not on their oaths as all the members of every other tribunal in the kingdom must do though in them the proceeding is not conclusive we have therefore a right to demand that no application shall be made to peers of such a nature as may give room to call in question much less to attaint our sole security for all that we possess this corrupt proceeding appeared to the house of commons who are the natural guardians of the purity of parliament and of the purity of every branch of judicature a most reprehensible and dangerous practice tending to shake the very foundation of the authority of the house of peers and they branded it as such by their resolution   natural selfdestruction  the french had shown themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world in that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground their monarchy their church their nobility their law their revenue their army their navy their commerce their arts and their manufactures they had done their business for us as rivals in a way in which twenty ramilies or blenheims could never have done it were we absolute conquerors and france to lie prostrate at our feet we should be ashamed to send a commission to settle their affairs which could impose so hard a law upon the french and so destructive of all their consequence as a nation as that they had imposed on themselves   the carnatic  the carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to england figure to yourself mr speaker the land in whose representative chair you sit figure to yourself the form and fashion of your sweet and cheerful country from thames to trent north and south and from the irish to the german sea east and west emptied and embowelled may god avert the omen of our crimes by so accomplished a desolation extend your imagination a little further and then suppose your ministers taking a survey of this scene of waste and desolation what would be your thoughts if you should be informed that they were computing how much had been the amount of the excises how much the customs how much the land and malttax in order that they should charge take it in the most favourable light for public service upon the relics of the satiated vengeance of relentless enemies the whole of what england had yielded in the most exuberant seasons of peace and abundance what would you call it to call it tyranny sublimed into madness would be too faint an image yet this very madness is the principle upon which the ministers at your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues of the carnatic when they were providing not supply for the establishments of its protection but rewards for the authors of its ruin  every day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant the carnatic is a country that will soon recover and become instantly as prosperous as ever they think they are talking to innocents who will believe that by sowing of dragons teeth men may come up ready grown and ready armed they who will give themselves the trouble of considering for it requires no great reach of thought no very profound knowledge the manner in which mankind are increased and countries cultivated will regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded in order that the people after a long period of vexation and plunder may be in a condition to maintain government government must begin by maintaining them here the road to economy lies not through receipt but through expense and in that country nature has given no short cut to your object men must propagate like other animals by the mouth never did oppression light the nuptial torch never did extortion and usury spread out the genial bed does any one of you think that england so wasted would under such a nursing attendance so rapidly and cheaply recover but he is meanly acquainted with either england or india who does not know that england would a thousand times sooner resume population fertility and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from bothrevenue than such a country as the carnatic the carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile soil the general size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise it is some days since i moved that a curious and interesting map kept in the india house should be laid before you the india house is not yet in readiness to send it i have therefore brought down my own copy and there it lies for the use of any gentleman who may think such a matter worthy of his attention it is indeed a noble map and of noble things but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine speculations of avarice run mad in addition to what you know must be the case in every part of the world the necessity of a previous provision of habitation seed stock capital that map will show you that the uses of the influences of heaven itself are in that country a work of art the carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or running streams and it has rain only at a season but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command this is the national bank of the carnatic on which it must have a perpetual credit or it perishes irretrievably for that reason in the happier times of india a number almost incredible of reservoirs have been made in chosen places throughout the whole country they are formed for the greater part of mounds of earth and stones with sluices of solid masonry the whole constructed with admirable skill and labour and maintained at a mighty charge in the territory contained in that map alone i have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit from these reservoirs currents are occasionally drawn over the fields and these watercourses again call for a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly leveled taking the district in that map as a measure there cannot be in the carnatic and tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs of the larger and middling dimensions to say nothing of those for domestic services and the uses of religious purification these are not the enterprises of your power nor in a style of magnificence suited to the taste of your minister these are the monuments of real kings who were the fathers of their people testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own these were the grand sepulchres built by ambition but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence which not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life had strained with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations the guardians the protectors the nourishers of mankind   abstract theory of human liberty  i love a manly moral regulated liberty as well as any gentleman of that society be he who he will and perhaps i have given as good proofs of my attachment to that cause in the whole course of my public conduct i think i envy liberty as little as they do to any other nation but i cannot stand forward and give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions and human concerns on a simple view of the object as it stands stripped of every relation in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction circumstances which with some gentlemen pass for nothing give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour and discriminating effect the circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind abstractedly speaking government as well as liberty is good yet could i in common sense ten years ago have felicitated france on her enjoyment of a government for she then had a government without inquiry what the nature of that government was or how it was administered can i now congratulate the same nation upon its freedom is it because liberty in the abstract may be classed amongst the blessings of mankind that i am seriously to felicitate a madman who has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome darkness of his cell on his restoration to the enjoyment of light and liberty am i to congratulate a highwayman and murderer who has broken prison upon the recovery of his natural rights this would be to act over again the scene of the criminals condemned to the galleys and their heroic deliverer the metaphysic knight of the sorrowful countenance when i see the spirit of liberty in action i see a strong principle at work and this for a while is all i can possibly know of it the wild gas the fixed air is plainly broke loose but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subsided till the liquor is cleared and until we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface i must be tolerably sure before i venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing that they have really received one flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver and adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings i should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of france until i was informed how it had been combined with government with public force with the discipline and obedience of armies with the collection of an effective and welldistributed revenue with morality and religion with solidity and property with peace and order with civil and social manners all these in their way are good things too and without them liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts and is not likely to continue long the effect of liberty to individuals is that they may do what they please we ought to see what it will please them to do before we risk congratulations which may be soon turned into complaints prudence would dictate this in the case of separate insulated private men but liberty when men act in bodies is power considerate people before they declare themselves will observe the use which is made of power and particularly of so trying a thing as new power in new persons of whose principles tempers and dispositions they have little or no experience and in situations where those who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be the real movers   politics and the pulpit  supposing however that something like moderation were visible in this political sermon yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement no sound ought to be heard in the church but the healing voice of christian charity the cause of civil liberty and civil government gains as little as that of religion by this confusion of duties those who quit their proper character to assume what does not belong to them are for the greater part ignorant both of the character they leave and of the character they assume wholly unacquainted with the world in which they are so fond of meddling and inexperienced in all its affairs on which they pronounce with so much confidence they have nothing of politics but the passions they excite surely the church is a place where one days truce ought to be allowed to the dissensions and animosities of mankind   idea of french revolution  it appears to me as if i were in a great crisis not of the affairs of france alone but of all europe perhaps of more than europe all circumstances taken together the french revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world the most wonderful things are brought about in many instances by means the most absurd and ridiculous in the most ridiculous modes and apparently by the most contemptible instruments everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity and of all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies in viewing this monstrous tragicomic scene the most opposite passions necessarily succeed and sometimes mix with each other in the mind alternate contempt and indignation alternate laughter and tears alternate scorn and horror   patriotic distinction    i certainly have the honour to belong to more clubs than one in which the constitution of this kingdom and the principles of the glorious revolution are held in high reverence and i reckon myself among the most forward in my zeal for maintaining that constitution and those principles in their utmost purity and vigour it is because i do so that i think it necessary for me that there should be no mistake those who cultivate the memory of our revolution and those who are attached to the constitution of this kingdom will take good care how they are involved with persons who under the pretext of zeal towards the revolution and constitution too frequently wander from their true principles and are ready on every occasion to depart from the firm but cautious and deliberate spirit which produced the one and which presides in the other   kingly power not based on popular choice  according to this spiritual doctor of politics if his majesty does not owe his crown to the choice of his people he is no lawful king now nothing can be more untrue than that the crown of this kingdom is so held by his majesty therefore if you follow their rule the king of great britain who most certainly does not owe his high office to any form of popular election is in no respect better than the rest of the gang of usurpers who reign or rather rob all over the face of this our miserable world without any sort of right or title to the allegiance of their people the policy of this general doctrine so qualified is evident enough the propagators of this political gospel are in hopes that their abstract principle their principle that a popular choice is necessary to the legal existence of the sovereign magistracy would be overlooked whilst the king of great britain was not affected by it in the mean time the ears of their congregations would be gradually habituated to it as if it were a first principle admitted without dispute for the present it would only operate as a theory pickled in the preserving juices of pulpit eloquence and laid by for future use condo et compono quae mox depromere possim by this policy whilst our government is soothed with a reservation in its favour to which it has no claim the security which it has in common with all governments so far as opinion is security is taken away  thus these politicians proceed whilst little notice is taken of their doctrines but when they come to be examined upon the plain meaning of their words and the direct tendency of their doctrines then equivocations and slippery construction come into play when they say the king owes his crown to the choice of his people and is therefore the only lawful sovereign in the world they will perhaps tell us they mean to say no more than that some of the kings predecessors have been called to the throne by some sort of choice and therefore he owes his crown to the choice of his people thus by a miserable subterfuge they hope to render their proposition safe by rendering it nugatory they are welcome to the asylum they seek for their offence since they take refuge in their folly for if you admit this interpretation how does their idea of election differ from our idea of inheritance and how does the settlement of the crown in the brunswick line derived from james i come to legalize our monarchy rather than that of any of the neighbouring countries at some time or other to be sure all the beginners of dynasties were chosen by those who called them to govern there is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of europe were at a remote period elective with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice but whatever kings might have been here or elsewhere a thousand years ago or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of england or france may have begun the king of great britain is at this day king by a fixed rule of succession according to the laws of his country and whilst the legal conditions of the compact of sovereignty are performed by him as they are performed he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the revolution society who have not a single vote for a king amongst them either individually or collectively though i make no doubt they would soon erect themselves into an electoral college if things were ripe to give effect to their claim his majestys heirs and successors each in his time and order will come to the crown with the same contempt of their choice with which his majesty has succeeded to that he wears  whatever may be the success of evasion in explaining away the gross error of fact which supposes that his majesty though he holds it in concurrence with the wishes owes his crown to the choice of his people yet nothing can evade their full explicit declaration concerning the principle of a right in the people to choose which right is directly maintained and tenaciously adhered to all the oblique insinuations concerning election bottom in this proposition and are referable to it lest the foundation of the kings exclusive legal title should pass for a mere rant of adulatory freedom the political divine proceeds dogmatically to assert that by the principles of the revolution the people of england have acquired three fundamental rights all of which with him compose one system and lie together in one short sentence namely that we have acquired a right  1 to choose our own governors  2 to cashier them for misconduct  3 to frame a government for ourselves  this new and hitherto unheard of bill of rights though made in the name of the whole people belongs to those gentlemen and their faction only the body of the people of england have no share in it they utterly disclaim it they will resist the practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes they are bound to do so by the laws of their country made at the time of that very revolution which is appealed to in favour of the fictitious rights claimed by the society which abuses its name   preaching democracy of dissent  if the noble seekers should find nothing to satisfy their pious fancies in the old staple of the national church or in all the rich variety to be found in the wellassorted warehouses of the dissenting congregations dr price advises them to improve upon nonconformity and to set up each of them a separate meetinghouse upon his own particular principles it is somewhat remarkable that this reverend divine should be so earnest for setting up new churches and so perfectly indifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them his zeal is of a curious character it is not for the propagation of his own opinions but of any opinions it is not for the diffusion of truth but for the spreading of contradiction let the noble teachers but dissent it is no matter from whom or from what this great point once secured it is taken for granted their religion will be rational and manly i doubt whether religion would reap all the benefits which the calculating divine computes from this great company of great preachers it would certainly be a valuable addition of nondescripts to the ample collection of known classes genera and species which at present beautify the hortus siccus of dissent a sermon from a noble duke or a noble marquis or a noble earl or baron bold would certainly increase and diversify the amusements of this town which begins to grow satiated with the uniform round of its vapid dissipations i should only stipulate that these new messjohns in robes and coronets should keep some sort of bounds in the democratic and levelling principles which are expected from their titled pulpits the new evangelists will i dare say disappoint the hopes that are conceived of them they will not become literally as well as figuratively polemic divines nor be disposed so to drill their congregations that they may as in former blessed times preach their doctrines to regiments of dragoons and corps of infantry and artillery such arrangements however favourable to the cause of compulsory freedom civil and religious may not be equally conducive to the national tranquillity these few restrictions i hope are no great stretches of intolerance no very violent exertions of despotism   jargon of republicanism    dr price in this sermon condemns very properly the practice of gross adulatory addresses to kings instead of this fulsome style he proposes that his majesty should be told on occasions of congratulation that he is to consider himself as more properly the servant than the sovereign of his people for a compliment this new form of address does not seem to be very soothing  those who are servants in name as well as in effect do not like to be told of their situation their duty and their obligations the slave in the old play tells his master haec commemoratio est quasi exprobatio it is not pleasant as compliment it is not wholesome as instruction after all if the king were to bring himself to echo this new kind of address to adopt it in terms and even to take the appellation of servant of the people as his royal style how either he or we should be much mended by it i cannot imagine i have seen very assuming letters signed your most obedient humble servant the proudest denomination that ever was endured on earth took a title of still greater humility than that which is now proposed for sovereigns by the apostle of liberty kings and nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling himself the servant of servants and mandates for deposing sovereigns were sealed with the signet of the fisherman  i should have considered all this as no more than a sort of flippant vain discourse in which as in an unsavoury fume several persons suffer the spirit of liberty to evaporate if it were not plainly in support of the idea and a part of the scheme of cashiering kings for misconduct in that light it is worth some observation  kings in one sense are undoubtedly the servants of the people because their power has no other rational end than that of the general advantage but it is not true that they are in the ordinary sense by our constitution at least anything like servants the essence of whose situation is to obey the commands of some other and to be removable at pleasure but the king of great britain obeys no other person all other persons are individually and collectively too under him and owe to him a legal obedience the law which knows neither to flatter nor to insult calls this high magistrate not our servant as this humble divine calls him but our sovereign lord the king and we on our parts have learned to speak only the primitive language of the law and not the confused jargon of their babylonian pulpits   conservative progress of inherited freedom  the policy appears to me to be the result of profound reflection or rather the happy effect of following nature which is wisdom without reflection and above it a spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views people will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors besides the people of england well know that the idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle of conservation and a sure principle of transmission without at all excluding a principle of improvement it leaves acquisition free but it secures what it acquires whatever advantages are obtained by a state proceeding on these maxims are locked fast as in a sort of family settlement grasped as in a kind of mortmain for ever by a constitutional policy working after the pattern of nature we receive we hold we transmit our government and our privileges in the same manner in which we enjoy and transmit our property and our lives the institutions of policy the goods of fortune the gifts of providence are handed down to us and from us in the same course and order our political system is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the order of the world and with the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts wherein by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race the whole at one time is never old or middleaged or young but in a condition of unchangeable constancy moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay fall renovation and progression thus by preserving the method of nature in the conduct of the state in what we improve we are never wholly new in what we retain we are never wholly obsolete by adhering in this manner and on those principles to our forefathers we are guided not by the superstition of antiquarians but by the spirit of philosophic analogy in this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic ties adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family affections keeping inseparable and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities our state our hearths our sepulchres and our altars  through the same plan of a conformity to nature in our artificial institutions and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful instincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our reason we have derived several other and those no small benefits from considering our liberties in the light of an inheritance always acting as if in the presence of canonized forefathers the spirit of freedom leading in itself to misrule and excess is tempered with an awful gravity this idea of a liberal descent inspires us with a sense of habitual native dignity which prevents that upstart insolence almost inevitably adhering to and disgracing those who are the first acquirers of any distinction by this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom it carries an imposing and majestic aspect it has a pedigree and illustrating ancestors it has its bearings and its ensigns armorial it has its gallery of portraits its monumental inscriptions its records evidences and titles we procure reverence to our civil institutions on the principle upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men on account of their age and on account of those from whom they are descended all your sophisters cannot produce anything better adapted to preserve a rational and manly freedom than the course that we have pursued who have chosen our nature rather than our speculations our breasts rather than our inventions for the great conservatories and magazines of our rights and privileges   conservation and correction  a state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation without such means it might even risk the loss of that part of the constitution which it wished the most religiously to preserve the two principles of conservation and correction operated strongly at the two critical periods of the restoration and revolution when england found itself without a king at both those periods the nation had lost the bond of union in their ancient edifice they did not however dissolve the whole fabric on the contrary in both cases they regenerated the deficient part of the old constitution through the parts which were not impaired they kept these old parts exactly as they were that the part recovered might be suited to them they acted by the ancient organized states in the shape of their old organization and not by the organic moleculae of a disbanded people at no time perhaps did the sovereign legislature manifest a more tender regard to that fundamental principle of british constitutional policy than at the time of the revolution when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary succession the crown was carried somewhat out of the line in which it had before moved but the new line was derived from the same stock it was still a line of hereditary descent still an hereditary descent in the same blood though an hereditary descent qualified with protestantism when the legislature altered the direction but kept the principle they showed that they held it inviolable   hereditary succession of english crown  unquestionably there was at the revolution in the person of king william a small and a temporary deviation from the strict order of a regular hereditary succession but it is against all genuine principles of jurisprudence to draw a principle from a law made in a special case and regarding an individual person privilegium non transit in exemplum if ever there was a time favourable for establishing the principle that a king of popular choice was the only legal king without all doubt it was at the revolution its not being done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any time there is no person so completely ignorant of our history as not to know that the majority in parliament of both parties were so little disposed to anything resembling that principle that at first they were determined to place the vacant crown not on the head of the prince of orange but on that of his wife mary daughter of king james the eldest born of the issue of that king which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his it would be to repeat a very trite story to recall to your memory all those circumstances which demonstrated that their accepting king william was not properly a choice but to all those who did not wish in effect to recall king james or to deluge their country in blood and again to bring their religion laws and liberties into the peril they had just escaped it was an act of necessity in the strictest moral sense in which necessity can be taken  so far is it from being true that we acquired a right by the revolution to elect our kings that if we had possessed it before the english nation did at that time most solemnly renounce and abdicate it for themselves and for all their posterity for ever these gentlemen may value themselves as much as they please on their whig principles but i never desire to be thought a better whig than lord somers or to understand the principles of the revolution better than those by whom it was brought about or to read in the declaration of right any mysteries unknown to those whose penetrating style has engraved in our ordinances and in our hearts the words and spirit of that immortal law  it is true that aided with the powers derived from force and opportunity the nation was at that time in some sense free to take what course it pleased for filling the throne but only free to do so upon the same grounds on which they might have wholly abolished their monarchy and every other part of their constitution  however they did not think such bold changes within their commission it is indeed difficult perhaps impossible to give limits to the mere abstract competence of the supreme power such as was exercised by parliament at that time but the limits of a moral competence subjecting even in powers more indisputably sovereign occasional will to permanent reason and to the steady maxims of faith justice and fixed fundamental policy are perfectly intelligible and perfectly binding upon those who exercise any authority under any name or under any title in the state the house of lords for instance is not morally competent to dissolve the house of commons no nor even to dissolve itself nor to abdicate if it would its portion in the legislature of the kingdom though a king may abdicate for his own person he cannot abdicate for the monarchy by as strong or by a stronger reason the house of commons cannot renounce its share of authority the engagement and pact of society which generally goes by the name of the constitution forbids such invasion and such surrender the constituent parts of a state are obliged to hold their public faith with each other and with all those who derive any serious interest under their engagements as much as the whole state is bound to keep its faith with separate communities otherwise competence and power would soon be confounded and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force on this principle the succession of the crown has always been what it now is an hereditary succession by law in the old line it was a succession by the common law in the new by the statute law operating on the principles of the common law not changing the substance but regulating the mode and describing the persons both these descriptions of law are of the same force and are derived from an equal authority emanating from the common agreement and original compact of the state communi sponsione reipublicae and as such are equally binding on king people too as long as the terms are observed and they continue the same body politic   limits of legislative capacity    if we were to know nothing of this assembly but by its title and function no colours could paint to the imagination anything more venerable in that light the mind of an inquirer subdued by such an awful image as that of the virtue and wisdom of a whole people collected into one focus would pause and hesitate in condemning things even of the very worst aspect instead of blameable they would appear only mysterious but no name no power no function no artificial institution whatsoever can make the men of whom any system of authority is composed any other than god and nature and education and their habits of life have made them capacities beyond these the people have not to give virtue and wisdom may be the objects of their choice but their choice confers neither the one nor the other on those upon whom they lay their ordaining hands they have not the engagement of nature they have not the promise of revelation for any such power   our constitution not fabricated but inherited  the revolution was made to preserve our ancient indisputable laws and liberties and that ancient constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty if you are desirous of knowing the spirit of our constitution and the policy which predominated in that great period which has secured it to this hour pray look for both in our histories in our records in our acts of parliament and journals of parliament and not in the sermons of the old jewry and the afterdinner toasts of the revolution society in the former you will find other ideas and another language such a claim is as ill suited to our temper and wishes as it is unsupported by any appearance of authority the very idea of the fabrication of a new government is enough to fill us with disgust and horror we wished at the period of the revolution and do now wish to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any scion alien to the nature of the original plant all the reformations we have hitherto made have proceeded upon the principle of reverence to antiquity and i hope nay i am persuaded that all those which possibly may be made hereafter will be carefully formed upon analogical precedent authority and example  our oldest reformation is that of magna charta you will see that sir edward coke that great oracle of our law and indeed all the great men who follow him to blackstone are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties they endeavour to prove that the ancient charter the magna charta of king john was connected with another positive charter from henry i and that both the one and the other were nothing more than a reaffirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom in the matter of fact for the greater part these authors appear to be in the right perhaps not always but if the lawyers mistake in some particulars it proves my position still the more strongly because it demonstrates the powerful prepossession towards antiquity with much the minds of all our lawyers and legislators and of all the people whom they wish to influence have been always filled and the stationary policy of this kingdom in considering their most sacred rights and franchises as an inheritance  in the famous law of the 3rd of charles i called the petition of right the parliament says to the king your subjects have inherited this freedom claiming their franchises not on abstract principles as the rights of men but as the rights of englishmen and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers selden and the other profoundly learned men who drew this petition of right were as well acquainted at least with all the general theories concerning the rights of men as any of the discoursers in our pulpits or on your tribune full as well as dr price or as the abbe sieyes but for reasons worthy of that practical wisdom which superseded their theoretic science they preferred this positive recorded hereditary title to all which can be dear to the man and the citizen to that vague speculative right which exposed their sure inheritance to be scrambled for and torn to pieces by every wild litigious spirit  the same policy pervades all the laws which have since been made for the preservation of our liberties in the 1st of william and mary in the famous statute called the declaration of right the two houses utter not a syllable of a right to frame a government for themselves you will see that their whole care was to secure the religion laws and liberties that had been long possessed and had been lately endangered taking into their most serious consideration the best means for making such an establishment that their religion laws and liberties might not be in danger of being again subverted they auspicate all their proceedings by stating as some of those best means in the first place to do as their ancestors in like cases have usually done for vindicating their ancient rights and liberties to declareand then they pray the king and queen that it may be declared and enacted that all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and declared are the true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom  you will observe that from magna charta to the declaration of right it has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assert our liberties as an entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers and to be transmitted to our posterity as an estate specially belonging to the people of this kingdom without any reference whatever to any other more general or prior right by this means our constitution preserves a unity in so great a diversity of its parts we have an inheritable crown an inheritable peerage and a house of commons and a people inheriting privileges franchises and liberties from a long line of ancestors   low aims and low instruments  when men of rank sacrifice all ideas of dignity to an ambition without a distinct object and work with low instruments and for low ends the whole composition becomes low and base does not something like this now appear in france does it not produce something ignoble and inglorious a kind of meanness in all the prevalent policy a tendency in all that is done to lower along with individuals all the dignity and importance of the state other revolutions have been conducted by persons who whilst they attempted or affected changes in the commonwealth sanctified their ambition by advancing the dignity of the people whose peace they troubled they had long views they aimed at the rule not at the destruction of their country they were men of great civil and great military talents and if the terror the ornament of their age they were not like jew brokers contending with each other who could best remedy with fraudulent circulation and depreciated paper the wretchedness and ruin brought on their country by their degenerate councils the compliment made to one of the great bad men of the old stamp cromwell by his kinsman a favourite poet of that time shows what it was he proposed and what indeed to a great degree he accomplished in the success of his ambition      still as you rise the state exalted too      finds no distemper whilst tis changed by you     changed like the worlds great scene when without noise     the rising sun nights vulgar lights destroys   these disturbers were not so much like men usurping power as asserting their natural place in society their rising was to illuminate and beautify the world their conquest over their competitors was by outshining them the hand that like a destroying angel smote the country communicated to it the force and energy under which it suffered i do not say god forbid i do not say that the virtues of such men were to be taken as a balance to their crimes but they were some corrective to their effects such was as i said our cromwell such were your whole race of guises condes and colignis such the richelieus who in more quite times acted in the spirit of a civil war such as better men and in a less dubious cause were your henry the fourth and your sully though nursed in civil confusions and not wholly without some of their taint it is a thing to be wondered at to see how very soon france when she had a moment to respire recovered and emerged from the longest and most dreadful civil war that ever was known in any nation why because among all their massacres they had not slain the mind in their country a conscious dignity a noble pride a generous sense of glory and emulation was not extinguished on the contrary it was kindled and enflamed the organs also of the state however shattered existed all the prizes of honour and virtue all the rewards all the distinctions remained but your present confusion like a palsy has attacked the fountain of life itself every person in your country in a situation to be actuated by a principle of honour is disgraced and degraded and can entertain no sensation of life except in a mortified and humiliated indignation but this generation will quickly pass away the next generation of the nobility will resemble the artificers and clowns and moneyjobbers usurers and jews who will be always their fellows sometimes their masters believe me sir those who attempt to level never equalise in all societies consisting of various descriptions of citizens some description must be uppermost the levellers therefore only change and pervert the natural order of things they load the edifice of society by setting up in the air what the solidity of the structure requires to be on the ground the associations of tailors and carpenters of which the republic of paris for instance is composed cannot be equal to the situation into which by the worst of usurpations a usurpation on the prerogatives of nature you attempt to force them  the chancellor of france at the opening of the states said in a tone of oratorical flourish that all occupations were honourable if he meant only that no honest employment was disgraceful he would not have gone beyond the truth but in asserting that anything is honourable we imply some distinction in its favour the occupation of a hairdresser or of a working tallowchandler cannot be a matter of honour to any personto say nothing of a number of other more servile employments such descriptions of men ought not to suffer oppression from the state but the state suffers oppression if such as they either individually or collectively are permitted to rule in this you think you are combating prejudice but you are at war with nature   house of commons contrasted with national assembly  the british house of commons without shutting its doors to any merit in any class is by the sure operation of adequate causes filled with everything illustrious in rank in descent in hereditary and in acquired opulence in cultivated talents in military civil naval and politic distinction that the country can afford but supposing what hardly can be supposed as a case that the house of commons should be composed in the same manner with the tiersetat in france would this dominion of chicane be borne with patience or even conceived without horror god forbid i should insinuate anything derogatory to that profession which is another priesthood administering the rights of sacred justice but whilst i revere men in the functions which belong to them and would do as much as one man can do to prevent their exclusion from any i cannot to flatter them give the lie to nature they are good and useful in the composition they must be mischievous if they preponderate so as virtually to become the whole their very excellence in their peculiar functions may be far from a qualification for others it cannot escape observation that when men are too much confined to professional and faculty habits and as it were inveterate in the recurrent employment of that narrow circle they are rather disabled than qualified for whatever depends on the knowledge of mankind on experience in mixed affairs on a comprehensive connected view of the various complicated external and internal interests which go to the formation of that multifarious thing called a state after all if the house of commons were to have a wholly professional and faculty composition what is the power of the house of commons circumscribed and shut in by the immoveable barriers of law usages positive rules of doctrine and practice counterpoised by the house of lords and every moment of its existence at the discretion of the crown to continue prorogue or dissolve us the power of the house of commons direct or indirect is indeed great and long may it be able to preserve its greatness and the spirit belonging to true greatness at the full and it will do so as long as it can keep the breakers of law in india from becoming the makers of law for england the power however of the house of commons when least diminished is as a drop of water in the ocean compared to that residing in a settled majority of your national assembly that assembly since the destruction of the orders has no fundamental law no strict convention no respected usage to restrain it instead of finding themselves obliged to conform to a fixed constitution they have a power to make a constitution which shall conform to their designs nothing in heaven or upon earth can serve as a control on them what ought to be the heads the hearts the dispositions that are qualified or that dare not only to make laws under a fixed constitution but at one heat to strike out a totally new constitution for a great kingdom and every part of it from the monarch on the throne to the vestry of a parish butfools rush in where angels fear to tread in such a state of unbounded power for undefined and indefinable purposes the evil of a moral and almost physical inaptitude of the man to the function must be the greatest we can conceive to happen in the management of human affairs   property more than ability represented in parliament  nothing is a due and adequate representation of a state that does not represent its ability as well as its property but as ability is a vigorous and active principle and as property is sluggish inert and timid it never can be safe from the invasions of ability unless it be out of all proportion predominant in the representation it must be represented too in great masses of accumulation or it is not rightly protected the characteristic essence of property formed out of the combined principles of its acquisition and conservation is to be unequal the great masses therefore which excite envy and tempt rapacity must be put out of the possibility of danger then they form a natural rampart about the lesser properties in all their gradations the same quantity of property which is by the natural course of things divided among many has not the same operation its defensive power is weakened as it is diffused in this diffusion each mans portion is less than what in the eagerness of his desires he may flatter himself to obtain by dissipating the accumulations of others the plunder of the few would indeed give but a share inconceivably small in the distribution to the many but the many are not capable of making this calculation and those who lead them to rapine never intend this distribution  the power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it and that which tends the most to the perpetuation of society itself it makes our weakness subservient to our virtue it grafts benevolence even upon avarice the possessors of family wealth and of the distinction which attends hereditary possession as most concerned in it are the natural securities for this transmission with us the house of peers is formed upon this principle it is wholly composed of hereditary property and hereditary distinction and made therefore the third of the legislature and in the last event the sole judge of all property in all its subdivisions the house of commons too though not necessarily yet in fact is always so composed in the far greater part let those large proprietors be what they will and they have their chance of being among the best they are at the very worst the ballast in the vessel of the commonwealth for though hereditary wealth and the rank which goes with it are too much idolized by creeping sycophants and the blind abject admirers of power they are too rashly slighted in shallow speculations of the petulant assuming shortsighted coxcombs of philosophy some decent regulated preeminence some preference not exclusive appropriation given to birth is neither unnatural nor unjust nor impolitic it is said that twentyfour millions ought to prevail over two hundred thousand true if the constitution of a kingdom be a problem of arithmetic this sort of discourse does well enough with the lamppost for its second to men who may reason calmly it is ridiculous the will of the many and their interest must very often differ and great will be the difference when they make an evil choice   virtue and wisdom qualify for government  i do not my dear sir conceive you to be of that sophistical captious spirit or of that uncandid dulness as to require for every general observation or sentiment an explicit detail of the correctives and exceptions which reason will presume to be included in all the general propositions which come from reasonable men you do not imagine that i wish to confine power authority and distinction to blood and names and titles no sir there is no qualification for government but virtue and wisdom actual or presumptive wherever they are actually found they have in whatever state condition profession or trade the passport of heaven to human place and honour woe to that country which would madly and impiously reject the service of the talents and virtues civil military or religious that are given to grace and to serve it and would condemn to obscurity everything formed to diffuse lustre and glory around a state woe to that country too that passing into the opposite extreme considers a low education a mean contracted view of things a sordid mercenary occupation as a preferable title to command everything ought to be open but not indifferently to every man no rotation no appointment by lot no mode of election operating in the spirit of sortition or rotation can be generally good in a government conversant in extensive objects because they have no tendency direct or indirect to select the man with a view to the duty or to accommodate the one to the other i do not hesitate to say that the road to eminence and power from obscure condition ought not to be made too easy nor a thing too much of course if rare merit be the rarest of all rare things in ought to pass through some sort of probation the temple of honour ought to be seated on an eminence if it be opened through virtue let it be remembered too that virtue is never tried but by some difficulty and some struggle   natural and civil rights  far am i from denying in theory full as far as is my heart from withholding in practice if i were of power to give or to withhold the real rights of men in denying their false claims of right i do not mean to injure those which are real and are such as their pretended rights would totally destroy if civil society be made for the advantage of man all the advantages for which it is made become his right it is an institution of beneficence and law itself is only beneficence acting by a rule men have a right to live by that rule they have a right to do justice as between their fellows whether their fellows are in politic function or in ordinary occupation they have a right to the fruits of their industry and to the means of making their industry fruitful they have a right to the acquisitions of their parents to the nourishment and improvement of their offspring to instruction in life and to consolation in death whatever each man can separately do without trespassing upon others he has a right to do for himself and he has a right to a fair portion of all which society with all its combinations of skill and force can do in his favour in this partnership all men have equal rights but not to equal things he that has but five shillings in the partnership has as good a right to it as he that has five hundred pounds has to his larger proportion but he has not a right to an equal dividend in the product of the jointstock and as to the share of power authority and direction which each individual ought to have in the management of the state that i must deny to be amongst the direct original rights of man in civil society for i have in my contemplation the civil social man and no other it is a thing to be settled by convention if civil society be the offspring of convention that convention must be its law that convention must limit and modify all the descriptions of constitution which are formed under it every sort of legislature judicial or executory power are its creatures they can have no being in any other state of things and how can any man claim under the conventions of civil society rights which do not so much as suppose its existence rights which are absolutely repugnant to it one of the first motives to civil society and which becomes one of its fundamental rules is that no man should be judge in his own cause by this each person has at once divested himself of the first fundamental right of uncovenanted man that is to judge for himself and to assert his own cause he abdicates all right to be his own governor he inclusively in a great measure abandons the right of selfdefence the first law of nature men cannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil state together that he may obtain justice he gives up his right of determining what it is in points the most essential to him that he may secure some liberty he makes a surrender in trust of the whole of it  government is not made in virtue of natural rights which may and do exist in total independence of it and exist in much greater clearness and in a much greater degree of abstract perfection but their abstract perfection is their practical defect by having a right to everything they want everything government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom among these wants is to be reckoned the want out of civil society of a sufficient restraint upon their passions society requires not only that the passions of individuals should be subjected but that even in the mass and body as well as in the individuals the inclinations of men should frequently be thwarted their will controlled and their passions brought into subjection this can only be done by a power out of themselves and not in the exercise of its function subject to that will and to those passions which it is its office to bridle and subdue in this sense the restraints on men as well as their liberties are to be reckoned among their rights but as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and circumstances and admit of infinite modifications they cannot be settled upon any abstract rule and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that principle  the moment you abate anything from the full rights of men each to govern himself and suffer any artificial positive limitation upon those rights from that moment the whole organization of government becomes a consideration of convenience this it is which makes the constitution of a state and the due distribution of its powers a matter of the most delicate and complicated skill it requires a deep knowledge of human nature and human necessities and of the things which facilitate or obstruct the various ends which are to be pursued by the mechanism of civil institutions the state is to have recruits to its strength and remedies to its distempers what is the use of discussing a mans abstract right to food or medicine the question is upon the method of procuring and administering them in that deliberation i shall always advise to call in the aid of the farmer and the physician rather than the professor of metaphysics the science of constructing a commonwealth or renovating it or reforming it is like every other experimental science not to be taught a priori nor is it a short experience that can instruct us in that practical science because the real effects of moral causes are not always immediate but that which in the first instance is prejudicial may be excellent in its remoter operation and its excellence may arise even from the ill effects it produces in the beginning the reverse also happens and very plausible schemes with very pleasing commencements have often shameful and lamentable conclusions in states there are often some obscure and almost latent causes things which appear at first view of little moment on which a very great part of its prosperity or adversity may most essentially depend the science of government being therefore so practical in itself and intended for such practical purposes a matter which requires experience and even more experience than any person can gain in his whole life however sagacious and observing he may be it is with infinite caution that any man ought to venture upon pulling down an edifice which has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes of society or on building it up again without having models and patterns of approved utility before his eyes  these metaphysic rights entering into common life like rays of light which pierce into a dense medium are by the laws of nature refracted from their straight line indeed in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns the primitive rights of men undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction the nature of man is intricate the objects of society are of the greatest possible complexity and therefore no simple disposition or direction of power can be suitable either to mans nature or to the quality of his affairs when i hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed at and boasted of in any new political constitutions i am at no loss to decide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their trade or totally negligent of their duty the simple governments are fundamentally defective to say no worse of them if you were to contemplate society in but one point of view all these simple modes of polity are infinitely captivating in effect each would answer its single end much more perfectly than the more complex is able to attain all its complex purposes but it is better that the whole should be imperfectly and anomalously answered than that while some parts are provided for with great exactness others might be totally neglected or perhaps materially injured by the overcare of a favourite member  the pretended rights of these theorists are all extremes and in proportion as they are metaphysically true they are morally and politically false the rights of men are in a sort of middle incapable of definition but not impossible to be discerned the rights of men in governments are their advantages and these are often in balances between differences of good in compromises sometimes between good and evil and sometimes between evil and evil political reason is a computing principle adding subtracting multiplying and dividing morally and not metaphysically or mathematically true moral denominations  by these theorists the right of the people is almost always sophistically confounded with their power the body of the community whenever it can come to act can meet with no effectual resistance but till power and right are the same the whole body of them has no right inconsistent with virtue and the first of all virtuesprudence   marie antoinette  it is now sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of france then the dauphiness at versailles and surely never lighted on this orb which she hardly seemed to touch a more delightful vision i saw her just above the horizon decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move inglittering like the morningstar full of life and splendour and joy oh what a revolution and what a heart must i have to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall little did i dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic distant respectful love that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom little did i dream that i should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men in a nation of men of honour and of cavaliers i thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult but the age of chivalry is gone that of sophisters economists and calculators has succeeded and the glory of europe is extinguished for ever never never more shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex that proud submission that dignified obedience that subordination of the heart which kept alive even in servitude itself the spirit of an exalted freedom the unbought grace of life the cheap defence of nations the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone it is gone that sensibility of principle that chastity of honour which felt a stain like a wound which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity which ennobled whatever it touched and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness   spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of religion  how much of that prosperous state was owing to the spirit of our old manners and opinions is not easy to say but as such causes cannot be indifferent in their operation we must presume that on the whole their operation was beneficial  we are but too apt to consider things in the state in which we find them without sufficiently adverting to the causes by which they have been produced and possibly may be upheld nothing is more certain than that our manners our civilization and all the good things which are connected with manners and with civilization have in this european world of ours depended for ages upon two principles and were indeed the result of both combined i mean the spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of religion the nobility and the clergy the one by profession the other by patronage kept learning in existence even in the midst of arms and confusions and whilst governments were rather in their causes than formed learning paid back what it received to nobility and to priesthood and paid it with usury by enlarging their ideas and by furnishing their minds happy if they had all continued to know their indissoluble union and their proper place happy if learning not debauched by ambition had been satisfied to continue the instructor and not aspired to be the master along with its natural protectors and guardians learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down under the hoofs of a swinish multitude  if as i suspect modern letters owe more than they are always willing to own to ancient manners so do other interests which we value full as much as they are worth even commerce and trade and manufacture the gods of our economical politicians are themselves perhaps but creatures are themselves but effects which as first causes we choose to worship they certainly grew under the same shade in which learning flourished they too may decay with their natural protecting principles with you for the present at least they all threaten to disappear together where trade and manufactures are wanting to a people and the spirit of nobility and religion remains sentiment supplies and not always ill supplies their place but if commerce and the arts should be lost in an experiment to try how well a state may stand without these old fundamental principles what sort of a thing must be a nation of gross stupid ferocious and at the same time poor and sordid barbarians destitute of religion honour or manly pride possessing nothing at present and hoping for nothing hereafter   power survives opinion  but power of some kind or other will survive the shock in which manners and opinions perish and it will find other and worse means for its support the usurpation which in order to subvert ancient institutions has destroyed ancient principles will hold power by arts similar to those by which it has acquired it when the old feudal and chivalrous spirit of fealty which by freeing kings from fear freed both kings and subjects from the precaution of tyranny shall be extinct in the minds of men plots and assassinations will be anticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation and that long roll of grim and bloody maxims which form the political code of all power not standing on its own honour and the honour of those who are to obey it kings will be tyrants from policy when subjects are rebels from principle   chivalry a moralizing charm    this mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin in the ancient chivalry and the principle though varied in its appearance by the varying state of human affairs subsisted and influenced through a long succession of generations even to the time we live in if it should ever be totally extinguished the loss i fear will be great it is this which has given its character to modern europe it is this which has distinguished it under all its forms of government and distinguished it to its advantage from the states of asia and possibly from those states which flourished in the most brilliant periods of the antique world it was this which without confounding ranks had produced a noble equality and handed it down through all the gradations of social life it was this opinion which mitigated kings into companions and raised private men to be fellows with kings  without force or opposition it subdued the fierceness of pride and power it obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft collar of social esteem compelled stern authority to submit to elegance and gave a dominating vanquisher of laws to be subdued by manners  but now all is to be changed all the pleasing illusions which made power gentle and obedience liberal which harmonized the different shades of life and which by a bland assimilation incorporated into politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private society are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason all the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off all the superadded ideas furnished from the wardrobe of a moral imagination which the heart owns and the understanding ratifies as necessary to cover the defects of our naked shivering nature and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation are to be exploded as a ridiculous absurd and antiquated fashion  on this scheme of things a king is but a man a queen is but a woman a woman is but an animaland an animal not of the highest order all homage paid to the sex in general as such and without distinct views is to be regarded as romance and folly regicide and parricide and sacrilege are but fictions of superstition corrupting jurisprudence by destroying its simplicity the murder of a king or a queen or a bishop or a father are only common homicide and if the people are by any chance or in any way gainers by it a sort of homicide much the most pardonable and into which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny  on the scheme of this barbarous philosophy which is the offspring of cold hearts and muddy understandings and which is as void of solid wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance laws are to be supported only by their own terrors and by the concern which each individual may find in them from his own private speculations or can spare to them from his own private interests in the groves of their academy at the end of every vista you see nothing but the gallows nothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the commonwealth on the principles of this mechanic philosophy our institutions can never be embodied if i may use the expression in persons so as to create in us love veneration admiration or attachment but that sort of reason which banishes the affections is incapable of filling their place these public affections combined with manners are required sometimes as supplements sometimes as correctives always as aids to law the precept given by a wise man as well as a great critic for the construction of poems is equally true as to statesnon satis est pulchra esse poemata dulcia sunto there ought to be a system of manners in every nation which a wellformed mind would be disposed to relish to make us love our country our country ought to be lovely   sacredness of moral instincts    why do i feel so differently from the reverend dr price and those of his lay flock who will choose to adopt the sentiments of his discourse for this plain reasonbecause it is natural i should because we are so made as to be affected at such spectacles with melancholy sentiments upon the unstable condition of mortal prosperity and the tremendous uncertainty of human greatness because in those natural feelings we learn great lessons because in events like these our passions instruct our reason because when kings are hurled from their thrones by the supreme director of this great drama and become the objects of insult to the base and of pity to the good we behold such disasters in the moral as we should behold a miracle in the physical order of things we are alarmed into reflection our minds as it has long since been observed are purified by terror and pity our weak unthinking pride is humbled under the dispensations of a mysterious wisdom some tears might be drawn from me if such a spectacle were exhibited on the stage i should be truly ashamed of finding in myself that superficial theatric sense of painted distress whilst i could exult over it in real life with such a perverted mind i could never venture to show my face at a tragedy  people would think the tears that garrick formerly or that siddons not long since have extorted from me were the tears of hypocrisy i should know them to be the tears of folly  indeed the theatre is a better school of moral sentiments than churches where the feelings of humanity are thus outraged poets who have to deal with an audience not yet graduated in the school of the rights of men and who must apply themselves to the moral constitution of the heart would not dare to produce such a triumph as a matter of exultation there where men follow their natural impulses they would not bear the odious maxims of a machiavelian policy whether applied to the attainment of monarchical or democratic tyranny they would reject them on the modern as they once did on the ancient stage where they could not bear even the hypothetical proposition of such wickedness in the mouth of a personated tyrant though suitable to the character he sustained no theatric audience in athens would bear what has been borne in the midst of the real tragedy of this triumphal day a principal actor weighing as it were in scales hung in a shop of horrors so much actual crime against so much contingent advantage and after putting in and out weights declaring that the balance was on the side of the advantages they would not bear to see the crimes of new democracy posted as in a ledger against the crimes of old despotism and the bookkeepers of politics finding democracy still in debt but by no means unable or unwilling to pay the balance in the theatre the first intuitive glance without any elaborate process of reasoning will show that this method of political computation would justify every extent of crime they would see that on these principles even where the very worst acts were not perpetrated it was owing rather to the fortune of the conspirators than to their parsimony in the expenditure of treachery and blood they would soon see that criminal means once tolerated are soon preferred they present a shorter cut to the object than through the highway of the moral virtues justifying perfidy and murder for public benefit public benefit would soon become the pretext and perfidy and murder the end until rapacity malice revenge and fear more dreadful than revenge could satiate their insatiable appetites such must be the consequences of losing in the splendour of these triumphs of the rights of men all natural sense of wrong and right   parental experience    had it pleased god to continue to me the hopes of succession i should have been according to my mediocrity and the mediocrity of the age i live in a sort of founder of a family i should have left a son who in all the points in which personal merit can be viewedin science in erudition in genius in taste in honour in generosity in humanity in every liberal sentiment and every liberal accomplishmentwould not have shown himself inferior to the duke of bedford or to any of those whom he traces in his line his grace very soon would have wanted all plausibility in his attack upon that provision which belonged more to mine than to me he would soon have supplied every deficiency and symmetrized every disproportion it would not have been for that successor to resort to any stagnant wasting reservoir of merit in me or in any ancestry he had in himself a salient living spring of generous and manly action every day he lived he would have repurchased the bounty of the crown and ten times more if ten times more he had received he was made a public creature and had no enjoyment whatever but in the performance of some duty at this exigent moment the loss of a finished man is not easily supplied  but a disposer whose power we are little able to resist and whose wisdom it behoves us not at all to dispute has ordained it in another manner and whatever my querulous weakness might suggest a far better the storm has gone over me and i lie like one of those old oaks which the late hurricane has scattered about me i am stripped of all my honours i am torn up by the roots and lie prostrate on the earth there and prostrate there i most unfeignedly recognise the divine justice and in some degree submit to it but whilst i humble myself before god i do not know that it is forbidden to repel the attacks of unjust and inconsiderate men the patience of job is proverbial after some of the convulsive struggles of our irritable nature he submitted himself and repented in dust and ashes but even so i do not find him blamed for reprehending and with a considerable degree of verbal asperity those illnatured neighbours of his who visited his dunghill to read moral political and economical lectures on his misery i am alone i have none to meet my enemies in the gate indeed my lord i greatly deceive myself if in this hard season i would give a peck of refuse wheat for all that is called fame and honour in the world this is the appetite but of a few it is a luxury it is a privilege it is an indulgence for those who are at their ease but we are all of us made to shun disgrace as we are made to shrink from pain and poverty and disease it is an instinct and under the direction of reason instinct is always in the right i live in an inverted order they who ought to have succeeded me have gone before me they who should have been to me as posterity are in the place of ancestors i owe to the dearest relation which ever must subsist in memory that act of piety which he would have performed to me i owe it to him to show that he was not descended as the duke of bedford would have it from an unworthy parent   revolutionary scene  history who keeps a durable record of all our acts and exercises her awful censure over the proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns will not forget either those events or the era of this liberal refinement in the intercourse of mankind history will record that on the morning of the 6th of october 1789 the king and queen of france after a day of confusion alarm dismay and slaughter lay down under the pledged security of public faith to indulge nature in a few hours of respite and troubled melancholy repose from this sleep the queen was first startled by the voice of the sentinel at her door who cried out to her to save herself by flightthat this was the last proof of fidelity he could givethat they were upon him and he was dead instantly he was cut down a band of cruel ruffians and assassins reeking with his blood rushed into the chamber of the queen and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost naked and through ways unknown to the murderers had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king and husband not secure of his own life for a moment this king to say no more of him and this queen and their infant children who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and generous people were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most splendid palace in the world which they left swimming in blood polluted by massacre and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated carcases thence they were conducted into the capital of their kingdom two had been selected from the unprovoked unresisted promiscuous slaughter which was made of the gentlemen of birth and family who composed the kings bodyguard these two gentlemen with all the parade of an execution of justice were cruelly and publicly dragged to the block and beheaded in the great court of the palace their heads were stuck upon spears and led the procession whilst the royal captives who followed in the train were slowly moved along amidst the horrid yells and shrilling screams and frantic dances and infamous contumelies and all the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell in the abused shape of the vilest of women after they had been made to taste drop by drop more than the bitterness of death in the slow torture of a journey of twelve miles protracted to six hours they were under a guard composed of those very soldiers who had thus conducted them through this famous triumph lodged in one of the old palaces of paris now converted into a bastille for kings  is this a triumph to be consecrated at altars to be commemorated with grateful thanksgiving to be offered to the divine humanity with fervent prayer and enthusiastic ejaculationthese theban and thracian orgies acted in france and applauded only in the old jewry i assure you kindle prophetic enthusiasm in the minds but of very few people in this kingdom although a saint and apostle who may have revelations of his own and who has so completely vanquished all the mean superstitions of the heart may incline to think it pious and decorous to compare it with the entrance into the world of the prince of peace proclaimed in a holy temple by a venerable sage and not long before not worse announced by the voice of angels to quiet the innocence of shepherds   economy on state principles  economy in my plans was as it ought to be secondary subordinate instrumental i acted on state principles i found a great distemper in the commonwealth and according to the nature of the evil and of the object i treated it the malady was deep it was complicated in the causes and in the symptoms throughout it was full of contraindicants on one hand government daily growing more invidious from an apparent increase of the means of strength was every day growing more contemptible by real weakness nor was this dissolution confined to government commonly so called it extended to parliament which was losing not a little in its dignity and estimation by an opinion of its not acting on worthy motives on the other hand the desires of the people partly natural and partly infused into them by art appeared in so wild and inconsiderate a manner with regard to the economical object for i set aside for a moment the dreadful tampering with the body of the constitution itself that if their petitions had literally been complied with the state would have been convulsed and a gate would have been opened through which all property might be sacked and ravaged nothing could have saved the public from the mischiefs of the false reform but its absurdity which would soon have brought itself and with it all real reform into discredit this would have left a rankling wound in the hearts of the people who would know they had failed in the accomplishment of their wishes but who like the rest of mankind in all ages would impute the blame to anything rather than to their own proceedings but there were then persons in the world who nourished complaint and would have been thoroughly disappointed if the people were ever satisfied i was not of that humour i wished that they should be satisfied it was my aim to give to the people the substance of what i knew they desired and what i thought was right whether they desired or not before it had been modified for them into senseless petitions i knew that there is a manifest marked distinction which ill men with ill designs or weak men incapable of any design will constantly be confounding that is a marked distinction between change and reformation the former alters the substance of the objects themselves and gets rid of all their essential good as well as of all the accidental evil annexed to them change is novelty and whether it is to operate any one of the effects of reformation at all or whether it may not contradict the very principle upon which reformation is desired cannot be certainly known beforehand reform is not a change in the substance or in the primary modification of the object but a direct application of a remedy to the grievance complained of so far as that is removed all is sure it stops there and if it fails the substance which underwent the operation at the very worst is but where it was all this in effect i think but am not sure i have said elsewhere it cannot at this time be too often repeated line upon line precept upon precept until it comes into the currency of a proverb to innovate is not to reform the french revolutionists complained of everything they refused to reform anything and they left nothing no nothing at all unchanged the consequences are before usnot in remote history not in future prognostication they are about us they are upon us they shake the public security they menace private enjoyment they dwarf the growth of the young they break the quiet of the old if we travel they stop our way they infest us in town they pursue us to the country our business is interrupted our repose is troubled our pleasures are saddened our very studies are poisoned and perverted and knowledge is rendered worse than ignorance by the enormous evils of this dreadful innovation the revolution harpies of france sprung from night and hell or from that chaotic anarchy which generates equivocally all monstrous all prodigious things cuckoolike adulterously lay their eggs and brood over and hatch them in the nest of every neighbouring state these obscene harpies who deck themselves in i know not what divine attributes but who in reality are foul and ravenous birds of prey both mothers and daughters flutter over our heads and souse down upon our tables and leave nothing unrent unrifled unravaged or unpolluted with the slime of their filthy offal   philosophical vanity its maxims and effects  the assembly recommends to its youth a study of the bold experimenters in morality everybody knows that there is a great dispute amongst their leaders which of them is the best resemblance of rousseau in truth they all resemble him his blood they transfuse into their minds and into their manners him they study him they meditate him they turn over in all the time they can spare from the laborious mischief of the day or the debauches of the night rousseau is their canon of holy writ in his life he is their canon of polycletus he is their standard figure of perfection to this man and this writer as a pattern to authors and to frenchmen the foundries of paris are now running for statues with the kettles of their poor and the bells of their churches if an author had written like a great genius on geometry though its practical and speculative morals were vicious in the extreme it might appear that in voting the statue they honoured only the geometrician but rousseau is a moralist or he is nothing it is impossible therefore putting the circumstances together to mistake their design in choosing the author with whom they have begun to recommend a courses studies  their great problem is to find a substitute for all the principles which hitherto have been employed to regulate the human will and action they find dispositions in the mind of such force and quality as may fit men far better than the old morality for the purposes of such a state as theirs and may go much further in supporting their power and destroying their enemies they have therefore chosen a selfish flattering seductive ostentatious vice in the place of plain duty true humility the basis of the christian system is the low but deep and firm foundation of all real virtue but this as very painful in the practice and little imposing in the appearance they have totally discarded their object is to merge all natural and all social sentiment in inordinate vanity in a small degree and conversant in little things vanity is of little moment when full grown it is the worst of vices and the occasional mimic of them all it makes the whole man false it leaves nothing sincere or trustworthy about him his best qualities are poisoned and perverted by it and operate exactly as the worst when your lords had many writers as immoral as the object of their statue such as voltaire and others they chose rousseau because in him that peculiar vice which they wished to erect into ruling virtue was by far the most conspicuous we have had the great professor and founder of the philosophy of vanity in england as i had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almost from day to day he left no doubt on my mind that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart or to guide his understanding but vanity with this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness it is from the same deranged eccentric vanity that this the insane socrates of the national assembly was impelled to publish a mad confession of his mad faults and to attempt a new sort of glory from bringing hardily to light the obscure and vulgar vices which we know may sometimes be blended with eminent talents he has not observed on the nature of vanity who does not know that it is omnivorous that it has no choice in its food that it is fond to talk even of its own faults and vices as what will excite surprise and draw attention and what will pass at worst for openness and candour  it was this abuse and perversion which vanity makes even of hypocrisy that has driven rousseau to record a life not so much as chequered or spotted here and there with virtues or even distinguished by a single good action it is such a life he chooses to offer to the attention of mankind it is such a life that with a wild defiance he flings in the face of his creator whom he acknowledges only to brave your assembly knowing how much more powerful example is found than precept has chosen this man by his own account without a single virtue for a model to him they erect their first statue from him they commence their series of honours and distinctions  it is that newinvented virtue which your masters canonize that led their model hero constantly to exhaust the stores of his powerful rhetoric in the expression of universal benevolence whilst his heart was incapable of harbouring one spark of common parental affection benevolence to the whole species and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact form the character of the new philosophy setting up for an unsocial independence this their hero of vanity refuses the just price of common labour as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius and which when paid honours the giver and the receiver and then he pleads his beggary as an excuse for his crimes he melts with tenderness for those only who touch him by the remotest relation and then without one natural pang casts away as a sort of offal and excrement the spawn of his disgustful amours and sends his children to the hospital of foundlings the bear loves licks and forms her young but bears are not philosophers vanity however finds its account in reversing the train of our natural feelings thousands admire the sentimental writer the affectionate father is hardly known in his parish  under this philosophic instructor in the ethics of vanity they have attempted in france a regeneration of the moral constitution of man statesmen like your present rulers exist by everything which is spurious fictitious and false by everything which takes the man from his house and sets him on a stage which makes him up an artificial creature with painted theatric sentiments fit to be seen by the glare of candlelight and formed to be contemplated at a due distance vanity is too apt to prevail in all of us and in all countries to the improvement of frenchmen it seems not absolutely necessary that it should be taught upon system but it is plain that the present rebellion was its legitimate offspring and it is piously fed by that rebellion with a daily dole if the system of institution recommended by the assembly be false and theatric it is because their system of government is of the same character to that and to that alone it is strictly conformable to understand either we must connect the morals with the politics of the legislators your practical philosophers systematic in everything have wisely begun at the source as the relation between parents and children is the first amongst the elements of vulgar natural morality filiola tua te delectari laetor et probari tibi phusiken esse ten pros ta tekna etenim si haec non est nulla potest homini esse ad hominem naturae adjunctio qua sublata vitae societas tollitur valete patron rousseau et tui condiscipuli lassemblee nationalcic ep ad atticum they erect statues to a wild ferocious lowminded hardhearted father of fine general feelings a lover of his kind but a hater of his kindred your masters reject the duties of his vulgar relation as contrary to liberty as not founded in the social compact and not binding according to the rights of men because the relation is not of course the result of free election never so on the side of the children not always on the part of the parents  the next relation which they regenerate by their statues to rousseau is that which is next in sanctity to that of a father they differ from those oldfashioned thinkers who considered pedagogues as sober and venerable characters and allied to the parental the moralists of the dark times preceptorum sancti voluere parentis esse loco in this age of light they teach the people that preceptors ought to be in the place of gallants they systematically corrupt a very corruptible race for some time a growing nuisance amongst you a set of pert petulant literators to whom instead of their proper but severe unostentatious duties they assign the brilliant part of men of wit and pleasure of gay young military sparks and danglers at toilets they call on the rising generation in france to take a sympathy in the adventures and fortunes and they endeavour to engage their sensibility on the side of pedagogues who betray the most awful family trusts and vitiate their female pupils they teach the people that the debauchers of virgins almost in the arms of their parents may be safe inmates in the houses and even fit guardians of the honour of those husbands who succeed legally to the office which the young literators had preoccupied without asking leave of law or conscience  thus they dispose of all the family relations of parents and children husbands and wives through this same instructor by whom they corrupt the morals they corrupt the taste taste and elegance though they are reckoned only among the smaller and secondary morals yet are of no mean importance in the regulation of life a moral taste is not of force to turn vice into virtue but it recommends virtue with something like the blandishments of pleasure and it infinitely abates the evils of vice rousseau a writer of great force and vivacity is totally destitute of taste in any sense of the word your masters who are his scholars conceive that all refinement has an aristocratic character the last age had exhausted all its powers in giving a grace and nobleness to our mutual appetites and in raising them into a higher class and order than seemed justly to belong to them through rousseau your masters are resolved to destroy these aristocratic prejudices the passion called love has so general and powerful an influence it makes so much of the entertainment and indeed so much of the occupation of that part of life which decides the character for ever that the mode and the principles on which it engages the sympathy and strikes the imagination become of the utmost importance to the morals and manners of every society your rulers were well aware of this and in their system of changing your manners to accommodate them to their politics they found nothing so convenient as rousseau through him they teach men to love after the fashion of philosophers that is they teach to men to frenchmen a love without gallantry a love without anything of that fine flower of youthfulness and gentility which places it if not among the virtues among the ornaments of life instead of this passion naturally allied to grace and manners they infuse into their youth an unfashioned indelicate sour gloomy ferocious medly of pedantry and lewdness of metaphysical speculations blended with the coarsest sensuality such is the general morality of the passions to be found in their famous philosopher in his famous work of philosophic gallantry the nouvelle eloise when the fence from the gallantry of preceptors is broken down and your families are no longer protected by decent pride and salutary domestic prejudice there is but one step to a frightful corruption the rulers in the national assembly are in good hopes that the females of the first families in france may become an easy prey to dancingmasters fiddlers patterndrawers friseurs and valets de chambre and other active citizens of that description who having the entry into your houses and being half domesticated by their situation may be blended with you by regular and irregular relations by a law they have made these people their equals by adopting the sentiments of rousseau they have made them your rivals in this manner these great legislators complete their plan of levelling and establish their rights of men on a sure foundation  i am certain that the writings of rousseau lead directly to this kind of shameful evil i have often wondered how he comes to be so much more admired and followed on the continent than he is here perhaps a secret charm in the language may have its share in this extraordinary difference we certainly perceive and to a degree we feel in this writer a style glowing animated enthusiastic at the same time that we find it lax diffuse and not in the best taste of composition all the members of the piece being pretty equally laboured and expanded without any due selection or subordination of parts he is generally too much on the stretch and his manner has little variety we cannot rest upon any of his works though they contain observations which occasionally discover a considerable insight into human nature but his doctrines on the whole are so inapplicable to real life and manners that we never dream of drawing from them any rule for laws or conduct or for fortifying or illustrating anything by a reference to his opinions they have with us the fate of older paradoxes      cum ventum ad verum est sensus moresque repugnant       atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et aequi  perhaps bold speculations are more acceptable because more new to you than to us who have been long since satiated with them we continue as in the two last ages to read more generally than i believe is now done on the continent the authors of sound antiquity these occupy our minds they give us another taste and turn and will not suffer us to be more than transiently amused with paradoxical morality it is not that i consider this writer as wholly destitute of just notions amongst his irregularities it must be reckoned that he is sometimes moral and moral in a very sublime strain but the general spirit and tendency of his works is mischievous and the more mischievous for this mixture for perfect depravity of sentiment is not reconcileable with eloquence and the mind though corruptible not complexionally vicious would reject and throw off with disgust a lesson of pure and unmixed evil these writers make even virtue a pander to vice  however i less consider the author than the system of the assembly in perverting morality through his means this i confess makes me nearly despair of any attempt upon the minds of their followers through reason honour or conscience the great object of your tyrants is to destroy the gentlemen of france and for that purpose they destroy to the best of their power all the effect of those relations which may render considerable men powerful or even safe to destroy that order they vitiate the whole community that no means may exist of confederating against their tyranny by the false sympathies of this nouvelle eloise they endeavour to subvert those principles of domestic trust and fidelity which form the discipline of social life they propagate principles by which every servant may think it if not his duty at least his privilege to betray his master by these principles every considerable father of a family loses the sanctuary of his house debet sua cuique domus esse perfugium tutissimum says the law which your legislators have taken so much pains first to decry then to repeal they destroy all the tranquillity and security of domestic life turning the asylum of the house into a gloomy prison where the father of the family must drag out a miserable existence endangered in proportion to the apparent means of his safety where he is worse than solitary in a crowd of domestics and more apprehensive from his servants and inmates than from the hired bloodthirsty mob without doors who are ready to pull him to the lanterne it is thus and for the same end that they endeavour to destroy that tribunal of conscience which exists independently of edicts and decrees your despots govern by terror they know that he who fears god fears nothing else and therefore they eradicate from the mind through their voltaire their helvetius and the rest of that infamous gang that only sort of fear which generates true courage their object is that their fellowcitizens may be under the dominion of no awe but that of their committee of research and of their lanterne  having found the advantage of assassination in the formation of their tyranny it is the grand resource in which they trust for the support of it whoever opposes any of their proceedings or is suspected of a design to oppose them is to answer it with his life or the lives of his wife and children this infamous cruel and cowardly practice of assassination they have the imprudence to call merciful they boast that they operated their usurpation rather by terror than by force and that a few seasonable murders have prevented the bloodshed of many battles there is no doubt they will extend these acts of mercy whenever they see an occasion dreadful however will be the consequences of their attempt to avoid the evils of war by the merciful policy of murder if by effectual punishment of the guilty they do not wholly disavow that practice and the threat of it too as any part of their policy if ever a foreign prince enters into france he must enter it as into a country of assassins the mode of civilized war will not be practised nor are the french who act on the present system entitled to expect it they whose known policy is to assassinate every citizen whom they suspect to be discontented by their tyranny and to corrupt the soldiery of every open enemy must look for no modified hostility all war which is not battle will be military execution this will beget acts of retaliation from you and every retaliation will beget a new revenge the hellhounds of war on all sides will be uncoupled and unmuzzled the new school of murder and barbarism set up in paris having destroyed so far as in it lies all the other manners and principles which have hitherto civilized europe will destroy also the mode of civilized war which more than anything else has distinguished the christian world such is the approaching golden age which the virgil of your assembly has sung to his pollios mirabeaus speech concerning universal peace   unity between church and state  they take this tenet of the head and heart not from the great name which it immediately bears nor from the greater from whence it is derived but from that which alone can give true weight and sanction to any learned opinion the common nature and common relation of men persuaded that all things ought to be done with reference and referring all to the point of reference to which all should be directed they think themselves bound not only as individuals in the sanctuary of the heart or as congregated in that personal capacity to renew the memory of their high origin and caste but also in their corporate character to perform their national homage to the institutor and author and protector of civil society without which civil society man could not by any possibility arrive at the perfection of which his nature is capable nor even make a remote and faint approach to it they conceive that he who gave our nature to be perfected by our virtue willed also the necessary means of its perfectionhe willed therefore the statehe willed its connection with the source and original archetype of all perfection they who are convinced of this his will what is the law of laws and the sovereign of sovereigns cannot think it reprehensible that this our corporate fealty and homage that this our recognition of a signiory paramount i had almost said this oblation of the state itself as a worthy offering on the high altar of universal praise should be performed as all public solemn acts are performed in buildings in music in decoration in speech in the dignity of persons according to the customs of mankind taught by their nature that is with modest splendour and unassuming state with mild majesty and sober pomp for those purposes they think some part of the wealth of the country is as usefully employed as it can be in fomenting the luxury of individuals it is the public ornament it is the public consolation it nourishes the public hope the poorest man finds his own importance and dignity in it whilst the wealth and pride of individuals at every moment makes the man of humble rank and fortune sensible of his inferiority and degrades and vilifies his condition it is for the man in humble life and to raise his nature and to put him in mind of a state in which the privileges of opulence will cease when he will be equal by nature and may be more than equal by virtue that this portion of the general wealth of his country is employed and sanctified  i assure you i do not aim at singularity i give you opinions which have been accepted amongst us from very early times to this moment with a continued and general approbation and which indeed are so worked into my mind that i am unable to distinguish what i have learned from others from the results of my own meditation  it is on some such principles that the majority of the people of england far from thinking a religious national establishment unlawful hardly think it lawful to be without one in france you are wholly mistaken if you do not believe us above all other things attached to it and beyond all other nations and when this people has acted unwisely and unjustifiably in its favour as in some instances they have done most certainly in their very errors you will at least discover their zeal  this principle runs through the whole system of their polity they do not consider their church establishment as convenient but as essential to their state not as a thing heterogeneous and inseparable something added for accommodation what they may either keep or lay aside according to their temporary ideas of convenience they consider it as the foundation of their whole constitution with which and with every part of which it holds an indissoluble union church and state are ideas inseparable in their minds and scarcely is the one ever mentioned without mentioning the other  in preparing these pages for publication the selector has

crowning name she wears      luther 6th edition 1852   triple basis of french revolution  instead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great politic communion with the christian world they have constructed their republic on three bases all fundamentally opposite to those on which the communities of europe are built its foundation is laid in regicide in jacobinism and in atheism and it has joined to those principles a body of systematic manners which secures their operation  if i am asked how i would be understood in the use of these terms regicide jacobinism atheism and a system of corresponding manners and their establishment i will tell you  iregicide  i call a commonwealth regicide which lays it down as a fixed law of nature and a fundamental right of man that all government not being a democracy is a usurpation that all kings as such are usurpers and for being kings may and ought to be put to death with their wives families and adherents the commonwealth which acts uniformly upon those principles and which after abolishing every festival of religion chooses the most flagrant act of a murderous regicide treason for a feast of eternal commemoration and which forces all her people to observe itthis i call regicide by establishment  iijacobinism  jacobinism is the revolt of the enterprising talents of a country against its property when private men form themselves into associations for the purpose of destroying the preexisting laws and institutions of their country when they secure to themselves an army by dividing amongst the people of no property the estates of the ancient and lawful proprietors when a state recognises those acts when it does not make confiscations for crimes but makes crimes for confiscations when it has its principal strength and all its resources in such a violation of property when it stands chiefly upon such a violation massacring by judgments or otherwise those who make any struggle for their old legal government and their legal hereditary or acquired possessionsi call this jacobinism by establishment  iiiatheism    i call it atheism by establishment when any state as such shall not acknowledge the existence of god as a moral governor of the world when it shall offer to him no religious or moral worshipwhen it shall abolish the christian religion by a regular decreewhen it shall persecute with a cold unrelenting steady cruelty by every mode of confiscation imprisonment exile and death all its ministerswhen it shall generally shut up or pull down churches when the few buildings which remain of this kind shall be opened only for the purpose of making a profane apotheosis of monsters whose vices and crimes have no parallel amongst men and whom all other men consider as objects of general detestation and the severest animadversion of law when in the place of that religion of social benevolence and of individual selfdenial in mockery of all religion they institute impious blasphemous indecent theatric rites in honour of their vitiated perverted reason and erect altars to the personification of their own corrupted and bloody republicwhen schools and seminaries are founded at the public expense to poison mankind from generation to generation with the horrible maxims of this impietywhen wearied out with incessant martyrdom and the cries of a people hungering and thirsting for religion they permit it only as a tolerated evili call this atheism by establishment   correspondent system of manners and morals  when to these establishments of regicide of jacobinism and of atheism you add the correspondent system of manners no doubt can be left on the mind of a thinking man concerning their determined hostility to the human race manners are of more importance than laws upon them in a great measure the laws depend the law touches us but here and there and now and then manners are what vex or soothe corrupt or purify exalt or debase barbarize or refine us by a constant steady uniform insensible operation like that of the air we breathe in they give their whole form and colour to our lives according to their quality they aid morals they supply them or they totally destroy them of this the new french legislators were aware therefore with the same method and under the same authority they settled a system of manners the most licentious prostitute and abandoned that ever has been known and at the same time the most coarse rude savage and ferocious nothing in the revolution no not to a phrase or gesture not to the fashion of a hat or a shoe was left to accident all has been the result of design all has been matter of institution no mechanical means could be devised in favour of this incredible system of wickedness and vice that has not been employed the noblest passions the love of glory the love of country have been debauched into means of its preservation and its propagation all sorts of shows and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination and pervert the moral sense have been contrived they have sometimes brought forth five or six hundred drunken women calling at the bar of the assembly for the blood of their own children as being royalists or constitutionalists sometimes they have got a body of wretches calling themselves fathers to demand the murder of their sons boasting that rome had but one brutus but that they could show five hundred there were instances in which they inverted and retaliated the impiety and produced sons who called for the execution of their parents the foundation of their republic is laid in moral paradoxes their patriotism is always prodigy all those instances to be found in history whether real or fabulous of a doubtful public spirit at which morality is perplexed reason is staggered and from which affrighted nature recoils are their chosen and almost sole examples for the instruction of their youth  the whole drift of their institution is contrary to that of the wise legislators of all countries who aimed at improving instincts into morals and at grafting the virtues on the stock of the natural affections they on the contrary have omitted no pains to eradicate every benevolent and noble propensity in the mind of men in their culture it is a rule always to graft virtues on vices they think everything unworthy of the name of public virtue unless it indicates violence on the private all their new institutions and with them everything is new strike at the root of our social nature other legislators knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations and consequently the first element of all duties have endeavoured by every art to make it sacred the christian religion by confining it to the pairs and by rendering that relation indissoluble has by these two things done more towards the peace happiness settlement and civilization of the world than by any other part in this whole scheme of divine wisdom the direct contrary course has been taken in the synagogue of antichrist i mean in that forge and manufactury of all evil the sect which predominated in the constituent assembly of 1789 those monsters employed the same or greater industry to desecrate and degrade that state which other legislators have used to render it holy and honourable   ferocity of jacobinism    as to those whom they suffer to die a natural death they do not permit them to enjoy the last consolations of mankind or those rights of sepulture which indicate hope and which mere nature has taught to mankind in all countries to soothe the afflictions and to cover the infirmity of mortal condition they disgrace men in the entry into life they vitiate and enslave them through the whole course of it and they deprive them of all comfort at the conclusion of their dishonoured and depraved existence endeavouring to persuade the people that they are no better than beasts the whole body of their institution tends to make them beasts of prey furious and savage for this purpose the active part of them is disciplined into a ferocity which has no parallel to this ferocity there is joined not one of the rude unfashioned virtues which accompany the vices where the whole are left to grow up together in the rankness of uncultivated nature but nothing is left to nature in their systems  the same discipline which hardens their hearts relaxes their morals whilst courts of justice were thrust out by revolutionary tribunals and silent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion there were no fewer than nineteen or twenty theatres great and small most of them kept open at the public expense and all of them crowded every night among the gaunt haggard forms of famine and nakedness amidst the yells of murder the tears of affliction and the cries of despair the song the dance the mimic scene the buffoon laughter went on as regularly as in the gay hour of festive peace i have it from good authority that under the scaffold of judicial murder and the gaping planks that poured down blood on the spectators the space was hired out for a show of dancing dogs i think without concert we have made the very same remark on reading some of their pieces which being written for other purposes let us into a view of their social life it struck us that the habits of paris had no resemblance to the finished virtues or to the polished vice and elegant though not blameless luxury of the capital of a great empire their society was more like that of a den of outlaws upon a doubtful frontier of a lewd tavern for the revels and debauches of banditti assassins bravos smugglers and their more desperate paramours mixed with bombastic players the refuse and rejected offal of strolling theatres puffing out illsorted verses about virtue mixed with the licentious and blasphemous songs proper to the brutal and hardened course of life belonging to that sort of wretches this system of manners in itself is at war with all orderly and moral society and is in its neighbourhood unsafe if great bodies of that kind were anywhere established in a bordering territory we should have a right to demand of their governments the suppression of such a nuisance   voice of oppression  should we not obtest heaven and whatever justice there is yet on earth oppression makes wise men mad but the distemper is still the madness of the wise which is better than the sobriety of fools the cry is the voice of sacred misery exalted not into wild raving but into the sanctified frenzy of prophecy and inspirationin that bitterness of soul in that indignation of suffering virtue in that exaltation of despair would not persecuted english loyalty cry out with an awful warning voice and denounce the destruction that waits on monarchs who consider fidelity to them as the most degrading of all vices who suffer it to be punished as the most abominable of all crimes and who have no respect but for rebels traitors regicides and furious negro slaves whose crimes have broken their chains would not this warm language of high indignation have more of sound reason in it more of real affection more of true attachment than all the lullabies of flatterers who would hush monarchs to sleep in the arms of death   britain vindicated in her war with france    there is one thing in this business which appears to be wholly unaccountable or accountable on a supposition i dare not entertain for a moment i cannot help asking why all this pains to clear the british nation of ambition perfidy and the insatiate thirst of war at what period of time was it that our country has deserved that load of infamy of which nothing but preternatural humiliation in language and conduct can serve to clear us  if we have deserved this kind of evil fame from anything we have done in a state of prosperity i am sure that it is not an abject conduct in adversity than can clear our reputation well is it known that ambition can creep as well as soar the pride of no person in a flourishing condition is more justly to be dreaded than that of him who is mean and cringing under a doubtful and unprosperous fortune but it seems it was thought necessary to give some outoftheway proofs of our sincerity as well as of our freedom from ambition is then fraud and falsehood become the distinctive character of englishmen whenever your enemy chooses to accuse you of perfidy and ill faith will you put it into his power to throw you into the purgatory of selfhumiliation is his charge equal to the finding of the grand jury of europe and sufficient to put you upon your trial but on that trial i will defend the english ministry i am sorry that on some points i have on the principles i have always opposed so good a defence to make they were not the first to begin the war they did not excite the general confederacy in europe which was so properly formed on the alarm given by the jacobinism of france they did not begin with an hostile aggression on the regicides are any of their allies these parricides of their own country disciplining themselves for foreign by domestic violence were the first to attack a power that was our ally by nature by habit and by the sanction of multiplied treaties the editor has ventured to print these lines in italics because it appears while this selection from burke is preparing for the press an inflated demagogue has not only dared to deny the claims of the duke of wellington to be the hero of a nations heart but has also accused the illustrious burke of misrepresenting historical facts connected with our war in the french revolution on which side both the truth and integrity of history are to be found may safely be left to the moral decision of men who do not look at history through the exclusive medium of the market and in listening to the voice of instruction are at least enabled to distinguish the bray of an ass from the peal of a trumpet is it not true that they were the first to declare war upon this kingdom is every word in the declaration from downingstreet concerning their conduct and concerning ours and that of our allies so obviously false that it is necessary to give some newinvented proofs of our good faith in order to expunge the memory of all this perfidy   polish and french revolution    a king without authority nobles without union or subordination a people without arts industry commerce or liberty no order within no defence without no effective public force but a foreign force which entered a naked country at will and disposed of everything at pleasure here was a state of things which seemed to invite and might perhaps justify bold enterprise and desperate experiment but in what manner was this chaos brought into order the means were as striking to the imagination as satisfactory to the reason and soothing to the moral sentiments in contemplating that change humanity has everything to rejoice and to glory in nothing to be ashamed of nothing to suffer so far as it has gone it probably is the most pure and defecated public good which ever has been conferred on mankind we have seen anarchy and servitude at once removed a throne strengthened for the protection of the people without trenching on their liberties all foreign cabal banished by changing the crown from elective to hereditary and what was a matter of pleasing wonder we have seen a reigning king from an heroic love to his country exerting himself with all the toil the dexterity the management the intrigue in favour of a family of strangers with which ambitious men labour for the aggrandizement of their own ten millions of men in a way of being freed gradually and therefore safely to themselves and the state not from civil or political chains which bad as they are only fetter the mind but from substantial personal bondage inhabitants of cities before without privileges placed in the consideration which belongs to that improved and connecting situation of social life one of the most proud numerous and fierce bodies of nobility and gentry ever known in the world arranged only in the foremost rank of free and generous citizens not one man incurred loss or suffered degradation all from the king to the daylabourer were improved in their condition everything was kept in its place and order but in that place and order everything was betterd to add to this happy wonder this unheardof conjunction of wisdom and fortune not one drop of blood was spilled no treachery no outrage no system of slander more cruel than the sword no studied insults on religion morals or manners no spoil no confiscation no citizen beggared none imprisoned none exiled the whole was effected with a policy a discretion a unanimity and secrecy such as have never been before known on any occasion but such wonderful conduct was reserved for this glorious conspiracy in favour of the true and genuine rights and interests of men happy people if they know how to proceed as they have begun happy prince worthy to begin with splendour or to close with glory a race of patriots and of kings and to leave      a name which evry wind to heavn would bear      which men to speak and angels joy to hear  to finish allthis great good as in the instant it is contains in it the seeds of all further improvement and may be considered as in a regular progress because founded on similar principles towards the stable excellency of a british constitution  here was a matter for congratulation and for festive remembrance through ages here moralists and divines might indeed relax in their temperance to exhilarate their humanity but mark the character of our faction all their enthusiasm is kept for the french revolution they cannot pretend that france had stood so much in need of a change as poland they cannot pretend that poland has not obtained a better system of liberty or of government than it enjoyed before they cannot assert that the polish revolution cost more dearly than that of france to the interests and feelings of multitudes of men but the cold and subordinate light in which they look upon the one and the pains they take to preach up the other of these revolutions leave us no choice in fixing on their motives both revolutions profess liberty as their object but in obtaining this object the one proceeds from anarchy to order the other from order to anarchy the first secures its liberty by establishing its throne the other builds its freedom on the subversion of its monarchy in the one their means are unstained by crimes and their settlement favours morality in the other vice and confusion are in the very essence of their pursuit and of their enjoyment the circumstances in which these two events differ must cause the difference we make in their comparative estimation these turn the scale with the societies in favour of france ferrum est quod amant the frauds the violences the sacrileges the havoc and ruin of families the dispersion and exile of the pride and flower of a great country the disorder the confusion the anarchy the violation of property the cruel murders the inhuman confiscations and in the end the insolent domination of bloody ferocious and senseless clubsthese are the things which they love and admire what men admire and love they would surely act let us see what is done in france and then let us undervalue any the slightest danger of falling into the hands of such a merciless and savage faction   europe in 1789    in the long series of ages which have furnished the matter of history never was so beautiful and so august a spectacle presented to the moral eye as europe afforded the day before the revolution in france i knew indeed that this prosperity contained in itself the seeds of its own danger in one part of the society it caused laxity and debility in the other it produced bold spirits and dark designs a false philosophy passed from academies into courts and the great themselves were infected with the theories which conducted to their ruin knowledge which in the two last centuries either did not exist at all or existed solidly on right principles and in chosen hands was now diffused weakened and perverted general wealth loosened morals relaxed vigilance and increased presumption men of talent began to compare in the partition of the common stock of public prosperity the proportions of the dividends with the merits of the claimants as usual they found their portion not equal to their estimate or perhaps to the public estimate of their own worth when it was once discovered by the revolution in france that a struggle between establishment and rapacity could be maintained though but for one year and in one place i was sure that a practicable breach was made in the whole order of things and in every country religion that held the materials of the fabric together was first systematically loosened all other opinions under the name of prejudices must fall along with it and property left undefended by principles became a repository of spoils to tempt cupidity and not a magazine to furnish arms for defence i knew that attacked on all sides by the infernal energies of talents set in action by vice and disorder authority could not stand upon authority alone it wanted some other support than the poise of its own gravity situations formerly supported persons it now became necessary that personal qualities should support situations formerly where authority was found wisdom and virtue were presumed but now the veil was torn and to keep off sacrilegious intrusion it was necessary that in the sanctuary of government something should be disclosed not only venerable but dreadful government was at once to show itself full of virtue and full of force it was to invite partisans by making it appear to the world that a generous cause was to be asserted one fit for a generous people to engage in from passive submission was it to expect resolute defence no it must have warm advocates and passionate defenders which a heavy discontented acquiescence never could produce  what a base and foolish thing is it for any consolidated body of authority to say or to act as if it said i will put my trust not in my own virtue but in your patience i will indulge in effeminacy in indolence in corruption i will give way to all my perverse and vicious humours because you cannot punish me without the hazard of ruining yourselves   atheism cannot repent  disappointment and mortification undoubtedly they feel but to them repentance is a thing impossible they are atheists this wretched opinion by which they are possessed even to the height of fanaticism leading them to exclude from their ideas of a commonwealth the vital principle of the physical the moral and the political world engages them in a thousand absurd contrivances to fill up this dreadful void incapable of innoxious repose or honourable action or wise speculation in the lurkingholes of a foreign land into which in a common ruin they are driven to hide their heads amongst the innocent victims of their madness they are at this very hour as busy in the confection of the dirtpies of their imaginary constitutions as if they had not been quite fresh from destroying by their impious and desperate vagaries the finest country upon earth   outward dignity of the church defended    the english people are satisfied that to the great the consolations of religion are as necessary as its instructions they too are among the unhappy they feel personal pain and domestic sorrow in these they have no privilege but are subject to pay their full contingent to the contributions levied on mortality they want this sovereign balm under their gnawing cares and anxieties which being less conversant about the limited wants of animal life range without limit and are diversified by infinite combinations in the wild and unbounded regions of imagination some charitable dole is wanting to these our often very unhappy brethren to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on earth to hope or fear something to relieve in the killing languor and overlaboured lassitude of those who have nothing to do something to excite an appetite to existence in the palled satiety which attends on all pleasures which may be bought where nature is not left to her own process where even desire is anticipated and therefore fruition defeated by meditated schemes and contrivances of delight and no interval no obstacle is interposed between the wish and the accomplishment  the people of england know how little influence the teachers of religion are likely to have with the wealthy and powerful of long standing and how much less with the newly fortunate if they appear in a manner no way assorted to those with whom they must associate and over whom they must even exercise in some cases something like an authority what must they think of that body of teachers if they see it in no part above the establishment of their domestic servants if the poverty were voluntary there might be some difference strong instances of selfdenial operate powerfully on our minds and a man who has no wants has obtained great freedom and firmness and even dignity but as the mass of any description of men are but men and their poverty cannot be voluntary that disrespect which attends upon all lay property will not depart from the ecclesiastical our provident constitution has therefore taken care that those who are to instruct presumptuous ignorance those who are to be censors over insolent vice should neither incur their contempt nor live upon their alms nor will it tempt the rich to a neglect of the true medicine of their minds for these reasons whilst we provide first for the poor and with a parental solicitude we have not relegated religion like something we were ashamed to show to obscure municipalities or rustic villages no we will have her to exalt her mitred front in courts and parliaments we will have her mixed throughout the whole mass of life and blended with all the classes of society the people of england will show to the haughty potentates of the world and to their talking sophisters that a free a generous an informed nation honours the high magistrates of its church that it will not suffer the insolence of wealth and titles or any other species of proud pretension to look down with scorn upon what they look up to with reverence nor presume to trample on that acquired personal nobility which they intend always to be and which often is the fruit not the reward for what can be the reward of learning piety and virtue they can see without pain or grudging an archbishop precede a duke they can see a bishop of durham or a bishop of winchester in possession of ten thousand pounds a year and cannot conceive why it is in worse hands than estates to the like amount in the hands of this earl or that squire although it may be true that so many dogs and horses are not kept by the former and fed with the victuals which ought to nourish the children of the people it is true the whole church revenue is not always employed and to every shilling in charity nor perhaps ought it but something is generally so employed it is better to cherish virtue and humanity by leaving much to free will even with some loss to the object than to attempt to make men mere machines and instruments of a political benevolence the world on the whole will gain by a liberty without which virtue cannot exist  when once the commonwealth has established the estates of the church as property it can consistently hear nothing of the more or the less too much and too little are treason against property what evil can arise from the quantity in any hand whilst the supreme authority has the full sovereign superintendence over this as over any property to prevent every species of abuse and whenever it notably deviates to give to it a direction agreeable to the purposes of its institution in england most of us conceive that it is envy and malignity towards those who are often the beginners of their own fortune and not a love of the selfdenial and mortification of the ancient church that makes some look askance at the distinctions and honours and revenues which taken from no person are set apart for virtue the ears of the people of england are distinguishing they hear these men speak broad their tongue betrays them their language is in the patois of fraud in the cant and gibberish of hypocrisy the people of england must think so when these praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive evangelic poverty which in the spirit ought always to exist in them and in us too however we may like it but in the thing must be varied when the relation of that body to the state is altered when manners when modes of life when indeed the whole order of human affairs has undergone a total revolution we shall believe those reformers then to be honest enthusiasts not as now we think them cheats and deceivers when we see them throwing their own goods into common and submitting their own persons to the austere discipline of the early church   danger of abstract views  it is not worth our while to discuss like sophisters whether in no case some evil for the sake of some benefit is to be tolerated nothing universal can be rationally affirmed on any moral or any political subject pure metaphysical abstraction does not belong to these matters the lines of morality are not like ideal lines of mathematics they are broad and deep as well as long they admit of exceptions they demand modifications these exceptions and modifications are not made by the process of logic but by the rules of prudence prudence is not only the first in rank of the virtues political and moral but she is the director the regulator the standard of them all metaphysics cannot live without definition but prudence is cautious how she defines our courts cannot be more fearful in suffering fictitious cases to be brought before them for eliciting their determination on a point of law than prudent moralists are in putting extreme and hazardous cases of conscience upon emergencies not existing without attempting therefore to define what never can be defined the case of a revolution in government this i think may be safely affirmed that a sore and pressing evil is to be removed and that a good great in its amount and unequivocal in its nature must be probable almost to certainty before the inestimable price of our own morals and the wellbeing of a number of our fellowcitizens is paid for a revolution if ever we ought to be economists even to parsimony it is in the voluntary production of evil every revolution contains in it something of evil   appeal to impartiality  the quality of the sentence does not however decide on the justice of it angry friendship is sometimes as bad as calm enmity for this reason the cold neutrality of abstract justice is to a good and clear cause a more desirable thing than an affection liable to be any way disturbed when the trial is by friends if the decision should happen to be favourable the honour of the acquittal is lessened if adverse the condemnation is exceedingly embittered it is aggravated by coming from lips professing friendship and pronouncing judgment with sorrow and reluctance taking in the whole view of life it is more safe to live under the jurisdiction of severe but steady reason than under the empire of indulgent but capricious passion it is certainly well for mr burke that there are impartial men in the world to them i address myself pending the appeal which on his part is made from the living to the dead from the modern whigs to the ancient   historical estimate of louis xvi    the unhappy louis xvi was a man of the best intentions that probably ever reigned he was by no means deficient in talents he had a most laudable desire to supply by general reading and even by the acquisition of elemental knowledge an education in all points originally defective but nobody told him and it was no wonder he should not himself divine it that the world of which he read and the world in which he lived were no longer the same  desirous of doing everything for the best fearful of cabal distrusting his own judgment he sought his ministers of all kinds upon public testimony but as courts are the field for caballers the public is the theatre for mountebanks and imposters the cure for both those evils is in the discernment of the prince but an accurate and penetrating discernment is what in a young prince could not be looked for  his conduct in its principle was not unwise but like most other of his wellmeant designs it failed in his hands it failed partly from mere ill fortune to which speculators are rarely pleased to assign that very large share to which she is justly entitled in human affairs the failure perhaps in part was owing to his suffering his system to be vitiated and disturbed by those intrigues which it is humanly speaking impossible wholly to prevent in courts or indeed under any form of government however with these aberrations he gave himself over to a succession of the statesmen of public opinion in other things he thought that he might be a king on the terms of his predecessors he was conscious of the purity of his heart and the general good tendency of his government he flattered himself as most men in his situation will that he might consult his ease without danger to his safety it is not at all wonderful that both he and his ministers giving way abundantly in other respects to innovation should take up in policy with the tradition of their monarchy under his ancestors the monarchy had subsisted and even been strengthened by the generation or support of republics first the swiss republics grew under the guardianship of the french monarchy the dutch republics were hatched and cherished under the same incubation afterwards a republican constitution was under the influence of france established in the empire against the pretensions of its chief even whilst the monarchy of france by a series of wars and negociations and lastly by the treaties of westphalia had obtained the establishment of the protestants in germany as a law of the empire the same monarchy under louis the thirteenth had force enough to destroy the republican system of the protestants at home louis the sixteenth was a diligent reader of history but the very lamp of prudence blinded him the guide of human life led him astray a silent revolution in the moral world preceded the political and prepared it it became of more importance than ever what examples were given and what measures were adopted their causes no longer lurked in the recesses of cabinets or in the private conspiracies of the factious they were no longer to be controlled by the force and influence of the grandees who formerly had been able to stir up troubles by their discontents and to quiet them by their corruption the chain of subordination even in cabal and sedition was broken in its most important links it was no longer the great and the populace other interests were formed other dependencies other connections other communications the middle classes had swelled far beyond their former proportion like whatever is the most effectively rich and great in society these classes became the seat of all the active politics and the preponderating weight to decide on them there were all the energies by which fortune is acquired there the consequence of their success there were all the talents which assert their pretensions and are impatient of the place which settled society prescribes to them these descriptions had got between the great and the populace and the influence on the lower classes was with them the spirit of ambition had taken possession of this class as violent as ever it had done of any other they felt the importance of this situation the correspondence of the monied and the mercantile world the literary intercourse of academies but above all the press of which they had in a manner entire possession made a kind of electric communication everywhere the press in reality has made every government in its spirit almost democratic without it the great the first movements in this revolution could not perhaps have been given but the spirit of ambition now for the first time connected with the spirit of speculation was not to be restrained at will there was no longer any means of arresting a principle in its course when louis the sixteenth under the influence of the enemies to monarchy meant to found but one republic he set up two when he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbour he lost the whole of his own louis the sixteenth could not with impunity countenance a new republic yet between his throne and that dangerous lodgment for an enemy which he had erected he had the whole atlantic for a ditch he had for an outwork the english nation itself friendly to liberty adverse to that mode of it he was surrounded by a rampart of monarchies most of them allied to him and generally under his influence yet even thus secured a republic erected under his auspices and dependent on his power became fatal to his throne the very money which he had lent to support this republic by a good faith which to him operated as perfidy was punctually paid to his enemies and became a resource in the hands of his assassins   negative religion a nullity  if mere dissent from the church of rome be a merit he that dissents the most perfectly is the most meritorious in many points we hold strongly with that church he that dissents throughout with that church will dissent with the church of england and then it will be a part of his merit that he dissents with ourselvesa whimsical species of merit for any set of men to establish we quarrel to extremity with those who we know agree with us in many things but we are to be so malicious even in the principle of our friendships that we are to cherish in our bosom those who accord with us in nothing because whilst they despise ourselves they abhor even more than we do those with whom we have some disagreement a man is certainly the most perfect protestant who protests against the whole christian religion whether a persons having no christian religion be a title to favour in exclusion to the largest description of christians who hold all the doctrines of christianity though holding along with them some errors and some superfluities is rather more than any man who has not become recreant and apostate from his baptism will i believe choose to affirm the countenance given from a spirit of controversy to that negative religion may by degrees encourage light and unthinking people to a total indifference to everything positive in matters of doctrine and in the end of practice too if continued it would play the game of that sort of active proselytizing and persecuting atheism which is the disgrace and calamity of our time and which we see to be as capable of subverting a government as any mode can be of misguided zeal for better things   antechamber of regicide    to those who do not love to contemplate the fall of human greatness i do not know a more mortifying spectacle than to see the assembled majesty of the crowned heads of europe waiting as patient suitors in the antechamber of regicide they wait it seems until the sanguinary tyrant carnot shall have snorted away the fumes of the indigested blood of his sovereign then when sunk on the down of usurped pomp he shall have sufficiently indulged his meditations with what monarch he shall next glut his ravening maw he may condescend to signify that it is his pleasure to be awake and that he is at leisure to receive the proposals of his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may respite the execution of the sentence he has passed upon them at the opening of those doors what a sight it must be to behold the plenipotentiaries of royal impotence in the precedency which they will intrigue to obtain and which will be granted to them according to the seniority of their degradation sneaking into the regicide presence and with the relics of the smile which they had dressed up for the levee of their masters still flickering on their curled lips presenting the faded remains of their courtly graces to meet the scornful ferocious sardonic grin of a bloody ruffian who whilst he is receiving their homage is measuring them with his eye and fitting to their size the slider of his guillotine these ambassadors may easily return as good courtiers as they went but can they ever return from that degrading residence loyal and faithful subjects or with any true affection to their master or true attachment to the constitution religion or laws of their country there is great danger that they who enter smiling into this trophonian cave will come out of it sad and serious conspirators and such will continue as long as they live they will become true conductors of contagion to every country which has had the misfortune to send them to the source of that electricity at best they will become totally indifferent to good and evil to one institution or another this species of indifference is but too generally distinguishable in those who have been much employed in foreign courts but in the present case the evil must be aggravated without measure for they go from their country not with the pride of the old character but in a state of the lowest degradation and what must happen in their place of residence can have no effect in raising them to the level of true dignity or of chaste selfestimation either as men or as representatives of crowned heads   tremendousness of war  as if war was a matter of experiment as if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic as if the dire goddess that presides over it with her murderous spear in hand and her gorgon at her breast was a coquette to be flirted with we ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity that loves courage but commands counsel war never leaves where it found a nation it is never to be entered into without mature deliberation not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indecision but a deliberation leading to a sure and fixed judgment when so taken up it is not to be abandoned without reason as valid as fully and as extensively considered peace may be made as unadvisedly as war nothing is so rash as fear and the councils of pusillanimity very rarely put off whilst they are always sure to aggravate the evils from which they would fly   english officers  there is no want of officers that i have ever understood for the new ships which we commission or the new regiments which we raise in the nature of things it is not with their persons that the higher classes principally pay their contingent to the demands of war there is another and not less important part which rests with almost exclusive weight upon them they furnish the means      how war may best upheld     move by her two main nerves iron and gold      in all her equipage   not that they are exempt from contributing also by their personal service in the fleets and armies of their country they do contribute and in their full and fair proportion according to the relative proportion of their numbers in the community they contribute all the mind that actuates the whole machine the fortitude required of them is very different from the unthinking alacrity of the common soldier or common sailor in the face of danger and death it is not a passion it is not an impulse it is not a sentiment it is a cool steady deliberate principle always present always equable having no connection with anger tempering honour with prudence incited invigorated and sustained by a generous love of fame informed moderated and directed by an enlarged knowledge of its own great public ends flowing in one blended stream from the opposite sources of the heart and the head carrying in itself its own commission and proving its title to every other command by the first and most difficult command that of the bosom in which it resides it is a fortitude which unites with the courage of the field the more exalted and refined courage of the council which knows as well to retreat as to advance which can conquer as well by delay as by the rapidity of a march or the impetuosity of an attack which can be with fabius the black cloud that lowers on the tops of the mountains or with scipio the thunderbolt of war which undismayed by false shame can patiently endure the severest trial that a gallant spirit can undergo in the taunts and provocations of the enemy the suspicions the cold respect and mouthhonour of those from whom it should meet a cheerful obedience which undisturbed by false humanity can calmly assume that most awful moral responsibility of deciding when victory may be too dearly purchased by the loss of a single life and when the safety and glory of their country may demand the certain sacrifice of thousands different stations of command may call for different modifications of this fortitude but the character ought to be the same in all and never in the most palmy state of our martial renown did it shine with brighter lustre than in the present sanguinary and ferocious hostilities wherever the british arms have been carried   diplomacy of humiliation  it happens frequently that pride may reject a public advance while interest listens to a secret suggestion of advantage the opportunity has been afforded at a very early period in the diplomacy of humiliation a gentleman was sent on an errand of which from the motive of it whatever the event might be we can never be ashamed humanity cannot be degraded by humiliation it is its very character to submit to such things there is a consanguinity between benevolence and humility they are virtues of the same stock dignity is of as good a race but it belongs to the family of fortitude in the spirit of that benevolence we sent a gentleman to beseech the directory of regicide not to be quite so prodigal as their republic had been of judicial murder we solicited them to spare the lives of some unhappy persons of the first distinction whose safety at other times could not have been an object of solicitation they had quitted france on the faith of the declaration of the rights of citizens they never had been in the service of the regicides nor at their hands had received any stipend the very system and constitution of government that now prevails was settled subsequently to their emigration they were under the protection of great britain and in his majestys pay and service not an hostile invasion but the disasters of the sea had thrown them upon a shore more barbarous and inhospitable than the inclement ocean under the most pitiless of its storms here was an opportunity to express a feeling for the miseries of war and to open some sort of conversation which after our public overtures had glutted their pride at a cautious and jealous distance might lead to something like an accommodation what was the event a strange uncouth thing a theatrical figure of the opera his head shaded with threecoloured plumes his body fantastically habited strutted from the back scenes and after a short speech in the mock heroic falsetto of stupid tragedy delivered the gentleman who came to make the representation into the custody of a guard with directions not to lose sight of him for a moment and then ordered him to be sent from paris in two hours   relation of wealth to national dignity    we have a vast interest to preserve and we possess great means of preserving it but it is to be remembered that the artificer may be encumbered by his tools and that resources may be among impediments if wealth is the obedient and laborious slave of virtue and of public honour then wealth is in its place and has its use but if this order is changed and honour is to be sacrificed to the conservation of richesriches which have neither eyes nor hands nor anything truly vital in them cannot long survive the being of their vivifying powers their legitimate masters and their potent protectors if we command our wealth we shall be rich and free  if our wealth command us we are poor indeed we are bought by the enemy with the treasure from our own coffers too great a sense of the value of a subordinate interest may be the very source of its danger as well as the certain ruin of interests of a superior order often has a man lost his all because he would not submit to hazard all in defending it  a display of our wealth before robbers is not the way to restrain their boldness or to lessen their rapacity this display is made i know to persuade the people of england that thereby we shall awe the enemy and improve the terms of our capitulation it is made not that we should fight with more animation but that we should supplicate with better hopes we are mistaken we have an enemy to deal with who never regarded our contest as a measuring and weighing of purses he is the gaul that puts his sword into the scale he is more tempted with our wealth as booty than terrified with it as power but let us be rich or poor let us be either in what proportion we may nature is false or this is true that where the essential public force of which money is but a part is in any degree upon a par in a conflict between nations that state which is resolved to hazard its existence rather than to abandon its objects must have an infinite advantage over that which is resolved to yield rather than to carry its resistance beyond a certain point  humanly speaking that people which bounds its efforts only with its being must give the law to that nation which will not push its opposition beyond its convenience   ambassadors of infamy  on this their gaudy day the new regicide directory sent for their diplomatic rabble as bad as themselves in principle but infinitely worse in degradation they called them out by a sort of roll of their nations one after another much in the manner in which they called wretches out of their prison to the guillotine when these ambassadors of infamy appeared before them the chief director in the name of the rest treated each of them with a short affected pedantic insolent theatric laconium a sort of epigram of contempt when they had thus insulted them in a style and language which never before was heard and which no sovereign would for a moment endure from another supposing any of them frantic enough to use it to finish their outrage they drummed and trumpeted the wretches out of their hall of audience  among the objects of this insolent buffoonery was a person supposed to represent the king of prussia to this worthy representative they did not so much as condescend to mention his master they did not seem to know that he had one they addressed themselves solely to prussia in the abstract notwithstanding the infinite obligation they owed to their early protector for their first recognition and alliance and for the part of his territory he gave into their hands for the firstfruits of his homage none but dead monarchs are so much as mentioned by them and those only to insult the living by an invidious comparison they told the prussians they ought to learn after the example of frederick the great a love for france what a pity it is that he who loved france so well as to chastise it was not now alive by an unsparing use of the rod which indeed he would have spared little to give them another instance of his paternal affection but the directory were mistaken these are not days in which monarchs value themselves upon the title of great they are grown philosophic they are satisfied to be good your lordship will pardon me for this no very long reflection on the short but excellent speech of the plumed director to the ambassador of cappadocia the imperial ambassador was not in waiting but they found for austria a good judean representation with great judgment his highness the grand duke had sent the most atheistic coxcomb to be found in florence to represent at the bar of impiety the house of apostolic majesty and the descendants of the pious though highminded maria theresa he was sent to humble the whole race of austria before those grim assassins reeking with the blood of the daughter of maria theresa whom they sent halfdead in a dungcart to a cruel execution and this trueborn son of apostasy and infidelity this renegado from the faith and from all honour and all humanity drove an austrian coach over the stones which were yet wet with her bloodwith that blood which dropped every step through her tumbril all the way she was drawn from the horrid prison in which they had finished all the cruelty and horrors not executed in the face of the sun the hungarian subjects of maria theresa when they drew their swords to defend her rights against france called her with correctness of truth though not with the same correctness perhaps of grammar a king moriamur pro rege nostro maria theresashe lived and died a king and others will have subjects ready to make the same vow when in either sex they show themselves real kings   difficulty the path to glory  when you choose an arduous and slippery path god forbid that any weak feelings of my declining age which calls for soothings and supports and which can have none but from you should make me wish that you should abandon what you are about or should trifle with it in this house we submit though with troubled minds to that order which has connected all great duties with toils and with perils which has conducted the road to glory through the regions of obloquy and reproach and which will never suffer the disparaging alliance of spurious false and fugitive praise with genuine and permanent reputation we know that the power which has settled that order and subjected you to it by placing you in the situation you are in is able to bring you out of it with credit and with safety his will be done all must come right you may open the way with pain and under reproach others will pursue it with ease and with applause   robespierre and his counterparts    they have murdered one robespierre  this robespierre they tell us was a cruel tyrant and now that he is put out of the way all will go well in france astraea will again return to that earth from which she has been an emigrant and all nations will resort to her golden scales it is very extraordinary that the very instant the mode of paris is known here it becomes all the fashion in london this is their jargon it is the old bon ton of robbers who cast their common crimes on the wickedness of their departed associates i care little about the memory of this same robespierre i am sure he was an execrable villain i rejoiced at his punishment neither more nor less than i should at the execution of the present directory or any of its members but who gave robespierre the power of being a tyrant and who were the instruments of his tyranny the present virtuous constitutionmongers he was a tyrant they were his satellites and his hangmen their sole merit is in the murder of their colleague they have expiated their other murders by a new murder it has always been the case among this banditti they have always had the knife at each others throats after they had almost blunted it at the throats of every honest man these people thought that in the commerce of murder he was like to have the better of the bargain if any time was lost they therefore took one of their short revolutionary methods and massacred him in a manner so perfidious and cruel as would shock all humanity if the stroke was not struck by the present rulers on one of their own associates but this last act of infidelity and murder is to expiate all the rest and to qualify them for the amity of a humane and virtuous sovereign and civilized people i have heard that a tartar believes when he has killed a man that all his estimable qualities pass with his clothes and arms to the murderer but i have never heard that it was the opinion of any savage scythian that if he kills a brother villain he is ipso facto absolved of all his own offences the tartarian doctrine is the most tenable opinion the murderers of robespierre besides what they are entitled to by being engaged in the same tontine of infamy are his representatives have inherited all his murderous qualities in addition to their own private stock but it seems we are always to be of a party with the last and victorious assassins i confess i am of a different mind and am rather inclined of the two to think and speak less hardly of a dead ruffian than to associate with the living i could better bear the stench of the gibbeted murderer than the society of the bloody felons who yet annoy the world whilst they wait the recompense due to their ancient crimes they merit new punishment by the new offences they commit there is a period to the offences of robespierre they survive in his assassins better a living dog says the old proverb than a dead lion not so here murderers and hogs never look well till they are hanged from villany no good can arise but in the example of its fate so i leave them their dead robespierre either to gibbet his memory or to deify him in their pantheon with their marat and their mirabeau   accumulation a state principle  there must be some impulse besides public spirit to put private interest into motion along with it monied men ought to be allowed to set a value on their money if they did not there could be no monied men this desire of accumulation is a principle without which the means of their service to the state could not exist the love of lucre though sometimes carried to a ridiculous sometimes to a vicious excess is the grand cause of prosperity to all states in this natural this reasonable this powerful this prolific principle it is for the satirist to expose the ridiculous it is for the moralist to censure the vicious it is for the sympathetic heart to reprobate the hard and cruel it is for the judge to animadvert on the fraud the extortion and the oppression but it is for the statesman to employ it as he finds it with all its concomitant excellencies with all its imperfections on its head it is his part in this case as it is in all other cases where he is to make use of the general energies of nature to take them as he finds them   warning for a nation  with all these causes of corruption we may well judge what the general fashion of mind will be through both sexes and all conditions such spectacles and such examples will overbear all the laws that ever blackened the cumbrous volumes of our statutes when royalty shall have disavowed itself when it shall have relaxed all the principles of its own support when it has rendered the system of regicide fashionable and received it as triumphant in the very persons who have consolidated that system by the perpetration of every crime who have not only massacred the prince but the very laws and magistrates which were the support of royalty and slaughtered with an indiscriminate proscription without regard to either sex or age every person that was suspected of an inclination to king law or magistracyi say will any one dare to be loyal will any one presume against both authority and opinion to hold up this unfashionable antiquated exploded constitution the jacobin faction in england must grow in strength and audacity it will be supported by other intrigues and supplied by other resources than yet we have seen in action confounded at its growth the government may fly to parliament for its support but who will answer for the temper of a house of commons elected under these circumstances who will answer for the courage of a house of commons to arm the crown with the extraordinary powers that it may demand but the ministers will not venture to ask half of what they know they want they will lose half of that half in the contest and when they have obtained their nothing they will be driven by the cries of faction either to demolish the feeble works they have thrown up in a hurry or in effect to abandon them as to the house of lords it is not worth mentioning the peers ought naturally to be the pillars of the crown but when their titles are rendered contemptible and their property invidious and a part of their weakness and not of their strength they will be found so many degraded and trembling individuals who will seek by evasion to put off the evil day of their ruin both houses will be in perpetual oscillation between abortive attempts at energy and still more unsuccessful attempts at compromise you will be impatient of your disease and abhorrent of your remedy a spirit of subterfuge and a tone of apology will enter into all your proceedings whether of law or legislation your judges who now sustain so masculine an authority will appear more on their trial than the culprits they have before them the awful frown of criminal justice will be smoothed into the silly smile of seduction judges will think to insinuate and soothe the accused into conviction and condemnation and to wheedle to the gallows the most artful of all delinquents but they will not be so wheedled they will not submit even to the appearance of persons on their trial their claim to this exception will be admitted the place in which some of the greatest names which ever distinguished the history of this country have stood will appear beneath their dignity the criminal will climb from the dock to the sidebar and take his place and his tea with the counsel from the bar of the counsel by a natural progress he will ascend to the bench which long before had been virtually abandoned they who escape from justice will not suffer a question upon reputation they will take the crown of the causeway they will be revered as martyrs they will triumph as conquerors nobody will dare to censure that popular part of the tribunal whose only restraint on misjudgment is the censure of the public they who find fault with the decision will be represented as enemies to the institution juries that convict for the crown will be loaded with obloquy the juries who acquit will be held up as models of justice if parliament orders a prosecution and fails as fail it will it will be treated to its face as guilty of a conspiracy maliciously to prosecute its care in discovering a conspiracy against the state will be treated as a forged plot to destroy the liberty of the subject every such discovery instead of strengthening government will weaken its reputation  in this state things will be suffered to proceed lest measures of vigour should precipitate a crisis the timid will act thus from character the wise from necessity our laws had done all that the old condition of things dictated to render our judges erect and independent but they will naturally fail on the side upon which they had taken no precautions the judicial magistrates will find themselves safe as against the crown whose will is not their tenure the power of executing their office will be held at the pleasure of those who deal out fame or abuse as they think fit they will begin rather to consult their own repose and their own popularity than the critical and perilous trust that is in their hands they will speculate on consequences when they see at court an ambassador whose robes are lined with a scarlet dyed in the blood of judges it is no wonder nor are they to blame when they are to consider how they shall answer for their conduct to the criminal of today turned into the magistrate of tomorrow   santerre and tallien  is it only an oppressive nightmare with which we have been loaded is it then all a frightful dream and are there no regicides in the world have we not heard of that prodigy of a ruffian who would not suffer his benignant sovereign with his hands tied behind him and stripped for execution to say one parting word to his deluded peopleof santerre who commanded the drums and trumpets to strike up to stifle his voice and dragged him backward to the machine of murder this nefarious villain for a few days i may call him so stands high in france as in a republic of robbers and murderers he ought what hinders this monster from being sent as ambassador to convey to his majesty the first compliments of his brethren the regicide directory they have none that can represent them more properly i anticipate the day of his arrival he will make his public entry into london on one of the pale horses of his brewery as he knows that we are pleased with the paris taste for the orders of knighthood he will fling a bloody sash across his shoulders with the order of the holy guillotine surmounting the crown appendant to the riband thus adorned he will proceed from whitechapel to the further end of pall mall all the music of london playing the marseillais hymn before him and escorted by a chosen detachment of the legion de lechaffaud it were only to be wished that no illfated loyalist for the imprudence of his zeal may stand in the pillory at charing cross under the statue of king charles the first at the time of this grand procession lest some of the rotten eggs which the constitutional society shall let fly at his indiscreet head may hit the virtuous murderer of his king they might soil the state dress which the ministers of so many crowned heads have admired and in which sir clement cotterel is to introduce him at st jamess  if santerre cannot be spared from the constitutional butcheries at home tallien may supply his place and in point of figure with advantage he has been habituated to commissions and he is as well qualified as santerre for this nero wished the roman people had but one neck the wish of the more exalted tallien when he sat in judgment was that his sovereign had eightythree heads that he might send one to every one of the departments tallien will make an excellent figure at guildhall at the next sheriffs feast he may open the ball with my lady mayoress but this will be after he has retired from the public table and gone into the private room for the enjoyment of more social and unreserved conversation with the ministers of state and the judges of the bench there these ministers and magistrates will hear him entertain the worthy aldermen with an instructing and pleasing narrative of the manner in which he made the rich citizens of bordeaux squeak and gently led them by the public credit of the guillotine to disgorge their antirevolutionary pelf  all this will be the display and the towntalk when our regicide is on a visit of ceremony at home nothing will equal the pomp and splendour of the hotel de la republique there another scene of gaudy grandeur will be opened when his citizen excellency keeps the festival which every citizen is ordered to observe for the glorious execution of louis the sixteenth and renews his oath of detestation of kings a grand ball of course will be given on the occasion then what a hurlyburlywhat a crowdingwhat a glare of a thousand flambeaux in the squarewhat a clamour of footmen contending at the doorwhat a rattling of a thousand coaches of duchesses countesses and lady marys choking the way and overturning each other in a struggle who should be first to pay her court to the citoyenne the spouse of the twentyfirst husband he the husband of the thirtyfirst wife and to hail her in the rank of honourable matrons before the four days duration of marriage is expiredmorals as they weredecorum the great outguard of the sex and the proud sentiment of honour which makes virtue more respectable where it is and conceals human frailty where virtue may not be will be banished from this land of propriety modesty and reserve   sir sydney smith    this officer having attempted with great gallantry to cut out a vessel from one of the enemys harbours was taken after an obstinate resistance such as obtained him the marked respect of those who were witnesses of his valour and knew the circumstances in which it was displayed upon his arrival at paris he was instantly thrown into prison where the nature of his situation will best be understood by knowing that amongst its mitigations was the permission to walk occasionally in the court and to enjoy the privilege of shaving himself on the old system of feelings and principles his sufferings might have been entitled to consideration and even in a comparison with those of citizen la fayette to a priority in the order of compassion  if the ministers had neglected to take any steps in his favour a declaration of the sense of the house of commons would have stimulated them to their duty if they had caused a representation to be made such a proceeding would have added force to it if reprisal should be thought advisable the address of the house would have given an additional sanction to a measure which would have been indeed justifiable without any other sanction than its own reason but no nothing at all like it  in fact the merit of sir sydney smith and his claim on british compassion was of a kind altogether different from that which interested so deeply the authors of the motion in favour of citizen la fayette in my humble opinion captain sir sydney smith has another sort of merit with the british nation and something of a higher claim on british humanity than citizen la fayette faithful zealous and ardent in the service of his king and country full of spirit full of resources going out of the beaten road but going right because his uncommon enterprise was not conducted by a vulgar judgmentin his profession sir sydney smith might be considered as a distinguished person if any person could well be distinguished in a service in which scarcely a commander can be named without putting you in mind of some action of intrepidity skill and vigilance that has given them a fair title to contend with any men and in any age but i will say nothing farther of the merits of sir sydney smith the mortal animosity of the regicide enemy supersedes all other panegyric their hatred is a judgment in his favour without appeal at present he is lodged in the tower of the temple the last prison of louis the sixteenth and the last but one of maria antonietta of austria the prison of louis the seventeenth the prison of elizabeth of bourbon there he lies unpitied by the grand philanthropy to meditate upon the fate of those who are faithful to their king and country whilst this prisoner secluded from intercourse was indulging in these cheering reflections he might possibly have had the further consolation of learning by means of the insolent exultation of his guards that there was an english ambassador at paris he might have had the proud comfort of hearing that this ambassador had the honour of passing his mornings in respectful attendance at the office of a regicide pettifogger and that in the evening he relaxed in the amusements of the opera and in the spectacle of an audience totally new an audience in which he had the pleasure of seeing about him not a single face that he could formerly have known in paris but in the place of that company one indeed more than equal to it in display of gaiety splendour and luxury a set of abandoned wretches squandering in insolent riot the spoils of their bleeding country a subject of profound reflection both to the prisoner and to the ambassador   a moral distinction  i think we might have found before the rude hand of insolent office was on our shoulder and the staff of usurped authority brandished over our heads that contempt of the suppliant is not the best forwarder of a suit that national disgrace is not the high road to security much less to power and greatness patience indeed strongly indicates the love of peace but mere love does not always lead to enjoyment it is the power of winning that palm which ensures our wearing it virtues have their place and out of their place they hardly deserve the name they pass into the neighbouring vice the patience of fortitude and the endurance of pusillanimity are things very different as in their principle so in their effects   infidels and their policy  in the revolution of france two sorts of men were principally concerned in giving a character and determination to its pursuits the philosophers and the politicians they took different ways but they met in the same end the philosophers had one predominant object which they pursued with a fanatical fury that is the utter extirpation of religion to that every question of empire was subordinate they had rather domineer in a parish of atheists than rule over a christian world their temporal ambition was wholly subservient to their proselytizing spirit in which they were not exceeded by mahomet himself they who have made but superficial studies in the natural history of the human mind have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only cause of enthusiastic zeal and sectarian propagation but there is no doctrine whatever on which men can warm that is not capable of the very same effect the social nature of man impels him to propagate his principles as much as physical impulses urge him to propagate his kind the passions give zeal and vehemence the understanding bestows design and system the whole man moves under the discipline of his opinions religion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm when anything concerning it becomes an object of much meditation it cannot be indifferent to the mind they who do not love religion hate it the rebels to god perfectly abhor the author of their being they hate him with all their heart with all their mind with all their soul and with all their strength he never presents himself to their thoughts but to menace and alarm them they cannot strike the sun out of heaven but they are able to raise a smouldering smoke that obscures him from their own eyes not being able to revenge themselves on god they have a delight in vicariously defacing degrading torturing and tearing in pieces his image in man let no one judge of them by what he has conceived of them when they were not incorporated and had no lead they were then only passengers in a common vehicle they were then carried along with the general motion of religion in the community and without being aware of it partook of its influence in that situation at worst their nature was left free to counterwork their principles they despaired of giving any very general currency to their opinions they considered them as a reserved privilege for the chosen few but when the possibility of dominion lead and propagation presented itself and that the ambition which before had so often made them hypocrites might rather gain than lose by a daring avowal of their sentiments then the nature of this infernal spirit which has evil for its good appeared in its full perfection nothing indeed but the possession of some power can with any certainty discover what at the bottom is the true character of any man without reading the speeches of vergniaud francian of nantes isnard and some others of that sort it would not be easy to conceive the passion rancour and malice of their tongues and hearts they worked themselves up to a perfect frenzy against religion and all its professors they tore the reputation of the clergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives before they lacerated their bodies by their massacres this fanatical atheism left out we omit the principal feature in the french revolution and a principal consideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a peace with it  the other sort of men were the politicians to them who had little or not at all reflected on the subject religion was in itself no object of love or hatred they disbelieved it and that was all neutral with regard to that object they took the side which in the present state of things might best answer their purposes they soon found that they could not do without the philosophers and the philosophers soon made them sensible that the destruction of religion was to supply them with means of conquest first at home and then abroad the philosophers were the active internal agitators and supplied the spirit and principles the second gave the practical direction sometimes the one predominated in the composition sometimes the other the only difference between them was in the necessity of concealing the general design for a time and in their dealing with foreign nations the fanatics going straightforward and openly the politicians by the surer mode of zigzag in the course of events this among other causes produced fierce and bloody contentions between them but at the bottom they thoroughly agreed in all the objects of ambition and irreligion and substantially in all the means of promoting these ends   what a minister should attempt    after such an elaborate display had been made of the injustice and insolence of an enemy who seems to have been irritated by every one of the means which had been commonly used with effect to soothe the rage of intemperate power the natural result would be that the scabbard in which we in vain attempted to plunge our sword should have been thrown away with scorn it would have been natural that rising in the fulness of their might insulted majesty despised dignity violated justice rejected supplication patience goaded into fury would have poured out all the length of the reins upon all the wrath which they had so long restrained it might have been expected that emulous of the glory of the youthful hero in alliance with him touched by the example of what one man well formed and well placed may do in the most desperate state of affairs convinced there is a courage of the cabinet full as powerful and far less vulgar than that of the field our minister would have changed the whole line of that useless prosperous prudence which had hitherto produced all the effects of the blindest temerity if he found his situation full of danger and i do not deny that it is perilous in the extreme he must feel that it is also full of glory and that he is placed on a stage than which no muse of fire that had ascended the highest heaven of invention could imagine anything more awful and august it was hoped that in this swelling scene in which he moved with some of the first potentates of europe for his fellowactors and with so many of the rest for the anxious spectators of a part which as he plays it determines for ever their destiny and his own like ulysses in the unravelling point of the epic story he would have thrown off his patience and his rags together and stripped of unworthy disguises he would have stood forth in the form and in the attitude of a hero on that day it was thought he would have assumed the port of mars that he would bid to be brought forth from their hideous kennel where his scrupulous tenderness had too long immured them those impatient dogs of war whose fierce regards affright even the minister of vengeance that feeds them that he would let them loose in famine fever plagues and death upon a guilty race to whose frame and to all whose habit order peace religion and virtue are alien and abhorrent it was expected that he would at last have thought of active and effectual war that he would no longer amuse the british lion in the chase of mice and rats that he would no longer employ the whole naval power of great britain once the terror of the world to prey upon the miserable remains of a peddling commerce which the enemy did not regard and from which none could profit it was expected that he would have reasserted the justice of his cause that he would have reanimated whatever remained to him of his allies and endeavoured to recover those whom their fears had led astray that he would have rekindled the martial ardour of his citizens that he would have held out to them the example of their ancestry the assertor of europe and the scourge of french ambition that he would have reminded them of a posterity which if this nefarious robbery under the fraudulent name and false colour of a government should in full power be seated in the heart of europe must for ever be consigned to vice impiety barbarism and the most ignominious slavery of body and mind in so holy a cause it was presumed that he would as in the beginning of the war he did have opened all the temples and with prayer with fasting and with supplication better directed than to the grim moloch of regicide in france have called upon us to raise that united cry which has so often stormed heaven and with a pious violence forced down blessings upon a repentant people it was hoped that when he had invoked upon his endeavours the favourable regard of the protector of the human race it would be seen that his menaces to the enemy and his prayers to the almighty were not followed but accompanied with correspondent action it was hoped that his shrilling trumpet should be heard not to announce a show but to sound a charge   law of vicinity  this violent breach in the community of europe we must conclude to have been made even if they had not expressly declared it over and over again either to force mankind into an adoption of their system or to live in perpetual enmity with a community the most potent we have ever known can any person imagine that in offering to mankind this desperate alternative there is no indication of a hostile mind because men in possession of the ruling authority are supposed to have a right to act without coercion in their own territories as to the right of men to act anywhere according to their pleasure without any moral tie no such right exists men are never in a state of total independence of each other it is not the condition of our nature nor is it conceivable how any man can pursue a considerable course of action without its having some effect upon others or of course without producing some degree of responsibility for his conduct the situations in which men relatively stand produce the rules and principles of that responsibility and afford directions to prudence in exacting it distance of place does not extinguish the duties or the rights of men but it often renders their exercise impracticable the same circumstance of distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any community less pernicious but there are situations where this difficulty does not occur and in which therefore these duties are obligatory and these rights are to be asserted it has ever been the method of public jurists to draw a great part of the analogies on which they form the law of nations from the principles of law which prevail in civil community civil laws are not all of them merely positive those which are rather conclusions of legal reason than matters of statutable provision belong to universal equity and are universally applicable almost the whole praetorian law is such there is a law of neighbourhood which does not leave a man perfectly master on his own ground when a neighbour sees a new erection in the nature of a nuisance set up at his door he has a right to represent it to the judge who on his part has a right to order the work to be stayed or if established to be removed on this head the parent law is express and clear and has made many wise provisions which without destroying regulate and restrain the right of ownership by the right of vicinage no innovation is permitted that may redound even secondarily to the prejudice of a neighbour the whole doctrine of that important head of praetorian law de novi operis nunciatione is founded on the principle that no new use should be made of a mans private liberty of operating upon his private property from whence a detriment may be justly apprehended by his neighbour this law of denunciation is prospective it is to anticipate what is called damnum infectum or damnum nondum factum that is a damage justly apprehended but not actually done even before it is clearly known whether the innovation be damageable or not the judge is competent to issue a prohibition to innovate until the point can be determined this prompt interference is grounded on principles favourable to both parties it is preventive of mischief difficult to be repaired and of ill blood difficult to be softened the rule of law therefore which comes before the evil is amongst the very best parts of equity and justifies the promptness of the remedy because as it is well observed res damni infecti celeritatem desiderat et periculosa est dilatio this right of denunciation does not hold when things continue however inconveniently to the neighbourhood according to the ancient mode for there is a sort of presumption against novelty drawn out of a deep consideration of human nature and human affairs and the maxim of jurisprudence is well laid down vetustas pro lege semper habetur  such is the law of civil vicinity now where there is no constituted judge as between independent states there is not the vicinage itself is the natural judge it is preventively the assertor of its own rights or remedially their avenger neighbours are presumed to take cognizance of each others acts vicini vicinorum facta praesumuntur scire this principle which like the rest is as true of nations as of individual men has bestowed on the grand vicinage of europe a duty to know and a right to prevent any capital innovation which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nuisance   european community  the operation of dangerous and delusive first principles obliges us to have recourse to the true ones in the intercourse between nations we are apt to rely too much on the instrumental part we lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts we do not act much more wisely when we trust to the interests of men as guarantees of their engagements the interests frequently tear to pieces the engagements and the passions trample upon both entirely to trust to either is to disregard our own safety or not to know mankind men are not tied to one another by papers and seals they are led to associate by resemblances by conformities by sympathies it is with nations as with individuals nothing is so strong a tie of amity between nation and nation as correspondence in laws customs manners and habits of life they have more than the force of treaties in themselves they are obligations written in the heart they approximate men to men without their knowledge and sometimes against their intentions the secret unseen but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourse holds them together even when their perverse and litigious nature sets them to equivocate scuffle and fight about the terms of their written obligations as to war if it be the means of wrong and violence it is the sole means of justice amongst nations nothing can banish it from the world they who say otherwise intending to impose upon us do not impose upon themselves but it is one of the greatest objects of human wisdom to mitigate those evils which we are unable to remove the conformity and analogy of which i speak incapable like everything else of preserving perfect trust and tranquillity among men has a strong tendency to facilitate accommodation and to produce a generous oblivion of the rancour of their quarrels with this similitude peace is more of peace and war is less of war i will go further there have been periods of time in which communities apparently in peace with each other have been more perfectly separated than in latter times many nations in europe have been in the course of long and bloody wars the cause must be sought in the similitude throughout europe of religion laws and manners at bottom these are all the same the writers on public law have often called this aggregate of nations a commonwealth they had reason it is virtually one great state having the same basis of general law with some diversity of provincial customs and local establishments the nations of europe have had the very same christian religion agreeing in the fundamental parts varying a little in the ceremonies and in the subordinate doctrines the whole of the polity and economy of every country in europe has been derived from the same sources it was drawn from the old germanic or gothic custumary from the feudal institutions which must be considered as an emanation from that custumary and the whole has been improved and digested into system and discipline by the roman law from hence arose the several orders with or without a monarch which are called states in every european country the strong traces of which where monarchy predominated were never wholly extinguished or merged in despotism in the few places where monarchy was cast off the spirit of european monarchy was still left those countries still continued countries of states that is of classes orders and distinctions such as had before subsisted or nearly so indeed the force and form of the institution called states continued in greater perfection in those republican communities than under monarchies from all those sources arose a system of manners and of education which was nearly similar in all this quarter of the globe and which softened blended and harmonized the colours of the whole   perils of jacobin peace    the same temper which brings us to solicit a jacobin peace will induce us to temporize with all the evils of it by degrees our minds will be made to our circumstances the novelty of such things which produces half the horror and all the disgust will be worn off our ruin will be disguised in profit and the sale of a few wretched baubles will bribe a degenerate people to barter away the most precious jewel of their souls our constitution is not made for this kind of warfare it provides greatly for our happinessit furnishes few means for our defence it is formed in a great measure upon the principle of jealousy of the crown and as things stood when it took that turn with very great reason i go further it must keep alive some part of that fire of jealousy eternally and chastely burning or it cannot be the british constitution at various periods we have had tyranny in this country more than enough we have had rebellions with more or less justification some of our kings have made adulterous connections abroad and trucked away for foreign gold the interests and glory of their crown but before this time our liberty has never been corrupted i mean to say that it has never been debauched from its domestic relations to this time it has been english liberty and english liberty only our love of liberty and our love of our country were not distinct things liberty is now it seems put upon a larger and more liberal bottom we are men and as men undoubtedly nothing human is foreign to us we cannot be too liberal in our general wishes for the happiness of our kind but in all questions on the mode of procuring it for any particular community we ought to be fearful of admitting those who have no interest in it or who have perhaps an interest against it into the consultation above all we cannot be too cautious in our communication with those who seek their happiness by other roads than those of humanity morals and religion and whose liberty consists and consists alone in being free from those restraints which are imposed by the virtues upon the passions  when we invite danger from a confidence in defensive measures we ought first of all to be sure that it is a species of danger against which any defensive measures that can be adopted will be sufficient next we ought to know that the spirit of our laws or that our own dispositions which are stronger than laws are susceptible of all those defensive measures which the occasion may require a third consideration is whether these measures will not bring more odium than strength to government and the last whether the authority that makes them in a general corruption of manners and principles can insure their execution let no one argue from the state of things as he sees them at present concerning what will be the means and capacities of government when the time arrives which shall call for remedies commensurate to enormous evils  it is an obvious truth that no constitution can defend itself it must be defended by the wisdom and fortitude of men these are what no constitution can give they are the gifts of god and he alone knows whether we shall possess such gifts at the time when we stand in need of them constitutions furnish the civil means of getting at the natural it is all that in this case they can do but our constitution has more impediments than helps its excellencies when they come to be put to this sort of proof may be found among its defects  nothing looks more awful and imposing than an ancient fortification its lofty embattled walls its bold projecting rounded towers that pierce the sky strike the imagination and promise inexpugnable strength but they are the very things that make its weakness you may as well think of opposing one of these old fortresses to the mass of artillery brought by a french irruption into the field as to think of resisting by your old laws and your old forms the new destruction which the corps of jacobin engineers of today prepare for all such forms and all such laws besides the debility and false principle of their construction to resist the present modes of attack the fortress itself is in ruinous repair and there is a practicable breach in every part of it  such is the work but miserable works have been defended by the constancy of the garrison weatherbeaten ships have been brought safe to port by the spirit and alertness of the crew but it is here that we shall eminently fail the day that by their consent the seat of regicide has its place among the thrones of europe there is no longer a motive for zeal in their favour it will at best be cold unimpassioned dejected melancholy duty the glory will seem all on the other side the friends of the crown will appear not as champions but as victims discountenanced mortified lowered defeated they will fall into listlessness and indifference they will leave things to take their course enjoy the present hour and submit to the common fate   parliamentary and regal prerogative    your throne cannot stand secure upon the principles of unconditional submission and passive obedience on powers exercised without the concurrence of the people to be governed on acts made in defiance of their prejudices and habits on acquiescence procured by foreign mercenary troops and secured by standing armies these may possibly be the foundation of other thrones  they must be the subversion of yours it was not to passive principles in our ancestors that we owe the honour of appearing before a sovereign who cannot feel that he is a prince without knowing that we ought to be free the revolution is a departure from the ancient course of the descent of this monarchy the people at that time reentered into their original rights and it was not because a positive law authorized what was then done but because the freedom and safety of the subject the origin and cause of all laws required a proceeding paramount and superior to them at that evermemorable and instructive period the letter of the law was superseded in favour of the substance of liberty  to the free choice therefore of the people without either king or parliament we owe that happy establishment out of which both king and parliament were regenerated from that great principle of liberty have originated the statutes confirming and ratifying the establishment from which your majesty derives your right to rule over us those statutes have not given us our liberties our liberties have produced them every hour of your majestys reign your title stands upon the very same foundation on which it was at first laid and we do not know a better on which it can possibly be placed  convinced sir that you cannot have different rights and a different security in different parts of your dominions we wish to lay an even platform for your throne and to give it an unmovable stability by laying it on the general freedom of your people and by securing to your majesty that confidence and affection in all parts of your dominions which makes your best security and dearest title in this the chief seat of your empire  such sir being amongst us the foundation of monarchy itself much more clearly and much more peculiarly is it the ground of all parliamentary power parliament is a security provided for the protection of freedom and not a subtile fiction contrived to amuse the people in its place the authority of both houses can still less than that of the crown be supported upon different principles in different places so as to be for one part of your subjects a protector of liberty and for another a fund of despotism through which prerogative is extended by occasional powers whenever an arbitrary will finds itself straitened by the restrictions of law had it seemed good to parliament to consider itself as the indulgent guardian and strong protector of the freedom of the subordinate popular assemblies instead of exercising its power to their annihilation there is no doubt that it never could have been their inclination because not their interest to raise questions on the extent of parliamentary rights or to enfeeble privileges which were the security of their own powers evident from necessity and not suspicious from an alarming mode or purpose in the exertion would as formerly they were be cheerfully submitted to and these would have been fully sufficient for conservation of unity in the empire and for directing its wealth to one common centre another use has produced other consequences and a power which refuses to be limited by moderation must either be lost or find other more distinct and satisfactory limitations   burkes design in his greatest work    he had undertaken to demonstrate by arguments which he thought could not be refuted and by documents which he was sure could not be denied that no comparison was to be made between the british government and the french usurpation that they who endeavoured madly to compare them were by no means making the comparison of one good system with another good system which varied only in local and circumstantial differences much less that they were holding out to us a superior pattern of legal liberty which we might substitute in the place of our old and as they described it superannuated constitution he meant to demonstrate that the french scheme was not a comparative good but a positive evil that the question did not at all turn as had been stated on a parallel between a monarchy and a republic he denied that the present scheme of things in france did at all deserve the respectable name of a republic he had therefore no comparison between monarchies and republics to make that what was done in france was a wild attempt to methodize anarchy to perpetuate and fix disorder that it was a foul impious monstrous thing wholly out of the course of moral nature he undertook to prove that it was generated in treachery fraud falsehood hypocrisy and unprovoked murder he offered to make out that those who had led in that business had conducted themselves with the utmost perfidy to their colleagues in function and with the most flagrant perjury both towards their king and their constituents to the one of whom the assembly had sworn fealty and to the other when under no sort of violence or constraint they had sworn a full obedience to instructionsthat by the terror of assassination they had driven away a very great number of the members so as to produce a false appearance of a majoritythat this fictitious majority had fabricated a constitution which as now it stands is a tyranny far beyond any example that can be found in the civilized european world of our age that therefore the lovers of it must be lovers not of liberty but if they really understand its nature of the lowest and basest of all servitude  he proposed to prove that the present state of things in france is not a transient evil productive as some have too favourably represented it of a lasting good but that the present evil is only the means of producing future and if that were possible worse evilsthat it is not an undigested imperfect and crude scheme of liberty which may gradually be mellowed and ripened into an orderly and social freedom but that it is so fundamentally wrong as to be utterly incapable of correcting itself by any length of time or of being formed into any mode of polity of which a member of the house of commons could publicly declare his approbation   lord keppel  i ever looked on lord keppel as one of the greatest and best men of his age and i loved and cultivated him accordingly he was much in my heart and i believe i was in his to the very last beat it was at his trial at portsmouth that he gave me this picture with what zeal and anxious affection i attended him through that his agony of glory what part my son took in the early flush and enthusiasm of his virtue and the pious passion with which he attached himself to all my connections with what prodigality we both squandered ourselves in courting almost every sort of enmity for his sake i believe he felt just as i should have felt such friendship on such an occasion i partook indeed of this honour with several of the first and best and ablest in the kingdom but i was behindhand with none of them and i am sure that if to the eternal disgrace of this nation and to the total annihilation of every trace of honour and virtue in it things had taken a different turn from what they did i should have attended him to the quarterdeck with no less goodwill and more pride though with far other feelings than i partook of the general flow of national joy that attended the justice that was done to his virtue  pardon my lord the feeble garrulity of age which loves to diffuse itself in discourse of the departed great at my years we live in retrospect alone and wholly unfitted for the society of vigorous life we enjoy the best balm to all wounds the consolation of friendship in those only whom we have lost for ever feeling the loss of lord keppel at all times at no time did i feel it so much as on the first day when i was attacked in the house of lords  had he lived that reverend form would have risen in its place and with a mild parental reprehension to his nephew the duke of bedford he would have told him that the favour of that gracious prince who had honoured his virtues with the government of the navy of great britain and with a seat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom was not undeservedly shown to the friend of the best portion of his life and his faithful companion and counsellor under his rudest trials he would have told him that to whomever else these reproaches might be becoming they were not decorous in his near kindred he would have told him that when men in that rank lose decorum they lose everything on that day i had a loss in lord keppel but the public loss of him in this awful crisis i speak from much knowledge of the person he never would have listened to any compromise with the rabble rout of this sansculotterie of france his goodness of heart his reason his taste his public duty his principles his prejudices would have repelled him for ever from all connection with that horrid medley of madness vice impiety and crime  lord keppel had two countries one of descent and one of birth their interest and their glory are the same and his mind was capacious of both his family was noble and it was dutch that is he was the oldest and purest nobility that europe can boast among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land though it was never shown in insult to any human being lord keppel was something high it was a wild stock of pride on which the tenderest of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues he valued ancient nobility and he was not disinclined to augment it with new honours he valued the old nobility and the new not as an excuse for inglorious sloth but as an incitement to virtuous activity he considered it as a sort of cure for selfishness and a narrow mind conceiving that a man born in an elevated place in himself was nothing but everything in what went before and what was to come after him without much speculation but by the sure instinct of ingenuous feelings and by the dictates of plain unsophisticated natural understanding he felt that no great commonwealth could by any possibility long subsist without a body of some kind or other of nobility decorated with honour and fortified by privilege this nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a nation which otherwise with mr paine would soon be taught that no one generation can bind another he felt that no political fabric could be well made without some such order of things as might through a series of time afford a rational hope of securing unity coherence consistency and stability to the state he felt that nothing else can protect it against the levity of courts and the greater levity of the multitude that to talk of hereditary monarchy without anything else of hereditary reverence in the commonwealth was a lowminded absurdity fit only for those detestable fools aspiring to be knaves who began to forge in 1789 the false money of the french constitutionthat it is one fatal objection to all new fancied and new fabricated republics among a people who once possessing such an advantage have wickedly and insolently rejected it that the prejudice of an old nobility is a thing that cannot be made it may be improved it may be corrected it may be replenished men may be taken from it or aggregated to it but the thing itself is matter of inveterate opinion and therefore cannot be matter of mere positive institution he felt that this nobility in fact does not exist in wrong of other orders of the state but by them and for them   labouring poor  let government protect and encourage industry secure property repress violence and discountenance fraud it is all that they have to do in other respects the less they meddle in these affairs the better the rest is in the hands of our master and theirs we are in a constitution of things whereinmodo sol nimius modo corripit imber but i will push this matter no further as i have said a good deal upon it at various times during my public service and have lately written something on it which may yet see the light i shall content myself now with observing that the vigorous and laborious class of life has lately got from the bon ton of the humanity of this day the name of the labouring poor we have heard many plans for the relief of the labouring poor this puling jargon is not as innocent as it is foolish in meddling with great affairs weakness is never innoxious hitherto the name of poor in the sense in which it is used to excite compassion has not been used for those who can but for those who cannot labourfor the sick and infirm for orphan infancy for languishing and decrepit age but when we affect to pity as poor those who must labour or the world cannot exist we are trifling with the condition of mankind it is the common doom of man that he must eat his bread by the sweat of his brow that is by the sweat of his body or the sweat of his mind if this toil was inflicted as a curse it is as might be expected from the curses of the father of all blessingsit is tempered with many alleviations many comforts every attempt to fly from it and to refuse the very terms of our existence becomes much more truly a curse and heavier pains and penalties fall upon those who would elude the tasks which are put upon them by the great master workman of the world who in his dealings with his creatures sympathizes with their weakness and speaking of a creation wrought by mere will out of nothing speaks of six days of labour and one of rest i do not call a healthy young man cheerful in his mind and vigorous in his arms i cannot call such a man poor i cannot pity my kind as a kind merely because they are men this affected pity only tends to dissatisfy them with their condition and to teach them to seek resources where no resources are to be found in something else than their own industry and frugality and sobriety whatever may be the intention which because i do not know i cannot dispute of those who would discontent mankind by this strange pity they act towards us in the consequences as if they were our worst enemies   state consecrated by the church  i beg leave to speak of our church establishment which is the first of our prejudices not a prejudice destitute of reason but involving in it profound and extensive wisdom i speak of it first it is first and last and midst in our minds for taking ground on that religious system of which we are now in possession we continue to act on the early received and uniformly continued sense of mankind that sense not only like a wise architect hath built up the august fabric of states but like a provident proprietor to preserve the structure from profanation and ruin as a sacred temple purged from all the impurities of fraud and violence and injustice and tyranny hath solemnly and for ever consecrated the commonwealth and all that officiate in it this consecration is made that all who administer in the government of men in which they stand in the person of god himself should have high and worthy notions of their function and destination that their hope should be full of immortality that they should not look to the paltry pelf of the moment nor to the temporary and transient praise of the vulgar but to a solid permanent existence in the permanent part of their nature and to a permanent fame and glory in the example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world  such sublime principles ought to be infused into persons of exalted situations and religious establishments provided that may continually revive and enforce them every sort of moral every sort of civil every sort of politic institution aiding the rational and natural ties that connect the human understanding and affections to the divine are not more than necessary in order to build up that wonderful structure man whose prerogative it is to be in a great degree a creature of his own making and who when made as he ought to be made is destined to hold no trivial place in the creation but whenever man is put over men as the better nature ought ever to preside in that case more particularly he should as nearly as possible be approximated to his perfection  the consecration of the state by a state religious establishment is necessary also to operate with a wholesome awe upon free citizens because in order to secure their freedom they must enjoy some determinate portion of power to them therefore a religion connected with the state and with their duty towards it becomes even more necessary than in such societies where the people by the terms of their subjection are confined to private sentiments and the management of their own family concerns all persons possessing any portion of power ought to be strongly and awfully impressed with an idea that they act in trust and that they are to account for their conduct in that trust to the one great master author and founder of society this principle ought even to be more strongly impressed upon the minds of those who compose the collective sovereignty than upon those of single princes without instruments these princes can do nothing whoever uses instruments in finding helps finds also impediments their power is therefore by no means complete nor are they safe in extreme abuse such persons however elevated by flattery arrogance and selfopinion must be sensible that whether covered or not by positive law in some way or other they are accountable even here for the abuse of their trust if they are not cut off by a rebellion of their people they may be strangled by the very janissaries kept for their security against all other rebellion thus we have seen the king of france sold by his soldiers for an increase of pay but where popular authority is absolute and unrestrained the people have an infinitely greater because a far better founded confidence in their own power they are themselves in a great measure their own instruments they are nearer to their objects besides they are less under responsibility to one of the greatest controlling powers on earth the sense of fame and estimation the share of infamy that is likely to fall to the lot of each individual in public acts is small indeed the operation of opinion being in the inverse ratio to the number of those who abuse power their own approbation of their own acts has to them the appearance of a public judgment in their favour a perfect democracy is therefore the most shameless thing in the world as it is the most shameless it is also the most fearless no man apprehends in his person that he can be made subject to punishment certainly the people at large never ought for as all punishments are for example towards the conservation of the people at large the people at large can never become the subject of punishment by any human hand quicquid multis peccatur inultum it is therefore of infinite importance that they should not be suffered to imagine that their will any more than that of kings is the standard of right and wrong they ought to be persuaded that they are full as little entitled and far less qualified with safety to themselves to use any arbitrary power whatsoever that therefore they are not under a false show of liberty but in truth to exercise an unnatural inverted domination tyranically to exact from those who officiate in the state not an entire devotion to their interest which is their right but an abject submission to their occasional will extinguishing thereby in all those who serve them all moral principle all sense of dignity all use of judgment and all consistency of character whilst by the very same process they give themselves up a proper a suitable but a most contemptible prey to the servile ambition of popular sycophants or courtly flatterers   fate of louis xviii    let those who have the trust of political or of natural authority ever keep watch against the desperate enterprises of innovation let even their benevolence be fortified and armed they have before their eyes the example of a monarch insulted degraded confined deposed his family dispersed scattered imprisoned his wife insulted to his face like the vilest of the sex by the vilest of all populace himself three times dragged by these wretches in an infamous triumph his children torn from him in violation of the first right of nature and given into the tuition of the most desperate and impious of the leaders of desperate and impious clubs his revenues dilapidated and plundered his magistrates murdered his clergy proscribed persecuted famished his nobility degraded in their rank undone in their fortunes fugitives in their persons his armies corrupted and ruined his whole people impoverished disunited dissolved whilst through the bars of his prison and amidst the bayonets of his keepers he hears the tumult of two conflicting factions equally wicked and abandoned who agree in principles in dispositions and in objects but who tear each other to pieces about the most effectual means of obtaining their common end the one contending to preserve for a while his name and his person the more easily to destroy the royal authoritythe other clamouring to cut off the name the person and the monarchy together by one sacrilegious execution all this accumulation of calamity the greatest that ever fell upon one man has fallen upon his head because he had left his virtues unguarded by caution because he was not taught that where power is concerned he who will confer benefits must take security against ingratitude   nobility  all this violent cry against the nobility i take to be a mere work of art to be honoured and even privileged by the laws opinions and inveterate usages of our country growing out of the prejudice of ages has nothing to provoke horror and indignation in any man even to be too tenacious of those privileges is not absolutely a crime the strong struggle in every individual to preserve possession of what he has found to belong to him and to distinguish him is one of the securities against injustice and despotism implanted in our nature it operates as an instinct to secure property and to preserve communities in a settled state what is there to shock in this nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order it is the corinthian capital of polished society omnes boni nobilitati semper favemus was the saying of a wise and good man it is indeed one sign of a liberal and benevolent mind to incline to it with some sort of partial propensity he feels no ennobling principle in his own heart who wishes to level all the artificial institutions which have been adopted for giving a body to opinion and permanence to fugitive esteem it is a sour malignant envious disposition without taste for the reality or for any image or representation of virtue that sees with joy the unmerited fall of what had long flourished in splendour and in honour i do not like to see anything destroyed any void produced in society any ruin on the face of the land it was therefore with no disappointment or dissatisfaction that my inquiries and observations did not present to me any incorrigible vices in the noblesse of france or any abuse which could not be removed by a reform very short of abolition your noblesse did not deserve punishment but to degrade is to punish  it was with the same satisfaction i found that the result of my inquiry concerning your clergy was not dissimilar it is no soothing news to my ears that great bodies of men are incurably corrupt it is not with much credulity i listen to any when they speak evil of those whom they are going to plunder i rather suspect that vices are feigned or exaggerated when profit is looked for in their punishment an enemy is a bad witness a robber is a worse vices and abuses there were undoubtedly in that order and must be it was an old establishment and not frequently revised but i saw no crimes in the individuals that merited confiscation of their substance nor those cruel insults and degradations and that unnatural persecution which have been substituted in the place of meliorating regulation  if there had been any just cause for this new religious persecution the atheistic libellers who act as trumpeters to animate the populace to plunder do not love anybody so much as not to dwell with complacence on the vices of the existing clergy this they have not done they find themselves obliged to rake into the histories of former ages which they have ransacked with a malignant and profligate industry for every instance of oppression and persecution which has been made by that body or in its favour in order to justify upon very iniquitous because very illogical principles of retaliation their own persecutions and their own cruelties after destroying all other genealogies and family distinctions they invent a sort of pedigree of crimes it is not very just to chastise men for the offences of their natural ancestors but to take the fiction of ancestry in a corporate succession as a ground for punishing men who have no relation to guilty acts except in names and general descriptions is a sort of refinement in injustice belonging to the philosophy of this enlightened age the assembly punishes men many if not most of whom abhor the violent conduct of ecclesiastics in former times as much as their present persecutors can do and who would be as loud and as strong in the expression of that sense if they were not well aware of the purposes for which all this declamation is employed corporate bodies are immortal for the good of the members but not for their punishment nations themselves are such corporations as well might we in england think of waging inexpiable war upon all frenchmen for the evils which they have brought upon us in the several periods of our mutual hostilities you might on your part think yourselves justified in falling upon all englishmen on account of the unparalleled calamities brought upon the people of france by the unjust invasions of our henries and our edwards indeed we should be mutually justified in this exterminatory war upon each other full as much as you are in the unprovoked persecution of your present countrymen on account of the conduct of men of the same name in other times   legislation and republicans  the legislators who framed the ancient republics knew that their business was too arduous to be accomplished with no better apparatus than the metaphysics of an undergraduate and the mathematics and arithmetic of an exciseman they had to do with men and they were obliged to study human nature they had to do with citizens and they were obliged to study the effects of those habits which are communicated by the circumstances of civil life they were sensible that the operation of this second nature on the first produced a new combination and thence arose many diversities amongst men according to their birth their education their professions the periods of their lives their residence in towns or in the country their several ways of acquiring and of fixing property and according to the quality of the property itself all which rendered them as it were so many different species of animals from hence they thought themselves obliged to dispose their citizens into such classes and to place them in such situations in the state as their peculiar habits might qualify them to fill and to allot to them such appropriated privileges as might secure to them what their specific occasions required and which might furnish to each description such force as might protect it in the conflict caused by the diversity of interests that must exist and must contend in all complex society for the legislator would have been ashamed that the coarse husbandman should well know how to assort and to use his sheep horses and oxen and should have enough of common sense not to abstract and equalize them all into animals without providing for each kind an appropriate food care and employment whilst he the economist disposer and shepherd of his own kindred subliming himself into an airy metaphysician was resolved to know nothing of his flocks but as men in general it is for this reason that montesquieu observed very justly that in their classification of the citizens the great legislators of antiquity made the greatest display of their powers and even soared above themselves it is here that your modern legislators have gone deep into the negative series and sunk even below their own nothing as the first sort of legislators attended to the different kinds of citizens and combined them into one commonwealth the others the metaphysical and alchemistical legislators have taken the directly contrary course they have attempted to confound all sorts of citizens as well as they could into one homogeneous mass and then they divided this their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics they reduce men to loose counters merely for the sake of simple telling and not to figures whose power is to arise from their place in the table the elements of their own metaphysics might have taught them better lessons the troll of their categorical table might have informed them that there was something else in the intellectual world besides substance and quantity they might learn from the catechism of metaphysics that there were eight heads more in every complex deliberation which they have never thought of though these of all the ten are the subjects on which the skill of man can operate anything at all so far from this able disposition of some of the old republican legislators which follows with a solicitous accuracy the moral conditions and propensities of men they have leveled and crushed together all the orders which they found even under the coarse unartificial arrangement of the monarchy in which mode of government the classing of the citizens is not of so much importance as in a republic it is true however that every such classification if properly ordered is good in all forms of government and composes a strong barrier against the excesses of despotism as well as it is the necessary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic for want of something of this kind if the present project of a republic should fail all securities to a moderated freedom fail along with it all the indirect restraints which mitigate despotism are removed insomuch that if monarchy should ever again obtain an entire ascendancy in france under this or under any other dynasty it will probably be if not voluntarily tempered at setting out by the wise and virtuous counsels of the prince the most completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on earth this is to play a most desperate game   principle of stateconsecration  but one of the first and most leading principles on which the commonwealth and the laws are consecrated is lest the temporary possessors and liferenters in it unmindful of what they have received from their ancestors or of what is due to their posterity should act as if they were the entire masters that they should not think it amongst their rights to cut off the entail or commit waste on the inheritance by destroying at their pleasure the whole original fabric of their society hazarding to leave to those who come after them a ruin instead of an habitationand teaching these successors as little to respect their contrivances as they had themselves respected the institutions of their forefathers by this unprincipled facility of changing the state as often and as much and in as many ways as there are floating fancies or fashions the whole chain and continuity of the commonwealth would be broken no one generation could link with the other men would become little better than the flies of a summer  and first of all the science of jurisprudence the pride of the human intellect which with all its defects redundancies and errors is the collected reason of ages combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns as a heap of old exploded errors would be no longer studied personal selfsufficiency and arrogance the certain attendants upon all those who have never experienced a wisdom greater than their own would usurp the tribunal of course no certain laws establishing invariable grounds of hope and fear would keep the actions of men in a certain course or direct them to a certain end nothing stable in the modes of holding property or exercising function could form a solid ground on which any parent could speculate in the education of his offspring or in a choice for their future establishment in the world no principles would be early worked into the habits as soon as the most able instructor had completed his laborious course of institution instead of sending forth his pupil accomplished in a virtuous discipline fitted to procure him attention and respect in his place in society he would find everything altered and that he had turned out a poor creature to the contempt and derision of the world ignorant of the true grounds of estimation who would insure a tender and delicate sense of honour to beat almost with the first pulses of the heart when no man could know what would be the test of honour in a nation continually varying the standard of its coin no part of life would retain its acquisitions barbarism with regard to science and literature unskilfulness with regard to arts and manufactures would infallibly succeed to the want of a steady education and settled principle and thus the commonwealth itself would in a few generations crumble away be disconnected into the dust and powder of individuality and at length dispersed to all the winds of heaven to avoid therefore the evils of inconstancy and versatility ten thousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice we have consecrated the state that no man should approach to look into its defects or corruptions but with due caution that he should never dream of beginning its reformation by its subversion that he should approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of a father with pious awe and trembling solicitude by this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror on those children of their country who are prompt rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of magicians in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations they may regenerate the paternal constitution and renovate their fathers life   british stability  four hundred years have gone over us but i believe we are not materially changed since that period thanks to our sullen resistance to innovation thanks to the cold sluggishness of our national character we still bear the stamp of our forefathers we have not as i conceive lost the generosity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century nor as yet have we subtilized ourselves into savages we are not the converts of rousseau we are not the disciples of voltaire helvetius has made no progress amongst us atheists are not our preachers madmen are not our lawgivers we know that we have made no discoveries and we think that no discoveries are to be made in morality nor many in the great principles of government nor in the ideas of liberty which were understood long before we were born altogether as well as they will be after the grave has heaped its mould upon our presumption and the silent tomb shall have imposed its law on our pert loquacity in england we have not yet been completely embowelled of our natural entrails we still feel within us and we cherish and cultivate those inbred sentiments which are the faithful guardians the active monitors of our duty the true supporters of all liberal and manly morals we have not been drawn and trussed in order that we may be filled like stuffed birds in a museum with chaff and rags and paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of man we preserve the whole of our feelings still native and entire unsophisticated by pedantry and infidelity we have real hearts of flesh and blood beating in our bosoms we fear god we look up with awe to kings with affection to parliaments with duty to magistrates with reverence to priests and with respect to nobility why because when such ideas are brought before our minds it is natural to be so affected because all other feelings are false and spurious and tend to corrupt our minds to vitiate our primary morals to render us unfit for rational liberty and by teaching us a servile licentious and abandoned insolence to be our low sport for a few holidays to make us perfectly fit for and justly deserving of slavery through the whole course of our lives  you see sir that in this enlightened age i am bold enough to confess that we are generally men of untaught feelings that instead of casting away all our old prejudices we cherish them to a very considerable degree and to take more shame to ourselves we cherish them because they are prejudices and the longer they have lasted and the more generally they have prevailed the more we cherish them we are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because we suspect that the stock in each man is small and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages many of our men of speculation instead of exploding general prejudices employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them if they find what they seek and they seldom fail they think it more wise to continue the prejudice with the reason involved than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to leave nothing but the naked reason because prejudice with its reason has a motive to give action to that reason and an affection which will give it permanence prejudice is of ready application to the emergency it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision sceptical puzzled and unresolved prejudice renders a mans virtue his habit and not a series of unconnected acts through just prejudice his duty becomes a part of his nature   literary atheists    the literary cabal had some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the christian religion this object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety  they were possessed with a spirit of proselytism in the most fanatical degree and from thence by an easy progress with the spirit of persecution according to their means what was not to be done towards their great end by any direct or immediate act might be wrought by a longer process through the medium of opinion to command that opinion the first step is to establish a dominion over those who direct it they contrived to possess themselves with great method and perseverance of all the avenues to literary fame many of them indeed stood high in the ranks of literature and science the world had done them justice and in favour of general talents forgave the evil tendency of their peculiar principles this was true liberality which they returned by endeavouring to confine the reputation of sense learning and taste to themselves or their followers i will venture to say that this narrow exclusive spirit has not been less prejudicial to literature and to taste than to morals and true philosophy those atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own and they have learnt to talk against monks with the spirit of a monk but in some things they are men of the world  the resources of intrigue are called in to supply the defects of argument and wit to this system of literary monopoly was joined an unremitting industry to blacken and discredit in every way and by every means all those who did not hold to their faction to those who have observed the spirit of their conduct it has long been clear that nothing was wanted but the power of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into a persecution which would strike at property liberty and life  the desultory and faint persecution carried on against them more from compliance with form and decency than with serious resentment neither weakened their strength nor relaxed their efforts the issue of the whole was that what with opposition and what with success a violent and malignant zeal of a kind hitherto unknown in the world had taken an entire possession of their minds and rendered their whole conversation which otherwise would have been pleasing and instructive perfectly disgusting a spirit of cabal intrigue and proselytism pervaded all their thoughts words and actions and as controversial zeal soon turns its thoughts on force they began to insinuate themselves into a correspondence with foreign princes in hopes through their authority which at first they flattered they might bring about the changes they had in view to them it was indifferent whether these changes were to be accomplished by the thunderbolt of despotism or by the earthquake of popular commotion the correspondence between this cabal and the late king of prussia will throw no small light upon the spirit of all their proceedings for the same purpose for which they intrigued with princes they cultivated in a distinguished manner the monied interest of france and partly through the means furnished by those whose peculiar offices gave them the most extensive and certain means of communication they carefully occupied all the avenues to opinion  writers especially when they act in a body and with one direction have great influence on the public mind the alliance therefore of these writers with the monied interest had no small effect in removing the popular odium and envy which attended that species of wealth these writers like the propagators of all novelties pretended to a great zeal for the poor and the lower orders whilst in their satires they rendered hateful by every exaggeration the faults of courts of nobility and of priesthood they became a sort of demagogues they served as a link to unite in favour of one object obnoxious wealth to restless and desperate poverty   city of paris    the second material of cement for their new republic is the superiority of the city of paris and this i admit is strongly connected with the other cementing principle of paper circulation and confiscation it is in this part of the project we must look for the cause of the destruction of all the old bounds of provinces and jurisdictions ecclesiastical and secular and the dissolution of all ancient combinations of things as well as the formation of so many small unconnected republics the power of the city of paris is evidently one great spring of all their politics it is through the power of paris now become the centre and focus of jobbing that the leaders of this faction direct or rather command the whole legislative and the whole executive government everything therefore must be done which can confirm the authority of that city over the other republics paris is compact she has an enormous strength wholly disproportioned to the force of any of the square republics and this strength is collected and condensed within a narrow compass paris has a natural and easy connection of its parts which will not be affected by any scheme of a geometrical constitution nor does it much signify whether its proportion of representation be more or less since it has the whole draft of fishes in its dragnet the other divisions of the kingdom being hackled and torn to pieces and separated from all their habitual means and even principles of union cannot for some time at least confederate against her nothing was to be left in all the subordinate members but weakness disconnection and confusion to confirm this part of the plan the assembly has lately come to a resolution that no two of their republics shall have the same commanderinchief  to a person who takes a view of the whole the strength of paris thus formed will appear a system of general weakness it is boasted that the geometrical policy has been adopted that all local ideas should be sunk and that the people should be no longer gascons picards bretons normans but frenchmen with one country one heart and one assembly but instead of being all frenchmen the greater likelihood is that the inhabitants of that region will shortly have no country no man ever was attached by a sense of pride partiality or real affection to a description of square measurements he never will glory in belonging to the chequer no 71 or to any other badgeticket we begin our public affections in our families no cold relation is a zealous citizen we pass on to our neighbourhoods and our habitual provincial connections these are inns and restingplaces such divisions of our country as have been formed by habit and not by a sudden jerk of authority were so many little images of the great country in which the heart found something which it could fill the love to the whole is not extinguished by this subordinate partiality perhaps it is a sort of elemental training to those higher and more large regards by which alone men come to be affected as with their own concern in the prosperity of a kingdom so extensive as that of france in that general territory itself as in the old name of provinces the citizens are interested from old prejudices and unreasoned habits and not on account of the geometric properties of its figure the power and preeminence of paris does certainly press down and hold these republics together as long as it lasts but for the reasons i have already given you i think it cannot last very long   principle of church property    why should the expenditure of a great landed property which is a dispersion of the surplus product of the soil appear intolerable to you or to me when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast libraries which are the history of the force and weakness of the human mind through great collections of ancient records medals and coins which attest and explain laws and customs through paintings and statues that by imitating nature seem to extend the limits of creation through grand monuments of the dead which continue the regards and connections of life beyond the grave through collections of the specimens of nature which become a representative assembly of all the classes and families of the world that by disposition facilitate and by exciting curiosity open the avenues to science if by great permanent establishments all these objects of expense are better secured from the inconstant sport of personal caprice and personal extravagance are they worse than if the same tastes prevailed in scattered individuals does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter who toil in order to partake the sweat of the peasant flow as pleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and repair of the majestic edifices of religion as in the painted booths and sordid sties of vice and luxury as honourably and as profitably in repairing those sacred works which grow hoary with innumerable years as on the momentary receptacles of transient voluptuousness in operahouses and brothels and gaminghouses and clubhouses and obelisks in the champ de mars is the surplus product of the olive and the vine worse employed in the frugal sustenance of persons whom the fictions of a pious imagination raise to dignity by construing in the service of god than in pampering the innumerable multitude of those who are degraded by being made useless domestics subservient to the pride of man are the decorations of temples an expenditure less worthy a wise man than ribbons and laces and national cockades and petites maisons and petits soupers and all the innumerable fopperies and follies in which opulence sports away the burthen of its superfluity  we tolerate even these not from love of them but for fear of worse we tolerate them because property and liberty to a degree acquire that toleration but why proscribe the other and surely in every point of view the more laudable use of estates why through the violation of all property through an outrage upon every principle of liberty forcibly carry them from the better to the worse  this comparison between the new individuals and the old corps is made upon a supposition that no reform could be made in the latter but in a question of reformation i always consider corporate bodies whether sole or consisting of many to be much more susceptible of a public direction by the power of the state in the use of their property and in the regulation of modes and habits of life in their members than private citizens ever can be or perhaps ought to be and this seems to me a very material consideration for those who undertake anything which merits the name of a politic enterprise so far as to the estates of monasteries  with regard to the estates possessed by bishops and canons and commendatory abbots i cannot find out for what reason some landed estates may not be held otherwise than by inheritance can any philosophic spoiler undertake to demonstrate the positive or the comparative evil of having a certain and that too a large portion of landed property passing in succession through persons whose title to it is always in theory and often in fact an eminent degree of piety morals and learning a property which by its destination in their turn and on the score of merit gives to the noblest families renovation and support to the lowest the means of dignity and elevation a property the tenure to which is the performance of some duty whatever value you may choose to set upon that duty and the character of whose proprietors demands at least an exterior decorum and gravity of manners who are to exercise a generous but temperate hospitality part of whose income they are to consider as a trust for charity and who even when they fail in their trust when they slide from their character and degenerate into a mere common secular nobleman or gentleman are in no respect worse than those who may succeed them in their forfeited possessions is it better that estates should be held by those who have no duty than by those who have oneby those whose character and destination point to virtues than by those who have no rule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but their own will and appetite nor are these estates held altogether in the character or with the evils supposed inherent in mortmain they pass from hand to hand with a more rapid circulation than any other no excess is good and therefore too great a proportion of landed property may be held officially for life but it does not seem to me of material injury to any commonwealth that there should exist some estates that have a chance of being acquired by other means than the previous acquisition of money   parsimony not economy  i beg leave to tell him that mere parsimony is not economy it is separable in theory from it and in fact it may or it may not be a part of economy according to circumstances expense and great expense may be an essential part in true economy if parsimony were to be considered as one of the kinds of that virtue there is however another and a higher economy economy is a distributive virtue and consists not in saving but in selection parsimony requires no providence no sagacity no powers of combination no comparison no judgment mere instinct and that not an instinct of the noblest kind may produce this false economy in perfection the other economy has larger views it demands a discriminating judgment and a firm sagacious mind it shuts one door to impudent importunity only to open another and a wider to unpresuming merit if none but meritorious service or real talent were to be rewarded this nation has not wanted and this nation will not want the means of rewarding all the service it ever will receive and encouraging all the merit it ever will produce no state since the foundation of society has been impoverished by that species of profusion had the economy of selection and proportion been at all times observed we should not now have had an overgrown duke of bedford to oppress the industry of humble men and to limit by the standard of his own conceptions the justice the bounty or if he pleases the charity of the crown   majesty of the british constitution  i wish my countrymen rather to recommend to our neighbours the example of the british constitution than to take models from them for the improvement of our own in the former they have got an invaluable treasure they are not i think without some causes of apprehension and complaint but these they do not owe to their constitution but to their own conduct i think our happy situation owing to our constitution but owing to the whole of it and not to any part singly owing in a great measure to what we have left standing in our several reviews and reformations as well as to what we have altered or superadded our people will find employment enough for a truly patriotic free and independent spirit in guarding what they possess from violation i would not exclude alteration neither but even when i changed it should be to preserve i should be led to my remedy by a great grievance in what i did i should follow the example of our ancestors i would make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style of the building a politic caution a guarded circumspection a moral rather than a complexional timidity were among the ruling principles of our forefathers in their most decided conduct not being illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of france tell us they have got so abundant a share they acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and fallibility of mankind he that had made them thus fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct attended to their nature let us imitate their caution if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their bequests let us add if we please but let us preserve what they have left and standing on the firm ground of the british constitution let us be satisfied to admire rather than attempt to follow in their desperate flights the aeronauts of france  i have told you candidly my sentiments i think they are not likely to alter yours i do not know that they ought you are young you cannot guide but must follow the fortune of your country but hereafter they may be of some use to you in some future form which your commonwealth may take in the present it can hardly remain but before its final settlement it may be obliged to pass as one of our poets says through great varieties of untried being and in all its transmigrations to be purified by fire and blood   duty not based on will    i cannot too often recommend it to the serious consideration of all men who think civil society to be within the province of moral jurisdiction that if we owe to it any duty it is not subject to our will duties are not voluntary duty and will are even contradictory terms now though civil society might be at first a voluntary act which in many cases it undoubtedly was its continuance is under a permanent standing covenant coexisting with the society and it attaches upon every individual of that society without any formal act of his own this is warranted by the general practice arising out of the general sense of mankind men without their choice derive benefits from that association without their choice they are subjected to duties in consequence of these benefits and without their choice they enter into a virtual obligation as binding as any that is actual look through the whole of life and the whole system of duties  much the strongest moral obligations are such as were never the results of our option i allow that if no supreme ruler exists wise to form and potent to enforce the moral law there is no sanction to any contract virtual or even actual against the will of prevalent power  on that hypothesis let any set of men be strong enough to set their duties at defiance and they cease to be duties any longer we have but this one appeal against irresistible power      si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma       at sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi  taking it for granted that i do not write to the disciples of the parisian philosophy i may assume that the awful author of our being is the author of our place in the order of existence and that having disposed and marshalled us by a divine tactic not according to our will but according to his he has in and by that disposition virtually subjected us to act the part which belongs to the place assigned us we have obligations to mankind at large which are not in consequence of any special voluntary pact they arise from the relation of man to man and the relation of man to god which relations are not matters of choice on the contrary the force of all the pacts which we enter into with any particular person or number of persons amongst mankind depends upon those prior obligations in some cases the subordinate relations are voluntary in others they are necessarybut the duties are all compulsive when we marry the choice is voluntary but the duties are not matter of choice they are dictated by the nature of the situation dark and inscrutable are the ways by which we come into the world the instincts which give rise to this mysterious process of nature are not of our making but out of physical causes unknown to us perhaps unknowable arise moral duties which as we are able perfectly to comprehend we are bound indispensably to perform parents may not be consenting to their moral relation but consenting or not they are bound to a long train of burthensome duties towards those with whom they have never made a convention of any sort children are not consenting to their relation but their relation without their actual consent binds them to its duties or rather it implies their consent because the presumed consent of every rational creature is in unison with the predisposed order of things men come in that manner into a community with the social state of their parents endowed with all the benefits loaded with all the duties of their situation if the social ties and ligaments spun out of those physical relations which are the elements of the commonwealth in most cases begin and alway continue independently of our will so without any stipulation on our own part are we bound by that relation called our country which comprehends as it has been well said all the charities of all nor are we left without powerful instincts to make this duty as dear and grateful to us as it is awful and coercive it consists in a great measure in the ancient order into which we are born we may have the same geographical situation but another country as we may have the same country in another soil the place that determines our duty to our country is a social civil relation   ecclesiastical confiscation    the confiscators truly have made some allowance to their victims from the scraps and fragments of their own tables from which they have been so harshly driven and which have been so bountifully spread for a feast to the harpies of usury but to drive men from independence to live on alms is itself great cruelty that which might be a tolerable condition to men in one state of life and not habituated to other things may when all these circumstances are altered be a dreadful revolution and one to which a virtuous mind would feel pain in condemning any guilt except that which would demand the life of the offender but to many minds this punishment of degradation and infamy is worse than death undoubtedly it is an infinite aggravation of this cruel suffering that the persons who were taught a double prejudice in favour of religion by education and by the place they held in the administration of its functions are to receive the remnants of the property as alms from the profane and impious hands of those who had plundered them of all the rest to receive if they are at all to receive not from the charitable contributions of the faithful but from the insolent tenderness of known and avowed atheism the maintenance of religion measured out to them on the standard of the contempt in which it is held and for the purpose of rendering those who receive the allowance vile and of no estimation in the eyes of mankind  but this act of seizure of property it seems is a judgment in law and not a confiscation they have it seems found out in the academies of the palais royal and the jacobins that certain men had no right to the possessions which they held under law usage the decisions of courts and the accumulated prescription of a thousand years they say that ecclesiastics are fictitious persons creatures of the state whom at pleasure they may destroy and of course limit and modify in every particular that the goods they possess are not properly theirs but belong to the state which created the fiction and we are therefore not to trouble ourselves with what they may suffer in their natural feelings and natural persons on account of what is done towards them in this their constructive character of what import is it under what names you injure men and deprive them of the just emoluments of a profession in which they were not only permitted but encouraged by the state to engage and upon the supposed certainty of which emoluments they had formed the plan of their lives contracted debts and led multitudes to an entire dependence upon them  you do not imagine sir that i am going to compliment this miserable distinction of persons with any long discussion the arguments of tyranny are as contemptible as its force is dreadful had not your confiscators by their early crimes obtained a power which secures indemnity to all the crimes of which they have since been guilty or that they can commit it is not the syllogism of the logician but the lash of the executioner that would have refuted a sophistry which becomes an accomplice of theft and murder the sophistic tyrants of paris are loud in their declamations against the departed regal tyrants who in former ages have vexed the world they are thus bold because they are safe from the dungeons and iron cages of their old masters shall we be more tender of the tyrants of our own time when we see them acting worse tragedies under our eyes shall we not use the same liberty that they do when we can use it with the same safety when to speak honest truth only requires a contempt of the opinion of those whose actions we abhor   moral of history  we do not draw the moral lessons we might from history on the contrary without care it may be used to vitiate our minds and to destroy our happiness in history a great volume is unrolled for our instruction drawing the materials of future wisdom from the past errors and infirmities of mankind it may in the perversion serve for a magazine furnishing offensive and defensive weapons for parties in church and state and supplying the means of keeping alive or reviving dissensions and animosities and adding fuel to civil fury history consists for the greater part of the miseries brought upon the world by pride ambition avarice revenge lust sedition hypocrisy ungoverned zeal and all the train of disorderly appetites which shake the public with the same      troublous storms that toss     the private state and render life unsweet  these vices are the causes of those storms religion morals laws prerogatives privileges liberties rights of men are the pretexts the pretexts are always found in some specious appearance of a real good you would not secure men from tyranny and sedition by rooting out of the mind the principles to which these fraudulent pretexts apply if you did you would root out everything that is valuable in the human breast as these are the pretexts so the ordinary actors and instruments in great public evils are kings priests magistrates senates parliaments national assemblies judges and captains you would not cure the evil by resolving that there should be no more monarchs nor ministers of state nor of the gospel no interpreters of law no general officers no public councils you might change the names the things in some shape must remain a certain quantum of power must always exist in the community in some hands and under some appellation wise men will apply their remedies to vices not to names to the causes of evil which are permanent not to the occasional organs by which they act and the transitory modes in which they appear otherwise you will be wise historicallya fool in practice seldom have two ages the same fashion in their pretexts and the same modes of mischief wickedness is a little more inventive whilst you are discussing fashion the fashion is gone by the very same vice assumes a new body the spirit transmigrates and far from losing its principle of life by the change of its appearance it is renovated in its new organs with the fresh vigour of a juvenile activity it walks abroad it continues its ravages whilst you are gibbeting the carcase or demolishing the tomb you are terrifying yourselves with ghosts and apparitions whilst your house is the haunt of robbers it is thus with all those who attending only to the shell and husk of history think they are waging war with intolerance pride and cruelty whilst under colour of abhorring the ill principles of antiquated parties they are authorizing and feeding the same odious vices in different factions and perhaps in worse   use of defects in history    not that i derogate from the use of history  it is a great improver of the understanding by showing both men and affairs in a great variety of views from this source much political wisdom may be learned that is may be learned as habit not as precept and as an exercise to strengthen the mind as furnishing materials to enlarge and enrich it not as a repertory of cases and precedents for a lawyer if it were a thousand times better would it be that a statesman had never learned to readvellem nescirent literas this method turns their understanding from the object before them and from the present exigencies of the world to comparisons with former times of which after all we can know very little and very imperfectly and our guides the historians who are to give us their true interpretation are often prejudiced often ignorant often fonder of system than of truth whereas if a man with reasonably good parts and natural sagacity and not in the leadingstrings of any master will look steadily on the business before him without being diverted by retrospect and comparison he may be capable of forming a reasonably good judgment of what is to be done there are some fundamental points in which nature never changesbut they are few and obvious and belong rather to morals than to politics but so far as regards political matter the human mind and human affairs are susceptible of infinite modifications and of combinations wholly new and unlooked for very few for instance could have imagined that property which has been taken for natural dominion should through the whole of a vast kingdom lose all its importance and even its influence this is what history or books of speculation could hardly have taught us how many could have thought that the most complete and formidable revolution in a great empire should be made by men of letters not as subordinate instruments and trumpeters of sedition but as the chief contrivers and managers and in a short time as the open administrators and sovereign rulers who could have imagined that atheism could produce one of the most violently operative principles of fanaticism who could have imagined that in a commonwealth in a manner cradled in war and in extensive and dreadful war military commanders should be of little or no account that the convention should not contain one military man of name that administrative bodies in a state of the utmost confusion and of but a momentary duration and composed of men with not one imposing part of character should be able to govern the country and its armies with an authority which the most settled senates and the most respected monarchs scarcely ever had in the same degree this for one i confess i did not foresee though all the rest was present to me very early and not out of my apprehension even for several years   social contract  society is indeed a contract subordinate contracts for objects of mere occasional interest may be dissolved at pleasurebut the state ought not to be considered nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee calico or tobacco or some other such low concern to be taken up for a little temporary interest and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties it is to be looked on with other reverence because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature it is a partnership in all science a partnership in all art a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection as the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living but between those who are living those who are dead and those who are to be born each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternal society linking the lower with the higher natures connecting the visible and invisible world according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures each in their appointed place this law is not subject to the will of those who by an obligation above them and infinitely superior are bound to submit their will to that law the municipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at their pleasure and on their speculations of a contingent improvement wholly to separate and tear asunder the bands of their subordinate community and to dissolve it into an unsocial uncivil unconnected chaos of elementary principles it is the first and supreme necessity only a necessity that is not chosen but chooses a necessity paramount to deliberation that admits no discussion and demands no evidence which alone can justify a resort to anarchy this necessity is no exception to the rule because this necessity itself is a part too of that moral and physical disposition of things to which man must be obedient by consent of force but if that which is only submission to necessity should be made the object of choice the law is broken nature is disobeyed and the rebellious are outlawed cast forth and exiled from this world of reason and order and peace and virtue and fruitful penitence into the antagonist world of madness discord vice confusion and unavailing sorrow   prescriptive rights  the crown has considered me after long service the crown has paid the duke of bedford by advance he has had a long credit for any service which he may perform hereafter he is secure and long may he be secure in his advance whether he performs any services or not but let him take care how he endangers the safety of that constitution which secures his own utility or his own insignificance or how he discourages those who take up even puny arms to defend an order of things which like the sun of heaven shines alike on the useful and the worthless his grants are engrafted on the public law of europe covered with the awful hoar of innumerable ages they are guarded by the sacred rules of prescription found in that full treasury of jurisprudence from which the jejuneness and penury of our municipal law has by degrees been enriched and strengthened this prescription i had my share a very full share in bringing to its perfection the duke of bedford will stand as long as prescriptive law endures as long as the great stable laws of property common to us with all civilized nations are kept in their integrity and without the smallest intermixture of laws maxims principles or precedents of the grand revolution they are secure against all changes but one the whole revolutionary system institutes digest code novels text gloss comment are not only not the same but they are the very reverse and the reverse fundamentally of all the laws on which civil life has hitherto been upheld in all the governments of the world the learned professors of the rights of man regard prescription not as a title to bar all claim set up against all possession but they look on prescription as itself a bar against the possessor and proprietor they hold an immemorial possession to be no more than a longcontinued and therefore an aggravated injustice  such are their ideas such their religion and such their law but as to our country and our race as long as the wellcompacted structure of our church and state the sanctuary the holy of holies of that ancient law defended by reverence defended by power a fortress at once and a temple shall stand inviolate on the brow of the british sion as long as the british monarchy not more limited than fenced by the orders of the state shall like the proud keep of windsor rising in the majesty of proportion and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towersas long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected landso long the mounds and dykes of the low fat bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of france as long as our sovereign lord the king and his faithful subjects the lords and commons of this realmthe triple cord which no man can break the solemn sworn constitutional frankpledge of this nation the firm guarantees of each others being and each others rights the joint and several securities each in its place and order for every kind and every quality of property and of dignityas long as these endure so long the duke of bedford is safe and we are all safe togetherthe high from the blights of envy and the spoliations of rapacity the low from the iron hand of oppression and the insolent spurn of contempt amen and so be it and so it will be      dum domus aeneae capitoli immobile saxum      accolet imperiumque pater romanus habebit   madness of innovation    novelty is not the only source of zeal why should not a maccabeus and his brethren arise to assert the honour of the ancient law and to defend the temple of their forefathers with as ardent a spirit as can inspire any innovator to destroy the monuments of the piety and the glory of ancient ages it is not a hazarded assertion it is a great truth that when once things are gone out of their ordinary course it is by acts out of the ordinary course they can alone be reestablished republican spirit can only be combated by a spirit of the same nature of the same nature but informed with another principle and pointing to another end i would persuade a resistance both to the corruption and to the reformation that prevails it will not be the weaker but much the stronger for combating both together a victory over real corruptions would enable us to baffle the spurious and pretended reformations i would not wish to excite or even to tolerate that kind of evil spirit which invokes the powers of hell to rectify the disorders of the earth no i would add my voice with better and i trust more potent charms to draw down justice and wisdom and fortitude from heaven for the correction of human vice and the recalling of human error from the devious ways into which it has been betrayed i would wish to call the impulses of individuals at once to the aid and to the control of authority by this which i call the true republican spirit paradoxical as it may appear monarchies alone can be rescued from the imbecility of courts and the madness of the crowd this republican spirit would not suffer men in high place to bring ruin on their country and on themselves it would reform not by destroying but by saving the great the rich and the powerful such a republican spirit we perhaps fondly conceive to have animated the distinguished heroes and patriots of old who knew no mode of policy but religion and virtue these they would have paramount to all constitutions they would not suffer monarchs or senates or popular assemblies under pretences of dignity or authority or freedom to shake off those moral riders which reason has appointed to govern every sort of rude power these in appearance loading them by their weight do by that pressure augment their essential force the momentum is increased by the extraneous weight it is true in moral as it is in mechanical science it is true not only in the draught but in the race these riders of the great in effect hold the reins which guide them in their course and wear the spur that stimulates them to the goals of honour and of safety the great must submit to the dominion of prudence and of virtue or none will long submit to the dominion of the great      dis te minorem quod geris imperas  this is the feudal tenure which they cannot alter   the state its own revenue  the revenue of the state is the state in effect all depends upon it whether for support or for reformation the dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon the quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it as all great qualities of the mind which operate in public and are not merely suffering and passive require force for their display i had almost said for their unequivocal existence the revenue which is the spring of all power becomes in its administration the sphere of every active virtue public virtue being of a nature magnificent and splendid instituted for great things and conversant about great concerns requires abundant scope and room and cannot spread and grow under confinement and in circumstances straitened narrow and sordid through the revenue alone the body politic can act in its true genius and character and therefore it will display just as much of its collective virtue and as much of that virtue which may characterize those who move it and are as it were its life and guiding principle as it is possessed of a just revenue for from hence not only magnanimity and liberality and beneficence and fortitude and providence and the tutelary protection of all good arts derive their food and the growth of their organs but continence and selfdenial and labour and vigilance and frugality and whatever else there is in which the mind shows itself above the appetite are nowhere more in their proper element than in the provision and distribution of the public wealth it is therefore not without reason that the science of speculative and practical finance which must take to its aid so many auxiliary branches of knowledge stands high in the estimation not only of the ordinary sort but of the wisest and best men and as this science has grown with the progress of its object the prosperity and improvement of nations has generally increased with the increase of their revenues and they will both continue to grow and flourish as long as the balance between what is left to strengthen the efforts of individuals and what is collected for the common efforts of the state bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion and are kept in a close correspondence and communication   metaphysical depravity    these philosophers are fanatics independent of any interest which if it operated alone would make them much more tractable they are carried with such a headlong rage towards every desperate trial that they would sacrifice the whole human race to the slightest of their experiments i am better able to enter into the character of this description of men than the noble duke can be i have lived long and variously in the world without any considerable pretensions to literature in myself i have aspired to the love of letters i have lived for a great many years in habitudes with those who professed them i can form a tolerable estimate of what is likely to happen from a character chiefly dependent for fame and fortune on knowledge and talent as well in its morbid and perverted state as in that which is sound and natural naturally men so formed and finished are the first gifts of providence to the world but when they have once thrown off the fear of god which was in all ages too often the case and the fear of men which is now the case and when in that state they come to understand one another and to act in corps a more dreadful calamity cannot arise out of hell to scourge mankind nothing can be conceived more hard than the heart of a thoroughbred metaphysician it comes nearer to the cold malignity of a wicked spirit than to the frailty and passion of a man it is like that of the principle of evil himself incorporeal pure unmixed dephlegmated defecated evil it is no easy operation to eradicate humanity from the human breast what shakespeare calls the compunctious visitings of nature will sometimes knock at their hearts and protest against their murderous speculations  but they have a means of compounding with their nature their humanity is not dissolved they only give it a long prorogation they are ready to declare that they do not think two thousand years too long a period for the good that they pursue it is remarkable that they never see any way to their projected good but by the road of some evil their imagination is not fatigued with the contemplation of human suffering through the wild waste of centuries added to centuries of misery and desolation their humanity is at their horizonand like the horizon it always flies before them the geometricians and the chemists bring the one from the dry bones of their diagrams and the other from the soot of their furnaces dispositions that make them worse than indifferent about those feelings and habitudes which are the supports of the moral world ambition is come upon them suddenly they are intoxicated with it and it has rendered them fearless of the danger which may from thence arise to others or to themselves these philosophers consider men in their experiments no more than they do mice in an airpump or in a recipient of mephitic gas whatever his grace may think of himself they look upon him and everything that belongs to him with no more regard than they do upon the whiskers of that little longtailed animal that has been long the game of the grave demure insidious springnailed velvetpawed greeneyed philosophers whether going upon two legs or upon four   personal and ancestral claims  i really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public merits of his grace by which he justifies the grants he holds and these services of mine on the favourable construction of which i have obtained what his grace so much disapproves in private life i have not at all the honour of acquaintance with the noble duke but i ought to presume and it costs me nothing to do so that he abundantly deserves the esteem and love of all who live with him but as to public service why truly it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself in rank in fortune in splendid descent in youth strength or figure with the duke of bedford than to make a parallel between his services and my attempts to be useful to my country it would not be gross adulation but uncivil irony to say that he has any public merit of his own to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed pensions were obtained my merits whatever they are are original and personal his are derivative it is his ancestor the original pensioner that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit which makes his grace so very delicate and exceptious about the merit of all other grantees of the crown had he permitted me to remain in quiet i should have said tis his estate thats enough it is his by law what have i to do with it or its history he would naturally have said on his side tis this mans fortune he is as good now as my ancestor was two hundred and fifty years ago i am a young man with very old pensions he is an old man with very young pensionsthats all why will his grace by attacking me force me reluctantly to compare my little merit with that which obtained from the crown those prodigies of profuse donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and laborious individuals i would willingly leave him to the heralds college which the philosophy of the sans culottes prouder by far than all the garters and norroys and clarencieux and rouge dragons that ever pranced in a procession of what his friends call aristocrats and despots will abolish with contumely and scorn these historians recorders and blazoners of virtues and arms differ wholly from that other description of historians who never assign any act of politicians to a good motive these gentle historians on the contrary dip their pens in nothing but the milk of human kindness they seek no further for merit than the preamble of a patent or the inscription of a tomb with them every man created a peer is first a hero ready made they judge of every mans capacity for office by the offices he has filled and the more offices the more ability every generalofficer with them is a marlborough every statesman a burleigh every judge a murray or a yorke they who alive were laughed at or pitied by all their acquaintance make as good a figure as the best of them in the pages of guillim edmondson and collins   monastic and philosophic superstition  but the institutions savour of superstition in their very principle and they nourish it by a permanent and standing influence this i do not mean to dispute but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from superstition itself any resources which may thence be furnished for the public advantage you derive benefits from many dispositions and many passions of the human mind which are of as doubtful a colour in the moral eye as superstition itself it was your business to correct and mitigate everything which was noxious in this passion as in all the passions but is superstition the greatest of all possible vices in its possible excess i think it becomes a very great evil it is however a moral subject and of course admits of all degrees and all modifications superstition is the religion of feeble minds and they must be tolerated in an intermixture of it in some trifling or some enthusiastic shape or other else you will deprive weak minds of a resource found necessary to the strongest the body of all true religion consists to be sure in obedience to the will of the sovereign of the world in a confidence in his declarations and in imitation of his perfections the rest is our own it may be prejudicial to the great end it may be auxiliary wise men who as such are not admirers not admirers at least of the munera terrae are not violently attached to these things nor do they violently hate them wisdom is not the most severe corrector of folly they are the rival follies which mutually wage so unrelenting a war and which make so cruel a use of their advantages as they can happen to engage the immoderate vulgar on the one side or the other in their quarrels prudence would be neuter but if in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce such heats a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and excesses of enthusiasm he would condemn or bear perhaps he would think the superstition which builds to be more tolerable than that which demolishes that which adorns a country than that which deforms it that which endows than that which plunders that which disposes to mistaken beneficence than that which stimulates to real injustice that which leads a man to refuse to himself lawful pleasures than that which snatches from others the scanty subsistence of their selfdenial such i think is very nearly the state of the question between the ancient founders of monkish superstition and the superstition of the pretended philosophers of the hour   difficulty and wisdom of corporate reform    there are moments in the fortune of states when particular men are called to make improvements by great mental exertion in those moments even when they seem to enjoy the confidence of their prince and country and to be invested with full authority they have not always apt instruments a politician to do great things looks for a power what our workmen call a purchase and if he finds that power in politics as in mechanics he cannot be at a loss to apply it in the monastic institutions in my opinion was found a great power for the mechanism of politic benevolence there were revenues with a public direction there were men wholly set apart and dedicated to public purposes without any other than public ties and public principles men without the possibility of converting the estate of the community into a private fortune men denied to selfinterests whose avarice is for some community men to whom personal poverty is honour and implicit obedience stands in the place of freedom in vain shall a man look to the possibility of making such things when he wants them the winds blow as they list these institutions are the products of enthusiasm they are the instruments of wisdom wisdom cannot create materials they are the gifts of nature or of chance her pride is in the use the perennial existence of bodies corporate and their fortunes are things particularly suited to a man who has long views who meditates designs that require time in fashioning and which propose duration when they are accomplished he is not deserving to rank high or even to be mentioned in the order of great statesmen who having obtained the command and direction of such a power as existed in the wealth the discipline and the habits of such corporations as those which you have rashly destroyed cannot find any way of converting it to the great and lasting benefit of his country on the view of this subject a thousand uses suggest themselves to a contriving mind to destroy any power growing wild from the rank productive force of the human mind is almost tantamount in the moral world to the destruction of the apparently active properties of bodies in the material it would be like the attempt to destroy if it were in our competence to destroy the expansive force of fixed air in nitre or the power of steam or of electricity or of magnetism these energies always existed in nature and they were always discernible they seemed some of them unserviceable some noxious some no better than a sport to children until contemplative ability combining with practic skill tamed their wild nature subdued them to use and rendered them at once the most powerful and the most tractable agents in subservience to the great views and designs of men did fifty thousand persons whose mental and whose bodily labour you might direct and so many hundred thousand a year of a revenue which was neither lazy nor superstitious appear too big for your abilities to wield had you no way of using the men but by converting monks into pensioners had you no way of turning the revenue to account but through the improvident resource of a spendthrift sale  if you were thus destitute of mental funds the proceeding is in its natural course your politicians do not understand their trade and therefore they sell their tools   distinctive character of english protestantism  protestantism of the english church very indefinite because the term protestant which you apply is too general for the conclusions which one of your accurate understanding would wish to draw from it and because a great deal of argument will depend on the use that is made of that term it is not a fundamental part of the settlement at the revolution that the state should be protestant without any qualification of the term with a qualification it is unquestionably true not in all its latitude with the qualification it was true before the revolution our predecessors in legislation were not so irrational not to say impious as to form an operose ecclesiastical establishment and even to render the state itself in some degree subservient to it when their religion if such it might be called was nothing but a mere negation of some otherwithout any positive idea either of doctrine discipline worship or morals in the scheme which they professed themselves and which they imposed upon others even under penalties and incapacitiesno no this never could have been done even by reasonable atheists they who think religion of no importance to the state have abandoned it to the conscience or caprice of the individual they make no provision for it whatsoever but leave every club to make or not a voluntary contribution towards its support according to their fancies this would be consistent the other always appeared to me to be a monster of contradiction and absurdity it was for that reason that some years ago i strenuously opposed the clergy who petitioned to the number of about three hundred to be freed from the subscription to the thirtynine articles without proposing to substitute any other in their place there never has been a religion of the state the few years of the parliament only excepted but that of the espiscopal church of england the episcopal church of england before the reformation connected with the see of rome since then disconnected and protesting against some of her doctrines and against the whole of her authority as binding in our national church nor did the fundamental laws of this kingdom in ireland it has been the same ever know at any period any other church as an object of establishment or in that light any other protestant religion nay our protestant toleration itself at the revolution and until within a few years required a signature of thirtysix and a part of the thirtyseventh out of the thirtynine articles so little idea had they at the revolution of establishing protestantism indefinitely that they did not indefinitely tolerate it under that name i do not mean to praise that strictness where nothing more than merely religious toleration is concerned toleration being a part of moral and political prudence ought to be tender and large a tolerant government ought not to be too scrupulous in its investigations but may bear without blame not only very illgrounded doctrines but even many things that are positively vices where they are adulta et praevalida the good of the commonwealth is the rule which rides over the rest and to this every other must completely submit   fictitious liberty  a brave people will certainly prefer liberty accompanied with a virtuous poverty to a depraved and wealthy servitude but before the price of comfort and opulence is paid one ought to be pretty sure it is real liberty which is purchased and that she is to be purchased at no other price i shall always however consider that liberty as very equivocal in her appearance which has not wisdom and justice for her companions and does not lead prosperity and plenty in her train   french ignorance of english character    when i assert anything else as concerning the people of england i speak from observation not from authority but i speak from the experience i have had in a pretty extensive and mixed communication with the inhabitants of this kingdom of all descriptions and ranks and after a course of attentive observation begun in early life and continued for nearly forty years  i have often been astonished considering that we are divided from you but by a slender dyke of about twentyfour miles and that the mutual intercourse between the two countries has lately been very great to find how little you seem to know of us i suspect that this is owing to your forming a judgment of this nation from certain publications which do very erroneously if they do at all represent the opinions and dispositions generally prevalent in england the vanity restlessness petulance and spirit of intrigue of several petty cabals who attempt to hide their total want of consequence in bustle and noise and puffing and mutual quotation of each other makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect of their abilities is a general mark of acquiescence in their opinions no such thing i assure you because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink whilst thousands of great cattle reposed beneath the shadow of the british oak chew the cud and are silent pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field that of course they are many in number or that after all they are other than the little shrivelled meagre hopping though loud and troublesome insects of the hour   the people and omnipotence of parliament  when the supreme authority of the people is in question before we attempt to extend or to confine it we ought to fix in our minds with some degree of distinctness an idea of what it is we mean when we say the people  in a state of rude nature there is no such thing as a people a number of men in themselves have no collective capacity the idea of a people is the idea of a corporation it is wholly artificial and made like all other legal fictions by common agreement what the particular nature of that agreement was is collected from the form into which the particular society has been cast any other is not their covenant when men therefore break up the original compact or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity to a state they are no longer a people they have no longer a corporate existence they have no longer a legal coactive force to bind within nor a claim to be recognised abroad they are a number of vague loose individuals and nothing more with them all is to begin again alas they little know how many a weary step is to be taken before they can form themselves into a mass which has a true politic personality  we hear much from men who have not acquired their hardness of assertion from the profundity of their thinking about the omnipotence of a majority in such a dissolution of an ancient society as hath taken place in france but amongst men so disbanded there can be no such thing as majority or minority or power in any one person to bind another the power of acting by a majority which the gentlemen theorists seem to assume so readily after they have violated the contract out of which it has arisen if at all it existed must be grounded on two assumptions first that of an incorporation produced by unanimity and secondly an unanimous agreement that the act of a mere majority say of one shall pass with them and with others as the act of the whole  we are so little affected by things which are habitual that we consider this idea of the decision of a majority as if it were a law of our original nature but such constructive whole residing in a part only is one of the most violent fictions of positive law that ever has been or can be made on the principles of artificial incorporation out of civil society nature knows nothing of it nor are men even when arranged according to civil order otherwise than by very long training brought at all to submit to it the mind is brought far more easily to acquiesce in the proceedings of one man or a few who act under a general procuration for the state than in the vote of a victorious majority in councils in which every man has his share in the deliberation for there the beaten party are exasperated and soured by the previous contention and mortified by the conclusive defeat this mode of decision where wills may be so nearly equal where according to circumstances the smaller number may be the stronger force and where apparent reason may be all upon one side and on the other little else than impetuous appetite all this must be the result of a very particular and special convention confirmed afterwards by long habits of obedience by a sort of discipline in society and by a strong hand vested with stationary permanent power to enforce this sort of constructive general will what organ it is that shall declare the corporate mind is so much a matter of positive arrangement that several states for the validity of several of their acts have required a proportion of voices much greater than that of a mere majority these proportions are so entirely governed by convention that in some cases the minority decides   magnanimity of english people    i do not accuse the people of england  as to the great majority of the nation they have done whatever in their several ranks and conditions and descriptions was required of them by their relative situations in society and from those the great mass of mankind cannot depart without the subversion of all public order they look up to that government which they obey that they may be protected they ask to be led and directed by those rulers whom providence and the laws of their country have set over them and under their guidance to walk in the ways of safety and honour they have again delegated the greatest trust which they have to bestow to those faithful representatives who made their true voice heard against the disturbers and destroyers of europe they suffered with unapproving acquiescence solicitations which they had in no shape desired to an unjust and usurping power whom they had never provoked and whose hostile menaces they did not dread when the exigencies of the public service could only be met by their voluntary zeal they started forth with an ardour which outstripped the wishes of those who had injured them by doubting whether it might not be necessary to have recourse to compulsion they have in all things reposed an enduring but not an unreflecting confidence that confidence demands a full return and fixes a responsibility on the ministers entire and undivided the people stands acquitted if the war is not carried on in a manner suited to its objects if the public honour is tarnished if the public safety suffers any detriment the ministers not the people are to answer it and they alone its armies its navies are given to them without stint or restriction its treasures are poured out at their feet its constancy is ready to second all their efforts they are not to fear a responsibility for acts of manly adventure the responsibility which they are to dread is lest they should show themselves unequal to the expectation of a brave people the more doubtful may be the constitutional and economical questions upon which they have received so marked a support the more loudly they are called upon to support this great war for the success of which their country is willing to supersede considerations of no slight importance where i speak of responsibility i do not mean to exclude that species of it which the legal powers of the country have a right finally to exact from those who abuse a public trust but high as this is there is a responsibility which attaches on them from which the whole legitimate power of this kingdom cannot absolve them there is a responsibility to conscience and to glory a responsibility to the existing world and to that posterity which men of their eminence cannot avoid for glory or for shame a responsibility to a tribunal at which not only ministers but kings and parliaments but even nations themselves must one day answer   true basis of civil society  we know and what is better we feel inwardly that religion is the basis of civil society and the source of all good and of all comfort in england we are so convinced of this that there is no rust of superstition with which the accumulated absurdity of the human mind might have crusted it over in the course of ages that ninetynine in a hundred of the people of england would not prefer to impiety we shall never be such fools as to call in an enemy to the substance of any system to remove its corruptions to supply its defects or to perfect its construction if our religious tenets should ever want a further elucidation we shall not call on atheism to explain them we shall not light up our temple from that unhallowed fire it will be illuminated with other lights it will be perfumed with other incense than the infectious stuff which is imported by the smugglers of adulterated metaphysics if our ecclesiastical establishment should want a revision it is not avarice or rapacity public or private that we shall employ for the audit or receipt or application of its consecrated revenue violently condemning neither the greek nor the armenian nor since heats are subsided the roman system of religion we prefer the protestant not because we think it has less of the christian religion in it but because in our judgment it has more we are protestants not from indifference but from zeal we know and it is our pride to know that man is by his constitution a religious animal that atheism is against not only our reason but our instincts and that it cannot prevail long but if in the moment of riot and in a drunken delirium from the hot spirit drawn out of the alembic of hell which in france is now so furiously boiling we should uncover our nakedness by throwing off that christian religion which has hitherto been our boast and comfort and one great source of civilization amongst us and among many other nations we are apprehensive being well aware that the mind will not endure a void that some uncouth pernicious and degrading superstition might take place of it   rousseau  it is undoubtedly true though it may seem paradoxical but in general those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation because their minds are not only unfurnished with patterns of the fair and good but by habit they come to take no delight in the contemplation of those things by hating vices too much they come to love men too little it is therefore not wonderful that they should be indisposed and unable to serve them from hence arises the complexional disposition of some of your guides to pull everything in pieces at this malicious game they display the whole of their quadrimanous activity as to the rest the paradoxes of eloquent writers brought forth purely as a sport of fancy to try their talents to rouse attention and excite surprise are taken up by these gentleman not in the spirit of the original authors as means of cultivating their taste and improving their style these paradoxes become with them serious grounds of action upon which they proceed in regulating the most important concerns of the state cicero ludicrously describes cato as endeavouring to act in the commonwealth upon the school paradoxes which exercised the wits of the junior students in the stoic philosophy if this was true of cato these gentlemen copy after him in the manner of some persons who lived about his timepede nudo catonem mr hume told me that he had from rousseau himself the secret of his principles of composition that acute though eccentric observer had perceived that to strike and interest the public the marvellous must be produced that the marvellous of the heathen mythology had long since lost its effects that giants magicians fairies and heroes of romance which succeeded had exhausted the portion of credulity which belonged to their age that now nothing was left to a writer but that species of the marvellous which might still be produced and with as great an effect as ever though in another way that is the marvellous in life in manners in characters and in extraordinary situations giving rise to new and unlookedfor strokes in politics and morals i believe that were rousseau alive and in one of his lucid intervals he would be shocked at the practical frenzy of his scholars who in their paradoxes are servile imitators and even in their incredulity discover an implicit faith   moral heroes    mankind has no title to demand that we should be slaves to their guilt and insolence or that we should serve them in spite of themselves minds sore with the poignant sense of insulted virtue filled with high disdain against the pride of triumphant baseness often have it not in their choice to stand their ground their complexion which might defy the rack cannot go through such a trial something very high must fortify men to that proof but when i am driven to comparison surely i cannot hesitate for a moment to prefer to such men as are common those heroes who in the midst of despair perform all the tasks of hope who subdue their feelings to their duties who in the cause of humanity liberty and honour abandon all the satisfactions of life and every day incur a fresh risk of life itself  do me the justice to believe that i never can prefer any fastidious virtue virtue still to the unconquered perseverance to the affectionate patience of those who watch day and night by the bedside of their delirious country who for their love to that dear and venerable name bear all the disgusts and all the buffets they receive from their frantic mother sir i do look on you as true martyrs i regard you as soldiers who act far more in the spirit of our commanderinchief and the captain of our salvation than those who have left you though i must first bolt myself very thoroughly and know that i could do better before i can censure them i assure you sir that when i consider your unconquerable fidelity to your sovereign and to your country the courage fortitude magnanimity and longsuffering of yourself and the abbe maury and of mr cazales and of many worthy persons of all orders in your assembly i forget in the lustre of these great qualities that on your side has been displayed an eloquence so rational manly and convincing that no time or country perhaps has ever excelled but your talents disappear in my admiration of your virtues   kingdom of france  when i consider the face of the kingdom of france the multitude and opulence of her cities the useful magnificence of her spacious highroads and bridges the opportunity of her artificial canals and navigations opening the conveniences of maritime communication through a solid continent of so immense an extent when i turn my eyes to the stupendous works of her ports and harbours and to her whole naval apparatus whether for war or trade when i bring before my view the number of her fortifications constructed with so bold and masterly a skill and made and maintained at so prodigious a charge presenting an armed front and impenetrable barrier to her enemies upon every side when i recollect how very small a part of that extensive region is without cultivation and to what complete perfection the culture of many of the best productions of the earth have been brought in france when i reflect on the excellence of her manufactures and fabrics second to none but ours and in some particulars not second when i contemplate the grand foundations of charity public and private when i survey the state of all the arts that beautify and polish life when i reckon the men she has bred for extending her fame in war her able statesmen the multitude of her profound lawyers and theologians her philosophers her critics her historians and antiquaries her poets and her orators sacred and profane i behold in all this something which awes and commands the imagination which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and indiscriminate censure and which demands that we should very seriously examine what and how great are the latent vices that could authorize us at once to level so specious a fabric with the ground i do not recognise in this view of things the despotism of turkey nor do i discern the character of a government that has been on the whole so oppressive or so corrupt or so negligent as to be utterly unfit for all reformation i must think such a government well deserved to have its excellences heightened its faults corrected and its capacities improved into a british constitution   grievance and opinion    this shows in my opinion how very quick and awakened all men ought to be who are looked up to by the public and who deserve that confidence to prevent a surprise on their opinions when dogmas are spread and projects pursued by which the foundations of society may be affected before they listen even to moderate alterations in the government of their country they ought to take care that principles are not propagated for that purpose which are too big for their object doctrines limited in their present application and wide in their general principles are never meant to be confined to what they at first pretend if i were to form a prognostic of the effect of the present machinations on the people from their sense of any grievance they suffer under this constitution my mind would be at ease but there is a wide difference between the multitude when they act against their government from a sense of grievance or from zeal for some opinions  when men are thoroughly possessed with that zeal it is difficult to calculate its force it is certain that its power is by no means in exact proportion to its reasonableness it must always have been discoverable by persons of reflection but it is now obvious to the world that a theory concerning government may become as much a cause of fanaticism as a dogma in religion there is a boundary to mens passions when they act from feeling none when they are under the influence of imagination remove a grievance and when men act from feeling you go a great way towards quieting a commotion but the good or bad conduct of a government the protection men have enjoyed or the oppression they have suffered under it are of no sort of moment when a faction proceeding upon speculative grounds is thoroughly heated against its form when a man is from system furious against monarchy or episcopacy the good conduct of the monarch or the bishop has no other effect than further to irritate the adversary he is provoked at it as furnishing a plea for preserving the thing which he wishes to destroy  his mind will be heated as much by the sight of a sceptre a mace or a verge as if he had been daily bruised and wounded by these symbols of authority mere spectacles mere names will become sufficient causes to stimulate the people to war and tumult   perplexity and policy  let us not deceive ourselves we are at the beginning of great troubles i readily acknowledge that the state of public affairs is infinitely more unpromising than at the period i have just now alluded to and the position of all the powers of europe in relation to us and in relation to each other is more intricate and critical beyond all comparison difficult indeed is our situation in all situations of difficulty men will be influenced in the part they take not only by the reason of the case but by the peculiar turn of their own character the same ways to safety do not present themselves to all men nor to the same men in different tempers there is a courageous wisdom there is also a false reptile prudence the result not of caution but of fear under misfortunes it often happens that the nerves of the understanding are so relaxed the pressing peril of the hour so completely confounds all the faculties that no future danger can be properly provided for can be justly estimated can be so much as fully seen the eye of the mind is dazzled and vanquished an abject distrust of ourselves an extravagant admiration of the enemy present us with no hope but in a compromise with his pride by a submission to his will this short plan of policy is the only counsel which will obtain a hearing we plunge into a dark gulf with all the rash precipitation of fear the nature of courage is without a question to be conversant with danger but in the palpable night of their terrors men under consternation suppose not that it is the danger which by a sure instinct calls out the courage to resist it but that it is the courage which produces the danger they therefore seek for a refuge from their fears in the fears themselves and consider a temporizing meanness as the only source of safety  the rules and definitions of prudence can rarely be exact never universal i do not deny that in small truckling states a timely compromise with power has often been the means and the only means of drawling out their puny existence but a great state is too much envied too much dreaded to find safety in humiliation to be secure it must be respected power and eminence and consideration are things not to be begged they must be commanded and they who supplicate for mercy from others can never hope for justice through themselves what justice they are to obtain as the alms of an enemy depends upon his character and that they ought well to know before they implicitly confide   historical instruction    such is the effect of the perversion of history by those who for the same nefarious purposes have perverted every other part of learning but those who will stand upon that elevation of reason which places centuries under our eye and brings things to the true point of comparison which obscures little names and effaces the colours of little parties and to which nothing can ascend but the spirit and moral quality of human actions will say to the teachers of the palais royalthe cardinal of lorraine was the murderer of the sixteenth century you have the glory of being the murderers in the eighteenth and this is the only difference between you but history in the nineteenth century better understood and better employed will i trust teach a civilized posterity to abhor the misdeeds of both these barbarous ages it will teach future priests and magistrates not to retaliate upon the speculative and inactive atheists of future times the enormities committed by the present practical zealots and furious fanatics of that wretched error which in its quiescent state is more than punished whenever it is embraced it will teach posterity not to make war upon either religion or philosophy for the abuse which the hypocrites of both have made of the two most valuable blessings conferred upon us by the bounty of the universal patron who in all things eminently favours and protects the race of man   montesquieu  place for instance before your eyes such a man as montesquieu think of a genius not born in every country or every time a man gifted by nature with a penetrating aquiline eye with a judgment prepared with the most extensive erudition with an herculean robustness of mind and nerves not to be broken with labour a man who could spend twenty years in one pursuit think of a man like the universal patriarch in milton who had drawn up before him in his prophetic vision the whole series of the generations which were to issue from his loins a man capable of placing in review after having brought together from the east the west the north and the south from the coarseness of the rudest barbarism to the most refined and subtle civilization all the schemes of government which had ever prevailed amongst mankind weighing measuring collating and comparing them all joining fact with theory and calling into council upon all this infinite assemblage of things all the speculations which have fatigued the understandings of profound reasoners in all times let us then consider that all these were but so many preparatory steps to qualify a man and such a man tinctured with no national prejudice with no domestic affection to admire and to hold out to the admiration of mankind the constitution of england and shall we englishmen revoke to such a suit shall we when so much more than he has produced remains still to be understood and admired instead of keeping ourselves in the schools of real science choose for our teachers men incapable of being taught whose only claim to know is that they have never doubted from whom we can learn nothing but their own indocility who would teach us to scorn what in the silence of our hearts we ought to adore   articles and scripture  if you will have religion publicly practised and publicly taught you must have a power to say what that religion will be which you will protect and encourage and to distinguish it by such marks and characteristics as you in your wisdom shall think fit as i said before your determination may be unwise in this as in other matters but it cannot be unjust hard or oppressive or contrary to the liberty of any man or in the least degree exceeding your province  it is therefore as a grievance fairly none at all nothing but what is essential not only to the order but to the liberty of the whole community the petitioners are so sensible of the force of these arguments that they do admit of one subscription that is to the scripture i shall not consider how forcibly this argument militates with their whole principle against subscription as an usurpation on the rights of providence i content myself with submitting to the consideration of the house that if that rule were once established it must have some authority to enforce the obedience because you well know a law without a sanction will be ridiculous somebody must sit in judgment on his conformity he must judge on the charge if he judges he must ordain execution these things are necessary consequences one of the other and then this judgment is an equal and a superior violation of private judgment the right of private judgment is violated in a much greater degree than it can be by any previous subscription you come round again to subscription as the best and easiest method men must judge of his doctrine and judge definitively so that either his test is nugatory or men must first or last prescribe his public interpretation of it   problem of legislation  it is one of the finest problems in legislation and what has often engaged my thoughts whilst i followed that profession what the state ought to take upon itself to direct by the public wisdom and what it ought to leave with as little interference as possible to individual discretion nothing certainly can be laid down on the subject that will not admit of exceptions many permanent some occasional but the clearest line of distinction which i could draw whilst i had my chalk to draw any line was this that the state ought to confine itself to what regards the state or the creatures of the statenamely the exterior establishment of its religion its magistracy its revenue its military force by sea and land the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat in a word to everything that is truly and properly public to the public peace to the public safety to the public order to the public prosperity in its preventive police it ought to be sparing of its efforts and to employ means rather few unfrequent and strong than many and frequent and of course as they multiply their puny politic race and dwindle small and feeble statesmen who know themselves will with the dignity which belongs to wisdom proceed only in this the superior orb and first mover of their duty steadily vigilantly severely courageously whatever remains will in a manner provide for itself but as they descend from the state to a province from a province to a parish and from a parish to a private house they go on accelerated in their fall they cannot do the lower duty and in proportion as they try it they will certainly fail in the higher they ought to know the different departments of things what belongs to laws and what manners alone can regulate to these great politicians may give a leaning but they cannot give a law   order labour and property    to tell the people that they are relieved by the dilapidation of their public estate is a cruel and insolent imposition statesmen before they valued themselves on the relief given to the people by the destruction of their revenue ought first to have carefully attended to the solution of this problemwhether it be more advantageous to the people to pay considerably and to gain in proportion or to gain little or nothing and to be disburthened of all contribution my mind is made up to decide in favour of the first proposition experience is with me and i believe the best opinions also to keep a balance between the power of acquisition on the part of the subject and the demands he is to answer on the part of the state is the fundamental part of the skill of a true politician the means of acquisition are prior in time and in arrangement good order is the foundation of all good things to be enabled to acquire the people without being servile must be tractable and obedient the magistrate must have his reverence the laws their authority the body of the people must not find the principles of natural subordination by art rooted out of their minds they must respect that property of which they cannot partake they must labour to obtain what by labour can be obtained and when they find as they commonly do the success disproportioned to the endeavour they must be taught their consolation in the final proportions of eternal justice of this consolation whoever deprives them deadens their industry and strikes at the root of all acquisition as of all conservation he that does this is the cruel oppressor the merciless enemy of the poor and wretched at the same time that by his wicked speculations he exposes the fruits of successful industry and the accumulations of fortune to the plunder of the negligent the disappointed and the unprosperous   regicidal legislature  this strange law is not made for a trivial object not for a single port or for a single fortress but for a great kingdom for the religion the morals the laws the liberties the lives and fortunes of millions of human creatures who without their consent or that of their lawful government are by an arbitrary act of this regicide and homicide government which they call a law incorporated into their tyranny  in other words their will is the law not only at home but as to the concerns of every nation who has made that law but the regicide republic itself whose laws like those of the medes and persians they cannot alter or abrogate or even so much as take into consideration without the least ceremony or compliment they have sent out of the world whole sets of laws and lawgivers they have swept away the very constitutions under which the legislators acted and the laws were made even the fundamental sacred rights of man they have not scrupled to profane they have set this holy code at naught with ignominy and scorn thus they treat all their domestic laws and constitutions and even what they had considered as a law of nature but whatever they have put their seal on for the purposes of their ambition and the ruin of their neighbours this alone is invulnerable impassible immortal assuming to be masters of everything human and divine here and here alone it seems they are limited cooped and cabined in and this omnipotent legislature finds itself wholly without the power of exercising its favourite attribute the love of peace in other words they are powerful to usurp impotent to restore and equally by their power and their impotence they aggrandize themselves and weaken and impoverish you and all other nations   government not to be rashly censured  the purpose for which the abuses of government are brought into view forms a very material consideration in the mode of treating them the complaints of a friend are things very different from the invectives of an enemy the charge of abuses on the late monarchy of france was not intended to lead to its reformation but to justify its destruction they who have raked into all history for the faults of kings and who have aggravated every fault they have found have acted consistently because they acted as enemies no man can be a friend to a tempered monarchy who bears a decided hatred to monarchy itself he who at the present time is favourable or even fair to that system must act towards it as towards a friend with frailties who is under the prosecution of implacable foes i think it a duty in that case not to inflame the public mind against the obnoxious person by any exaggeration of his faults it is our duty rather to palliate his errors and defects or to cast them into the shade and industriously to bring forward any good qualities that he may happen to possess but when the man is to be amended and by amendment to be preserved then the line of duty takes another direction when his safety is effectually provided for it then becomes the office of a friend to urge his faults and vices with all the energy of enlightened affection to paint them in their most vivid colours and to bring the moral patient to a better habit thus i think with regard to individuals thus i think with regard to ancient and respected governments and orders of men a spirit of reformation is never more consistent with itself than when it refuses to be rendered the means of destruction   etiquette    etiquette if i understand rightly the term which in any extent is of modern usage had its original application to those ceremonial and formal observances practised at courts which had been established by long usage in order to preserve the sovereign power from the rude intrusion of licentious familiarity as well as to preserve majesty itself from a disposition to consult its ease at the expense of its dignity the term came afterwards to have a greater latitude and to be employed to signify certain formal methods used in the transactions between sovereign states  in the more limited as well as in the larger sense of the term without knowing what the etiquette is it is impossible to determine whether it is a vain and captious punctilio or a form necessary to preserve decorum in character and order in business i readily admit that nothing tends to facilitate the issue of all public transactions more than a mutual disposition in the parties treating to waive all ceremony but the use of this temporary suspension of the recognised modes of respect consists in its being mutual and in the spirit of conciliation in which all ceremony is laid aside on the contrary when one of the parties to a treaty intrenches himself up to the chin in these ceremonies and will not on his side abate a single punctilio and that all the concessions are upon one side only the party so conceding does by this act place himself in a relation of inferiority and thereby fundamentally subverts that equality which is of the very essence of all treaty   ancient establishments  old establishments are tried by their effects if the people are happy united wealthy and powerful we presume the rest we conclude that to be good from whence good is derived in old establishments various correctives have been found for their aberrations from theory indeed they are the results of various necessities and expediencies they are not often constructed after any theory theories are rather drawn from them in them we often see the end best obtained where the means seem not perfectly reconcilable to what we may fancy was the original scheme the means taught by experience may be better suited to political ends than those contrived in the original project they again react upon the primitive constitution and sometimes improve the design itself from which they seem to have departed i think all this might be curiously exemplified in the british constitution at worst the errors and deviations of every kind in reckoning are found and computed and the ship proceeds in her course this is the case of old establishments but in a new and merely theoretic system it is expected that every contrivance shall appear on the face of it to answer its ends especially where the projectors are no way embarrassed with an endeavour to accommodate the new building to an old one either in the walls or on the foundations   sentiment and policy    never was there a jar or discord between genuine sentiment and sound policy never no never did nature say one thing and wisdom say another nor are sentiments of elevation in themselves turgid and unnatural nature is never more truly herself than in her grandest form the apollo of belvedere if the universal robber has yet left him at belvedere is as much in nature as any figure from the pencil of rembrandt or any clown in the rustic revels of teniers  indeed it is when a great nation is in great difficulties that minds must exalt themselves to the occasion or all is lost strong passion under the direction of a feeble reason feeds a low fever which serves only to destroy the body that entertains it but vehement passion does not always indicate an infirm judgment it often accompanies and actuates and is even auxiliary to a powerful understanding and when they both conspire and act harmoniously their force is great to destroy disorder within and to repel injury from abroad if ever there was a time that calls on us for no vulgar conception of things and for exertions in no vulgar strain it is the awful hour that providence has now appointed to this nation every little measure is a great error and every great error will bring on no small ruin nothing can be directed above the mark that we must aim at everything below it is absolutely thrown away   patriotism  i have little to recommend my opinions but long observation and much impartiality they come from one who has been no tool of power no flatterer of greatness and who in his last acts does not wish to belie the tenor of his life they come from one almost the whole of whose public exertions has been a struggle for the liberty of others from one in whose breast no anger durable or vehement has ever been kindled but by what he considered as tyranny and who snatches from his share in the endeavours which are used by good men to discredit opulent oppression the hours he has employed on your affairs and who in so doing persuades himself he has not departed from his usual office they come from one who desires honours distinctions and emoluments but little and who expects them not at all who has no contempt for fame and no fear of obloquy who shuns contention though he will hazard an opinion who would preserve consistency by varying his means to secure the unity of his end and when the equipoise of the vessel in which he sails may be endangered by overloading it upon one side is desirous of carrying the small weight of his reasons to that which may preserve its equipoise   necessity a relative term  the only excuse to be made for all our mendicant diplomacy is the same as in the case of all other mendicancynamely that it has been founded on absolute necessity this deserves consideration necessity as it has no law so it has no shame but moral necessity is not like metaphysical or even physical in that category it is a word of loose signification and conveys different ideas to different minds to the lowminded the slightest necessity becomes an invincible necessity the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way and i shall be devoured in the streets but when the necessity pleaded is not in the nature of things but in the vices of him who alleges it the whining tones of commonplace beggarly rhetoric produce nothing but indignation because they indicate a desire of keeping up a dishonourable existence without utility to others and without dignity to itself because they aim at obtaining the dues of labour without industry and by frauds would draw from the compassion of others what men ought to owe to their own spirit and their own exertions   king john and the pope  he began with exacting an oath from the king by which without showing the extent of his design he engaged him to everything he could ask john swore to submit to the legate in all things relating to his excommunication and first he was obliged to accept langton as archbishop then to restore the monks of canterbury and other deprived ecclesiastics and to make them a full indemnification for all their losses and now by these concessions all things seemed to be perfectly settled the cause of the quarrel was entirely removed but when the king expected for so perfect a submission a full absolution the legate began a laboured harangue on his rebellion his tyranny and the innumerable sins he had committed and in conclusion declared that there was no way left to appease god and the church but to resign his crown to the holy see from whose hands he should receive it purified from all pollutions and hold it for the future by homage and an annual tribute john was struck motionless at a demand so extravagant and unexpected he knew not on which side to turn if he cast his eyes toward the coast of france he there saw his enemy philip who considered him as a criminal as well as an enemy and who aimed not only at his crown but his life at the head of an innumerable multitude of fierce people ready to rush in upon him if he looked at his own army he saw nothing there but coldness disaffection uncertainty distrust and a strength in which he knew not whether he ought most to confide or fear on the other hand the papal thunders from the wounds of which he was still sore were leveled full at his head he could not look steadily at these complicated difficulties and truly it is hard to say what choice he had if any choice were left to kings in what concerns the independence of their crown surrounded therefore with these difficulties and that all his late humiliations might not be rendered as ineffectual as they were ignominious he took the last step and in the presence of a numerous assembly of his peers and prelates who turned their eyes from this mortifying sight formally resigned his crown to the popes legate to whom at the same time he did homage and paid the first fruits of his tribute nothing could be added to the humiliation of the king upon this occasion but the insolence of the legate who spurned the treasure with his foot and let the crown remain a long time on the ground before he restored it to the degraded owner  in this proceeding the motives of the king may be easily discovered but how the barons of the kingdom who were deeply concerned suffered without any protestation the independency of the crown to be thus forfeited is mentioned by no historian of that time in civil tumults it is astonishing how little regard is paid by all parties to the honour or safety of their country the kings friends were probably induced to acquiesce by the same motives that had influenced the king his enemies who were the most numerous perhaps saw his abasement with pleasure as they knew this action might be one day employed against him with effect to the bigots it was enough that it aggrandized the pope it is perhaps worthy of observation that the conduct of pandulph towards king john bore a very great affinity to that of the roman consuls to the people of carthage in the last punic war drawing them from concession to concession and carefully concealing their design until they made it impossible for the carthaginians to resist such a strong resemblance did the same ambition produce in such distant times and it is far from the sole instance in which we may trace a similarity between the spirit and conduct of the former and latter rome in their common design on the liberties of mankind   consumption and produce  the balance between consumption and production makes price the market settles and alone can settle that price market is the meeting and conference of the consumer and producer when they mutually discover each others wants nobody i believe has observed with any reflection what market is without being astonished at the truth the correctness the celerity the general equity with which the balance of wants is settled they who wish the destruction of that balance and would fain by arbitrary regulation decree that defective production should not be compensated by increased price directly lay their axe to the root of production itself   priests of the rights of man    his grace like an able orator as he is begins with giving me a great deal of praise for talents which i do not possess he does this to entitle himself on the credit of this gratuitous kindness to exaggerate my abuse of the parts which his bounty and not that of nature has bestowed upon me in this too he has condescended to copy mr erskine these priests i hope they will excuse me i mean priests of the rights of man begin by crowning me with their flowers and their fillets and bedewing me with their odours as a preface to the knocking me on the head with their consecrated axes  i have injured say they the constitution and i have abandoned the whig party and the whig principles that i professed i do not mean my dear sir to defend myself against his grace i have not much interest in what the world shall think or say of me as little has the world an interest in what i shall think or say of any one in it and i wish that his grace had suffered an unhappy man to enjoy in his retreat the melancholy privileges of obscurity and sorrow at any rate i have spoken and i have written on the subject if i have written or spoken so poorly as to be quite forgot a fresh apology will not make a more lasting impression i must let the tree lie as it falls perhaps i must take some shame to myself i confess that i have acted on my own principles of government and not on those of his grace which are i dare say profound and wise but which i do not pretend to understand  as to the party to which he alludes and which has long taken its leave of me i believe the principles of the book which he condemns are very conformable to the opinions of many of the most considerable and most grave in that description of politicians a few indeed who i admit are equally respectable in all points differ from me and talk his graces language i am too feeble to contend with them they have the field to themselves there are others very young and very ingenious persons who form probably the largest part of what his grace i believe is pleased to consider as that party some of them were not born into the world and all of them were children when i entered into that connection i give due credit to the censorial brow to the broad phylacteries and to the imposing gravity of those magisterial rabbins and doctors in the cabala of political science i admit that wisdom is as the gray hair to man and that learning is like honourable old age but at a time when liberty is a good deal talked of perhaps i might be excused if i caught something of the general indocility it might not be surprising if i lengthened my chain a link or two and in an age of relaxed discipline gave a trifling indulgence to my own notions if that could be allowed perhaps i might sometimes by accident and without an unpardonable crime trust as much to my own very careful and very laborious though perhaps somewhat purblind disquisitions as to their soaring intuitive eagleeyed authority but the modern liberty is a precious thing it must not be profaned by too vulgar an use it belongs only to the chosen few who are born to the hereditary representation of the whole democracy and who leave nothing at all no not the offal to us poor outcasts of the plebeian race   his grace  amongst those gentlemen who came to authority as soon or sooner than they came of age i do not mean to include his grace with all those native titles to empire over our minds which distinguish the others he has a large share of experience he certainly ought to understand the british constitution better than i do he has studied it in the fundamental part for one election i have seen he has been concerned in twenty nobody is less of a visionary theorist nobody has drawn his speculations more from practice no peer has condescended to superintend with more vigilance the declining franchises of the poor commons with thrice great hermes he has outwatched the bear often have his candles been burned to the snuff and glimmered and stunk in the sockets whilst he grew pale at his constitutional studies long sleepless nights has he wasted long laborious shiftless journeys has he made and great sums has he expended in order to secure the purity the independence and the sobriety of elections and to give a check if possible to the ruinous charges that go nearly to the destruction of the right of election itself amidst these his labours his grace will be pleased to forgive me if my zeal less enlightened to be sure than his by midnight lamps and studies has presumed to talk too favourably of this constitution and even to say something sounding like approbation of that body which has the honour to reckon his grace at the head of it those who dislike this partiality or if his grace pleases this flattery of mine have a comfort at hand i may be refuted and brought to shame by the most convincing of all refutationsa practical refutation every individual peer for himself may show that i was ridiculously wrong the whole body of those noble persons may refute me for the whole corps if they please they are more powerful advocates against themselves than a thousand scribblers like me can be in their favour if i were even possessed of those powers which his grace in order to heighten my offence is pleased to attribute to me there would be little difference the eloquence of mr erskine might save mr from the gallows but no eloquence could save mr jackson from the effects of his own potion   speculation and history  i shall not live to behold the unravelling of the intricate plot which saddens and perplexes the awful drama of providence now acting on the moral theatre of the world whether for thought or for action i am at the end of my career you are in the middle of yours in what part of its orbit the nation with which we are carried along moves at this instant it is not easy to conjecture it may perhaps be far advanced in its aphelionbut when to return  not to lose ourselves in the infinite void of the conjectural world our business is with what is likely to be affected for the better or the worse by the wisdom or weakness of our plans in all speculations upon men and human affairs it is of no small moment to distinguish things of accident from permanent causes and from effects that cannot be altered it is not every irregularity in our movement that is a total deviation from our course i am not quite of the mind of those speculators who seem assured that necessarily and by the constitution of things all states have the same periods of infancy manhood and decrepitude that are found in the individuals who compose them parallels of this sort rather furnish similitudes to illustrate or to adorn than supply analogies from whence to reason the objects which are attempted to be forced into an analogy are not found in the same classes of existence individuals are physical beings subject to laws universal and invariable the immediate cause acting in these laws may be obscure the general results are subjects of certain calculation but commonwealths are not physical but moral essences they are artificial combinations and in their proximate efficient cause the arbitrary productions of the human mind we are not yet acquainted with the laws which necessarily influence the stability of that kind of work made by that kind of agent there is not in the physical order with which they do not appear to hold any assignable connection a distinct cause by which any of those fabrics must necessarily grow flourish or decay nor in my opinion does the moral world produce anything more determinate on that subject than what may serve as an amusement liberal indeed and ingenious but still only an amusement for speculative men i doubt whether the history of mankind is yet complete enough if ever it can be so to furnish grounds for a sure theory on the internal causes which necessarily affect the fortune of a state i am far from denying the operation of such causes but they are infinitely uncertain and much more obscure and much more difficult to trace than the foreign causes that tend to raise to depress and sometimes to overwhelm a community it is often impossible in these political inquiries to find any proportion between the apparent force of any moral causes we may assign and their known operation we are therefore obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance or more piously perhaps more rationally to the occasional interposition and irresistible hand of the great disposer we have seen states of considerable duration which for ages have remained nearly as they have begun and could hardly be said to ebb or flow some appear to have spent their vigour at their commencement some have blazed out in their glory a little before their extinction the meridian of some has been the most splendid others and they the greatest number have fluctuated and experienced at different periods of their existence a great variety of fortune at the very moment when some of them seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster they have suddenly emerged they have begun a new course and opened a new reckoning and even in the depths of their calamity and on the very ruins of their country have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness all this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress the death of a man at a critical juncture his disgust his retreat his disgrace have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation a common soldier a child a girl at the door of an inn have changed the face of fortune and almost of nature  such and often influenced by such causes has commonly been the fate of monarchies of long duration they have their ebbs and their flows this has been eminently the fate of the monarchy of france there have been times in which no power has ever been brought so low few have ever flourished in greater glory by turns elevated and depressed that power had been on the whole rather on the increase and it continued not only powerful but formidable to the hour of the total ruin of the monarchy this fall of the monarchy was far from being preceded by any exterior symptoms of decline the interior were not visible to every eye and a thousand accidents might have prevented the operation of what the most clearsighted were not able to discern nor the most provident to divine a very little time before its dreadful catastrophe there was a kind of exterior splendour in the situation of the crown which usually adds to government strength and authority at home the crown seemed then to have obtained some of the most splendid objects of state ambition none of the continental powers of europe were the enemies of france they were all either tacitly disposed to her or publicly connected with her and in those who kept the most aloof there was little appearance of jealousy of animosity there was no appearance at all the british nation her great preponderating rival she had humbled to all appearance she had weakened certainly had endangered by cutting off a very large and by far the most growing part of her empire in that its acme of human prosperity and greatness in the high and palmy state of the monarchy of france it fell to the ground without a struggle it fell without any of those vices in the monarch which have sometimes been the causes of the fall of kingdoms but which existed without any visible effect on the state in the highest degree in many other princes and far from destroying their power had only left some slight stains on their character the financial difficulties were only pretexts and instruments of those who accomplished the ruin of that monarchy they were not the causes of it  deprived of the old government deprived in a manner of all government france fallen as a monarchy to common speculators might have appeared more likely to be an object of pity or insult according to the disposition of the circumjacent powers than to be the scourge and terror of them all but out of the tomb of the murdered monarchy in france has arisen a vast tremendous unformed spectre in a far more terrific guise than any which ever yet have overpowered the imagination and subdued the fortitude of man going straight forward to its end unappalled by peril unchecked by remorse despising all common maxims and all common means that hideous phantom overpowered those who could not believe it was possible she could at all exist except on the principles which habit rather than nature had persuaded them were necessary to their own particular welfare and to their own ordinary modes of action but the constitution of any political being as well as that of any physical being ought to be known before one can venture to say what is fit for its conservation or what is the proper means of its power the poison of other states is the food of the new republic that bankruptcy the very apprehension of which is one of the causes assigned for the fall of the monarchy was the capital on which she opened her traffic with the world   labour and wages    in the case of the farmer and the labourer their interests are always the same and it is absolutely impossible that their free contracts can be onerous to either party it is the interest of the farmer that his work should be done with effect and celerity  and that cannot be unless the labourer is well fed and otherwise found with such necessaries of animal life according to his habitudes as may keep the body in full force and the mind gay and cheerful for of all the instruments of his trade the labour of man what the ancient writers have called the instrumentum vocale is that on which he is most to rely for the repayment of his capital the other two the semivocale in the ancient classification that is the working stock of cattle and the instrumentum mutum such as carts ploughs spades and so forth though not all inconsiderable in themselves are very much inferior in utility or in expense or without a given portion of the first are nothing at all for in all things whatever the mind is the most valuable and the most important and in this scale the whole of agriculture is in a natural and just order the beast is as an informing principle to the plough and cart the labourer is as reason to the beast and the farmer is as a thinking and presiding principle to the labourer an attempt to break this chain of subordination in any part is equally absurd but the absurdity is the most mischievous in practical operation where it is the most easy that is where it is the most subject to an erroneous judgment  it is plainly more the farmers interest that his men should thrive than that his horses should be well fed sleek plump and fit for use or than that his waggons and ploughs should be strong in good repair and fit for service  on the other hand if the farmer cease to profit of the labourer and that his capital is not continually manured and fructified it is impossible that he should continue that abundant nutriment and clothing and lodging proper for the protection of the instruments he employs  it is therefore the first and fundamental interest of the labourer that the farmer should have a full incoming profit on the product of his labour the proposition is selfevident and nothing but the malignity perverseness and illgoverned passions of mankind and particularly the envy they bear to each others prosperity could prevent their seeing and acknowledging it with thankfulness to the benign and wise disposer of all things who obliges men whether they will or not in pursuing their own selfish interests to connect the general good with their own individual success  but who are to judge what that profit and advantage ought to be certainly no authority on earth it is a matter of convention dictated by the reciprocal conveniences of the parties and indeed by their reciprocal necessitiesbut if the farmer is excessively avariciouswhy so much the betterthe more he desires to increase his gains the more interested is he in the good condition of those upon whose labour his gains must principally depend  i shall be told by the zealots of the sect of regulation that this may be true and may be safely committed to the convention of the farmer and the labourer when the latter is in the prime of his youth and at the time of his health and vigour and in ordinary times of abundance but in calamitous seasons under accidental illness in declining life and with the pressure of a numerous offspring the future nourishers of the community but the present drains and bloodsuckers of those who produce them what is to be done when a man cannot live and maintain his family by the natural hire of his labour ought it not to be raised by authority  on this head i must be allowed to submit what my opinions have ever been and somewhat at large and first i premise that labour is as i have already intimated a commodity and as such an article of trade if i am right in this notion then labour must be subject to all the laws and principles of trade and not to regulation foreign to them and that may be totally inconsistent with those principles and those laws when any commodity is carried to market it is not the necessity of the vender but the necessity of the purchaser that raises the price the extreme want of the seller has rather by the nature of things with which we shall in vain contend the direct contrary operation if the goods at market are beyond the demand they fall in their value if below it they rise the impossibility of the subsistence of a man who carries his labour to a market is totally beside the question in his way of viewing it the only question is what is it worth to the buyer  but if the authority comes in and forces the buyer to a price who is this in the case say of a farmer who buys the labour of ten or twelve labouring men and three or four handicrafts what is it but to make an arbitrary division of his property among them  the whole of his gains i say it with the most certain conviction never do amount anything like in value to what he pays to his labourers and artificers so that a very small advance upon what one man pays to many may absorb the whole of what he possesses and amount to an actual partition of all his substance among them a perfect equality will indeed be producedthat is to say equal want equal wretchedness equal beggary and on the part of the petitioners a woeful helpless and desperate disappointment such is the event of all compulsory equalizations they pull down what is above they never raise what is below and they depress high and low together beneath the level of what was originally the lowest  if a commodity is raised by authority above what it will yield with a profit to the buyer that commodity will be the less dealt in if a second blundering interposition be used to correct the blunder of the first and an attempt is made to force the purchase of the commodity of labour for instance the one of these two things must happen either that the forced buyer is ruined or the price of the product of the labour in that proportion is raised then the wheel turns round and the evil complained of falls with aggravated weight on the complainant the price of corn which is the result of the expense of all the operations of husbandry taken together and for some time continued will rise on the labourer considered as a consumer the very best will be that he remains where he was but if the price of the corn should not compensate the price of labour what is far more to be feared the most serious evil the very destruction of agriculture itself is to be apprehended  nothing is such an enemy to accuracy of judgment as a coarse discrimination a want of such classification and distribution as the subject admits of increase the rate of wages to the labourer say the regulatorsas if labour was but one thing and of one value but this very broad generic term labour admits at least of two or three specific descriptions and these will suffice at least to let gentlemen discern a little the necessity of proceeding with caution in their coercive guidance of those whose existence depends upon the observance of still nicer distinctions and subdivisions than commonly they resort to in forming their judgments on this very enlarged part of economy  the labourers in husbandry may be divided 1st into those who are able to perform the full work of a man that is what can be done by a person from twentyone years of age to fifty i know no husbandrywork mowing hardly excepted that is not equally within the power of all persons within those ages the more advanced fully compensating by knack and habit what they lose in activity unquestionably there is a good deal of difference between the value of one mans labour and that of another from strength dexterity and honest application but i am quite sure from my best observation that any given five men will in their total afford a proportion of labour equal to any other five within the periods of life i have stated that is that among such five men there will be one possessing all the qualifications of a good workman one bad and the other three middling and approximating to the first and the last so that in so small a platoon as that of even five you will find the full complement of all that five men can earn taking five and five throughout the kingdom they are equal therefore an error with regard to the equalization of their wages by those who employ five as farmers do at the very least cannot be considerable 2ndly those who are able to work but not the complete task of a daylabourer this class is infinitely diversified but will aptly enough fall into principal divisions men from the decline which after fifty becomes every year more sensible to the period of debility and decrepitude and the maladies that precede a final dissolution women whose employment on husbandry is but occasional and who differ more in effective labour one from another than men do on account of gestation nursing and domestic management over and above the difference they have in common with men in advancing in stationary and in declining life children who proceed on the reverse order growing from less to greater utility but with a still greater disproportion of nutriment to labour than is found in the second of these subdivisions as is visible to those who will give themselves the trouble of examining into the interior economy of a poorhouse  this inferior classification is introduced to show that laws prescribing or magistrates exercising a very stiff and often inapplicable rule or a blind and rash discretion never can provide the just proportions between earning and salary on the one hand and nutriment on the other whereas interest habit and the tacit convention that arise from a thousand nameless circumstances produce a tact that regulates without difficulty what laws and magistrates cannot regulate at all the first class of labour wants nothing to equalize it it equalizes itself the second and third are not capable of any equalization  but what if the rate of hire to the labourer comes far short of his necessary subsistence and the calamity of the time is so great as to threaten actual famine is the poor labourer to be abandoned to the flinty heart and griping hand of base selfinterest supported by the sword of law especially when there is reason to suppose that the very avarice of farmers themselves has concurred with the errors of government to bring famine on the land   a complete revolution  before this of france the annals of all time have not furnished an instance of a complete revolution that revolution seems to have extended even to the constitution of the mind of man it has this of wonderful in it that it resembles what lord verulam says of the operations of nature it was perfect not only in its elements and principles but in all its members and its organs from the very beginning the moral scheme of france furnishes the only pattern ever known which they who admire will instantly resemble it is indeed an inexhaustible repertory of one kind of examples in my wretched condition though hardly to be classed with the living i am not safe from them they have tigers to fall upon animated strength they have hyaenas to prey upon carcasses the national menagerie is collected by the first physiologists of the time and it is defective in no description of savage nature they pursue even such as me into the obscurest retreats and haul them before their revolutionary tribunals neither sex nor agenor the sanctuary of the tomb is sacred to them they have so determined a hatred to all privileged orders that they deny even to the departed the sad immunities of the grave they are not wholly without an object their turpitude purveys to their malice and they unplumb the dead for bullets to assassinate the living if all revolutionists were not proof against all caution i should recommend it to their consideration that no persons were ever known in history either sacred or profane to vex the sepulchre and by their sorceries to call up the prophetic dead with any other event than the prediction of their own disastrous fateleave me oh leave me to repose   british government in india    the british government in india being a subordinate and delegated power it ought to be considered as a fundamental principle in such a system that it is to be preserved in the strictest obedience to the government at home administration in india at an immense distance from the seat of the supreme authority intrusted with the most extensive powers liable to the greatest temptations possessing the amplest means of abuse ruling over a people guarded by no distinct or wellascertained privileges whose language manners and radical prejudices render not only redress but all complaint on their part a matter of extreme difficulty such an administration it is evident never can be made subservient to the interests of great britain or even tolerable to the natives but by the strictest rigour in exacting obedience to the commands of the authority lawfully set over it   money and science  my exertions whatever they have been were such as no hopes of pecuniary reward could possibly excite and no pecuniary compensation can possibly reward them between money and such services if done by abler men than i am there is no common principle of comparison they are quantities incommensurable money is made for the comfort and convenience of animal life it cannot be a reward for what mere animal life must indeed sustain but never can inspire with submission to his grace i have not had more than sufficient as to any noble use i trust i know how to employ as well as he a much greater fortune than he possesses in a more confined application i certainly stand in need of every kind of relief and easement much more than he does when i say i have not received more than i deserve is this the language i hold to majesty no far very far from it before that presence i claim no merit at all everything towards me is favour and bounty one style to a gracious benefactor another to a proud and insulting foe  his grace is pleased to aggravate my guilt by charging my acceptance of his majestys grant as a departure from my ideas and the spirit of my conduct with regard to economy if it be my ideas of economy were false and illfounded but they are the duke of bedfords ideas of economy i have contradicted and not my own if he means to allude to certain bills brought in by me on a message from the throne in 1782 i tell him that there is nothing in my conduct that can contradict either the letter or the spirit of those acts does he mean the payoffice act i take it for granted he does not the act to which he alludes is i suppose the establishment act i greatly doubt whether his grace has ever read the one or the other the first of these systems cost me with every assistance which my then situation gave me pains incredible i found an opinion common through all the offices and general in the public at large that it would prove impossible to reform and methodize the office of paymastergeneral i undertook it however and i succeeded in my undertaking whether the military service or whether the general economy of our finances have profited by that act i leave to those who are acquainted with the army and with the treasury to judge   political axioms  i  of all things an indiscreet tampering with the trade of provisions is the most dangerous and it is always worst in the time when men are most disposed to it that is in the time of scarcity because there is nothing on which the passions of men are so violent and their judgment so weak and on which there exists such a multitude of illfounded popular prejudices  ii    the great use of government is as a restraint and there is no restraint which it ought to put upon others and upon itself too rather than that which is imposed on the fury of speculating under circumstances of irritation the number of idle tales spread about by the industry of faction and by the zeal of foolish goodintention and greedily devoured by the malignant credulity of mankind tends infinitely to aggravate prejudices which in themselves are more than sufficiently strong in that state of affairs and of the public with relation to them the first thing that government owes to us the people is information the next is timely coercionthe one to guide our judgment the other to regulate our tempers  iii  to provide for us in our necessities is not in the power of government it would be a vain presumption in statesmen to think they can do it the people maintain them and not they the people it is in the power of government to prevent much evil it can do very little positive good in this or perhaps in anything else it is not only so of the state and statesmen but of all the classes and descriptions of the richthey are the pensioners of the poor and are maintained by their superfluity they are under an absolute hereditary and indefeasible dependence on those who labour and are miscalled the poor  iv  the labouring people are only poor because they are numerous numbers in their nature imply poverty in a fair distribution among a vast multitude none can have much that class of dependent pensioners called the rich is so extremely small that if all their throats were cut and a distribution made of all they consume in a year it would not give a bit of bread and cheese for one nights supper to those who labour and who in reality feed both the pensioners and themselves  v  but the throats of the rich ought not to be cut nor their magazines plundered because in their persons they are trustees for those who labour and their hoards are the bankinghouses of these latter whether they mean it or not they do in effect execute their trustsome with more some with less fidelity and judgment but on the whole the duty is performed and everything returns deducting some very trifling commission and discount to the place from whence it arose when the poor rise to destroy the rich they act as wisely for their own purposes as when they burn mills and throw corn into the river to make bread cheap  vi  when i say that we of the people ought to be informed inclusively i say we ought not to be flattered flattery is the reverse of instruction the poor in that case would be rendered as improvident as the rich which would not be at all good for them  vii  nothing can be so base and so wicked as the political canting language the labouring poor let compassion be shown in action the more the better according to every mans ability but let there be no lamentation of their condition it is no relief to their miserable circumstances it is only an insult to their miserable understandings it arises from a total want of charity or a total want of thought want of one kind was never relieved by want of any other kind patience labour sobriety frugality and religion should be recommended to them all the rest is downright fraud it is horrible to call them the once happy labourer  viii  whether what may be called the moral or philosophical happiness of the laborious classes is increased or not i cannot say the seat of that species of happiness is in the mind and there are few data to ascertain the comparative state of the mind at any two periods philosophical happiness is to want little civil or vulgar happiness is to want much and to enjoy much ix  if the happiness of the animal man which certainly goes somewhere towards the happiness of the rational man be the object of our estimate then i assert without the least hesitation that the condition of those who labour in all descriptions of labour and in all gradations of labour from the highest to the lowest inclusively is on the whole extremely meliorated if more and better food is any standard of melioration they work more it is certain but they have the advantage of their augmented labour yet whether that increase of labour be on the whole a good or an evil is a consideration that would lead us a great way and is not for my present purpose but as to the fact of the melioration of their diet i shall enter into the detail of proof whenever i am called upon in the mean time the known difficulty of contenting them with anything but bread made of the finest flour and meat of the first quality is proof sufficient  x  i further assert that even under all the hardships of the last year the labouring people did either out of their direct gains or from charity which it seems is now an insult to them in fact fare better than they did in seasons of common plenty fifty or sixty years ago or even at the period of my english observation which is about fortyfour years i even assert that full as many in that class as ever were known to do it before continued to save money and this i can prove so far as my own information and experience extend  xi  it is not true that the rate of wages has not increased with the nominal price of provisions i allow it has not fluctuated with that price nor ought it and the squires of norfolk had dined when they gave it as their opinion that it might or ought to rise and fall with the market of provisions the rate of wages in truth has no direct relation to that price labour is a commodity like every other and rises or falls according to the demand this is in the nature of things however the nature of things has provided for their necessities wages have been twice raised in my time and they bear a full proportion or even a greater than formerly to the medium of provision during the last bad cycle of twenty years they bear a full proportion to the result of their labour if we were wildly to attempt to force them beyond it the stone which we had forced up the hill would only fall back upon them in a diminished demand or what indeed is the far lesser evil an aggravated price of all the provisions which are the result of their manual toil  xii  there is an implied contract much stronger than any instrument or article of agreement between the labourer in any occupation and his employerthat the labour so far as that labour is concerned shall be sufficient to pay to the employer a profit on his capital and a compensation for his risk in a word that the labour shall produce an advantage equal to the payment whatever is above that is a direct tax and if the amount of that tax be left to the will and pleasure of another it is an arbitrary tax   disappointed ambition    the true cause of his drawing so shocking a picture is no more than this and it ought rather to claim our pity than excite our indignationhe finds himself out of power and this condition is intolerable to him the same sun which gilds all nature and exhilarates the whole creation does not shine upon disappointed ambition it is something that rays out of darkness and inspires nothing but gloom and melancholy men in this deplorable state of mind find a comfort in spreading the contagion of their spleen they find an advantage too for it is a general popular error to imagine the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare if such persons can answer the ends of relief and profit to themselves they are apt to be careless enough about either the means or the consequences   difficulty an instructor  their purpose everywhere seems to have been to evade and slip aside from difficulty this it has been the glory of the great masters in all the arts to confront and to overcome and when they had overcome the first difficulty to turn it into an instrument for new conquests over new difficulties thus to enable them to extend the empire of their science and even to push forward beyond the reach of their original thoughts the landmarks of the human understanding itself difficulty is a severe instructor set over us by the supreme ordinance of a parental guardian and legislator who knows us better than we know ourselves as he loves us better too pater ipse colendi haud facilem esse viam voluit he that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill our antagonist is our helper this amicable conflict with difficulty obliges us to an intimate acquaintance with our object and compels us to consider it in all its relations it will not suffer us to be superficial it is the want of nerves of understanding for such a task it is the degenerate fondness for tricking shortcuts and little fallacious facilities that has in so many parts of the world created governments with arbitrary powers they have created the late arbitrary monarchy of france they have created the arbitrary republic of paris with them defects in wisdom are to be supplied by the plenitude of force they get nothing by it commencing their labours on a principle of sloth they have the common fortune of slothful men the difficulties which they rather had eluded than escaped meet them again in their course they multiply and thicken on them they are involved through a labyrinth of confused detail in an industry without limit and without direction and in conclusion the whole of their work becomes feeble vicious and insecure  it is this inability to wrestle with difficulty which has obliged the arbitrary assembly of france to commence their schemes of reform with abolition and total destruction but is it in destroying and pulling down that skill is displayed your mob can do this as well at least as your assemblies the shallowest understanding the rudest hand is more than equal to that task rage and phrensy will pull down more in half an hour than prudence deliberation and foresight can build up in a hundred years the errors and defects of old establishments are visible and palpable it calls for little ability to point them out and where absolute power is given it requires but a word wholly to abolish the vice and the establishment together the same lazy but restless disposition which loves sloth and hates quiet directs these politicians when they come to work for supplying the place of what they have destroyed to make everything the reverse of what they have seen is quite as easy as to destroy no difficulties occur in what has never been tried criticism is almost baffled in discovering the defects of what has not existed and eager enthusiasm and cheating hope have all the wide field of imagination in which they may expatiate with little or no opposition   sovereign jurisdictions    with regard to the sovereign jurisdictions i must observe sir that whoever takes a view of this kingdom in a cursory manner will imagine that he beholds a solid compacted uniform system of monarchy in which all inferior jurisdictions are but as rays diverging from one centre but on examining it more nearly you find much eccentricity and confusion it is not a monarchy in strictness  but as in the saxon times this country was an heptarchy it is now a strange sort of pentarchy it is divided into five several distinct principalities besides the supreme there is indeed this difference from the saxon times that as in the itinerant exhibitions of the stage for want of a complete company they are obliged to throw a variety of parts on their chief performer so our sovereign condescends himself to act not only the principal but all the subordinate parts in the play  he condescends to dissipate the royal character and to trifle with those light subordinate lacquered sceptres in those hands that sustain the ball representing the world or which wield the trident that commands the ocean cross a brook and you lose the king of england but you have some comfort in coming again under his majesty though shorn of his beams and no more than prince of wales go to the north and you find him dwindled to a duke of lancaster turn to the west of that north and he pops upon you in the humble character of earl of chester travel a few miles on the earl of chester disappears and the king surprises you again as count palatine of lancaster if you travel beyond mount edgecombe you find him once more in his incognito and he is duke of cornwall so that quite fatigued and satiated with this dull variety you are infinitely refreshed when you return to the sphere of his proper splendour and behold your amiable sovereign in his true simple undisguised native character of majesty   prudery of false reform  every one must remember that the cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery both moral and political those who in a few months after soused over head and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments which had formerly prevailed this marvellous abhorrence which the court had suddenly taken to all influence was not only circulated in conversation through the kingdom but pompously announced to the public with many other extraordinary things in a pamphlet which had all the appearance of a manifesto preparatory to some considerable enterprise throughout it was a satire though in terms managed and decent enough on the politics of the former reign it was indeed written with no small art and address  in this piece appeared the first dawning of the new system there first appeared the idea then only in speculation of separating the court from the administration of carrying everything from national connection to personal regards and of forming a regular party for that purpose under the name of kings men  to recommend this system to the people a perspective view of the court gorgeously painted and finely illuminated from within was exhibited to the gaping multitude party was to be totally done away with all its evil works corruption was to be cast down from court as ate was from heaven power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public spirit and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence except those who had the misfortune to be in disgrace at court which was to stand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions a scheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the visionary republic of plato the whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate those good souls whose credulous morality is so invaluable a treasure to crafty politicians indeed there was wherewithal to charm everybody except those few who are not much pleased with professions of supernatural virtue who know of what stuff such professions are made for what purposes they are designed and in what they are sure constantly to end many innocent gentlemen who had been talking prose all their lives without knowing anything of the matter began at last to open their eyes upon their own merits and to attribute their not having been lords of the treasury and lords of trade many years before merely to the prevalence of party and to the ministerial power which had frustrated the good intentions of the court in favour of their abilities now was the time to unlock the sealed fountain of royal bounty which had been infamously monopolized and huckstered and to let it flow at large upon the whole people the time was come to restore royalty to its original splendour   exaggeration    if a few puny libellers acting under a knot of factious politicians without virtue parts or character such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen are sufficient to excite this disturbance very perverse must be the disposition of that people amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means it is besides no small aggravation of the public misfortune that the disease on this hypothesis appears to be without remedy if the wealth of the nation be the cause of its turbulence i imagine it is not proposed to introduce poverty as a constable to keep the peace if our dominions abroad are the roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of sedition it is not intended to cut them off in order to famish the fruit if our liberty has enfeebled the executive power there is no design i hope to call in the aid of despotism to fill up the deficiencies of law  whatever may be intended these things are not yet professed we seem therefore to be driven to absolute despair for we have no other materials to work upon but those out of which god has been pleased to form the inhabitants of this island if these be radically and essentially vicious all that can be said is that those men are very unhappy to whose fortune or duty it falls to administer the affairs of this untoward people i hear it indeed sometimes asserted that a steady perseverance in the present measures and a rigorous punishment of those who oppose them will in course of time infallibly put an end to these disorders but this in my opinion is said without much observation of our present disposition and without any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind if the matter of which this nation is composed be so very fermentable as these gentlemen describe it leaven never will be wanting to work it up as long as discontent revenge and ambition have existence in the world particular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in the state they inflame rather than allay those heats which arise from the settled mismanagement of the government or from a natural indisposition in the people it is of the utmost moment not to make mistakes in the use of strong measures and firmness is then only a virtue when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom in truth inconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance   tactics of cabal  it is a law of nature that whoever is necessary to what we have made our object is sure in some way or in some time or other to become our master all this however is submitted to in order to avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people for it seems to be laid down as a maxim that a king has some sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects that all who are pleasing to them are to be of course disagreeable to him that as soon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours none are considered as wellwishers to the crown but those who advised to some unpopular course of action none capable of serving it but those who are obliged to call at every instant upon all its power for the safety of their lives none are supposed to be fit priests in the temple of government but the persons who are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary such is the effect of this refined project such is ever the result of all the contrivances which are used to free men from the servitude of their reason and from the necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evident interests these contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous servitude in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attended with advantage   government relative not absolute    i never govern myselfno rational man ever did govern himselfby abstractions and universals i do not put abstract ideas wholly out of any question because i well know that under that name i should dismiss principles and that without the guide and light of sound wellunderstood principles all reasonings in politics as in everything else would be only a confused jumble of particular facts and details without the means of drawing out any sort of theoretical or practical conclusion a statesman differs from a professor in an university the latter has only the general view of society the formerthe statesmenhas a number of circumstances to combine with those general ideas and to take into his consideration  circumstances are infinite are infinitely combined are variable and transient he who does not take them into consideration is not erroneous but stark maddat operam ut cum ratione insaniathe is metaphysically mad a statesman never losing sight of principles is to be guided by circumstances and judging contrary to the exigencies of the moment he may ruin his country for ever  i go on this ground that government representing the society has a general superintending control over all the actions and over all the publicly propagated doctrines of men without which it never could provide adequately for all the wants of society but then it is to use this power with an equitable discretion the only bond of sovereign authority for it is not perhaps so much by the assumption of unlawful powers as by the unwise or unwarrantable use of those which are most legal that governments oppose their true end and object for there is such a thing as tyranny as well as usurpation you can hardly state to me a case to which legislature is the most confessedly competent in which if the rules of benignity and prudence are not observed the most mischievous and oppressive things may not be done so that after all it is a moral and virtuous discretion and not any abstract theory of right which keeps governments faithful to their ends crude unconnected truths are in the world of practice what falsehoods are in theory  a reasonable prudent provident and moderate coercion may be a means of preventing acts of extreme ferocity and rigour for by propagating excessive and extravagant doctrines such extravagant disorders take place as require the most perilous and fierce corrections to oppose them it is not morally true that we are bound to establish in every country that form of religion which in our minds is most agreeable to truth and conduces most to the eternal happiness of mankind in the same manner it is not true that we are against the conviction of our own judgment to establish a system of opinions and practises directly contrary to those ends only because some majority of the people told by the head may prefer it no conscientious man would willingly establish what he knew to be false and mischievous in religion or in anything else no wise man on the contrary would tyrannically set up his own sense so as to reprobate that of the great prevailing body of the community and pay no regard to the established opinions and prejudices of mankind or refuse to them the means of securing a religious instruction suitable to these prejudices a great deal depends on the state in which you find men   general views    the foundations on which obedience to governments is founded are not to be constantly discussed that we are here supposes the discussion already made and the dispute settled we must assume the rights of what represents the public to control the individual to make his will and his acts to submit to their will until some intolerable grievance shall make us know that it does not answer its end and will submit neither to reformation nor restraint otherwise we should dispute all the points of morality before we can punish a murderer robber and adulterer we should analyze all society dangers by being despised grow great so they do by absurd provision against them stulti est dixisse non putaram whether an early discovery of evil designs an early declaration and an early precaution against them be more wise than to stifle all inquiry about them for fear they should declare themselves more early than otherwise they would and therefore precipitate the evilall this depends on the reality of the danger is it only an unbookish jealousy as shakspeare calls it it is a question of fact  does a design against the constitution of this country exist if it does and if it is carried on with increasing vigour and activity by a restless faction and if it receives countenance by the most ardent and enthusiastic applauses of its object in the great council of this kingdom by men of the first parts which this kingdom produces perhaps by the first it has ever produced can i think that there is no danger  if there be danger must there be no precaution at all against it if you ask whether i think the danger urgent and immediate i answer thank god i do not the body of the people is yet sound the constitution is in their hearts while wicked men are endeavouring to put another into their heads but if i see the very same beginnings which have commonly ended in great calamities i ought to act as if they might produce the very same effects early and provident fear is the mother of safety because in that state of things the mind is firm and collected and the judgment unembarrassed but when the fear and the evil feared come on together and press at once upon us deliberation itself is ruinous which saves upon all other occasions because when perils are instant it delays decision the man is in a flutter and in a hurry and his judgment is gone as the judgment of the deposed king of france and his ministers was gone if the latter did not premeditately betray him he was just come from his usual amusement of hunting when the head of the column of treason and assassination was arrived at his house let not the king let not the prince of wales be surprised in this manner let not both houses of parliament be led in triumph along with him and have law dictated to them by the constitutional the revolution and the unitarian societies these insect reptiles whilst they go on only caballing and toasting only fill us with disgust if they get above their natural size and increase the quantity whilst they keep the quality of their venom they become objects of the greatest terror a spider in his natural size is only a spider ugly and loathsome and his flimsy net is only fit for catching flies but good god suppose a spider as large as an ox and that he spread cables about us all the wilds of africa would not produce anything so dreadful      quale portentum neque militaris     daunia in latis alit esculetis      nec jubae tellus generat leonum     arida nutrix  think of them who dare menace in the way they do in their present state what would they do if they had power commensurate to their malice god forbid i ever should have a despotic master but if i must my choice is made i will have louis xvi rather than monsieur bailly or brissot or chabot rather george iii or george iv than dr priestley or dr kippis persons who would not load a tyrannous power by the poisoned taunts of a vulgar lowbred insolence i hope we have still spirit enough to keep us from the one or the other the contumelies of tyranny are the worst parts of it   magnitude in building    to the sublime in building greatness of dimension seems requisite for on a few parts and those small the imagination cannot rise to any idea of infinity no greatness in the manner can effectually compensate for the want of proper dimensions  there is no danger of drawing men into extravagant designs by this rule it carries its own caution along with it because too great a length in buildings destroys the purpose of greatness which it was intended to promote the perspective will lessen it in height as it gains in length and will bring it at last to a point turning the whole figure into a sort of triangle the poorest in its effect of almost any figure that can be presented to the eye i have ever observed that colonnades and avenues of trees of a moderate length were without comparison far grander than when they were suffered to run to immense distances a true artist should put a generous deceit on the spectators and effect the noblest designs by easy methods designs that are vast only by their dimensions are always the sign of a common and low imagination no work of art can be great but as it deceives to be otherwise is the prerogative of nature only a good eye will fix the medium betwixt an excessive length or height for the same objection lies against both and a short or broken quantity and perhaps it might be ascertained to a tolerable degree of exactness if it was my purpose to descend far into the particulars of any art   society and solitude  the second branch of the social passions is that which administers to society in general with regard to this i observe that society merely as society without any particular heightenings gives us no positive pleasure in the enjoyment but absolute and entire solitude that is the total and perpetual exclusion from all society is as great a positive pain as can almost be conceived therefore in the balance between the pleasure of general society and the pain of absolute solitude pain is the predominant idea but the pleasure of any particular social enjoyment outweighs very considerably the uneasiness caused by the want of that particular enjoyment so that the strongest sensations relative to the habitudes of particular society are sensations of pleasure good company lively conversations and the endearments of friendship fill the mind with great pleasure a temporary solitude on the other hand is itself agreeable this may perhaps prove that we are creatures designed for contemplation as well as action since solitude as well as society has its pleasures as from the former observation we may discern that an entire life of solitude contradicts the purposes of our being since death itself is scarcely an idea of more terror   eastindia bill and company  i therefore freely admit to the eastindia their claim to exclude their fellowsubjects from the commerce of half the globe i admit their claim to administer an annual territorial revenue of seven millions sterling to command an army of sixty thousand men and to dispose under the control of a sovereign imperial discretion and with the due observance of the natural and local law of the lives and fortunes of thirty millions of their fellowcreatures all this they possess by charter and by acts of parliament in my opinion without a shadow of controversy  those who carry the rights and claims of the company the furthest do not contend for more than this and all this i freely grant but granting all this they must grant to me in my turn that all political power which is set over men and that all privilege claimed or exercised in exclusion of them being wholly artificial and for so much a derogation from the natural quality of mankind at large ought to be some way or other exercised ultimately for their benefit  if this is true with regard to every species of political dominion and every description of commercial privilege none of which can be original selfderived rights or grants for the mere private benefit of the holders then such rights or privileges or whatever else you choose to call them are all in the strictest sense a trust and it is of the very essence of every trust to be rendered accountable and even totally to cease when it substantially varies from the purposes for which alone it could have a lawful existence  this i conceive sir to be true of trusts of power vested in the highest hands and of such as seem to hold of no human creature but about the application of this principle to subordinate derivative trusts i do not see how a controversy can be maintained to whom then would i make the eastindia company accountable why to parliament to be sure to parliament from which their trust was derived to parliament which alone is capable of comprehending the magnitude of its object and its abuse and alone capable of an effectual legislative remedy the very charter which is held out to exclude parliament from correcting malversation with regard to the high trust vested in the company is the very thing which at once gives a title and imposes on us a duty to interfere with effect wherever power and authority originating from ourselves are perverted from their purposes and become instruments of wrong and violence if parliament sir had nothing to do with this charter we might have some sort of epicurean excuse to stand aloof indifferent spectators of what passes in the companys name in india and in london but if we are the very cause of the evil we are in a special manner engaged to the redress and for us passively to bear with oppressions committed under the sanction of our own authority is in truth and reason for this house to be an active accomplice in the abuse  that the power notoriously grossly abused has been bought from us is very certain but this circumstance which is urged against the bill becomes an additional motive for our interference lest we should be thought to have sold the blood of millions of men for the base consideration of money we sold i admit all that we had to sell that is our authority not our control we had not a right to make a market of our duties  i ground myself therefore on this principlethat if the abuse is proved the contract is broken and we reenter into all our rights that is into the exercise of all our duties our own authority is indeed as much a trust originally as the companys authority is a trust derivatively and it is the use we make of the resumed power that must justify or condemn us in the resumption of it when we have perfected the plan laid before us by the right honourable mover the world will then see what it is we destroy and what it is we create by that test we stand or fall and by that test i trust that it will be found in the issue that we are going to supersede a charter abused to the full extent of all the powers which it could abuse and exercised in the plenitude of despotism tyranny and corruption and that in one and the same plan we provide a real chartered security for the rights of men cruelly violated under that charter  this bill and those connected with it are intended to form the magna charta of hindostan whatever the treaty of westphalia is to the liberty of the princes and free cities of the empire and to the three religions there professed whatever the great charter the statute of tallege the petition of right and the declaration of right are to great britain these bills are to the people of india of this benefit i am certain their condition is capable and when i know that they are capable of more my vote shall most assuredly be for our giving to the full extent of their capacity of receiving and no charter of dominion shall stand as a bar in my way to their charter of safety and protection  the strong admission i have made of the companys rights i am conscious of it binds me to do a great deal i do not presume to condemn those who argue a priori against the propriety of leaving such extensive political powers in the hands of a company of merchants i know much is and much more may be said against such a system but with my particular ideas and sentiments i cannot go that way to work i feel an insuperable reluctance in giving my hand to destroy any established institution of government upon a theory however plausible it may be my experience in life teaches me nothing clear upon the subject i have known merchants with the sentiments and the abilities of great statesmen and i have seen persons in the rank of statesmen with the conceptions and characters of pedlars indeed my observation has furnished me with nothing that is to be found in any habits of life or education which tends wholly to disqualify men for the functions of government but that by which the power of exercising those functions is very frequently obtained i mean a spirit and habits of low cabal and intrigue which i have never in one instance seen united with a capacity for sound and manly policy to justify us in taking the administration of their affairs out of the hands of the eastindia company on my principles i must see several conditions 1st the object affected by the abuse should be great and important 2nd the abuse affecting this great object ought to be a great abuse 3rd it ought to be habitual and not accidental 4th it ought to be utterly incurable in the body as it now stands constituted all this ought to be made as visible to me as the light of the sun before i should strike off an atom of their charter   parliaments and elections  all are agreed that parliaments should not be perpetual the only question is what is the most convenient time for their duration on which there are three opinions we are agreed too that the term ought not to be chosen most likely in its operation to spread corruption and to augment the already overgrown influence of the crown on these principles i mean to debate the question it is easy to pretend a zeal for liberty those who think themselves not likely to be encumbered with the performance of their promises either from their known inability or total indifference about the performance never fail to entertain the most lofty ideas they are certainly the most specious and they cost them neither reflection to frame nor pains to modify nor management to support the task is of another nature to those who mean to promise nothing that it is not in their intention or may possibly be in their power to perform to those who are bound and principled no more to delude the understandings than to violate the liberty of their fellowsubjects faithful watchmen we ought to be over the rights and privileges of the people but our duty if we are qualified for it as we ought is to give them information and not to receive it from them we are not to go to school to them to learn the principles of law and government in doing so we should not dutifully serve but we should basely and scandalously betray the people who are not capable of this service by nature nor in any instance called to it by the constitution i reverentially look up to the opinion of the people and with an awe that is almost superstitious i should be ashamed to show my face before them if i changed my ground as they cried up or cried down men or things or opinions if i wavered and shifted about with every change and joined in it or opposed as best answered any low interest or passion if i held them up hopes which i knew i never intended or promised what i well knew i could not perform of all these things they are perfect sovereign judges without appeal but as to the detail of particular measures or to any general schemes of policy they have neither enough of speculation in the closet nor of experience in business to decide upon it they can well see whether we are tools of a court or their honest servants of that they can well judge and i wish that they always exercised their judgment but of the particular merits of a measure i have other standards that the frequency of elections proposed by this bill has a tendency to increase the power and consideration of the electors not lessen corruptibility i do most readily allow so far it is desirable this is what it has i will tell you now what it has not 1st it has no sort of tendency to increase their integrity and public spirit unless an increase of power has an operation upon voters in elections that it has in no other situation in the world and upon no other part of mankind 2nd this bill has no tendency to limit the quantity of influence in the crown to render its operation more difficult or to counteract that operation which it cannot prevent in any way whatsoever it has its full weight its full range and its uncontrolled operation on the electors exactly as it had before 3rd nor thirdly does it abate the interest or inclination of ministers to apply that influence to the electors on the contrary it renders it much more necessary to them if they seek to have a majority in parliament to increase the means of that influence and redouble their diligence and to sharpen dexterity in the application the whole effect of the bill is therefore the removing the application of some part of the influence from the elected to the electors and further to strengthen and extend a court interest already great and powerful in boroughs here to fix their magazines and places of arms and thus to make them the principal not the secondary theatre of their manoeuvres for securing a determined majority in parliament i believe nobody will deny that the electors are corruptible they are men it is saying nothing worse of them many of them are but ill informed in their minds many feeble in their circumstances easily overreached easily seduced if they are many the wages of corruption are the lower and would to god it were not rather a contemptible and hypocritical adulation than a charitable sentiment to say that there is already no debauchery no corruption no bribery no perjury no blind fury and interested faction among the electors in many parts of this kingdom nor is it surprising or at all blamable in that class of private men when they see their neighbours aggrandised and themselves poor and virtuous without that eclat or dignity which attends men in higher situations  but admit it were true that the great mass of the electors were too vast an object for court influence to grasp or extend to and that in despair they must abandon it he must be very ignorant of the state of every popular interest who does not know that in all the corporations all the open boroughs indeed in every district of the kingdom there is some leading man some agitator some wealthy merchant or considerable manufacturer some active attorney some popular preacher some moneylender etc etc who is followed by the whole flock this is the style of all free countries      multum in fabia valet hic valet ille velina      cuilibet hic fasces dabit eripietque curule  these spirits each of which informs and governs his own little orb are neither so many nor so little powerful nor so incorruptible but that a minister may as he does frequently find means of gaining them and through them all their followers to establish therefore a very general influence among electors will no more be found an impracticable project than to gain an undue influence over members of parliament therefore i am apprehensive that this bill though it shifts the place of the disorder does by no means relieve the constitution i went through almost every contested election in the beginning of this parliament and acted as a manager in very many of them by which though as at a school of pretty severe and rugged discipline i came to have some degree of instruction concerning the means by which parliamentary interests are in general procured and supported  theory i know would suppose that every general election is to the representative a day of judgment in which he appears before his constituents to account for the use of the talent with which they intrusted him and for the improvement he has made of it for the public advantage it would be so if every corruptible representative were to find an enlightened and incorruptible constituent but the practice and knowledge of the world will not suffer us to be ignorant that the constitution on paper is one thing and in fact and experience is another we must know that the candidate instead of trusting at his election to the testimony of his behaviour in parliament must bring the testimony of a large sum of money the capacity of liberal expense in entertainments the power of serving and obliging the rulers of corporations of winning over the popular leaders of political clubs associations and neighbourhoods it is ten thousand times more necessary to show himself a man of power than a man of integrity in almost all the elections with which i have been acquainted elections therefore become a matter of heavy expense and if contests are frequent to many they will become a matter of an expense totally ruinous which no fortunes can bear but least of all the landed fortunes encumbered as they often indeed as they mostly are with debts with portions with jointures and tied up in the hands of the possessor by the limitations of settlement it is a material it is in my opinion a lasting consideration in all the questions concerning election let no one think the charges of elections a trivial matter the charge therefore of elections ought never to be lost sight of in a question concerning their frequency because the grand object you seek is independence independence of mind will ever be more or less influenced by independence of fortune and if every three years the exhausting sluices of entertainments drinkings open houses to say nothing of bribery are to be periodically drawn up and renewedif governmentfavours for which now in some shape or other the whole race of men are candidates are to be called for upon every occasion i see that private fortunes will be washed away and every even to the least trace of independence borne down by the torrent i do not seriously think this constitution even to the wrecks of it could survive five triennial elections if you are to fight the battle you must put on the armour of the ministry you must call in the public to the aid of private money the expense of the last election has been computed and i am persuaded that it has not been overrated at 1500000 poundsthree shillings in the pound more in the land tax about the close of the last parliament and the beginning of this several agents for boroughs went about and i remember well that it was in every one of their mouthssir your election will cost you three thousand pounds if you are independent but if the ministry supports you it may be done for two and perhaps for less and indeed the thing spoke itself where a living was to be got for one a commission in the army for another a lift in the navy for a third and customhouse offices scattered about without measure or number who doubts but money may be saved the treasury may even add money but indeed it is superfluous a gentleman of two thousand a year who meets another of the same fortune fights with equal arms but if to one of the candidates you add a thousand ayear in places for himself and a power of giving away as much among others one must or there is no truth in arithmetical demonstration ruin his adversary if he is to meet him and to fight with him every third year it will be said i do not allow for the operation of character but i do and i know it will have its weight in most elections perhaps it may be decisive in some but there are few in which it will be prevent great expenses  the destruction of independent fortunes will be the consequence on the part of the candidate what will be the consequence of triennial corruption triennial drunkenness triennial idleness triennial lawsuits litigations prosecutions triennial phrensy of society dissolved industry interrupted ruined of those personal hatreds that will never be suffered to soften those animosities and feuds which will be rendered immortal those quarrels which are never to be appeased morals vitiated and gangrened to the vitals i think no stable and useful advantages were ever made by the money got at elections by the voter but all he gets is doubly lost to the public it is money given to diminish the general stock of the community which is in the industry of the subject i am sure that it is a good while before he or his family settle again to their business their heads will never cool the temptations of elections will be for ever glittering before their eyes they will all grow politicians every one quitting his business will choose to enrich himself by his vote they will all take the gaugingrod new places will be made for them they will run to the customhouse quay their looms and ploughs will be deserted  so was rome destroyed by the disorders of continual elections though those of rome were sober disorders they had nothing but faction bribery bread and stage plays to debauch them we have the inflammation of liquor superadded a fury hotter than any of them there the contest was only between citizen and citizen here you have the contest of ambitious citizens on one side supported by the crown to oppose to the efforts let it be so of private and unsupported ambition on the other yet rome was destroyed by the frequency and charge of elections and the monstrous expense of an unremitted courtship to the people i think therefore the independent candidate and elector may each be destroyed by it the whole body of the community be an infinite sufferer and a vitious ministry the only gainer   religion and magistracy    in a christian commonwealth the church and the state are one and the same thing being different integral parts of the same whole for the church has been always divided into two parts the clergy and the laity of which the laity is as much an essential integral part and has as much its duties and privileges as the clerical member and in the rule order and government of the church has its share religion is so far in my opinion from being out of the province of the duty of a christian magistrate that it is and it ought to be not only his care but the principal thing in his care because it is one of the great bonds of human society and its object the supreme good the ultimate end and object of man himself the magistrate who is a man and charged with the concerns of men and to whom very specially nothing human is remote and indifferent has a right and a duty to watch over it with an unceasing vigilance to protect to promote to forward it by every rational just and prudent means it is principally his duty to prevent the abuses which grow out of every strong and efficient principle that actuates the human mind as religion is one of the bonds of society he ought not to suffer it to be made the pretext of destroying its peace order liberty and its security above all he ought strictly to look to it when men begin to form new combinations to be distinguished by new names and especially when they mingle a political system with their religious opinions true or false plausible or implausible  it is the interest and it is the duty and because it is the interest and the duty it is the right of government to attend much to opinions because as opinions soon combine with passions even when they do not produce them they have much influence on actions factions are formed upon opinions which factions become in effect bodies corporate in the statenay factions generate opinions in order to become a centre of union and to furnish watchwords to parties and this may make it expedient for government to forbid things in themselves innocent and neutral i am not fond of defining with precision what the ultimate rights of the sovereign supreme power in providing for the safety of the commonwealth may be or may not extend to it will signify very little what my notions or what their own notions on the subject may be because according to the exigence they will take in fact the steps which seem to them necessary for the preservation of the whole for as selfpreservation in individuals is the first law of nature the same will prevail in societies who will right or wrong make that an object paramount to all other rights whatsoever   persecution false in theory  the bottom of this theory of persecution is false it is not permitted to us to sacrifice the temporal good of any body of men to our own ideas of the truth and falsehood of any religious opinions by making men miserable in this life they counteract one of the great ends of charity which is inasmuch as in us lies to make men happy in every period of their existence and most in what most depends upon us but give to these old persecutors their mistaken principle in their reasoning they are consistent and in their tempers they may be even kind and goodnatured but whenever a faction would render millions of mankind miserable some millions of the race coexistent with themselves and many millions in their succession without knowing or so much as pretending to ascertain the doctrines of their own school in which there is much of the lash and nothing of the lesson the errors which the persons in such a faction fall into are not those that are natural to human imbecility nor is the least mixture of mistaken kindness to mankind an ingredient in the severities they inflict the whole is nothing but pure and perfect malice it is indeed a perfection in that kind belonging to beings of a higher order than man and to them we ought to leave it this kind of persecutors without zeal without charity know well enough that religion to pass by all questions of the truth or falsehood of any of its particular systems a matter i abandon to the theologians on all sides is a source of great comfort to us mortals in this our short but tedious journey through the world they know that to enjoy this consolation men must believe their religion upon some principle or other whether of education habit theory or authority when men are driven from any of those principles on which they have received religion without embracing with the same assurance and cordiality some other system a dreadful void is left in their minds and a terrible shock is given to their morals they lose their guide their comfort their hope none but the most cruel and hardhearted of men who had banished all natural tenderness from their minds such as those beings of iron the atheists could bring themselves to any persecution like this strange it is but so it is that men driven by force from their habits in one mode of religion have by contrary habits under the same force often quietly settled in another they suborn their reason to declare in favour of their necessity man and his conscience cannot always be at war if the first races have not been able to make a pacification between the conscience and the convenience their descendants come generally to submit to the violence of the laws without violence to their minds   irish legislation  the legislature of ireland like all legislatures ought to frame its laws to suit the people and the circumstances of the country and not any longer to make it their whole business to force the nature the temper and the inveterate habits of a nation to a conformity to speculative systems concerning any kind of laws ireland has an established government and a religion legally established which are to be preserved it has a people who are to be preserved too and to be led by reason principle sentiment and interest to acquiesce in that government ireland is a country under peculiar circumstances the people of ireland are a very mixed people and the quantities of the several ingredients in the mixture are very much disproportioned to each other are we to govern this mixed body as if it were composed of the most simple elements comprehending the whole in one system of benevolent legislation or are we not rather to provide for the several parts according to the various and diversified necessities of the heterogeneous nature of the mass would not common reason and common honesty dictate to us the policy of regulating the people in the several descriptions of which they are composed according to the natural ranks and classes of an orderly civil society under a common protecting sovereign and under a form of constitution favourable at once to authority and to freedom such as the british constitution boasts to be and such as it is to those who enjoy it   henry of navarre    i have observed the affectation which for many years past has prevailed in paris even to a degree perfectly childish of idolizing the memory of your henry the fourth if anything could put any one out of humour with that ornament to the kingly character it would be this overdone style of insidious panegyric the persons who have worked this engine the most busily are those who have ended their panegyrics in dethroning his successor and descendant a man as good natured at the least as henry the fourth altogether as fond of his people and who has done infinitely more to correct the ancient vices of the state than that great monarch did or we are sure he ever meant to do well it is for his panegyrists that they have not him to deal with  for henry of navarre was a resolute active and politic prince he possessed indeed great humanity and mildness but a humanity and mildness that never stood in the way of his interests he never sought to be loved without putting himself first in a condition to be feared  he used soft language with determined conduct he asserted and maintained his authority in the gross and distributed his acts of concession only in the detail he spent the income of his prerogative nobly but he took care not to break in upon the capital never abandoning for a moment any of the claims which he made under the fundamental laws nor sparing to shed the blood of those who opposed him often in the field sometimes upon the scaffold because he knew how to make his virtues respected by the ungrateful he has merited the praises of those whom if they had lived in his time he would have shut up in the bastile and brought to punishment along with the regicides whom he hanged after he had famished paris into a surrender   test acts  in a discussion which took place in the year 1790 mr burke declared his intention in case the motion for repealing the test acts had been agreed to of proposing to substitute the following test in the room of what was intended to be repealed i ab do in the presence of god sincerely profess and believe that a religious establishment in this state is not contrary to the law of god or disagreeable to the law of nature or to the true principles of the christian religion or that it is noxious to the community and i do sincerely promise and engage before god that i never will by any conspiracy contrivance or political device whatever attempt or abet others in any attempt to subvert the constitution of the church of england as the same is now by law established and that i will not employ any power or influence which i may derive from any office corporate or any other office which i hold or shall hold under his majesty his heirs and successors to destroy and subvert the same or to cause members to be elected into any corporation or into parliament give my vote in the election of any member or members of parliament or into any office for or on account of their attachment to any other or different religious opinions or establishments or with any hope that they may promote the same to the prejudice of the established church but will dutifully and peaceably content myself with my private liberty of conscience as the same is allowed by law  so help me god   what faction ought to teach  if however you could find out these pedigrees of guilt i do not think the difference would be essential history records many things which ought to make us hate evil actions but neither history nor morals nor policy can teach us to punish innocent men on that account what lesson does the iniquity of prevalent factions read to us it ought to lesson us into an abhorrence of the abuse of our own power in our own day when we hate its excesses so much in other persons and in other times to that school true statesmen ought to be satisfied to leave mankind they ought not to call from the dead all the discussions and litigations which formerly inflamed the furious factions which had torn their country to pieces they ought not to rake into the hideous and abominable things which were done in the turbulent fury of an injured robbed and persecuted people and which were afterwards cruelly revenged in the execution and as outrageously and shamefully exaggerated in the representation in order a hundred and fifty years after to find some colour for justifying them in the eternal proscription and civil excommunication of a whole people   grievances by law    this business appears in two points of view 1  whether it is a matter of grievance 2 whether it is within our province to redress it with propriety and prudence whether it comes properly before us on a petition upon matter of grievance i would not inquire too curiously i know technically speaking that nothing agreeable to law can be considered as a grievance but an overattention to the rules of any act does sometimes defeat the ends of it and i think it does so in this parliamentary act as much at least as in any other i know many gentlemen think that the very essence of liberty consists in being governed according to law as if grievances had nothing real and intrinsic but i cannot be of that opinion grievances may subsist by law nay i do not know whether any grievance can be considered as intolerable until it is established and sanctified by law  if the act of toleration were not perfect if there were a complaint of it i would gladly consent to amend it but when i heard a complaint of a pressure on religious liberty to my astonishment i find that there was no complaint whatsoever of the insufficiency of the act of king william nor any attempt to make it more sufficient the matter therefore does not concern toleration but establishment and it is not the rights of private conscience that are in question but the propriety of the terms which are proposed by law as a title to public emoluments so that the complaint is not that there is not toleration of diversity in opinion but that diversity in opinion is not rewarded by bishoprics rectories and collegiate stalls when gentlemen complain of the subscription as matter of grievance the complaint arises from confounding private judgment whose rights are anterior to law and the qualifications which the law creates for its own magistracies whether civil or religious to take away from men their lives their liberty or their property those things for the protection of which society was introduced is great hardship and intolerable tyranny but to annex any condition you please to benefits artificially created is the most just natural and proper thing in the world when e novo you form an arbitrary benefit an advantage preeminence or emolument not by nature but institution you order and modify it with all the power of a creator over his creature such benefits of institution are royalty nobility priesthood all of which you may limit to birth you might prescribe even shape and stature the jewish priesthood was hereditary  founders kinsmen have a preference in the election of fellows in many colleges of our universities the qualifications at all souls are that they should beoptime nati bene vestiti mediocriter docti  by contending for liberty in the candidate for orders you take away the liberty of the elector which is the people that is the state if they can choose they may assign a reason for their choice if they can assign a reason they may do it in writing and prescribe it as a condition they may transfer their authority to their representatives and enable them to exercise the same in all human institutions a great part almost all regulations are made from the mere necessity of the case let the theoretical merits of the question be what they will for nothing happened at the reformation but what will happen in all such revolutions when tyranny is extreme and abuses of government intolerable men resort to the rights of nature to shake it off when they have done so the very same principle of necessity of human affairs to establish some other authority which shall preserve the order of this new institution must be obeyed until they grow intolerable and you shall not be suffered to plead original liberty against such an institution see holland switzerland  if you will have religion publicly practised and publicly taught you must have a power to say what that religion will be which you will protect and encourage and to distinguish it by such marks and characteristics as you in your wisdom shall think fit as i said before your determination may be unwise in this as in other matters but it cannot be unjust hard or oppressive or contrary to the liberty of any man or in the least degree exceeding your province  it is therefore as a grievance fairly none at all nothing but what is essential not only to the order but to the liberty of the whole community   revolutionary politics    in france you are now in the crisis of a revolution and in the transit from one form of government to anotheryou cannot see that character of men exactly in the same situation in which we see it in this country with us it is militant with you it is triumphant and you know how it can act when its power is commensurate to its will i would not be supposed to confine those observations to any description of men or to comprehend all men of any description within themno far from it i am as incapable of that injustice as i am of keeping terms with those who profess principles of extremes and who under the name of religion teach little else than wild and dangerous politics the worst of these politics of revolution is this they temper and harden the breast in order to prepare it for the desperate strokes which are sometimes used in extreme occasions but as these occasions may never arrive the mind receives a gratuitous taint and the moral sentiments suffer not a little when no political purpose is served by the depravation this sort of people are so taken up with their theories about the rights of man that they have totally forgotten his nature without opening one new avenue to the understanding they have succeeded in stopping up those that lead to the heart they have perverted in themselves and in those that attend to them all the wellplaced sympathies of the human breast  this famous sermon of the old jewry breathes nothing but this spirit through all the political part plots massacres assassinations seem to some people a trivial price for obtaining a revolution a cheap bloodless reformation a guiltless liberty appear flat and vapid to their taste there must be a great change of scene there must be a magnificent stage effect there must be a grand spectacle to rouse the imagination grown torpid with the lazy enjoyment of sixty years security and the still unanimating repose of public prosperity the preacher found them all in the french revolution this inspires a juvenile warmth through his whole frame his enthusiasm kindles as he advances and when he arrives at his peroration it is in a full blaze then viewing from the pisgah of his pulpit the free moral happy flourishing and glorious state of france as in a birdeye landscape of a promised land he breaks out into rapture   toleration become intolerant  when any dissenters or any body of people come here with a petition it is not the number of people but the reasonableness of the request that should weigh with the house a body of dissenters come to this house and say tolerate uswe desire neither the parochial advantage of tithes nor dignities nor the stalls of your cathedrals no let the venerable orders of the hierarchy exist with all their advantages and shall i tell them i reject your just and reasonable petition not because it shakes the church but because there are others while you lie grovelling upon the earth that will kick and bite you judge which of these descriptions of men comes with a fair requestthat which says sir i desire liberty for my own because i trespass on no mans conscienceor the other which says i desire that these men should not be suffered to act according to their consciences though i am tolerated to act according to mine but i sign a body of articles which is my title to toleration i sign no more because more are against my conscience but i desire that you will not tolerate these men because they will not go so far as i though i desire to be tolerated who will not go as far as you no imprison them if they come within five miles of a corporate town because they do not believe what i do in point of doctrines shall i not say to these men arrangezvous canaille you who are not the predominant power will not give to others the relaxation under which you are yourself suffered to live i have as high an opinion of the doctrines of the church as you i receive them implicitly or i put my own explanation on them or take that which seems to me to come best recommended by authority there are those of the dissenters who think more rigidly of the doctrine of the articles relative to predestination than others do they sign the article relative to it ex animo and literally others allow a latitude of construction these two parties are in the church as well as among the dissenters yet in the church we live quietly under the same roof i do not see why as long as providence gives us no further light into this great mystery we should not leave things as the divine wisdom has left them but suppose all these things to me to be clear which providence however seems to have left obscure yet whilst dissenters claim a toleration in things which seeming clear to me are obscure to them without entering into the merit of the articles with what face can these men say tolerate us but do not tolerate them toleration is good for all or it is good for none  the discussion this day is not between establishment on one hand and toleration on the other but between those who being tolerated themselves refuse toleration to others that power should be puffed up with pride that authority should degenerate into rigour if not laudable is but too natural but this proceeding of theirs is much beyond the usual allowance to human weakness it not only is shocking to our reason but it provokes our indignation quid domini facient audent cum talia fures it is not the proud prelate thundering in his commission court but a pack of manumitted slaves with the lash of the beadle flagrant on their backs and their legs still galled with their fetters that would drive their brethren into that prisonhouse from whence they have just been permitted to escape if instead of puzzling themselves in the depths of the divine counsels they would turn to the mild morality of the gospel they would read their own condemnationo thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee   wilkes and right of election  in the last session the corps called the kings friends made a hardy attempt all at once to alter the right of election itself to put it into the power of the house of commons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting in parliament without any other rule than their own pleasure to make incapacities either general for descriptions of men or particular for individuals and to take into their body persons who avowedly never been chosen by the majority of legal electors nor agreeably to any known rule of law  the arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated are not my business here never has a subject been more amply and more learnedly handled nor upon one side in my opinion more satisfactorily they who are not convinced by what is already written would not receive conviction though one arose from the dead  i too have thought on this subject but my purpose here is only to consider it as a part of the favourite project of government to observe on the motives which led to it and to trace its political consequences  a violent rage for the punishment of mr wilkes was the pretence of the whole this gentleman by setting himself strongly in opposition to the court cabal had become at once an object of their persecution and of the popular favour the hatred of the court party pursuing and the countenance of the people protecting him it very soon became not at all a question on the man but a trial of strength between the two parties the advantage of the victory in this particular contest was the present but not the only nor by any means the principal object its operation upon the character of the house of commons was the great point in view the point to be gained by the cabal was this that a precedent should be established tending to show that the favour of the people was not so sure a road as the favour of the court even to popular honours and popular trusts a strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawless power a spirit of independence carried to some degree of enthusiasm an inquisitive character to discover and a bold one to display every corruption and every error of government these are the qualities which recommend a man to a seat in the house of commons in open and merely popular elections an indolent and submissive disposition a disposition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power and to live in a mutual intercourse of favours with them an inclination rather to countenance a strong use of authority than to bear any sort of licentiousness on the part of the people these are unfavourable qualities in an open election for members of parliament the instinct which carries the people towards the choice of the former is justified by reason because a man of such a character even in its exorbitances does not directly contradict the purposes of a trust the end of which is a control on power the latter character even when it is not in its extreme will execute this trust but very imperfectly and if deviating to the least excess will certainly frustrate instead of forwarding the purposes of a control on government but when the house of commons was to be new modelled is principle was not only to be changed but reversed whilst any errors committed in support of power were left to the law with every advantage of favourable construction of mitigation and finally of pardon all excesses on the side of liberty or in pursuit of popular favour or in defence of popular rights and privileges were not only to be punished by the rigour of the known law but by a discretionary proceeding which brought on the loss of the popular object itself popularity was to be rendered if not directly penal at least highly dangerous the favour of the people might lead even to a disqualification of representing them their odium might become strained through the medium of two or three constructions the means of sitting as the trustee of all that was dear to them this is punishing the offence in the offending part until this time the opinion of the people through the power of an assembly still in some sort popular led to the greatest honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown now the principle is reversed and the favour of the court is the only sure way of obtaining and holding those honours which ought to be in the disposal of the people  it signifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away example the only argument of effect in civil life demonstrates the truth of my proposition nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious tendency of this example until i see some man for his indiscretion in the support of power for his violent and intemperate servility rendered incapable of sitting in parliament for as it now stands the fault of overstraining popular qualities and irregularly if you please asserting popular privileges has led to disqualification the opposite fault never has produced the slightest punishment resistance to power has shut the door of the house of commons to one man obsequiousness and servility to none  not that i would encourage popular disorder or any disorder but i would leave such offences to the law to be punished in measure and proportion the laws of this country are for the most part constituted and wisely so for the general ends of government rather than for the preservation of our particular liberties whatever therefore is done in support of liberty by persons not in public trust or not acting merely in that trust is liable to be more or less out of the ordinary course of the law and the law itself is sufficient to animadvert upon it with great severity nothing indeed can hinder that severe letter from crushing us except the temperaments it may receive from a trial by jury but if the habit prevail of going beyond the law and superseding this judicature of carrying offences real or supposed into the legislative bodies who shall establish themselves into courts of criminal equity so the star chamber has been called by lord bacon all the evils of the star chamber are revived a large and liberal construction in ascertaining offences and a discretionary power in punishing them is the idea of criminal equity which is in truth a monster in jurisprudence it signifies nothing whether a court for this purpose be a committee of council or a house of commons or a house of lords the liberty of the subject will be equally subverted by it the true end and purpose of that house of parliament which entertains such a jurisdiction will be destroyed by it i will not believe what no other man living believes that mr wilkes was punished for the indecency of his publications or the impiety of his ransacked closet if he had fallen in a common slaughter of libellers and blasphemers i could well believe that nothing more was meant than was pretended but when i see that for years together full as impious and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion and virtue and order have not been punished nor their authors discountenanced that the most audacious libels on royal majesty have passed without notice that the most treasonable invectives against the laws liberties and constitution of the country have not met with the slightest animadversion i must consider this as a shocking and shameless pretence never did an envenomed scurrility against everything sacred and civil public and private rage through the kingdom with such a furious and unbridled licence all this while the peace of the nation must be shaken to ruin one libeller and to tear from the populace a single favourite  nor is it that vice merely skulks in an obscure and contemptible impunity does not the public behold with indignation persons not only generally scandalous in their lives but the identical persons who by their society their instruction their example their encouragement have drawn this man into the very faults which have furnished the cabal with a pretence for his persecution loaded with every kind of favour honour and distinction which a court can bestow add but the crime of servility the foedum crimen servitutis to every other crime and the whole mass is immediately transmuted into virtue and becomes the just subject of reward and honour when therefore i reflect upon this method pursued by the cabal in distributing rewards and punishments i must conclude that mr wilkes is the object of persecution not on account of what he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward but for that in which he differs from many of them that he is pursued for the spirited dispositions which are blended with his vices for his unconquerable firmness for his resolute indefatigable strenuous resistance against oppression  in this case therefore it was not the man that was to be punished nor his faults that were to be discountenanced opposition to acts of power was to be marked by a kind of civil proscription the popularity which should arise from such an opposition was to be shown unable to protect it the qualities by which court is made to the people were to render every fault inexpiable and every error irretrievable the qualities by which court is made to power were to cover and to sanctify everything he that will have a sure and honourable seat in the house of commons must take care how he adventures to cultivate popular qualities otherwise he may remember the old maxim breves et infaustos populi romani amores if therefore a pursuit of popularity expose a man to greater dangers than a disposition to servility the principle which is the life and soul of popular elections will perish out of the constitution   rockingham and conway  it is now given out for the usual purposes by the usual emissaries that lord rockingham did not consent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by lord chatham and the reporters have gone so far as publicly to assert in a hundred companies that the honourable gentleman under the gallery who proposed the repeal in the american committee had another set of resolutions in his pocket directly the reverse of those he moved these artifices of a desperate cause are at this time spread abroad with incredible care in every part of the town from the highest to the lowest companies as if the industry of the circulation were to make amends for the absurdity of the report sir whether the noble lord is of a complexion to be bullied by lord chatham or by any man i must submit to those who know him i confess when i look back to that time i consider him as placed in one of the most trying situations in which perhaps any man ever stood in the house of peers there were very few of the ministry out of the noble lords own particular connection except lord egmont who acted as far as i could discern an honourable and manly part that did not look to some other future arrangement which warped his politics there were in both houses new and menacing appearances that might very naturally drive any other than a most resolute minister from his measure or from his station the household troops openly revolted the allies of ministry those i mean who supported some of their measures but refused responsibility for any endeavoured to undermine their credit and to take ground that must be fatal to the success of the very cause which they would be thought to countenance the question of the repeal was brought on by ministry in the committee of this house in the very instant when it was known that more than one court negotiation was carrying on with the heads of the opposition everything upon every side was full of traps and mines earth below shook heaven above menaced all the elements of ministerial safety were dissolved it was in the midst of this chaos of plots and counterplots it was in the midst of this complicated warfare against public opposition and private treachery that the firmness of that noble person was put to the proof he never stirred from his ground no not an inch he remained fixed and determined in principle in measure and in conduct he practised no managements he secured no retreat he sought no apology  i will likewise do justice i ought to do it to the honourable gentlemen who led us in this house far from the duplicity wickedly charged on him he acted his part with alacrity and resolution we all felt inspired by the example he gave us down even to myself the weakest in that phalanx i declare for one i knew well enough it could not be concealed from anybody the true state of things but in my life i never came with so much spirits into this house it was a time for a man to act in we had powerful enemies but we had faithful and determined friends and a glorious cause we had a great battle to fight but we had the means of fighting not as now when our arms are tied behind us we did fight that day and conquer  i remember sir with a melancholy pleasure the situation of the honourable gentleman general conway who made the motion for the repeal in that crisis when the whole trading interest of this empire crammed into your lobbies with a trembling and anxious expectation waited almost to a winters return of light their fate from your resolutions when at length you had determined in their favour and your doors thrown open showed them the figure of their deliverer in the wellearned triumph of his important victory from the whole of that grave multitude there arose an involuntary burst of gratitude and transport they jumped upon him like children on a longabsent father they clung about him as captives about their redeemer all england all america joined to his applause nor did he seem insensible to the best of all earthly rewards the love and admiration of his fellowcitizens hope elevated and joy brightened his crest i stood near him and his face to use the expression of the scripture of the first martyr his face was as if it had been the face of an angel i do not know how others feel but if i had stood in that situation i never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profusion could bestow i did hope that that days danger and honour would have been a bond to hold us all together for ever but alas that with other pleasing visions is long since vanished  sir this act of supreme magnanimity has been represented as if it had been a measure of an administration that having no scheme of their own took a middle line pilfered a bit from one side and a bit from the other sir they took no middle lines they differed fundamentally from the schemes of both parties but they preserved the objects of both they preserved the authority of great britain they made the declaratory act they repealed the stamp act they did both fully because the declaratory act was without qualification and the repeal of the stamp act total this they did in the situation i have described   politics in the pulpit  it is plain that the mind of this political preacher was at the time big with some extraordinary design and it is very probable that the thoughts of his audience who understood him better than i do did all along run before him in his reflection and in the whole train of consequences to which it led before i read that sermon i really thought i had lived in a free country and it was an error i cherished because it gave me a greater liking to the country i lived in i was indeed aware that a jealous everwaking vigilance to guard the treasure of our liberty not only from invasion but from decay and corruption was our best wisdom and our first duty however i considered that treasure rather as a possession to be secured than as a prize to be contended for i did not discern how the present time came to be so very favourable to all exertions in the cause of freedom the present time differs from any other only by the circumstance of what is doing in france if the example of that nation is to have an influence on this i can easily conceive why some of their proceedings which have an unpleasant aspect and are not quite reconcilable to humanity generosity good faith and justice are palliated with so much milky goodnature towards the actors and born with so much heroic fortitude towards the sufferers it is certainly not prudent to discredit the authority of an example we mean to follow but allowing this we are led to a very natural questionwhat is that cause of liberty and what are those exertions in its favour to which the example of france is so singularly auspicious is our monarchy to be annihilated with all the laws all the tribunals and all the ancient corporations of the kingdom is every landmark of the country to be done away in favour of a geometrical and arithmetical constitution is the house of lords to be voted useless is episcopacy to be abolished are the church lands to be sold to jews and jobbers or given to bribe newinvented municipal republics into a participation in sacrilege are all the taxes to be voted grievances and the revenue reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic presents are silver shoebuckles to be substituted in the place of the landtax and the malttax for the support of the naval strength of this kingdom are all orders ranks and distinctions to be confounded that out of universal anarchy joined to national bankruptcy three or four thousand democracies should be formed into eightythree and that they may all by some sort of unknown attractive power be organized into one for this great end is the army to be seduced from its discipline and its fidelity first by every kind of debauchery and then by the terrible precedent of a donative in the increase of pay are the curates to be secluded from their bishops by holding out to them the delusive hope of a dole out of the spoils of their own order are the citizens of london to be drawn from their allegiance by feeding them at the expense of their fellowsubjects is a compulsory paper currency to be substituted in the place of the legal coin of this kingdom is what remains of the plundered stock of public revenue to be employed in the wild project of maintaining two armies to watch over and to fight with each other if these are the ends and means of the revolution society i admit they are well assorted and france may furnish them for both with precedents in point i see that your example is held out to shame us i know that we are supposed a dull sluggish race rendered passive by finding our situation tolerable and prevented by a mediocrity of freedom from ever attaining to its full perfection your leaders in france began by affecting to admire almost to adore the british constitution but as they advanced they came to look upon it with a sovereign contempt the friends of your national assembly amongst us have full as mean an opinion of what was formerly thought the glory of their country the revolution society has discovered that the english nation is not free they are convinced that the inequality in our representation is adefect in our constitution so gross and palpable as to make it excellent chiefly in form and theory discourse on the love of our country 3rd edition page 39 that a representation in the legislature of a kingdom is not only the basis of all constitutional liberty in it but of all legitimate government that without it a government is nothing but a usurpationthat when the representation is partial the kingdom possesses liberty only partially and if extremely partial it gives only a semblance and if not only extremely partial but corruptly chosen it becomes a nuisance dr price considers this inadequacy of representation as our fundamental grievance and though as to the corruption of this semblance of representation he hopes it is not yet arrived to its full perfection of depravity he fears that nothing will be done towards gaining for us this essential blessing until some great abuse of power again provokes our resentment or some great calamity again alarms our fears or perhaps till the acquisition of a pure and equal representation by other countries whilst we are mocked with the shadow kindles our shame to this he subjoins a note in these words a representation chosen chiefly by the treasury and a few thousands of the dregs of the people who are generally paid for their votes  you will smile here at the consistency of those democratists who when they are not on their guard treat the humbler part of the community with the greatest contempt whilst at the same time they pretend to make them the depositories of all power it would require a long discourse to point out to you the many fallacies that lurk in the generality and equivocal nature of the terms inadequate representation i shall only say here in justice to that oldfashioned constitution under which we have long prospered that our representation has been found perfectly adequate to all the purposes for which a representation of the people can be desired or devised i defy the enemies of our constitution to show the contrary to detail the particulars in which it is found so well to promote its ends would demand a treatise on our practical constitution i state here the doctrine of the revolutionists only that you and others may see what an opinion these gentlemen entertain of the constitution of their country and why they seem to think that some great abuse of power or some great calamity as giving a chance for the blessing of a constitution according to their ideas would be much palliated to their feelings you see why they are so much enamoured of your fair and equal representation which being once obtained the same effects might follow you see they consider our house of commons as only a semblance a form a theory a shadow a mockery perhaps a nuisance   william the conqueror    there is nothing more memorable in history than the actions fortunes and character of this great man whether we consider the grandeur of the plans he formed the courage and wisdom with which they were executed or the splendour of that success which adorning his youth continued without the smallest reserve to support his age even to the last moments of his life he lived above seventy years and reigned within ten years as long as he lived sixty over his dukedom above twenty over england both of which he acquired or kept by his own magnanimity with hardly any other title than he derived from his arms so that he might be reputed in all respects as happy as the highest ambition the most fully gratified can make a man the silent inward satisfactions of domestic happiness he neither had nor sought he had a body suited to the character of his mind erect firm large and active whilst to be active was a praise a countenance stern and which became command magnificent in his living reserved in his conversation grave in his common deportment but relaxing with a wise facetiousness he knew how to relieve his mind and preserve his dignity for he never forfeited by a personal acquaintance that esteem he had acquired by his great actions unlearned in books he formed his understanding by the rigid discipline of a large and complicated experience he knew men much and therefore generally trusted them but little but when he knew any man to be good he reposed in him an entire confidence which prevented his prudence from degenerating into a vice he had vices in his composition and great ones but they were the vices of a great mind ambition the malady of every extensive genius and avarice the madness of the wise one chiefly actuated his youth the other governed his age the vices of young and light minds the joys of wine and the pleasures of love never reached his aspiring nature the general run of men he looked on with contempt and treated with cruelty when they opposed him nor was the rigour of his mind to be softened but with the appearance of extraordinary fortitude in his enemies which by a sympathy congenial to his own virtues always excited his admiration and insured his mercy so that there were often seen in this one man at the same time the extremes of a savage cruelty and a generosity that does honour to human nature religion too seemed to have a great influence on his mind from policy or from better motives but his religion was displayed in the regularity with which he performed his duties not in the submission he showed to its ministers which was never more than what good government required yet his choice of a counsellor and favourite was not according to the mode of the time out of that order and a choice that does honour to his memory this was lanfranc a man of great learning for the times and extraordinary piety he owed his elevation to william but though always inviolably faithful he never was the tool or flatterer of the power which raised him and the greater freedom he showed the higher he rose in the confidence of his master by mixing with the concerns of state he did not lose his religion and conscience or make them the covers or instruments of ambition but tempering the fierce policy of a new power by the mild lights of religion he became a blessing to the country in which he was promoted the english owed to the virtue of this stranger and the influence he had on the king the little remains of liberty they continued to enjoy and at last such a degree of his confidence as in some sort counterbalanced the severities of the former part of his reign   king alfred  when alfred had once more reunited the kingdoms of his ancestors he found the whole face of things in the most desperate condition there was no observance of law and order religion had no force there was no honest industry the most squalid poverty and the grossest ignorance had overspread the whole kingdom alfred at once enterprised the cure of all these evils to remedy the disorders in the government he revived improved and digested all the saxon institutions insomuch that he is generally honoured as the founder of our laws and constitution historians copying after one another and examining little have attributed to this monarch the institution of juries an institution which certainly did never prevail amongst the saxons they have likewise attributed to him the distribution of england into shires hundreds and tithings and of appointing officers over these divisions but it is very obvious that the shires were never settled upon any regular plan nor are they the result of any single design but these reports however ill imagined are a strong proof of the high veneration in which this excellent prince has always been held as it has been thought that the attributing these regulations to him would endear them to the nation he probably settled them in such an order and made such reformations in his government that some of the institutions themselves which he improved have been attributed to him and indeed there was one work of his which serves to furnish us with a higher idea of the political capacity of that great man than any of these fictions he made a general survey and register of all the property in the kingdom who held it and what it was distinctly a vast work for an age of ignorance and time of confusion which has been neglected in more civilized nations and settled times it was called the roll of winton and served as a model of a work of the same kind made by william the conqueror the shire he divided into hundreds the hundreds into tithings every freeman was obliged to be entered into some tithing the members of which were mutually bound for each other for the preservation of the peace and the avoiding theft and rapine for securing the liberty of the subject he introduced the method of giving bail the most certain fence against the abuses of power it has been observed that the reigns of weak princes are times favourable to liberty but the wisest and bravest of all the english princes is the father of their freedom this great man was even jealous of the privileges of his subjects and as his whole life was spent in protecting them his last will breathes the same spirit declaring that he had left his people as free as their own thoughts he not only collected with great care a complete body of laws but he wrote comments on them for the instruction of his judges who were in general by the misfortune of the time ignorant and if he took care to correct their ignorance he was rigorous towards their corruption he inquired strictly into their conduct he heard appeals in person he held his wittenagemotes or parliaments frequently and kept every part of his government in health and vigour  nor was he less solicitous for the defence than he had shown himself for the regulation of his kingdom he nourished with particular care the new naval strength which he had established he built forts and castles in the most important posts he settled beacons to spread an alarm on the arrival of an enemy and ordered his militia in such a manner that there was always a great power in readiness to march well appointed and well disciplined but that a suitable revenue might not be wanting for the support of his fleets and fortifications he gave great encouragement to trade which by the piracies on the coasts and the rapine and injustice exercised by the people within had long become a stranger to this island  in the midst of these various and important cares he gave a peculiar attention to learning which by the rage of the late wars had been entirely extinguished in his kingdom very few there were says this monarch on this side the humber that understood their ordinary prayers or that were able to translate any latin book into english so few that i do not remember even one qualified to the southward of the thames when i began my reign to cure this deplorable ignorance he was indefatigable in his endeavours to bring into england men of learning in all branches from every part of europe and unbounded in his liberality to them he enacted by a law that every person possessed of two hides of land should send their children to school until sixteen wisely considering where to put a stop to his love even of the liberal arts which are only suited to a liberal condition he enterprised yet a greater design than that of forming the growing generationto instruct even the grown enjoining all his earldormen and sheriffs immediately to apply themselves to learning or to quit their offices to facilitate these great purposes he made a regular foundation of a university which with great reason is believed to have been at oxford whatever trouble he took to extend the benefits of learning amongst his subjects he showed the example himself and applied to the cultivation of his mind with unparalleled diligence and success he could neither read nor write at twelve years old but he improved his time in such a manner that he became one of the most knowing men of his age in geometry in philosophy in architecture and in music he applied himself to the improvement of his native language he translated several valuable works from latin and wrote a vast number of poems in the saxon tongue with a wonderful facility and happiness he not only excelled in the theory of the arts and sciences but possessed a great mechanical genius for the executive part he improved the manner of shipbuilding introduced a more beautiful and commodious architecture and even taught his countrymen the art of making bricks most of the buildings having been of wood before his time in a word he comprehended in the greatness of his mind the whole of government and all its parts at once and what is most difficult to human frailty was the same time sublime and minute religion which in alfreds father was so prejudicial to affairs without being in him at all inferior in its zeal and fervour was of a more enlarged and noble kind far from being a prejudice to his government it seems to have been the principle that supported him in so many fatigues and fed like an abundant source his civil and military virtues to his religious exercises and studies he devoted a full third part of his time it is pleasant to trace a genius even in its smallest exertions in measuring and allotting his time for the variety of business he was engaged in according to his severe and methodical custom he had a sort of wax candles made of different colours in different proportions according to the time he allotted to each particular affair as he carried these about with him wherever he went to make them burn evenly he invented horn lanthorns one cannot help being amazed that a prince who lived in such turbulent times who commanded personally in fiftyfour pitched battles who had so disordered a province to regulate who was not only a legislator but a judge and who was continually superintending his armies his navies the traffic of his kingdom his revenues and the conduct of all his officers could have bestowed so much of his time on religious exercises and speculative knowledge but the exertion of all his faculties and virtues seemed to have given a mutual strength to all of them thus all historians speak of this prince whose whole history was one panegyric and whatever dark spots of human frailty may have adhered to such a character they are entirely hid in the splendour of his many shining qualities and grand virtues that throw a glory over the obscure period in which he lived and which is for no other reason worthy of our knowledge   druids  the druids are said to be very expert in astronomy in geography and in all parts of mathematical knowledge and authors speak in a very exaggerated strain of their excellence in these and in many other sciences some elemental knowledge i suppose they had but i can scarcely be persuaded that their learning was either deep or extensive in all countries where druidism was professed the youth were generally instructed by that order and yet was there little either in the manners of the people in their way of life or their works of art that demonstrates profound science or particularly mathematical skill britain where their discipline was in its highest perfection and which was therefore resorted to by the people of gaul as an oracle in druidical questions was more barbarous in all other respects than gaul itself or than any other country then known in europe those piles of rude magnificence stonehenge and abury are in vain produced in proof of their mathematical abilities these vast structures have nothing which can be admired but the greatness of the work and they are not the only instances of the great things which the mere labour of many hands united and persevering in their purpose may accomplish with very little help from mechanics this may be evinced by the immense buildings and the low state of the sciences among the original peruvians the druids were eminent above all the philosophic lawgivers of antiquity for their care in impressing the doctrine of the souls immortality on the minds of their people as an operative and leading principle this doctrine was inculcated on the scheme of transmigration which some imagine them to have derived from pythagoras but it is by no means necessary to resort to any particular teacher for an opinion which owes its birth to the weak struggles of unenlightened reason and to mistakes natural to the human mind the idea of the souls immortality is indeed ancient universal and in a manner inherent in our nature but it is not easy for a rude people to conceive any other mode of existence than one similar to what they had experienced in life nor any other world as the scene of such an existence but this we inhabit beyond the bounds of which the mind extends itself with great difficulty admiration indeed was able to exalt to heaven a few selected heroes it did not seem absurd that those who in their mortal state had distinguished themselves as superior and overruling spirits should after death ascend to that sphere which influences and governs everything below or that the proper abode of beings at once so illustrious and permanent should be in that part of nature in which they had always observed the greatest splendour and the least mutation but on ordinary occasions it was natural some should imagine that the dead retired into a remote country separated from the living by seas or mountains it was natural that some should follow their imagination with a simplicity still purer and pursue the souls of men no further than the sepulchres in which their bodies had been deposited whilst others of deeper penetration observing that bodies worn out by age or destroyed by accidents still afforded the materials for generating new ones concluded likewise that a soul being dislodged did not wholly perish but was destined by a similar revolution in nature to act again and to animate some other body this last principle gave rise to the doctrine of transmigration but we must not presume of course that where it prevailed it necessarily excluded the other opinions for it is not remote from the usual procedure of the human mind blending in obscure matters imagination and reasoning together to unite ideas the most inconsistent when homer represents the ghosts of his heroes appearing at the sacrifices of ulysses he supposes them endued with life sensation and a capacity of moving but he has joined to these powers of living existence uncomeliness want of strength want of distinction the characteristics of a dead carcass this is what the mind is apt to do it is very apt to confound the ideas of the surviving soul and the dead body the vulgar have always and still do confound these very irreconcilable ideas they lay the scene of apparitions in churchyards they habit the ghost in a shroud and it appears in all the ghastly paleness of a corpse a contradiction of this kind has given rise to a doubt whether the druids did in reality hold the doctrine of transmigration there is positive testimony that they did hold it there is also testimony as positive that they buried or burned with the dead utensils arms slaves and whatever might be judged useful to them as if they were to be removed into a separate state they might have held both these opinions and we ought not to be surprised to find error inconsistent   saxon conquest and conversion  but whatever was the condition of the other parts of europe it is generally agreed that the state of britain was the worst of all some writers have asserted that except those who took refuge in the mountains of wales and cornwall or fled into armorica the british race was in a manner destroyed what is extraordinary we find england in a very tolerable state of population in less than two centuries after the first invasion of the saxons and it is hard to imagine either the transplantation or the increase of that single people to have been in so short a time sufficient for the settlement of so great an extent of country others speak of the britons not as extirpated but as reduced to a state of slavery and here these writers fix the origin of personal and predial servitude in england  i shall lay fairly before the reader all i have been able to discover concerning the existence or condition of this unhappy people that they were much more broken and reduced than any other nation which had fallen under the german power i think may be inferred from two considerations first that in all other parts of europe the ancient language subsisted after the conquest and at length incorporated with that of the conquerors whereas in england the saxon language received little or no tincture from the welsh and it seems even among the lowest people to have continued a dialect of pure teutonic to the time in which it was itself blended with the norman secondly that on the continent the christian religion after the northern irruptions not only remained but flourished it was very early and universally adopted by the ruling people in england it was so entirely extinguished that when augustin undertook his mission it does not appear that among all the saxons there was a single person professing christianity the sudden extinction of the ancient religion and language appears sufficient to show that britain must have suffered more than any of the neighbouring nations on the continent but it must not be concealed that there are likewise proofs that the british race though much diminished was not wholly extirpated and that those who remained were not merely as britons reduced to servitude for they are mentioned as existing in some of the earlier saxon laws in these laws they are allowed a compensation on the footing of the meaner kind of english and they are even permitted as well as the english to emerge out of that low rank into a more liberal condition this is degradation but not slavery leges inae 32 de cambrico homine agrum possidente id 54 the affairs of that whole period are however covered with an obscurity not to be dissipated the britons had little leisure or ability to write a just account of a war by which they were ruined and the anglosaxons who succeeded them attentive only to arms were until their conversion ignorant of the use of letters  it is on this darkened theatre that some old writers have introduced those characters and actions which have afforded such ample matter to poets and so much perplexity to historians this is the fabulous and heroic age of our nation after the natural and just representations of the roman scene the stage is again crowded with enchanters giants and all the extravagant images of the wildest and most remote antiquity no personage makes so conspicuous a figure in these stories as king arthur a prince whether of british or roman origin whether born on this island or in armorica is uncertain but it appears that he opposed the saxons with remarkable virtue and no small degree of success which has rendered him and his exploits so large an argument of romance that both are almost disclaimed by history light scarce begins to dawn until the introduction of christianity which bringing with it the use of letters and the arts of civil life affords at once a juster account of things and facts that are more worthy of relation nor is there indeed any revolution so remarkable in the english story  the bishops of rome had for sometime meditated the conversion of the anglosaxons pope gregory who is surnamed the great affected that pious design with an uncommon zeal and he at length found a circumstance highly favourable to it in the marriage of a daughter of charibert a king of the franks to the reining monarch of kent this opportunity induced pope gregory to commission augustin a monk of rheims and a man of distinguished piety to undertake this arduous enterprise  it was in the year of christ 600 and 150 years after the coming of the first saxon colonies into england that ethelbert king of kent received intelligence of the arrival in his dominions of a number of men in a foreign garb practising several strange and unusual ceremonies who desired to be conducted to the kings presence declaring that they had things to communicate to him and to his people of the utmost importance to their eternal welfare this was augustin with forty of the associates of his mission who now landed in the isle of thanet the same place by which the saxons had before entered when they extirpated christianity   ministerial responsibility  it is no excuse at all for a minister who at our desire takes a measure contrary to our safety that it is our own act he who does not stay the hand of suicide is guilty of murder on our part i say that to be instructed is not to be degraded or enslaved information is an advantage to us and we have a right to demand it he that is bound to act in the dark cannot be said to act freely when it appears evident to our governors that our desires and our interests are at variance they ought not to gratify the former at the expense of the latter statesmen are placed on an eminence that they may have a larger horizon than we can possibly command they have a whole before them which we can contemplate only in the parts and often without the necessary relations ministers are not only our natural rulers but our natural guides reason clearly and manfully delivered has in itself a mighty force but reason in the mouth of legal authority is i may fairly say irresistible i admit that reason of state will not in many circumstances permit the disclosure of the true ground of a public proceeding in that case silence is manly and it is wise it is fair to call for trust when the principle of reason itself suspends its public use i take the distinction to be this the ground of a particular measure making a part of a plan it is rarely proper to divulge all the broader grounds of policy on which the general plan is to be adopted ought as rarely to be concealed they who have not the whole cause before them call them politicians call them people call them what you will are no judges the difficulties of the case as well as its fair side ought to be presented this ought to be done and it is all that can be done when we have our true situation distinctly presented to us if then we resolve with a blind and headlong violence to resist the admonitions of our friends and to cast ourselves into the hands of our potent and irreconcilable foes then and not till then the ministers stand acquitted before god and man for whatever may come   monastic institutions and their results  in the change of religion care was taken to render the transit from falsehood to truth as little violent as possible though the first proselytes were kings it does not appear that there was any persecution it was a precept of pope gregory under whose auspices this mission was conducted that the heathen temples should not be destroyed especially where they were well built but that first removing the idols they should be consecrated anew by holier rites and to better purposes bed hist eccl l i c 30 in order that the prejudices of the people might not be too rudely shocked by a declared profanation of what they had so long held sacred and that everywhere beholding the same places to which they had formerly resorted for religious comfort they might be gradually reconciled to the new doctrines and ceremonies which were there introduced and as the sacrifices used in the pagan worship were always attended with feasting and consequently were highly grateful to the multitude the pope ordered that oxen should as usual be slaughtered near the church and the people indulged in their ancient festivity id c eod whatever popular customs of heathenism were found to be absolutely not incompatible with christianity were retained and some of them were continued to a very late period deer were at a certain season brought into st pauls church in london and laid on the altar dugdales history of st pauls and this custom subsisted until the reformation the names of some of the church festivals were with a similar design taken from those of the heathen which had been celebrated at the same time of the year nothing could have been more prudent than these regulations they were indeed formed from a perfect understanding of human nature  whilst the inferior people were thus insensibly led into a better order the example and countenance of the great completed the work for the saxon kings and ruling men embraced religion with so signal and in their rank so unusual a zeal that in many instances they even sacrificed to its advancement the prime objects of their ambition wulfere king of the west saxons bestowed the isle of wight on the king of sussex to persuade him to embrace christianity bed hist eccl l iv c 13 this zeal operated in the same manner in favour of their instructors the greatest kings and conquerors frequently resigned their crowns and shut themselves up in monasteries when kings became monks a high lustre was reflected upon the monastic state and great credit accrued to the power of their doctrine which was able to produce such extraordinary effects upon persons over whom religion has commonly the slightest influence  the zeal of the missionaries was also much assisted by their superiority in the arts of civil life at their first preaching in sussex that country was reduced to the greatest distress from a drought which had continued for three years the barbarous inhabitants destitute of any means to alleviate the famine in an epidemic transport of despair frequently united forty and fifty in a body and joining their hands precipitated themselves from the cliffs and were either drowned or dashed to pieces on the rocks though a maritime people they knew not how to fish and this ignorance probably arose from a remnant of druidical superstition which had forbidden the use of that sort of diet in this calamity bishop wilfred their first preacher collecting nets at the head of his attendants plunged into the sea and having opened this great resource of food he reconciled the desperate people to life and their minds to the spiritual care of those who had shown themselves so attentive to their temporal preservation bed hist eccl l iv c 13 the same regard to the welfare of the people appeared in all their actions the christian kings sometimes made donations to the church of lands conquered from their heathen enemies the clergy immediately baptized and manumitted their new vassals thus they endeared to all sorts of men doctrines and teachers which could mitigate the rigorous law of conquest and they rejoiced to see religion and liberty advancing with an equal progress nor were the monks in this time in anything more worthy of their praise than in their zeal for personal freedom in the canon wherein they provided against the alienation of their lands among other charitable exceptions to this restraint they particularize the purchase of liberty spelm concil page 329 in their transactions with the great the same point was always strenuously laboured when they imposed penance they were remarkably indulgent to persons of that rank but they always made them purchase the remission of corporal austerity by acts of beneficence they urged their powerful penitents to the enfranchisement of their own slaves and to the redemption of those which belonged to others they directed them to the repair of highways and to the construction of churches bridges and other works of general utility instauret etiam dei ecclesiam

extracted the fruits of virtue even from crimes and whenever a great man expiated his private offences he provided in the same act for the public happiness the monasteries were then the only bodies corporate in the kingdom and if any persons were desirous to perpetuate their charity by a fund for the relief of the sick or indigent there was no other way than to confide this trust to some monastery the monks were the sole channel through which the bounty of the rich could pass in any continued stream to the poor and the people turned their eyes towards them in all their distresses  we must observe that the monks of that time especially those from ireland aidanus finam et colmanus mirae sanctitatis fuerunt et parsimoniae adeo enim sacerdotes erant illius temporis ab avaritia immunes

rapacious desire of riches which long disgraced and finally ruined their successors not only did they not seek but seemed even to shun such donations this prevented that alarm which might have arisen from an early and declared avarice at this time the most fervent and holy anchorites retired to places the furthest that could be found from human concourse and help to the most desolate and barren situations which even from their horror seemed particularly adapted to men who had renounced the world many persons followed them in order to partake of their instructions and prayers or to form themselves upon their example an opinion of their miracles after their death drew still greater numbers establishments were gradually made the monastic life was frugal and the government moderate these causes drew a constant concourse sanctified deserts assumed a new face the marshes were drained and the lands cultivated and as this revolution seemed rather the effect of the holiness of the place than of any natural causes it increased their credit and every improvement drew with it a new donation in this manner the great abbeys of croyland and glastonbury and many others from the most obscure beginnings were advanced to a degree of wealth and splendour little less than royal in these rude ages government was not yet fixed upon solid principles and everything was full of tumult and distraction as the monasteries were better secured from violence by their character than any other places by laws several great men and even sovereign princes were obliged to take refuge in convents who when by a more happy revolution in their fortunes they were reinstated in their former dignities thought they could never make a sufficient return for the safety they had enjoyed under the sacred hospitality of these roofs not content to enrich them with ample possessions that others also might partake of the protection they had experienced they formally erected into an asylum those monasteries and their adjacent territory so that all thronged to that refuge who were rendered unquiet by their crimes their misfortunes or the severity of their lords and content to live under a government to which their minds were subject they raised the importance of their masters by their numbers their labour and above all by an inviolable attachment  the monastery was always the place of sepulture for the greatest lords and kings this added to the other causes of reverence a sort of sanctity which in universal opinion always attends the repositories of the dead and they acquired also thereby a more particular protection against the great and powerful for who would violate the tomb of his ancestors or his own it was not an unnatural weakness to think that some advantage might be derived from lying in holy places and amongst holy persons and this superstition was fomented with the greatest industry and art the monks of glastonbury spread a notion that it was almost impossible any person should be damned whose body lay in their cemetery this must be considered as coming in aid of the amplest of their resources prayer for the dead  but there was no part of their policy of whatever nature that procured to them a greater or juster credit than their cultivation of learning and useful arts for if the monks contributed to the fall of science in the roman empire it is certain that the introduction of learning and civility into this northern world is entirely owing to their labours it is true that they cultivated letters only in a secondary way and as subsidiary to religion but the scheme of christianity is such that it almost necessitates an attention to many kinds of learning for the scripture is by no means an irrelative system of moral and divine truths but it stands connected with so many histories and with the laws opinions and manners of so many various sorts of people and in such different times that it is altogether impossible to arrive to any tolerable knowledge of it without having recourse to much exterior inquiry for which reason the progress of this religion has always been marked by that of letters there were two other circumstances at this time that contributed no less to the revival of learning the sacred writings had not been translated into any vernacular language and even the ordinary service of the church was still continued in the latin tongue all therefore who formed themselves for the ministry and hoped to make any figure in it were in a manner driven to the study of the writers of polite antiquity in order to qualify themselves for their most ordinary functions by this means a practice liable in itself to great objections had a considerable share in preserving the wrecks of literature and was one means of conveying down to our times those inestimable monuments which otherwise in the tumult of barbarous confusion on one hand and untaught piety on the other must inevitably have perished the second circumstance the pilgrimages of that age if considered in itself was as liable to objection as the former but it proved of equal advantage to the cause of literature a principal object of these pious journeys was rome which contained all the little that was left in the western world of ancient learning and taste the other great object of those pilgrimages was jerusalem this led them into the grecian empire which still subsisted in the east with great majesty and power here the greeks had not only not discontinued the ancient studies but they added to the stock of arts many inventions of curiosity and convenience that were unknown to antiquity when afterwards the saracens prevailed in that part of the world the pilgrims had also by the same means an opportunity of profiting from the improvements of that laborious people and however little the majority of these pious travellers might have had such objects in their view something useful must unavoidably have stuck to them a few certainly saw with more discernment and rendered their travels serviceable to their country by importing other things besides miracles and legends thus a communication was opened between this remote island and countries of which it otherwise could then scarcely have heard mention made and pilgrimages thus preserved that intercourse amongst mankind which is now formed by politics commerce and learned curiosity it is not wholly unworthy of observation that providence which strongly appears to have intended the continual intermixture of mankind never leaves the human mind destitute of a principle to effect it this purpose is sometimes carried on by a sort of migratory instinct sometimes by the spirit of conquest at one time avarice drives men from their homes at another they are actuated by a thirst of knowledge where none of these causes can operate the sanctity of particular places attracts men from the most distant quarters it was this motive which sent thousands in those ages to jerusalem and rome and now in a full tide impels half the world annually to mecca  by those voyages the seeds of various kinds of knowledge and improvement were at different times imported into england they were cultivated in the leisure and retirement of monasteries otherwise they could not have been cultivated at all for it was altogether necessary to draw certain men from the general rude and fierce society and wholly to set a bar between them and the barbarous life of the rest of the world in order to fit them for study and the cultivation of arts and science accordingly we find everywhere in the first institutions for the propagation of knowledge amongst any people that those who followed it were set apart and secluded from the mass of the community  the great ecclesiastical chair of this kingdom for near a century was filled by foreigners they were nominated by the popes who were in that age just or politic enough to appoint persons of a merit in some degree adequate to that important charge through this series of foreign and learned prelates continual accessions were made to the originally slender stock of english literature the greatest and most valuable of these accessions was made in the time and by the care of theodorus the seventh archbishop of canterbury he was a greek by birth a man of a high ambitious spirit and of a mind more liberal and talents better cultivated than generally fell to the lot of the western prelates he first introduced the study of his native language into this island he brought with him a number of valuable books in many faculties and amongst them a magnificent copy of the works of homer the most ancient and best of poets and the best chosen to inspire a people just initiated into letters with an ardent love and with a true taste for the sciences under his influence a school was formed at canterbury and thus the other great fountain of knowledge the greek tongue was opened in england in the year of our lord 669   common law and magna charta  the common law as it then prevailed in england was in a great measure composed of some remnants of the old saxon customs joined to the feudal institutions brought in at the norman conquest and it is here to be observed that the constitutions of magna charta are by no means a renewal of the laws of st edward or the ancient saxon laws as our historians and lawwriters generally though very groundlessly assert they bear no resemblance in any particular to the laws of st edward or to any other collection of these ancient institutions indeed how should they the object of magna charta is the correction of the feudal policy which was first introduced at least in any regular form at the conquest and did not subsist before it it may be further observed that in the preamble to the great charter it is stipulated that the barons shall hold the liberties there granted to them and their heirs from the king and his heirs which shows that the doctrine of an unalienable tenure was always uppermost in their minds their idea even of liberty was not if i may use the expression perfectly free and they did not claim to possess their privileges upon any natural principle or independent bottom but just as they held their lands from the king this is worthy of observation by the feudal law all landed property is by a feigned conclusion supposed to be derived and therefore to be mediately or immediately held from the crown if some estates were so derived others were certainly procured by the same original title of conquest by which the crown itself was acquired and the derivation from the king could in reason only be considered as a fiction of law but its consequent rights being once supposed many real charges and burthens grew from a fiction made only for the preservation of subordination and in consequence of this a great power was exercised over the persons and estates of the tenants the fines on the succession to an estate called in the feudal language reliefs were not fixed to any certainty and were therefore frequently made so excessive that they might rather be considered as redemptions or new purchases than acknowledgments of superiority and tenure with respect to that most important article of marriage there was in the very nature of the feudal holding a great restraint laid upon it it was of importance to the lord that the person who received the feud should be submissive to him he had therefore a right to interfere in the marriage of the heiress who inherited the feud this right was carried further than the necessity required the male heir himself was obliged to marry according to the choice of his lord and even widows who had made one sacrifice to the feudal tyranny were neither suffered to continue in the widowed state nor to choose for themselves the partners of their second bed in fact marriage was publicly set up to sale the ancient records of the exchequer afford many instances where some women purchased by heavy fines the privilege of a single life some the free choice of a husband others the liberty of rejecting some person particularly disagreeable and what may appear extraordinary there are not wanting examples where a woman has fined in a considerable sum that she might not be compelled to marry a certain man the suitor on the other hand has outbid her and solely by offering more for the marriage than the heiress could to prevent it he carried his point directly and avowedly against her inclinations now as the king claimed no right over his immediate tenants that they did not exercise in the same or in a more oppressive manner over their vassals it is hard to conceive a more general and cruel grievance than this shameful market which so universally outraged the most sacred relations among mankind but the tyranny over women was not over with the marriage as the king seized into his hands the estate of every deceased tenant in order to secure his relief the widow was driven often by a heavy composition to purchase the admission to her dower into which it should seem she could not enter without the kings consent  all these were marks of a real and grievous servitude the great charter was made not to destroy the root but to cut short the overgrown branches of the feudal service first in moderating and in reducing to a certainty the reliefs which the kings tenants paid on succeeding to their estate according to their rank and secondly in taking off some of the burthens which had been laid on marriage whether compulsory or restrictive and thereby preventing that shameful market which had been made in the persons of heirs and the most sacred things amongst mankind  there were other provisions made in the great charter that went deeper than the feudal tenure and affected the whole body of the civil government a great part of the kings revenue then consisted in the fines and amercements which were imposed in his courts a fine was paid there for liberty to commence or to conclude a suit the punishment of offences by fine was discretionary and this discretionary power had been very much abused but by magna charta things were so ordered that a delinquent might be punished but not ruined by a fine or amercement because the degree of his offence and the rank he held were to be taken into consideration his freehold his merchandise and those instruments by which he obtained his livelihood were made sacred from such impositions a more grand reform was made with regard to the administration of justice the kings in those days seldom resided long in one place and their courts followed their persons this erratic justice must have been productive of infinite inconvenience to the litigants it was now provided that civil suits called common pleas should be fixed to some certain place thus one branch of jurisdiction was separated from the kings court and detached from his person they had not yet come to that maturity of jurisprudence as to think this might be made to extend to criminal law also and that the latter was an object of still greater importance but even the former may be considered as a great revolution a tribunal a creature of mere law independent of personal power was established and this separation of a kings authority from his person was a matter of vast consequence towards introducing ideas of freedom and confirming the sacredness and majesty of laws  but the grand article and that which cemented all the parts of the fabric of liberty was this that no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized or outlawed or banished or in any wise destroyed but by judgment of his peers  there is another article of nearly as much consequence as the former considering the state of the nation at that time by which it is provided that the barons shall grant to their tenants the same liberties which they had stipulated for themselves this prevented the kingdom from degenerating into the worst imaginable government a feudal aristocracy the english barons were not in the condition of those great princes who had made the french monarchy so low in the preceding century or like those who reduced the imperial power to a name they had been brought to moderate bounds by the policy of the first and second henrys and were not in a condition to set up for petty sovereigns by an usurpation equally detrimental to the crown and the people they were able to act only in confederacy and this common cause made it necessary to consult the common good and to study popularity by the equity of their proceedings this was a very happy circumstances to the growing liberty   europe and the norman invasion  before the period of which we are going to treat england was little known or considered in europe their situation their domestic calamities and their ignorance circumscribed the views and politics of the english within the bounds of their own island but the norman conqueror threw down all these barriers the english laws manners and maxims were suddenly changed the scene was enlarged and the communication with the rest of europe being thus opened has been preserved ever since in a continued series of wars and negotiations that we may therefore enter more fully into the matters which lie before us it is necessary that we understand the state of the neighbouring continent at the time when this island first came to be interested in its affairs  the northern nations who had overrun the roman empire were at first rather actuated by avarice than ambition and were more intent upon plunder than conquest they were carried beyond their original purposes when they began to form regular governments for which they had been prepared by no just ideas of legislation for a long time therefore there was little of order in their affairs or foresight in their designs the goths the burgundians the franks the vandals the suevi after they had prevailed over the roman empire by turns prevailed over each other in continual wars which were carried on upon no principles of a determinate policy entered into upon motives of brutality and caprice and ended as fortune and rude violence chanced to prevail tumult anarchy confusion overspread the face of europe and an obscurity rests upon the transactions of that time which suffers us to discover nothing but its extreme barbarity  before this cloud could be dispersed the saracens another body of barbarians from the south animated by a fury not unlike that which gave strength to the northern irruptions but heightened by enthusiasm and regulated by subordination and uniform policy began to carry their arms their manners and religion into every part of the universe spain was entirely overwhelmed by the torrent of their armies italy and the islands were harassed by their fleets and all europe alarmed by their vigorous and frequent enterprises italy who had so long sat the mistress of the world was by turns the slave of all nations the possession of that fine country was hotly disputed between the greek emperor and the lombards and it suffered infinitely by that contention germany the parent of so many nations was exhausted by the swarms she had sent abroad however in the midst of this chaos there were principles at work which reduced things to a certain form and gradually unfolded a system in which the chief movers and main springs were the papal and the imperial powers the aggrandisement or diminution of which have been the drift of almost all the politics intrigues and wars which have employed and distracted europe to this day  from rome the whole western world had received its christianity she was the asylum of what learning had escaped the general desolation and even in her ruins she preserved something of the majesty of her ancient greatness on these accounts she had a respect and a weight which increased every day amongst a simple religious people who looked but a little way into the consequences of their actions the rudeness of the world was very favourable for the establishment of an empire of opinion the moderation with which the popes at first exerted this empire made its growth unfelt until it could no longer be opposed and the policy of later popes building on the piety of the first continually increased it and they made use of every instrument but that of force they employed equally the virtues and the crimes of the great they favoured the lust of kings for absolute authority and the desire of subjects for liberty they provoked war and mediated peace and took advantage of every turn in the minds of men whether of a public or private nature to extend their influence and push their power from ecclesiastical to civil from subjection to independency from independency to empire  france had many advantages over the other parts of europe the saracens had no permanent success in that country the same hand which expelled those invaders deposed the last of a race of heavy and degenerate princes more like eastern monarchs than german leaders and who had neither the force to repel the enemies of their kingdom nor to assert their own sovereignty this usurpation placed on the throne princes of another character princes who were obliged to supply their want of title by the vigour of their administration the french monarch had need of some great and respected authority to throw a veil over his usurpation and to sanctify his newlyacquired power by those names and appearances which are necessary to make it respectable to the people on the other hand the pope who hated the grecian empire and equally feared the success of the lombards saw with joy this new star arise in the north and gave it the sanction of his authority presently after he called it to his assistance pepin passed the alps relieved the pope and invested him with the dominion of a large country in the best part of italy  charlemagne pursued the course which was marked out for him and put an end to the lombard kingdom weakened by the policy of his father and the enmity of the popes who never willingly saw a strong power in italy then he received from the hand of the pope the imperial crown sanctified by the authority of the holy see and with it the title of emperor of the romans a name venerable from the fame of the old empire and which was supposed to carry great and unknown prerogatives and thus the empire rose again out of its ruins in the west and what is remarkable by means of one of those nations which had helped to destroy it if we take in the conquests of charlemagne it was also very near as extensive as formerly though its constitution was altogether different as being entirely on the northern model of government  from charlemagne the pope received in return an enlargement and a confirmation of his new territory thus the papal and imperial powers mutually gave birth to each other they continued for some ages and in some measure still continue closely connected with a variety of pretensions upon each other and on the rest of europe though the imperial power had its origin in france it was soon divided into two branches the gallic and the german the latter alone supported the title of empire but the power being weakened by this division the papal pretensions had the greater weight the pope because he first revived the imperial dignity claimed a right of disposing of it or at least of giving validity to the election of the emperor the emperor on the other hand remembering the rights of those sovereigns whose title he bore and how lately the power which insulted him with such demands had arisen from the bounty of his predecessors claimed the same privileges in the election of a pope the claims of both were somewhat plausible and they were supported the one by force of arms and the other by ecclesiastical influence powers which in those days were very nearly balanced italy was the theatre upon which this prize was disputed in every city the parties in favour of each of the opponents were not far from an equality in their numbers and strength whilst these parties disagreed in the choice of a master by contending for a choice in their subjection they grew imperceptibly into freedom and passed through the medium of faction and anarchy into regular commonwealths thus arose the republics of venice of genoa of florence sienna and pisa and several others these cities established in this freedom turned the frugal and ingenious spirit contracted in such communities to navigation and traffic and pursuing them with skill and vigour whilst commerce was neglected and despised by the rustic gentry of the martial governments they grew to a considerable degree of wealth power and civility  the danes who in this latter time preserved the spirit and the numbers of the ancient gothic people had seated themselves in england in the low countries and in normandy they passed from thence to the southern part of europe and in this romantic age gave rise in sicily and naples to a new kingdom and a new line of princes  all the kingdoms on the continent of europe were governed nearly in the same form from whence arose a great similitude in the manners of their inhabitants the feodal discipline extended itself everywhere and influenced the conduct of the courts and the manners of the people with its own irregular martial spirit subjects under the complicated laws of a various and rigorous servitude exercised all the prerogatives of sovereign power they distributed justice they made war and peace at pleasure the sovereign with great pretensions had but little power he was only a greater lord among great lords who profited of the differences of his peers therefore no steady plan could be well pursued either in war or peace this day a prince seemed irresistible at the head of his numerous vassals because their duty obliged them to war and they performed this duty with pleasure the next day saw this formidable power vanish like a dream because this fierce undisciplined people had no patience and the time of the feudal service was contained within very narrow limits it was therefore easy to find a number of persons at all times ready to follow any standard but it was hard to complete a considerable design which required a regular and continued movement this enterprising disposition in the gentry was very general because they had little occupation or pleasure but in war and the greatest rewards did then attend personal valour and prowess all that professed arms became in some sort on an equality a knight was the peer of a king and men had been used to see the bravery of private persons opening a road to that dignity the temerity of adventurers was much justified by the ill order of every state which left it a prey to almost any who should attack it with sufficient vigour thus little checked by any superior power full of fire impetuosity and ignorance they longed to signalize themselves wherever an honourable danger called them and wherever that invited they did not weigh very deliberately the probability of success the knowledge of this general disposition in the minds of men will naturally remove a great deal of our wonder at seeing an attempt founded on such slender appearances of right and supported by a power so little proportioned to the undertaking as that of william so warmly embraced and so generally followed not only by his own subjects but by all the neighbouring potentates the counts of anjou bretagne ponthieu boulogne and poictou sovereign princes adventurers from every quarter of france the netherlands and the remotest parts of germany laying aside their jealousies and enmities to one another as well as to william ran with an inconceivable ardour into this enterprise captivated with the splendour of the object which obliterated all thoughts of the uncertainty of the event william kept up this fervour by promises of large territories to all his allies and associates in the country to be reduced by their united efforts but after all it became equally necessary to reconcile to his enterprise the three great powers of whom we have just spoken whose disposition must have had the most influence on his affairs  his feudal lord the king of france was bound by his most obvious interests to oppose the further aggrandisement of one already too potent for a vassal but the king of france was then a minor and baldwin earl of flanders whose daughter william had married was regent of the kingdom this circumstance rendered the remonstrance of the french council against his design of no effect indeed the opposition of the council itself was faint the idea of having a king under vassalage to their crown might have dazzled the more superficial courtiers whilst those who thought more deeply were unwilling to discourage an enterprise which they believed would probably end in the ruin of the undertaker the emperor was in his minority as well as the king of france but by what arts the duke prevailed upon the imperial council to declare in his favour whether or no by an idea of creating a balance to the power of france if we can imagine that any such idea then subsisted is altogether uncertain but it is certain that he obtained leave for the vassals of the empire to engage in his service and that he made use of this permission the popes consent was obtained with still less difficulty william had shown himself in many instances a friend to the church and a favourer of the clergy on this occasion he promised to improve those happy beginnings in proportion to the means he should acquire by the favour of the holy see it is said that he even proposed to hold his new kingdom as a fief from rome the pope therefore entered heartily into his interests he excommunicated all those that should oppose his enterprise and sent him as a means of ensuring success a consecrated banner   ancient inhabitants of britain    that britain was first peopled from gaul we are assured by the best proofs proximity of situation and resemblance in language and manners of the time in which this event happened we must be contented to remain in ignorance for we have no monuments but we may conclude that it was a very ancient settlement since the carthaginians found this island inhabited when they traded hither for tin as the phoenicians whose tracks they followed in this commerce are said to have done long before them it is true that when we consider the short interval between the universal deluge and that period and compare it with the first settlement of men at such a distance from this corner of the world it may seem not easy to reconcile such a claim to antiquity with the only authentic account we have of the origin and progress of mankind especially as in those early ages the whole face of nature was extremely rude and uncultivated when the links of commerce even in the countries first settled were few and weak navigation imperfect geography unknown and the hardships of travelling excessive but the spirit of migration of which we have now only some faint ideas was then strong and universal and it fully compensated all these disadvantages many writers indeed imagine that these migrations so common in the primitive times were caused by the prodigious increase of people beyond what their several territories could maintain but this opinion far from being supported is rather contradicted by the general appearance of things in that early time when in every country vast tracts of land were suffered to lie almost useless in morasses and forests nor is it indeed more countenanced by the ancient modes of life no way favourable to population i apprehend that these first settled countries so far from being overstocked with inhabitants were rather thinly peopled and that the same causes which occasioned that thinness occasioned also those frequent migrations which make so large a part of the first history of almost all nations  for in these ages men subsisted chiefly by pasturage or hunting these are occupations which spread the people without multiplying them in proportion they teach them an extensive knowledge of the country they carry them frequently and far from their homes and weaken those ties which might attach them to any particular habitation  it was in a great degree from this manner of life that mankind became scattered in the earliest times over the whole globe but their peaceful occupations did not contribute so much to that end as their wars which were not the less frequent and violent because the people were few and the interests for which they contended of but small importance ancient history has furnished us with many instances of whole nations expelled by invasion falling in upon others which they have entirely overwhelmed more irresistible in their defeat and ruin than in their fullest prosperity the rights of war were then exercised with great inhumanity a cruel death or a servitude scarcely less cruel was the certain fate of all conquered people the terror of which hurried men from habitations to which they were but little attached to seek security and repose under any climate that however in other respects undesirable might afford them refuge from the fury of their enemies thus the bleak and barren regions of the north not being peopled by choice were peopled as early in all probability as many of the milder and more inviting climates of the southern world and thus by a wonderful disposition of the divine providence a life of hunting which does not contribute to increase and war which is the great instrument in the destruction of men were the two principal causes of their being spread so early and so universally over the whole earth from what is very commonly known of the state of north america it need not be said how often and to what distance several of the nations on that continent are used to migrate who though thinly scattered occupy an immense extent of country nor are the causes of it less obvioustheir hunting life and their inhuman wars  such migrations sometimes by choice more frequently from necessity were common in the ancient world frequent necessities introduced a fashion which subsisted after the original causes for how could it happen but from some universally established public prejudice which always overrules and stifles the private sense of men that a whole nation should deliberately think it a wise measure to quit their country in a body that they might obtain in a foreign land a settlement which must wholly depend upon the chance of war yet this resolution was taken and actually pursued by the entire nation of the helvetii as it is minutely related by caesar the method of reasoning which led them to it must appear to us at this day utterly inconceivable they were far from being compelled to this extraordinary migration by any want of subsistence at home for it appears that they raised without difficulty as much corn in one year as supported them for two they could not complain of the barrenness of such a soil  this spirit of migration which grew out of the ancient manners and necessities and sometimes operated like a blind instinct such as actuates birds of passage is very sufficient to account for the early habitation of the remotest parts of the earth and in some sort also justifies that claim which has been so fondly made by almost all nations to great antiquity gaul from whence britain was originally peopled consisted of three nations the belgae towards the north the celtae in the middle countries and the aquitani to the south britain appears to have received its people only from the two former from the celtae were derived the most ancient tribes of the britons of which the most considerable were called brigantes the belgae who did not even settle in gaul until after britain had been peopled by colonies from the former forcibly drove the brigantes into the inland countries and possessed the greatest part of the coast especially to the south and west these latter as they entered the island in a more improved age brought with them the knowledge and practice of agriculture which however only prevailed in their own countries the brigantes still continued their ancient way of life by pasturage and hunting in this respect alone they differed so that what we shall say in treating of their manners is equally applicable to both and though the britons were further divided into an innumerable multitude of lesser tribes and nations yet all being the branches of these two stocks it is not to our purpose to consider them more minutely  britain was in the time of julius caesar what it is at this day in climate and natural advantages temperate and reasonably fertile but destitute of all those improvements which in a succession of ages it has received from ingenuity from commerce from riches and luxury it then wore a very rough and savage appearance the country forest or marsh the habitations cottages the cities hidingplaces in woods the people naked or only covered with skins their sole employment pasturage and hunting they painted their bodies for ornament or terror by a custom general among all savage nations who being passionately fond of show and finery and having no object but their naked bodies on which to exercise this disposition have in all times painted or cut their skins according to their ideas of ornament they shaved the beard on the chin that on the upper lip was suffered to remain and grow to an extraordinary length to favour the martial appearance in which they placed their glory they were in their natural temper not unlike the gauls impatient fiery inconstant ostentatious boastful fond of novelty and like all barbarians fierce treacherous and cruel their arms were short javelins small shields of a slight texture and great cutting swords with a blunt point after the gaulish fashion  their chiefs went to battle in chariots not unartfully contrived nor unskilfully managed i cannot help thinking it something extraordinary and not easily to be accounted for that the britons should have been so expert in the fabric of those chariots when they seem utterly ignorant in all other mechanic arts but thus it is delivered to us they had also horse though of no great reputation in their armies their foot was without heavy armour it was no firm body nor instructed to preserve their ranks to make their evolutions or to obey their commanders but in tolerating hardships in dexterity of forming ambuscades the art military of savages they are said to have excelled a natural ferocity and an impetuous onset stood them in the place of discipline   public prosecutions    public prosecutions are become little better than schools for treason of no use but to improve the dexterity of criminals in the mystery of evasion or to show with what complete impunity men may conspire against the commonwealth with what safety assassins may attempt its awful head everything is secure except what the laws have made sacred everything is tameness and languor that is not fury and faction whilst the distempers of a relaxed fibre prognosticate and prepare all the morbid force of convulsion in the body of the state the steadiness of the physician is overpowered by the very aspect of the disease the doctor of the constitution pretending to underrate what he is not able to contend with shrinks from his own operation he doubts and questions the salutary but critical terrors of the cautery and the knife he takes a poor credit even from his defeat and covers impotence under the mask of lenity he praises the moderation of the laws as in his hands he sees them baffled and despised is all this because in our day the statutes of the kingdom are not engrossed in as firm a character and imprinted in as black and legible a type as ever no the law is a clear but it is a dead letter dead and putrid it is insufficient to save the state but potent to infect and to kill living law full of reason and of equity and justice as it is or it should not exist ought to be severe and awful too or the words of menace whether written on the parchment roll of england or cut into the brazen tablet of rome will excite nothing but contempt how comes it that in all the state prosecutions of magnitude from the revolution to within these two or three years the crown has scarcely ever retired disgraced and defeated from its courts whence this alarming change by a connection easily felt and not impossible to be traced to its cause all the parts of the state have their correspondence and consent they who bow to the enemy abroad will not be of power to subdue the conspirator at home it is impossible not to observe that in proportion as we approximate to the poisonous jaws of anarchy the fascination grows irresistible in proportion as we are attracted towards the focus of illegality irreligion and desperate enterprise all the venomous and blighting insects of the state are awakened into life the promise of the year is blasted and shrivelled and burned up before them our most salutary and most beautiful institutions yield nothing but dust and smut the harvest of our law is no more than stubble it is in the nature of these eruptive diseases in the state to sink in by fits and reappear but the fuel of the malady remains and in my opinion is not in the smallest degree mitigated in its malignity though it waits the favourable moment of a freer communication with the source of regicide to exert and to increase its force  is it that the people are changed that the commonwealth cannot be protected by its laws i hardly think it on the contrary i conceive that these things happen because men are not changed but remain always what they always were they remain what the bulk of us ever must be when abandoned to our vulgar propensities without guide leader or control that is made to be full of a blind elevation in prosperity to despise untried dangers to be overpowered with unexpected reverses to find no clue in a labyrinth of difficulties to get out of a present inconvenience with any risk of future ruin to follow and to bow to fortune to admire successful though wicked enterprise and to imitate what we admire to contemn the government which announces danger from sacrilege and regicide whilst they are only in their infancy and their struggle but which finds nothing that can alarm in their adult state and in the power and triumph of those destructive principles in a mass we cannot be left to ourselves we must have leaders if none will undertake to lead us right we shall find guides who will contrive to conduct us to shame and ruin   true nature of a jacobin war  as to me i was always steadily of opinion that this disorder was not in its nature intermittent i conceived that the contest once begun could not be laid down again to be resumed at our discretion but that our first struggle with this evil would also be our last i never thought we could make peace with the system because it was not for the sake of an object we pursued in rivalry with each other but with the system itself that we were at war as i understood the matter we were at war not with its conduct but with its existence convinced that its existence and its hostility were the same  the faction is not local or territorial it is a general evil where it least appears in action it is still full of life in its sleep it recruits its strength and prepares its exertion its spirit lies deep in the corruption of our common nature the social order which restrains it feeds it it exists in every country in europe and among all orders of men in every country who look up to france as to a common head the centre is there the circumference is the world of europe wherever the race of europe may be settled everywhere else the faction is militant in france it is triumphant in france is the bank of deposit and the bank of circulation of all the pernicious principles that are forming in every state it will be a folly scarcely deserving of pity and too mischievous for contempt to think of restraining it in any other country whilst it is predominant there war instead of being the cause of its force has suspended its operation it has given a reprieve at least to the christian world the true nature of a jacobin war in the beginning was by most of the christian powers felt acknowledged and even in the most precise manner declared in the joint manifesto published by the emperor and the king of prussia on the 4th of august 1792 it is expressed in the clearest terms and on principles which could not fail if they had adhered to them of classing those monarchs with the first benefactors of mankind this manifesto was published as they themselves express it to lay open to the present generation as well as to posterity their motives their intentions and the disinterestedness of their personal views taking up arms for the purpose of preserving social and political order amongst all civilized nations and to secure to each state its religion happiness independence territories and real constitutionon this ground they hoped that all empires and all states would be unanimous and becoming the firm guardians of the happiness of mankind that they could not fail to unite their efforts to rescue a numerous nation from its own fury to preserve europe from the return of barbarism and the universe from the subversion and anarchy with which it was threatened the whole of that noble performance ought to be read at the first meeting of any congress which may assemble for the purpose of pacification in that peace these powers expressly renounce all views of personal aggrandisement and confine themselves to objects worthy of so generous so heroic and so perfectly wise and politic an enterprise it was to the principles of this confederation and to no other that we wished our sovereign and our country to accede as a part of the commonwealth of europe to these principles with some trifling exceptions and limitations they did fully accede see declaration whitehall october 29 1793 and all our friends who took office acceded to the ministry whether wisely or not as i always understood the matter on the faith and on the principles of that declaration  as long as these powers flattered themselves that the menace of force would produce the effect of force they acted on those declarations but when their menaces failed of success their efforts took a new direction it did not appear to them that virtue and heroism ought to be purchased by millions of rixdollars it is a dreadful truth but it is a truth that cannot be concealed in ability in dexterity in the distinctness of their views the jacobins are our superiors they saw the thing right from the very beginning whatever were the first motives to the war among politicians they saw that in its spirit and for its objects it was a civil war and as such they pursued it it is a war between the partisans of the ancient civil moral and political order of europe against a sect of fanatical and ambitious atheists which means to change them all it is not france extending a foreign empire over other nations it is a sect aiming at universal empire and beginning with the conquest of france the leaders of that sect secured the centre of europe and that secured they knew that whatever might be the event of battles and sieges their cause was victorious whether its territory had a little more or a little less peeled from its surface or whether an island or two was detached from its commerce to them was of little moment the conquest of france was a glorious acquisition that once well laid as a basis of empire opportunities never could be wanting to regain or to replace what had been lost and dreadfully to avenge themselves on the faction of their adversaries they saw it was a civil war it was their business to persuade their adversaries that it ought to be a foreign war the jacobins everywhere set up a cry against the new crusade and they intrigued with effect in the cabinet in the field and in every private society in europe their task was not difficult the condition of princes and sometimes of first ministers too is to be pitied the creatures of the desk and the creatures of favour had no relish for the principles of the manifestoes they promised no governments no regiments no revenues from whence emoluments might arise by perquisite or by grant in truth the tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowest of our species there is no trade so vile and mechanical as government in their hands virtue is not their habit they are out of themselves in any course of conduct recommended only by conscience and glory a large liberal and prospective view of the interests of states passes with them for romance and the principles that recommend it for the wanderings of a disordered imagination the calculators compute them out of their senses the jesters and buffoons shame them out of everything grand and elevated littleness in object and in means to them appears soundness and sobriety they think there is nothing worth pursuit but that which they can handle which they can measure with a twofoot rule which they can tell upon ten fingers  without the principles of the jacobins perhaps without any principles at all they played the game of that faction there was a beaten road before them the powers of europe were armed france had always appeared dangerous the war was easily diverted from france as a faction to france as a state the princes were easily taught to slide back into their old habitual course of politics they were easily led to consider the flames that were consuming france not as a warning to protect their own buildings which were without any partywall and linked by a contignation into the edifice of france but as a happy occasion for pillaging the goods and for carrying off the materials of their neighbours house their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes they carried on their new designs without seeming to abandon the principles of their old policy they pretended to seek or they flattered themselves that they sought in the accession of new fortresses and new territories a defensive security but the security wanted was against a kind of power which was not so truly dangerous in its fortresses nor in its territories as in its spirit and its principles they aimed or pretended to aim at defending themselves against a danger from which there can be no security in any defensive plan if armies and fortresses were a defence against jacobinism louis the sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over a happy people  this error obliged them even in their offensive operations to adopt a plan of war against the success of which there was something little short of mathematical demonstration they refused to take any step which might strike at the heart of affairs they seemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital part they acted through the whole as if they really wished the conservation of the jacobin power as what might be more favourable than the lawful government to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for they always kept on the circumference and the wider and remoter the circle was the more eagerly they chose it as their sphere of action in this centrifugal war the plan they pursued in its nature demanded great length of time in its execution they who went the nearest way to work were obliged to cover an incredible extent of country it left to the enemy every means of destroying this extended line of weakness ill success in any part was sure to defeat the effect of the whole this is true of austria it is still more true of england on this false plan even good fortune by further weakening the victor put him but the further off from his object  as long as there was any appearance of success the spirit of aggrandisement and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy seized upon all the coalesced powers some sought an accession of territory at the expense of france some at the expense of each other some at the expense of third parties and when the vicissitude of disaster took its turn they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and friendship the greatest skill conducting the greatest military apparatus has been employed but it has been worse than uselessly employed through the false policy of the war the operations of the field suffered by the errors of the cabinet if the same spirit continues when peace is made the peace will fix and perpetuate all the errors of the war because it will be made upon the same false principle what has been lost in the field in the field may be regained an arrangement of peace in its nature is a permanent settlement it is the effect of counsel and deliberation and not of fortuitous events if built upon a basis fundamentally erroneous it can only be retrieved by some of those unforeseen dispensations which the allwise but mysterious governor of the world sometimes interposes to snatch nations from ruin it would not be pious error but mad and impious presumption for any one to trust in an unknown order of dispensations in defiance of the rules of prudence which are formed upon the known march of the ordinary providence of god   national dignity  national dignity in all treaties i do admit is an important consideration they have given us a useful hint on that subject but dignity hitherto has belonged to the mode of proceeding not to the matter of a treaty never before has it been mentioned as the standard for rating the conditions of peace no never by the most violent of conquerors indemnification is capable of some estimate dignity has no standard it is impossible to guess what acquisitions pride and ambition may think fit for their dignity   principles of government not absolute but relative  i reprobate no form of government merely upon abstract principles there may be situations in which the purely democratic form will become necessary there may be some very few and very particularly circumstanced where it would be clearly desirable this i do not take to be the case of france or of any other great country until now we have seen no examples of considerable democracies the ancients were better acquainted with them not being wholly unread in the authors who had seen the most of those constitutions and who best understood them i cannot help concurring with their opinion that an absolute democracy no more than absolute monarchy is to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government they think it rather the corruption and degeneracy than the sound constitution of a republic if i recollect rightly aristotle observes that a democracy has many striking points of resemblance with a tyranny when i wrote this i quoted from memory after many years had elapsed from my reading the passage a learned friend has found it and it is as follows  to ethos to auto kai ampho despotika ton beltionon kai ta psephismata osper ekei ta epitagmata kai o demagogos kai o kolax oi autoi kai analogoi kai malista ekateroi par ekaterois ischuousin oi men kolakes para turannois oi de demagogoi para tois demois tois toioutois  the ethical character is the same both exercise despotism over the better class of citizens and decrees are in the one what ordinances and arrets are in the other the demagogue too and the court favourite are not unfrequently the same identical men and always bear a close analogy and these have the principal power each in their respective forms of government favourites with the absolute monarch and demagogues with a people such as i have describedarist politic lib iv cap 4  of this i am certain that in a democracy the majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority whenever strong divisions prevail in that kind of polity as they often must and that oppression of the minority will extend to far greater numbers and will be carried on with much greater fury than can almost ever be apprehended from the dominion of a single sceptre in such a popular persecution individual sufferers are in a much more deplorable condition than in any other under a cruel prince they have the balmy compassion of mankind to assuage the smart of their wounds they have the plaudits of the people to animate their generous constancy under their sufferings but those who are subjected to wrong under multitudes are deprived of all external consolation they seem deserted by mankind overpowered by a conspiracy of their whole species but admitting democracy not to have that inevitable tendency to party tyranny which i suppose it to have and admitting it to possess as much good in it when unmixed as i am sure it possesses when compounded with other forms does monarchy on its part contain nothing at all to recommend it i do not often quote bolingbroke nor have his works in general left any permanent impression on my mind he is a presumptuous and a superficial writer but he has one observation which in my opinion is not without depth and solidity he says that he prefers a monarchy to other governments because you can better ingraft any description of republic on a monarchy than anything of monarchy upon the republican forms i think him perfectly in the right the fact is so historically and it agrees well with the speculation  i know how easy a topic it is to dwell on the faults of departed greatness by a revolution in the state the fawning sycophant of yesterday is converted into the austere critic of the present hour but steady independent minds when they have an object of so serious a concern to mankind as government under their contemplation will disdain to assume the part of satirists and declaimers they will judge of human institutions as they do of human characters they will sort out the good from the evil which is mixed in mortal institutions as it is in mortal men   declaration of 1793  it is not difficult to discern what sort of humanity our government is to learn from these syren singers our government also i admit with some reason as a step towards the proposed fraternity is required to abjure the unjust hatred which it bears to this body of honour and virtue i thank god i am neither a minister nor a leader of opposition i protest i cannot do what they desire i could not do it if i were under the guillotine or as they ingeniously and pleasantly express it looking out of the little national window even at that opening i could receive none of their light i am fortified against all such affections by the declaration of the government which i must yet consider as lawful made on the 29th of october 1793 and still ringing in my ears  in their place has succeeded a system destructive of all public order maintained by proscriptions exiles and confiscations without number by arbitrary imprisonment by massacres which cannot be remembered without horror and at length by the execrable murder of a just and beneficent sovereign and of the illustrious princess who with an unshaken firmness has shared all the misfortunes of her royal consort his protracted sufferings his cruel captivity and ignominious death they the allies have had to encounter acts of aggression without pretext open violation of all treaties unprovoked declarations of war in a word whatever corruption intrigue or violence could effect for the purpose openly avowed of subverting all the institutions of society and of extending over all the nations of europe that confusion which has produced the misery of france this state of things cannot exist in france without involving all the surrounding powers in one common danger without giving them the right without imposing it upon them as a duty to stop the progress of an evil which exists only by the successive violation of all law and all property and which attacks the fundamental principles by which mankind is united in the bonds of civil societythe king would impose none other than equitable and moderate conditions not such as the expense the risks and the sacrifices of the war might justify but such as his majesty thinks himself under the indispensable necessity of requiring with a view to these considerations and still more to that of his own security and of the future tranquillity of europe his majesty desires nothing more sincerely than thus to terminate a war which he in vain endeavoured to avoid and all the calamities of which as now experienced by france are to be attributed only to the ambition the perfidy and the violence of those whose crimes have involved their own country in misery and disgraced all civilized nationsthe king promises on his part the suspension of hostilities friendship and as far as the course of events will allow of which the will of man cannot dispose security and protection to all those who by declaring for a monarchical form of government shall shake off the yoke of sanguinary anarchy of that anarchy which has broken all the most sacred bonds of society dissolved all the relations of civil life violated every right confounded every duty which uses the name of liberty to exercise the most cruel tyranny to annihilate all property to seize on all possessions which founds its power on the pretended consent of the people and itself carries fire and sword through extensive provinces for having demanded their laws their religion and their lawful sovereign  declaration sent by his majestys command to the commanders of his majestys fleets and armies employed against france and to his majestys ministers employed at foreign courts  this declaration was transmitted not only to our commanders by sea and land but to our ministers in every court of europe it is the most eloquent and highlyfinished in the style the most judicious in the choice of topics the most orderly in the arrangement and the most rich in the colouring without employing the smallest degree of exaggeration of any state paper that has ever yet appeared an ancient writer plutarch i think it is quotes some verses on the eloquence of pericles who is called the only orator that left stings in the minds of his hearers like his the eloquence of the declaration not contradicting but enforcing sentiments of the truest humanity has left stings that have penetrated more than skindeep into my mind and never can they be extracted by all the surgery of murder never can the throbbings they have created be assuaged by all the emolient cataplasms of robbery and confiscation i cannot love the republic   moral diet  to diet a man into weakness and languor afterwards to give him the greater strength has more of the empiric than the rational physician it is true that some persons have been kicked into courage and this is no bad hint to give to those who are too forward and liberal in bestowing insults and outrages on their passive companions but such a course does not at first view appear a wellchosen discipline to form men to a nice sense of honour or a quick resentment of injuries a long habit of humiliation does not seem a very good preparative to manly and vigorous sentiment it may not leave perhaps enough of energy in the mind fairly to discern what are good terms or what are not men low and dispirited may regard those terms as not at all amiss which in another state of mind they would think intolerable if they grow peevish in this state of mind they may be roused not against the enemy whom they have been taught to fear but against the ministry who are more within their reach and who have refused conditions that are not unreasonable from power that they have been taught to consider as irresistible   king williams policy  his majesty did determine and did take and pursue his resolution in all the tottering imbecility of a new government and with parliament totally unmanageable he persevered he persevered to expel the fears of his people by his fortitudeto steady their fickleness by his constancyto expand their narrow prudence by his enlarged wisdomto sink their factious temper in his public spirit in spite of his people he resolved to make them great and glorious to make england inclined to shrink into her narrow self the arbitress of europe the tutelary angel of the human race in spite of the ministers who staggered under the weight that his mind imposed upon theirs unsupported as they felt themselves by the popular spirit he infused into them his own soul he renewed in them their ancient heart he rallied them in the same cause it required some time to accomplish this work the people were first gained and through them their distracted representatives under the influence of king william holland had rejected the allurements of every seduction and had resisted the terrors of every menace with hannibal at her gates she had nobly and magnanimously refused all separate treaty or anything which might for a moment appear to divide her affection or her interest or even to distinguish her in identity from england having settled the great point of the consolidation which he hoped would be eternal of the countries made for a common interest and common sentiment the king in his message to both houses calls their attention to the affairs of the statesgeneral the house of lords was perfectly sound and entirely impressed with the wisdom and dignity of the kings proceedings in answer to the message which you will observe was narrowed to a single point the danger of the statesgeneral after the usual professions of zeal for his service the lords opened themselves at large they go far beyond the demands of the message they express themselves as follows we take this occasion further to assure your majesty that we are sensible of the great and imminent danger to which the statesgeneral are exposed and we perfectly agree with them in believing that their safety and ours are so inseparably united that whatsoever is ruin to the one must be fatal to the other  we humbly desire your majesty will be pleased not only to made good all the articles of any former treaties to the statesgeneral but that you will enter into a strict league offensive and defensive with them for their common preservation and that you will invite into it all princes and states who are concerned in the present visible danger arising from the union of france and spain  and we further desire your majesty that you will be pleased to enter into such alliances with the emperor as your majesty shall think fit pursuant to the ends of the treaty of 1689 towards all which we assure your majesty of our hearty and sincere assistance not doubting but whenever your majesty shall be obliged to be engaged for the defence of your allies and securing the liberty and quiet of europe almighty god will protect your sacred person in so righteous a cause and that the unanimity wealth and courage of your subjects will carry your majesty with honour and success through all the difficulties of a just war  the house of commons was more reserved the late popular disposition was still in a great degree prevalent in the representative after it had been made to change in the constituent body the principle of the grand alliance was not directly recognised in the resolution of the commons nor the war announced though they were well aware the alliance was formed for the war however compelled by the returning sense of the people they went so far as to fix the three great immovable pillars of the safety and greatness of england as they were then as they are now and as they must ever be to the end of time they asserted in general terms the necessity of supporting holland of keeping united with our allies and maintaining the liberty of europe though they restricted their vote to the succours stipulated by actual treaty but now they were fairly embarked they were obliged to go with the course of the vessel and the whole nation split before into a hundred adverse factions with a king at its head evidently declining to his tomb the whole nation lords commons and people proceeded as one body informed by one soul under the british union the union of europe was consolidated and it long held together with a degree of cohesion firmness and fidelity not known before or since in any political combination of that extent  just as the last hand was given to this immense and complicated machine the master workman died but the work was formed on true mechanical principles and it was as truly wrought it went by the impulse it had received from the first mover the man was dead but the grand alliance survived in which king william lived and reigned that heartless and dispirited people whom lord somers had represented about two years before as dead in energy and operation continued that war to which it was supposed they were unequal in mind and in means for nearly thirteen years for what have i entered into all this detail to what purpose have i recalled your view to the end of the last century it has been done to show that the british nation was then a great peopleto point out how and by what means they came to be exalted above the vulgar level and to take that lead which they assumed among mankind to qualify us for that preeminence we had then a high mind and a constancy unconquerable we were then inspired with no flashy passions but such as were durable as well as warm such as corresponded to the great interests we had at stake this force of character was inspired as all such spirit must ever be from above government gave the impulse as well may we fancy that of itself the sea will swell and that without winds the billows will insult the adverse shore as that the gross mass of the people will be moved and elevated and continue by a steady and permanent direction to bear upon one point without the influence of superior authority or superior mind  this impulse ought in my opinion to have been given in this war and it ought to have been continued to it at every instant it is made if ever war was made to touch all the great springs of action in the human breast it ought not to have been a war of apology the minister had in this conflict wherewithal to glory in success to be consoled in adversity to hold high his principle in all fortunes if it were not given him to support the falling edifice he ought to bury himself under the ruins of the civilized world all the art of greece and all the pride and power of eastern monarchs never heaped upon their ashes so grand a monument   distemper of remedy  this distemper of remedy grown habitual relaxes and wears out by a vulgar and prostituted use the spring of that spirit which is to be exerted on great occasions it was in the most patient period of roman servitude that themes of tyrannicide made the ordinary exercise of boys at schoolcum perimit saevos classis numerosa tyrannos in the ordinary state of things it produces in a country like ours the worst effects even on the cause of that liberty which it abuses with the dissoluteness of an extravagant speculation almost all the highbred republicans of my time have after a short space become the most decided thoroughpaced courtiers they soon left the business of a tedious moderate but practical resistance to those of us whom in the pride and intoxication of their theories they have slighted as not much better than tories hypocrisy of course delights in the most sublime speculations for never intending to go beyond speculation it costs nothing to have it magnificent but even in cases where rather levity than fraud was to be suspected in these ranting speculations the issue has been much the same these professors finding their extreme principles not applicable to cases which call only for a qualified or as i may say civil and legal resistance in such cases employ no resistance at all it is with them a war or a revolution or it is nothing finding their schemes of politics not adapted to the state of the world in which they live they often come to think lightly of all public principle and are ready on their part to abandon for a very trivial interest what they find of very trivial value some indeed are of more steady and persevering natures but these are eager politicians out of parliament who have little to tempt them to abandon their favourite projects they have some change in the church or state or both constantly in their view when that is the case they are always bad citizens and perfectly unsure connections for considering their speculative designs as of infinite value and the actual arrangement of the state as of no estimation they are at best indifferent about it they see no merit in the good and no fault in the vicious management of public affairs they rather rejoice in the latter as more propitious to revolution they see no merit or demerit in any man or any action or any political principle any further than as they may forward or retard their design of change they therefore take up one day the most violent and stretched prerogative and another time the wildest democratic ideas of freedom and pass from the one to the other without any sort of regard to cause to person or to party   war and will of the people  in matters of state a constitutional competence to act is in many cases the smallest part of the question without disputing god forbid i should dispute the sole competence of the king and the parliament each in its province to decide on war and peace i venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people this war in particular cannot be carried on unless they are enthusiastically in favour of it acquiescence will not do there must be zeal universal zeal in such a cause and at such a time as this is cannot be looked for neither is it necessary zeal in the larger part carries the force of the whole without this no government certainly not our government is capable of a great war none of the ancient regular governments have wherewithal to fight abroad with a foreign foe and at home to overcome repining reluctance and chicane it must be some portentous thing like regicide france that can exhibit such a prodigy yet even she the mother of monsters more prolific than the country of old called ferax monstrorum shows symptoms of being almost effete already and she will be so unless the fallow of a peace comes to recruit her fertility but whatever may be represented concerning the meanness of the popular spirit i for one do not think so desperately of the british nation our minds as i said are light but they are not depraved we are dreadfully open to delusion and to dejection but we are capable of being animated and undeceived  it cannot be concealed we are a divided people but in divisions where a part is to be taken we are to make a muster of our strength i have often endeavoured to compute and to class those who in any political view are to be called the people without doing something of this sort we must proceed absurdly we should not be much wiser if we pretended to very great accuracy in our estimate but i think in the calculation i have made the error cannot be very material in england and scotland i compute that those of adult age not declining in life of tolerable leisure for such discussions and of some means of information more or less and who are above menial dependence or what virtually is such may amount to about four hundred thousand there is such a thing as a natural representative of the people this body is that representative and on this body more than on the legal constituent the artificial representative depends this is the british public and it is a public very numerous the rest when feeble are the objects of protection when strong the means of force they who affect to consider that part of us in any other light insult while they cajole us they do not want us for counsellors in deliberation but to list us as soldiers for battle  of these four hundred thousand political citizens i look upon onefifth or about eighty thousand to be pure jacobins utterly incapable of amendment objects of eternal vigilance and when they break out of legal constraint on these no reason no argument no example no venerable authority can have the slightest influence they desire a change and they will have it if they can if they cannot have it by english cabal they will make no sort of scruple of having it by the cabal of france into which already they are virtually incorporated it is only their assured and confident expectation of the advantages of french fraternity and the approaching blessings of regicide intercourse that skins over their mischievous dispositions with a momentary quiet this minority is great and formidable i do not know whether if i aimed at the total overthrow of a kingdom i should wish to be encumbered with a larger body of partisans they are more easily disciplined and directed than if the number were greater these by their spirit of intrigue and by their restless agitating activity are of a force far superior to their numbers and if times grew the least critical have the means of debauching or intimidating many of those who are now sound as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more passive part of the nation this minority is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace or for war or for any object they are led vehemently to desire by passing from place to place with a velocity incredible and diversifying their character and description they are capable of mimicking the general voice we must not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noise of the acclamation   false policy in our french war    we have never put forth half the strength which we have exerted in ordinary wars in the fatal battles which have drenched the continent with blood and shaken the system of europe to pieces we have never had any considerable army of a magnitude to be compared to the least of those by which in former times we so gloriously asserted our place as protectors not oppressors at the head of the great commonwealth of europe we have never manfully met the danger in front and when the enemy resigning to us our natural dominion of the ocean and abandoning the defence of his distant possessions to the infernal energy of the destroying principles which he had planted there for the subversion of the neighbouring colonies drove forth by one sweeping law of unprecedented despotism his armed multitudes on every side to overwhelm the countries and states which had for centuries stood the firm barriers against the ambition of france we drew back the arm of our military force which had never been more than half raised to oppose him from that time we have been combating only with the other arm of our naval power the right arm of england i admit but which struck almost unresisted with blows that could never reach the heart of the hostile mischief from that time without a single effort to regain those outworks which ever till now we so strenuously maintained as the strong frontier of our own dignity and safety no less than the liberties of europe with but one feeble attempt to succour those brave faithful and numerous allies whom for the first time since the days of our edwards and henrys we now have in the bosom of france itself we have been intrenching and fortifying and garrisoning ourselves at home we have been redoubling security on security to protect ourselves from invasion which has now become to us a serious object of alarm and terror alas the few of us who have protracted life in any measure near to the extreme limits of our short period have been condemned to see strange things new systems of policy new principles and not only new men but what might appear a new species of men i believe that any person who was of age to take a part in public affairs forty years ago if the intermediate space of time were expunged from his memory would hardly credit his senses when he should hear from the highest authority that an army of two hundred thousand men was kept up in this island and that in the neighbouring island there were at least fourscore thousand more but when he had recovered from his surprise on being told of this army which has not its parallel what must be his astonishment to be told again that this mighty force was kept up for the mere purpose of an inert and passive defence and that in its far greater part it was disabled by its constitution and very essence from defending us against an enemy by any one preventive stroke or any one operation of active hostility what must his reflections be on learning further that a fleet of five hundred men of war the best appointed and to the full as ably commanded as any this country ever had upon the sea was for the greater part employed in carrying on the same system of unenterprising defence  what must be the sentiments and feelings of one who remembers the former energy of england when he is given to understand that these two islands with their extensive and everywhere vulnerable coast should be considered as a garrisoned seatown what would such a man what would any man think if the garrison of so strange a fortress should be such and so feebly commanded as never to make a sally and that contrary to all which has hitherto been seen in war an infinitely inferior army with the shattered relics of an almost annihilated navy ill found and ill manned may with safety besiege this superior garrison and without hazarding the life of a man ruin the place merely by the menaces and false appearances of an attack indeed indeed my dear friend i look upon this matter of our defensive system as much the most important of all considerations at this moment it has oppressed me with many anxious thoughts which more than any bodily distemper have sunk me to the condition in which you know that i am should it please providence to restore to me even the late weak remains of my strength i propose to make this matter the subject of a particular discussion i only mean here to argue that the mode of conducting the war on our part be it good or bad has prevented even the common havoc of war in our population and especially among that class whose duty and privilege of superiority it is to lead the way amidst the perils and slaughter of the field of battle   moral essence makes a nation  mere locality does not constitute a body politic had cade and his gang got possession of london they would not have been the lord mayor aldermen and common council the body politic of france existed in the majesty of its throne in the dignity of its nobility in the honour of its gentry in the sanctity of its clergy in the reverence of its magistracy in the weight and consideration due to its landed property in the several bailliages in the respect due to its moveable substance represented by the corporations of the kingdom all these particular moleculae united form the great mass of what is truly the body politic in all countries they are so many deposits and receptacles of justice because they can only exist by justice nation is a moral essence not a geographical arrangement or a denomination of the nomenclator france though out of her territorial possession exists because the sole possible claimant i mean the proprietary and the government to which the proprietary adheres exists and claims god forbid that if you were expelled from your house by ruffians and assassins that i should call the material walls doors and windows of  the ancient and honourable family of  am i to transfer to the intruders who not content to turn you out naked to the world would rob you of your very name all the esteem and respect i owe to you the regicides in france are not france france is out of her bounds but the kingdom is the same   public spirit    other great states having been without any regular certain course of elevation or decline we may hope that the british fortune may fluctuate also because the public mind which greatly influences that fortune may have its changes we are therefore never authorised to abandon our country to its fate or to act or advise as if it had no resource there is no reason to apprehend because ordinary means threaten to fail that no others can spring up whilst our heart is whole it will find means or make them the heart of the citizen is a perennial spring of energy to the state because the pulse seems to intermit we must not presume that it will cease instantly to beat the public must never be regarded as incurable i remember in the beginning of what has lately been called the seven years war that an eloquent writer and ingenious speculator dr brown upon some reverses which happened in the beginning of that war published an elaborate philosophical discourse to prove that the distinguishing features of the people of england have been totally changed and that a frivolous effeminacy was become the national character nothing could be more popular than that work it was thought a great consolation to us the light people of this country who were and are light but who were not and are not effeminate that we had found the causes of our misfortunes in our vices pythagoras could not be more pleased with his leading discovery but whilst in that splenetic mood we amused ourselves in a sour critical speculation of which we were ourselves the objects and in which every man lost his particular sense of the public disgrace in the epidemic nature of the distemper whilst as in the alps goitre i circumflex kept goitre i acute in countenance whilst we were thus abandoning ourselves to a direct confession of our inferiority to france and whilst many very many were ready to act upon a sense of that inferiority a few months effected a total change in our variable minds we emerged from the gulf of that speculative despondency and were buoyed up to the highest point of practical vigour never did the masculine spirit of england display itself with more energy nor ever did its genius soar with a prouder preeminence over france than at the time when frivolity and effeminacy had been at least tacitly acknowledged as their national character by the good people of this kingdom   progressive growth of christian states  when i contemplate the scheme on which france is formed and when i compare it with these systems with which it is and ever must be in conflict those things which seem as defects in her polity are the very things which make me tremble the states of the christian world have grown up to their present magnitude in a great length of time and by a great variety of accidents they have been improved to what we see them with greater or less degrees of felicity and skill not one of them has been formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of design as their constitutions are not systematical they have not been directed to any peculiar end eminently distinguished and superseding every other the objects which they embrace are of the greatest possible variety and have become in a manner infinite in all these old countries the state has been made to the people and not the people conformed to the state every state has pursued not only every sort of social advantage but it has cultivated the welfare of every individual his wants his wishes even his tastes have been consulted this comprehensive scheme virtually produced a degree of personal liberty in forms the most adverse to it that liberty was found under monarchies styled absolute in a degree unknown to the ancient commonwealths from hence the powers of all our modern states meet in all their movements with some obstruction it is therefore no wonder that when these states are to be considered as machines to operate for some one great end this dissipated and balanced force is not easily concentrated or made to bear with the whole force of the nation upon one point  the british state is without question that which pursues the greatest variety of ends and is the least disposed to sacrifice any one of them to another or to the whole it aims at taking in the entire circle of human desires and securing for them their fair enjoyment our legislature has been ever closely connected in its most efficient part with individual feeling and individual interest personal liberty the most lively of these feelings and the most important of these interests which in other european countries has rather arisen from the system of manners and the habitudes of life than from the laws of the state in which it flourished more from neglect than attention in england has been a direct object of government  on this principle england would be the weakest power in the whole system fortunately however the great riches of this kingdom arising from a variety of causes and the disposition of the people which is as great to spend as to accumulate has easily afforded a disposable surplus that gives a mighty momentum to the state this difficulty with these advantages to overcome it has called forth the talents of the english financiers who by the surplus of industry poured out by prodigality have outdone everything which has been accomplished in other nations the present minister has outdone his predecessors and as a minister of revenue is far above my power of praise but still there are cases in which england feels more than several others though they all feel the perplexity of an immense body of balanced advantages and of individual demands and of some irregularity in the whole mass  france differs essentially from all those governments which are formed without system which exist by habit and which are confused with the multitude and with the perplexity of their pursuits what now stands as government in france is struck out at a heat the design is wicked immoral impious oppressive but it is spirited and daring it is systematic it is simple in its principle it has unity and consistency in perfection   petty interests  it is undoubtedly the business of ministers very much to consult the inclinations of the people but they ought to take great care that they do not receive that inclination from the few persons who may happen to approach them the petty interests of such gentlemen the low conceptions of things their fears arising from the danger to which the very arduous and critical situation of public affairs may expose their places their apprehensions from the hazards to which the discontents of a few popular men at elections may expose their seats in parliament all these causes trouble and confuse the representations which they make to ministers of the real temper of the nation if ministers instead of following the great indications of the constitution proceed on such reports they will take the whispers of a cabal for the voice of the people and the counsels of imprudent timidity for the wisdom of a nation   pius vii    it is not for his holiness we intend this consolatory declaration of our own weakness and of the tyrannous temper of his grand enemy that prince has known both the one and the other from the beginning the artists of the french revolution had given their very first essays and sketches of robbery and desolation against his territories in a far more cruel murdering piece than had ever entered into the imagination of painter or poet without ceremony they tore from his cherishing arms the possessions which he held for five hundred years undisturbed by all the ambition of all the ambitious monarchs who during that period have reigned in france is it to him in whose wrong we have in our late negotiation ceded his now unhappy countries near the rhone lately amongst the most flourishing perhaps the most flourishing for their extent of all the countries upon earth that we are to prove the sincerity of our resolution to make peace with the republic barbarism that venerable potentate and pontiff is sunk deep into the vale of years he is half disarmed by his peaceful character his dominions are more than half disarmed by a peace of two hundred years defended as they were not by forces but by reverence yet in all these straits we see him display amidst the recent ruins and the new defacements of his plundered capital along with the mild and decorated piety of the modern all the spirit and magnanimity of ancient rome does he who though himself unable to defend them nobly refused to receive pecuniary compensations for the protection he owed to his people of avignon carpentras and the venaisindoes he want proofs of our good disposition to deliver over that people without any security for them or any compensation to their sovereign to this cruel enemy does he want to be satisfied of the sincerity of our humiliation to france who has seen his free fertile and happy city and state of bologna the cradle of regenerated law the seat of sciences and of arts so hideously metamorphosed whilst he was crying to great britain for aid and offering to purchase that aid at any price is it him who sees that chosen spot of plenty and delight converted into a jacobin ferocious republic dependent on the homicides of france is it him who from the miracles of his beneficent industry has done a work which defied the power of the roman emperors though with an enthralled world to labour for them is it him who has drained and cultivated the pontine marshes that we are to satisfy of our cordial spirit of conciliation with those who in their equity are restoring holland again to the seas whose maxims poison more than the exhalations of the most deadly fens and who turn all the fertilities of nature and of art into a howling desert is it to him that we are to demonstrate the good faith of our submissions to the cannibal republic to him who is commanded to deliver into their hands ancona and civita vecchia seats of commerce raised by the wise and liberal labours and expenses of the present and late pontiffs ports not more belonging to the ecclesiastical state than to the commerce of great britain thus wresting from his hands the power of the keys of the centre of italy as before they had taken possession of the keys of the northern part from the hands of the unhappy king of sardinia the natural ally of england  is it to him we are to prove our good faith in the peace which we are soliciting to receive from the hands of his and our robbers the enemies of all arts all sciences all civilization and all commerce   extinction of local patriotism  that day was i fear the fatal term of local patriotism on that day i fear there was an end of that narrow scheme of relations called our country with all its pride its prejudices and its partial affections all the little quiet rivulets that watered an humble a contracted but not an unfruitful field are to be lost in the waste expanse and boundless barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of france it is no longer an object of terror the aggrandizement of a new power which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair whilst it propagates by arms and establishes by conquest the comprehensive system of universal fraternity in what light is all this viewed in a great assembly the party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connections with the metropolis of that fraternity that reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject the display of those horrors that must attend the existence of a power with such dispositions and principles seated in the heart of europe it is satisfied to find some loose ambiguous expressions in its former declarations which may set it free from its professions and engagements it always speaks of peace with the regicides as a great and an undoubted blessing and such a blessing as if obtained promises as much as any human disposition of things can promise security and permanence it holds out nothing at all definite towards this security it only seeks by a restoration to some of their former owners of some fragments of the general wreck of europe to find a plausible plea for a present retreat from an embarrassing position as to the future that party is content to leave it covered in a night of the most palpable obscurity it never once has entered into a particle of detail of what our own situation or that of other powers must be under the blessings of the peace we seek this defect to my power i mean to supply that if any persons should still continue to think an attempt at foresight is any part of the duty of a statesman i may contribute my trifle to the materials of his speculation  as to the other party the minority of today possibly the majority of tomorrow small in number but full of talents and every species of energy which upon the avowed ground of being more acceptable to france is a candidate for the helm of this kingdom it has never changed from the beginning it has preserved a perennial consistency this would be a neverfailing source of true glory if springing from just and right but it is truly dreadful if it be an arm of styx which springs out of the profoundest depths of a poisoned soil the french maxims were by these gentlemen at no time condemned i speak of their language in the most moderate terms there are many who think that they have gone much further that they have always magnified and extolled the french maxims that not in the least disgusted or discouraged by the monstrous evils which have attended these maxims from the moment of their adoption both at home and abroad they still continue to predict that in due time they must produce the greatest good to the poor human race they obstinately persist in stating those evils as matter of accident as things wholly collateral to the system it is observed that this party has never spoken of an ally of great britain with the smallest degree of respect or regard on the contrary it has generally mentioned them under opprobrious appellations and in such terms of contempt or execration as never had been heard before because no such would have formerly been permitted in our public assemblies the moment however that any of those allies quitted this obnoxious connection the party has instantly passed an act of indemnity and oblivion in their favour after this no sort of censure on their conduct no imputation on their character from that moment their pardon was sealed in a reverential and mysterious silence with the gentlemen of this minority there is no ally from one end of europe to the other with whom we ought not to be ashamed to act the whole college of the states of europe is no better than a gang of tyrants with them all our connexions were broken off at once we ought to have cultivated france and france alone from the moment of her revolution on that happy change all our dread of that nation as a power was to cease she became in an instant dear to our affections and one with our interests all other nations we ought to have commanded not to trouble her sacred throes whilst in labour to bring into a happy birth her abundant litter of constitutions   walpole and his policy  there has not been in this century any foreign peace or war in its origin the fruit of popular desire except the war that was made with spain in 1739 sir robert walpole was forced into the war by the people who were inflamed to this measure by the most leading politicians by the first orators and the greatest poets of the time for that war pope sung his dying notes for that war johnson in more energetic strains employed the voice of his early genius for that war glover distinguished himself in the way in which his muse was the most natural and happy the crowd readily followed the politicians in the cry for a war which threatened little bloodshed and which promised victories that were attended with something more solid than glory a war with spain was a war of plunder in the present conflict with regicide mr pitt has not hitherto had nor will perhaps for a few days have many prizes to hold out in the lottery of war to attempt the lower part of our character he can only maintain it by an appeal to the higher and to those in whom that higher part is the most predominant he must look the most for his support whilst he holds out no inducements to the wise nor bribes to the avaricious he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace ten times more ruinous than the most disastrous war the weaker he is in the fund of motives which apply to our avarice to our laziness and to our lassitude if he means to carry the war to any end at all the stronger he ought to be in his addresses to our magnanimity and to our reason  in stating that walpole was driven by a popular clamour into a measure not to be justified i do not mean wholly to excuse his conduct my time of observation did not exactly coincide with that event but i read much of the controversies then carried on several years after the contests of parties had ceased the people were amused and in a degree warmed with them the events of that era seemed then of magnitude which the revolutions of our time have reduced to parochial importance and the debates which then shook the nation now appear of no higher moment than a discussion in a vestry when i was very young a general fashion told me i was to admire some of the writings against that minister a little more maturity taught me as much to despise them i observed one fault in his general proceeding he never manfully put forward the entire strength of his cause he temporised he managed and adopting very nearly the sentiments of his adversaries he opposed their inferences this for a political commander is the choice of a weak post his adversaries had the better of the argument as he handled it not as the reason and justice of his cause enabled him to manage it i say this after having seen and with some care examined the original documents concerning certain important transactions of those times they perfectly satisfied me of the extreme injustice of that war and of the falsehood of the colours which to his own ruin and guided by a mistaken policy he suffered to be daubed over that measure some years after it was my fortune to converse with many of the principal actors against that minister and with those who principally excited that clamour none of them no not one did in the least defend the measure or attempt to justify their conduct they condemned it as freely as they would have done in commenting upon any proceeding in history in which they were totally unconcerned thus it will be they who stir up the people to improper desires whether of peace or war will be condemned by themselves they who weakly yield to them will be condemned by history   political peace  how a question of peace can be discussed without having them in view i cannot imagine if you or others see a way out of these difficulties i am happy i see indeed a fund from whence equivalents will be proposed i see it but i cannot just now touch it it is a question of high moment it opens another iliad of woes to europe  such is the time proposed for making a common political peace to which no one circumstance is propitious as to the grand principle of the peace it is left as if by common consent wholly out of the question  viewing things in this light i have frequently sunk into a degree of despondency and dejection hardly to be described yet out of the profoundest depths of this despair an impulse which i have in vain endeavoured to resist has urged me to raise one feeble cry against this unfortunate coalition which is formed at home in order to make a coalition with france subversive of the whole ancient order of the world no disaster of war no calamity of season could ever strike me with half the horror which i felt from what is introduced to us by this junction of parties under the soothing name of peace we are apt to speak of a low and pusillanimous spirit as the ordinary cause by which dubious wars terminated in humiliating treaties it is here the direct contrary i am perfectly astonished at the boldness of character at the intrepidity of mind the firmness of nerve in those who are able with deliberation to face the perils of jacobin fraternity  this fraternity is indeed so terrible in its nature and in its manifest consequences that there is no way of quieting our apprehensions about it but by totally putting it out of sight by substituting for it through a sort of periphrasis something of an ambiguous quality and describing such a connection under the terms of the usual relations of peace and amity by this means the proposed fraternity is hustled in the crowd of those treaties which imply no change in the public law of europe and which do not upon system affect the interior condition of nations it is confounded with those conventions in which matters of dispute among sovereign powers are compromised by the taking off a duty more or less by the surrender of a frontier town or a disputed district on the one side or the other by pactions in which the pretensions of families are settled as by a conveyancer making family substitutions and successions without any alterations in the laws manners religion privileges and customs of the cities or territories which are the subject of such arrangements  all this body of old conventions composing the vast and voluminous collection called the corps diplomatique forms the code or statute law as the methodised reasonings of the great publicists and jurists form the digest and jurisprudence of the christian world in these treasures are to be found the usual relations of peace and amity in civilized europe and there the relations of ancient france were to be found amongst the rest  the present system in france is not the ancient france it is not the ancient france with ordinary ambition and ordinary means it is not a new power of an old kind it is a new power of a new species when such a questionable shape is to be admitted for the first time into the brotherhood of christendom it is not a mere matter of idle curiosity to consider how far it is in its nature alliable with the rest or whether the relations of peace and amity with this new state are likely to be of the same nature with the usual relations of the states of europe   public loans  it is never therefore wise to quarrel with the interested views of men whilst they are combined with the public interest and promote it it is our business to tie the knot if possible closer resources that are derived from extraordinary virtues as such virtues are rare so they must be unproductive it is a good thing for a monied man to pledge his property on the welfare of his country he shows that he places his treasure where his heart is and revolving in this circle we know that wherever a mans treasure is there his heart will be also for these reasons and on these principles i have been sorry to see the attempts which have been made with more good meaning than foresight and consideration towards raising the annual interest of this loan by private contributions wherever a regular revenue is established there voluntary contribution can answer no purpose but to disorder and disturb it in its course to recur to such aids is for so much to dissolve the community and to return to a state of unconnected nature and even if such a supply should be productive in a degree commensurate to its object it must also be productive of much vexation and much oppression either the citizens by the proposed duties pay their proportion according to some rate made by public authority or they do not if the law be well made and the contributions founded on just proportions everything superadded by something that is not as regular as law and as uniform in its operation will become more or less out of proportion if on the contrary the law be not made upon proper calculation it is a disgrace to the public wisdom which fails in skill to assess the citizen in just measure and according to his means but the hand of authority is not always the most heavy hand it is obvious that men may be oppressed by many ways besides those which take their course from the supreme power of the state suppose the payment to be wholly discretionary whatever has its origin in caprice is sure not to improve in its progress nor to end in reason it is impossible for each private individual to have any measure conformable to the particular condition of each of his fellowcitizens or to the general exigencies of his country tis a random shot at best  when men proceed in this irregular mode the first contributor is apt to grow peevish with his neighbours he is but too well disposed to measure their means by his own envy and not by the real state of their fortunes which he can rarely know and which it may in them be an act of the grossest imprudence to reveal hence the odium and lassitude with which people will look upon a provision for the public which is bought by discord at the expense of social quiet hence the bitter heartburnings and the war of tongues which is so often the prelude to other wars nor is it every contribution called voluntary which is according to the free will of the giver a false shame or a false glory against his feelings and his judgment may tax an individual to the detriment of his family and in wrong of his creditors a pretence of public spirit may disable him from the performance of his private duties it may disable him even from paying the legitimate contributions which he is to furnish according to the prescript of the law but what is the most dangerous of all is that malignant disposition to which this mode of contribution evidently tends and which at length leaves the comparatively indigent to judge of the wealth and to prescribe to the opulent or those whom they conceive to be such the use they are to make of their fortunes from thence it is but one step to the subversion of all property   historical strictures    the author does not confine the benefit of the regicide lesson to kings alone he has a diffusive bounty nobles and men of property will likewise be greatly reformed they too will be led to a review of their social situation and duties and will reflect that their large allotment of worldly advantages is for the aid and benefit of the whole is it then from the fate of juignie archbishop of paris or of the cardinal de rochefoucault and of so many others who gave their fortunes and i may say their very beings to the poor that the rich are to learn that their fortunes are for the aid and benefit of the whole i say nothing of the liberal persons of great rank and property lay and ecclesiastic men and women to whom we have had the honour and happiness of affording an asylumi pass by these lest i should never have done or lest i should omit some as deserving as any i might mention why will the author then suppose that the nobles and men of property in france have been banished confiscated and murdered on account of the savageness and ferocity of their character and their being tainted with vices beyond those of the same order and description in other countries no judge of a revolutionary tribunal with his hands dipped in their blood and his maw gorged with their property has yet dared to assert what this author has been pleased by way of a moral lesson to insinuate  their nobility and their men of property in a mass had the very same virtues and the very same vices and in the very same proportions with the same description of men in this and in other nations i must do justice to suffering honour generosity and integrity i do not know that any time or any country has furnished more splendid examples of every virtue domestic and public i do not enter into the councils of providence but humanly speaking many of these nobles and men of property from whose disastrous fate we are it seems to learn a general softening of character and a revision of our social situations and duties appear to me full as little deserving of that fate as the author whoever he is can be many of them i am sure were such as i should be proud indeed to be able to compare myself with in knowledge in integrity and in every other virtue my feeble nature might shrink though theirs did not from the proof but my reason and my ambition tell me that it would be a good bargain to purchase their merits with their fate  for which of his vices did that great magistrate despremenil lose his fortune and his head what were the abominations of malesherbes that other excellent magistrate whose sixty years of uniform virtue was acknowledged in the very act of his murder by the judicial butchers who condemned him on account of what misdemeanors was he robbed of his property and slaughtered with two generations of his offspring and the remains of the third race with a refinement of cruelty and lest they should appear to reclaim the property forfeited by the virtues of their ancestor confounded in an hospital with the thousands of those unhappy foundling infants who are abandoned without relation and without name by the wretchedness or by the profligacy of their parents  is the fate of the queen of france to produce this softening of character was she a person so very ferocious and cruel as by the example of her death to frighten us into common humanity is there no way to teach the emperor a softening of character and a review of his social situation and duty but his consent by an infamous accord with regicide to drive a second coach with the austrian arms through the streets of paris along which after a series of preparatory horrors exceeding the atrocities of the bloody execution itself the glory of the imperial race had been carried to an ignominious death is this a lesson of moderation to a descendant of maria theresa drawn from the fate of the daughter of that incomparable woman and sovereign if he learns this lesson from such an object and from such teachers the man may remain but the king is deposed if he does not carry quite another memory of that transaction in the inmost recesses of his heart he is unworthy to reign he is unworthy to live in the chronicle of disgrace he will have but this short tale told of him he was the first emperor of his house that embraced a regicide he was the last that wore the imperial purplefar am i from thinking so ill of this august sovereign who is at the head of the monarchies of europe and who is the trustee of their dignities and his own what ferocity of character drew on the fate of elizabeth the sister of king louis the sixteenth for which of the vices of that pattern of benevolence of piety and of all the virtues did they put her to death for which of her vices did they put to death the mildest of all human creatures the duchess of biron what were the crimes of those crowds of matrons and virgins of condition whom they massacred with their juries of blood in prisons and on scaffolds what were the enormities of the infant king whom they caused by lingering tortures to perish in their dungeon and whom if at last they despatched by poison it was in that detestable crime the only act of mercy they have ever shown  what softening of character is to be had what review of their social situations and duties is to be taught by these examples to kings to nobles to men of property to women and to infants the royal family perished because it was royal the nobles perished because they were noble the men women and children who had property because they had property to be robbed of the priests were punished after they had been robbed of their all not for their vices but for their virtues and their piety which made them an honour to their sacred profession and to that nature of which we ought to be proud since they belong to it my lord nothing can be learned from such examples except the danger of being kings queens nobles priests and children to be butchered on account of their inheritance these are things at which not vice not crime not folly but wisdom goodness learning justice probity beneficence stand aghast by these examples our reason and our moral sense are not enlightened but confounded and there is no refuge for astonished and affrighted virtue but being annihilated in humility and submission sinking into a silent adoration of the inscrutable dispensations of providence and flying with trembling wings from this world of daring crimes and feeble pusillanimous halfbred bastard justice to the asylum of another order of things in an unknown form but in a better life  whatever the politician or preacher of september or of october may think of the matter it is a most comfortless disheartening desolating example dreadful is the example of ruined innocence and virtue and the completest triumph of the completest villainy that ever vexed and disgraced mankind the example is ruinous in every point of view religious moral civil political it establishes that dreadful maxim of machiavel that in great affairs men are not to be wicked by halves this maxim is not made for a middle sort of beings who because they cannot be angels ought to thwart their ambition and not endeavour to become infernal spirits it is too well exemplified in the present time where the faults and errors of humanity checked by the imperfect timorous virtues have been overpowered by those who have stopped at no crime it is a dreadful part of the example that infernal malevolence has had pious apologists who read their lectures on frailties in favour of crimes who abandon the weak and court the friendship of the wicked to root out these maxims and the examples that support them is a wise object of years of war this is that war this is that moral war it was said by old trivulzio that the battle of marignan was the battle of the giants that all the rest of the many he had seen were those of the cranes and pigmies this is true of the objects at least of the contest for the greater part of those which we have hitherto contended for in comparison were the toys of children  the october politician is so full of charity and good nature that he supposes that these very robbers and murderers themselves are in a course of melioration on what ground i cannot conceive except on the long practice of every crime and by its complete success he is an origenist and believes in the conversion of the devil all that runs in the place of blood in his veins is nothing but the milk of human kindness he is as soft as a curd though as a politician he might be supposed to be made of sterner stuff he supposes to use his own expression that the salutary truths which he inculcates are making their way into their bosoms their bosom is a rock of granite on which falsehood has long since built her stronghold poor truth has had a hard work of it with her little pickaxe nothing but gunpowder will do as a proof however of the progress of this sap of truth he gives us a confession they had made not long before he wrote their fraternity as was lately stated by themselves in a solemn report has been the brotherhood of cain and abel and they have organized nothing but bankruptcy and famine a very honest confession truly and much in the spirit of their oracle rousseau yet what is still more marvellous than the confession this is the very fraternity to which our author gives us such an obliging invitation to accede there is indeed a vacancy in the fraternal corps a brother and a partner is wanted if we please we may fill up the place of the butchered abel and whilst we wait the destiny of the departed brother we may enjoy the advantages of the partnership by entering without delay into a shop of readymade bankruptcy and famine these are the douceurs by which we are invited to regicide fraternity and friendship but still our author considers the confession as a proof that truth is making its way into their bosoms no it is not making its way into their bosoms it has forced its way into their mouths the evil spirit by which they are possessed though essentially a liar is forced by the tortures of conscience to confess the truth to confess enough for their condemnation but not for their amendment shakspeare very aptly expresses this kind of confession devoid of repentance from the mouth of a usurper a murderer and a regicide      we are ourselves compelled      even to the teeth and forehead of our faults      to give in evidence  whence is their amendment why the author writes that on their murderous insurrectionary system their own lives are not sure for an hour nor has their power a greater stability true they are convinced of it and accordingly the wretches have done all they can to preserve their lives and to secure their power but not one step have they taken to amend the one or to make a more just use of the other   constitution not the peoples slave  there is one topic upon which i hope i shall be excused in going a little beyond my design the factions now so busy amongst us in order to divest men of all love for their country and to remove from their minds all duty with regard to the state endeavour to propagate an opinion that the people in forming their commonwealth have by no means parted with their power over it this is an impregnable citadel to which these gentlemen retreat whenever they are pushed by the battery of laws and usages and positive conventions indeed it is such and of so great force that all they have done in defending their outworks is so much time and labour thrown away discuss any of their schemestheir answer isit is the act of the people and that is sufficient are we to deny to a majority of the people the right of altering even the whole frame of their society if such should be their pleasure they may change it say they from a monarchy to a republic today and tomorrow back again from a republic to a monarchy and so backward and forward as often as they like they are masters of the commonwealth because in substance they are themselves the commonwealth the french revolution say they was the act of the majority of the people and if the majority of any other people the people of england for instance wish to make the same change they have the same right just the same undoubtedly that is none at all neither the few nor the many have a right to act merely by their will in any matter connected with duty trust engagement or obligation the constitution of a country being once settled upon some compact tacit or expressed there is no power existing of force to alter it without the breach of the covenant or the consent of all the parties such is the nature of a contract and the votes of a majority of the people whatever their infamous flatterers may teach in order to corrupt their minds cannot alter the moral any more than they can alter the physical essence of things the people are not to be taught to think lightly of their engagements to their governors else they teach governors to think lightly of their engagements towards them in that kind of game in the end the people are sure to be losers to flatter them into a contempt of faith truth and justice is to ruin them for in these virtues consist their whole safety to flatter any man or any part of mankind in any description by asserting that in engagements he or they are free whilst any other human creature is bound is ultimately to vest the rule of morality in the pleasure of those who ought to be rigidly submitted to it to subject the sovereign reason of the world to the caprices of weak and giddy men  but as no one of us men can dispense with public or private faith or with any other tie of moral obligation so neither can any number of us the number engaged in crimes instead of turning them into laudable acts only augments the quantity and intensity of the guilt i am well aware that men love to hear of their power but have an extreme disrelish to be told of their duty this is of course because every duty is a limitation of some power indeed arbitrary power is so much to the depraved taste of the vulgar of the vulgar of every description that almost all the dissensions which lacerate the commonwealth are not concerning the manner in which it is to be exercised but concerning the hands in which it is to be placed somewhere they are resolved to have it whether they desire it to be vested in the many or the few depends with most men upon the chance which they imagine they themselves may have of partaking in the exercise of that arbitrary sway in the one mode or in the other  it is not necessary to teach men to thirst after power but it is very expedient that by moral instruction they should be taught and by their civil constitutions they should be compelled to put many restrictions upon the immoderate exercise of it and the inordinate desire the best method of obtaining these two great points forms the important but at the same time the difficult problem to the true statesman he thinks of the place in which political power is to be lodged with no other attention than as it may render the more or the less practicable its salutary restraint and its prudent direction for this reason no legislator at any period of the world has willingly placed the seat of active power in the hands of the multitude because there it admits of no control no regulation no steady direction whatsoever the people are the natural control on authority but to exercise and to control together is contradictory and impossible  as the exorbitant exercise of power cannot under popular sway be effectually restrained the other great object of political arrangement the means of abating an excessive desire of it is in such a state still worse provided for the democratic commonwealth is the foodful nurse of ambition under the other forms it meets with many restraints whenever in states which have had a democratic basis the legislators have endeavoured to put restraints upon ambition their methods were as violent as in the end they were ineffectual as violent indeed as any the most jealous despotism could invent the ostracism could not very long save itself and much less the state which it was meant to guard from the attempts of ambition one of the natural inbred incurable distempers of a powerful democracy   modern lights  great lights they say are lately obtained in the world and mr burke instead of shrouding himself in exploded ignorance ought to have taken advantage of the blaze of illumination which has been spread about him it may be so the enthusiasts of this time it seems like their predecessors in another faction of fanaticism deal in lightshudibras pleasantly says to them they      have lights where better eyes are blind       as pigs are said to see the wind   the author of the reflections has heard a great deal concerning the modern lights but he has not yet had the good fortune to see much of them he has read more than he can justify to anything but the spirit of curiosity of the works of these illuminators of the world he has learned nothing from the far greater number of them than a full certainty of their shallowness levity pride petulance presumption and ignorance where the old authors whom he has read and the old men whom he has conversed with have left him in the dark he is in the dark still if others however have obtained any of this extraordinary light they will use it to guide them in their researches and their conduct i have only to wish that the nation may be as happy and as prosperous under the influence of the new light as it has been in the sober shade of the old obscurity   republics in the abstract  in the same debate mr burke was represented by mr fox as arguing in a manner which implied that the british constitution could not be defended but by abusing all republics ancient and modern he said nothing to give the least ground for such a censure he never abused all republics he has never professed himself a friend or an enemy to republics or to monarchies in the abstract he thought that the circumstances and habits of every country which it is always perilous and productive of the greatest calamities to force are to decide upon the form of its government there is nothing in his nature his temper or his faculties which should make him an enemy to any republic modern or ancient far from it he has studied the form and spirit of republics very early in life he has studied them with great attention and with a mind undisturbed by affection or prejudice he is indeed convinced that the science of government would be poorly cultivated without that study but the result in his mind from that investigation has been and is that neither england nor france without infinite detriment to them as well in the event as in the experiment could be brought into a republican form but that everything republican which can be introduced with safety into either of them must be built upon a monarchy built upon a real not a nominal monarchy as its essential basis that all such institutions whether aristocratic or democratic must originate from the crown and in all their proceedings must refer to it that by the energy of that main spring alone those republican parts must be set in action and from thence must derive their whole legal effect as amongst us they actually do or the whole will fall into confusion these republican members have no other point but the crown in which they can possibly unite  this is the opinion expressed in mr burkes book he has never varied in that opinion since he came to years of discretion but surely if it any time of his life he had entertained other notions which however he has never held or professed to hold the horrible calamities brought upon a great people by the wild attempt to force their country into a republic might be more than sufficient to undeceive his understanding and to free it for ever from such destructive fancies he is certain that many even in france have been made sick of their theories by their very success in realizing them   an english monarch  he is a real king and not an executive officer if he will not trouble himself with contemptible details nor wish to degrade himself by becoming a party in little squabbles i am far from sure that a king of great britain in whatever concerns him as a king or indeed as a rational man who combines his public interest with his personal satisfaction does not possess a more real solid extensive power than the king of france was possessed of before this miserable revolution the direct power of the king of england is considerable his indirect and far more certain power is great indeed he stands in need of nothing towards dignity of nothing towards splendour of nothing towards authority of nothing at all towards consideration abroad when was it that a king of england wanted wherewithal to make him respected courted or perhaps even feared in every state of europe   physiognomy    the physiognomy has a considerable share in beauty especially in that of our own species the manners give a certain determination to the countenance which being observed to correspond pretty regularly with them is capable of joining the effect of certain agreeable qualities of the mind to those of the body so that to form a finished human beauty and to give it its full influence the face must be expressive of such gentle and amiable qualities as correspond with the softness smoothness and delicacy of the outward form   the eye  i have hitherto purposely omitted to speak of the eye which has so great a share in the beauty of the animal creation as it did not fall so easily under the foregoing heads though in fact it is reducible to the same principles i think then that the beauty of the eye consists first in its clearness what coloured eye shall please most depends a good deal on particular fancies but none are pleased with an eye whose water to use that term is dull and muddy we are pleased with the eye in this view on the principle upon which we like diamonds clear water glass and suchlike transparent substances secondly the motion of the eye contributes to its beauty by continually shifting its direction but a slow and languid motion is more beautiful than a brisk one the latter is enlivening the former lovely thirdly with regard to the union of the eye with the neighbouring parts it is to hold the same rule that is given of other beautiful ones it is not to make a strong deviation from the line of the neighbouring parts nor to verge into any exact geometrical figure besides all this the eye affects as it is expressive of some qualities of the mind and its principal power generally arises from this so that what we have just said of the physiognomy is applicable here   abolition and use of parliaments  according to their invariable course the framers of your constitution have begun with the outer abolition of the parliaments these venerable bodies like the rest of the old government stood in need of reform even though there should be no change made in the monarchy they required several more alterations to adapt them to the system of a free constitution but they had particulars in their constitution and those not a few which deserved approbation from the wise they possessed one fundamental excellencethey were independent the most doubtful circumstance attendant on their office that of its being vendible contributed however to this independency of character they held for life indeed they may be said to have held by inheritance appointed by the monarch they were considered as nearly out of his power the most determined exertions of that authority against them only showed their radical independence they composed permanent bodies politic constituted to resist arbitrary innovation and from that corporate constitution and from most of their forms they were well calculated to afford both certainty and stability to the laws they had been a safe asylum to secure these laws in all the revolutions of humour and opinion they had saved that sacred deposit of the country during the reigns of arbitrary princes and the struggles of arbitrary factions they kept alive the memory and record of the constitution they were the great security to private property which might be said when personal liberty had no existence to be in fact as well guarded in france as in any other country whatever is supreme in a state ought to have as much as possible its judicial authority so constituted as not only not to depend upon it but in some sort to balance it it ought to give a security to its justice against its power it ought to make its judicature as it were something exterior to the state these parliaments had furnished not the best certainly but some considerable corrective to the excesses and vices of the monarchy such an independent judicature was ten times more necessary when a democracy became the absolute power of the country in that constitution elective temporary local judges such as you have contrived exercising their dependent functions in a narrow society must be the worst of all tribunals in them it will be vain to look for any appearance of justice towards strangers towards the obnoxious rich towards the minority of routed parties towards all those who in the election have supported unsuccessful candidates it will be impossible to keep the new tribunals clear of the worst spirit of faction all contrivances by ballot we know experimentally to be vain and childish to prevent a discovery of inclinations where they may the best answer the purposes of concealment they answer to produce suspicion and this is a still more mischievous cause of partiality  if the parliaments had been preserved instead of being dissolved at so ruinous a change to the nation they might have served in this new commonwealth perhaps not precisely the same i do not mean an exact parallel but nearly the same purposes as the court and senate of areopagus did in athens that is as one of the balances and correctives to the evils of a light and unjust democracy every one knows that this tribunal was the great stay of that state every one knows with what a care it was upheld and with what a religious awe it was consecrated the parliaments were not wholly free from faction i admit but this evil was exterior and accidental and not so much the vice of their constitution itself as it must be in your new contrivance of sexennial elective judicatories several english commend the abolition of the old tribunals as supposing that they determined everything by bribery and corruption but they have stood the test of monarchic and republican scrutiny the court was well disposed to prove corruption on those bodies when they were dissolved in 1771those who have again dissolved them would have done the same if they couldbut both inquisitions having failed i conclude that gross pecuniary corruption must have been rather rare amongst them  it would have been prudent along with the parliaments to preserve their ancient power of registering and of remonstrating at least upon all the decrees of the national assembly as they did upon those which passed in the time of the monarchy it would be a means of squaring the occasional decrees of a democracy to some principles of general jurisprudence the vice of the ancient democracies and one cause of their ruin was that they ruled as you do by occasional decreespsephismata this practice soon broke in upon the tenor and consistency of the laws it abated the respect of the people towards them and totally destroyed them in the end  your vesting the power of remonstrance which in the time of the monarchy existed in the parliament of paris in your principal executive officer whom in spite of common sense you persevere in calling king is the height of absurdity you ought never to suffer remonstrance from him who is to execute this is to understand neither counsel nor execution neither authority nor obedience the person whom you call king ought not to have this power or he ought to have more   cromwell and his contrasts    cromwell when he attempted to legalize his power and to settle his conquered country in a state of order did not look for dispensers of justice in the instruments of his usurpation quite the contrary he sought out with great solicitude and selection and even from the party most opposite to his designs men of weight and decorum of character men unstained with the violence of the times and with hands not fouled with confiscation and sacrilege for he chose an hale for his chief justice though he absolutely refused to take his civic oaths or to make any acknowledgment whatsoever of the legality of his government cromwell told this great lawyer that since he did not approve his title all he required of him was to administer in a manner agreeable to his pure sentiments and unspotted character that justice without which human society cannot subsist that it was not his particular government but civil order itself which as a judge he wished him to support cromwell knew how to separate the institutions expedient to his usurpation from the administration of the public justice of his country for cromwell was a man in whom ambition had not wholly suppressed but only suspended the sentiments of religion and the love as far as it could consist with his designs of fair and honourable reputation accordingly we are indebted to this act of his for the preservation of our laws which some senseless assertors of the rights of men were then on the point of entirely erasing as relics of feudality and barbarism besides he gave in the appointment of that man to that age and to all posterity the most brilliant example of sincere and fervent piety exact justice and profound jurisprudence see burnets life of hale but these are not the things in which your philosophic usurpers choose to follow cromwell  one would think that after an honest and necessary revolution if they had a mind that theirs should pass for such your masters would have imitated the virtuous policy of those who have been at the head of revolutions of that glorious character burnet tells us that nothing tended to reconcile the english nation to the government of king william so much as the care he took to fill the vacant bishoprics with men who had attracted the public esteem by their learning eloquence and piety and above all by their known moderation in the state with you in your purifying revolution whom have you chosen to regulate the church mr mirabeau is a fine speakerand a fine writerand a finea very fine manbut really nothing gave more surprise to everybody here than to find him the supreme head of your ecclesiastical affairs the rest is of course your assembly addresses a manifesto to france in which they tell the people with an insulting irony that they have brought the church to its primitive condition in one respect their declaration is undoubtedly true for they have brought it to a state of poverty and persecution what can be hoped for after this have not men if they deserve the name under this new hope and head of the church been made bishops for no other merit than having acted as instruments of atheists for no other merit than having thrown the childrens bread to dogs and in order to gorge the whole gang of usurers pedlars and itinerant jewdiscounters at the corners of streets starved the poor of their christian flocks and their own brother pastors have not such men been made bishops to administer in temples in which if the patriotic donations have not already stripped them of their vessels the churchwardens ought to take security for the altarplate and not so much as to trust the chalice in their sacrilegious hands so long as jews have assignats on ecclesiastic plunder to exchange for the silver stolen from churches   delicacy    an air of robustness and strength is very prejudicial to beauty an appearance of delicacy and even of fragility is almost essential to it whoever examines the vegetable or animal creation will find this observation to be founded in nature it is not the oak the ash or the elm or any of the robust trees of the forest which we consider as beautiful they are awful and majestic their inspire a sort of reverence it is the delicate myrtle it is the orange it is the almond it is the jasmine it is the vine which we look on as vegetable beauties it is the flowery species so remarkable for its weakness and momentary duration that gives us the liveliest idea of beauty and elegance among animals the greyhound is more beautiful than the mastiff and the delicacy of a gennet a barb or an arabian horse is much more amiable than the strength and stability of some horses of war or carriage i need here say little of the fair sex where i believe the point will be easily allowed me the beauty of women is considerably owing to their weakness or delicacy and is even enhanced by their timidity a quality of mind analogous to it i would not here be understood to say that weakness betraying very bad health has any share in beauty but the ill effect of this is not because it is weakness but because the ill state of health which produces such weakness alters the other conditions of beauty the parts in such a case collapse the bright colourthe lumen purpureum juventae is gone and the fine variation is lost in wrinkles sudden breaks and right lines   confiscation and currency  as to the operation of the first the confiscation and paper currency merely as a cement i cannot deny that these the one depending on the other may for some time compose some sort of cement if their madness and folly in the management and in the tempering of the parts together does not produce a repulsion in the very outset but allowing to the scheme some coherence and some duration it appears to me that if after a while the confiscation should not be found sufficient to support the paper coinage as i am morally certain it will not then instead of cementing it will add infinitely to the dissociation distraction and confusion of these confederate republics both with relation to each other and to the several parts within themselves but if the confiscation should so far succeed as to sink the paper currency the cement is gone with the circulation in the mean time its binding force will be very uncertain and it will straiten or relax with every variation in the credit of the paper  one thing only is certain in this scheme which is an effect seemingly collateral but direct i have no doubt in the minds of those who conduct this business that is its effect in producing an oligarchy in every one of the republics a paper circulation not founded on any real money deposited or engaged for amounting already to fourandforty millions of english money and this currency by force substituted in the place of the coin of the kingdom becoming thereby the substance of its revenue as well as the medium of all its commercial and civil intercourse must put the whole of what power authority and influence is left in any form whatsoever it may assume into the hands of the managers and conductors of this circulation  in england we feel the influence of the bank though it is only the centre of a voluntary dealing he knows little indeed of the influence of money upon mankind who does not see the force of the management of a monied concern which is so much more extensive and in its nature so much more depending on the managers than any of ours but this is not merely a money concern there is another member in the system inseparably connected with this money management it consists in the means of drawing out at discretion portions of the confiscated lands for sale and carrying on a process of continual transmutation of paper into land and of land into paper when we follow this process in its effects we may conceive something of the intensity of the force with which this system must operate by this means the spirit of moneyjobbing and speculation goes into the mass of land itself and incorporates with it by this kind of operation that species of property becomes as it were volatilized it assumes an unnatural and monstrous activity and thereby throws into the hands of the several managers principal and subordinate parisian and provincial all the representative of money and perhaps a full tenth part of all the land in france which has now acquired the worst and most pernicious part of the evil of a paper circulationthe greatest possible uncertainty in its value they have reversed the latonian kindness to the landed property of delos they have sent theirs to be blown about like the light fragments of a wreck oras et littora circum  the new dealers being all habitually adventurers and without any fixed habits or local predilections will purchase to job out again as the market of paper or of money or of land shall present an advantage for though a holy bishop thinks that agriculture will derive great advantage from the enlightened usurers who are to purchase the church confiscations i who am not a good but an old farmer with great humility beg leave to tell his late lordship that usury is not tutor of agriculture and if the word enlightened be understood according to the new dictionary as it always is in your new schools i cannot conceive how a mans not believing in god can teach him to cultivate the earth with the least of any additional skill or encouragement diis immortalibus sero said an old roman when he held one handle of the plough whilst death held the other though you were to join in the commission all the directors of the two academies to the directors of the caisse descompte an old experienced peasant is worth them all i have got more information upon a curious and interesting branch of husbandry in one short conversation with an old carthusian monk than i have derived from all the bank directors that i have ever conversed with however there is no cause for apprehension from the meddling of moneydealers with rural economy these gentlemen are too wise in their generation at first perhaps their tender and susceptible imaginations may be captivated with the innocent and unprofitable delights of a pastoral life but in a little time they will find that agriculture is a trade much more laborious and much less lucrative than that which they had left after making its panegyric they will turn their backs on it like their great precursor and prototype they may like him begin by singing beatus illebut what will be the end      haec ubi locutus foenerator alphius       jamjam futurus rusticus      omnem relegit

employ their talents according to their habits and their interests they will not follow the plough whilst they can direct treasuries and govern provinces  your legislators in everything new are the very first who have founded a commonwealth upon gaming and infused this spirit into it as its vital breath the great object in these politics is to metamorphose france from a great kingdom into one great playtable to turn its inhabitants into a nation of gamesters to make speculation as extensive as life to mix it with all its concerns and to divert the whole of the hopes and fears of the people from their usual channels into the impulses passions and superstitions of those who live on chances they loudly proclaim their opinion that this their present system of a republic cannot possibly exist without this kind of gaming fund and that the very thread of its life is spun out of the staple of these speculations the old gaming in funds was mischievous enough undoubtedly but it was so only to individuals even when it had its greatest extent in the mississippi and south sea it affected but few comparatively where it extends further as in lotteries the spirit has but a single object but where the law which in most circumstances forbids and in none countenances gaming is itself debauched so as to reverse its nature and policy and expressly to force the subject to this destructive table by bringing the spirit and symbols of gaming into the minutest matters and engaging everybody in it and in everything a more dreadful epidemic distemper of that kind is spread than yet has appeared in the world with you a man can neither earn nor buy his dinner without a speculation what he receives in the morning will not have the same value at night what he is compelled to take as pay for an old debt will not be received as the same when he comes to pay a debt contracted by himself nor will it be the same when by prompt payment he would avoid contracting any debt at all industry must wither away economy must be driven from your country careful provision will have no existence who will labour without knowing the amount of his pay who will study to increase what none can estimate who will accumulate when he does not know the value of what he saves if you abstract it from its uses in gaming to accumulate your paper wealth would be not the providence of a man but the distempered instinct of a jackdaw   omnipotence of church plunder    their fanatical confidence in the omnipotence of church plunder has induced these philosophers to overlook all care of the public estate just as the dream of the philosophers stone induces dupes under the more plausible delusion of the hermetic art to neglect all rational means of improving their fortunes with these philosophic financiers this universal medicine made of church mummy is to cure all the evils of the state these gentlemen perhaps do not believe a great deal in the miracles of piety but it cannot be questioned

the variety of their resources are the same they have not more notes in their song than the cuckoo though far from the softness of that harbinger of summer and plenty their voice is as harsh and as ominous as that of the raven   ugliness  it may perhaps appear like a sort of repetition of what we have before said to insist here upon the nature of ugliness as i imagine it to be in all respects the opposite to those qualities which we have laid down for the constituents of beauty but though ugliness be the opposite to beauty it is not the opposite to proportion and fitness for it is possible that a thing may be very ugly with any proportions and with a perfect fitness to any uses ugliness i imagine likewise to be consistent enough with an idea of the sublime but i would by no means insinuate that ugliness of itself is a sublime idea unless united with such qualities as excite a strong terror   grace  gracefulness is an idea not very different from beauty it consists in much the same things gracefulness is an idea belonging to posture and motion in both these to be graceful it is requisite that there be no appearance of difficulty there is required a small inflection of the body and a composure of the parts in such a manner as not to encumber each other not to appear divided by sharp and sudden angles in this ease this roundness this delicacy of attitude and motion it is that all the magic of grace consists and what is called its je ne sais quoi as will be obvious to any observer who considers attentively the venus de medicis the antinous or any statue generally allowed to be graceful in a high degree   elegance and speciousness    when any body is composed of parts smooth and polished without pressing upon each other without showing any ruggedness or confusion and at the same time affecting some regular shape i call it elegant it is closely allied to the beautiful differing from it only in this regularity which however as it makes a very material difference in the affection produced may very well constitute another species under this head i rank those delicate and regular works of art that imitate no determinate object in nature as elegant buildings and pieces of furniture when any object partakes of the abovementioned qualities are of those of beautiful bodies and is withal of great dimensions it is full as remote from the idea of mere beauty i call it fine or specious   the beautiful in feeling  the foregoing description of beauty so far as it is taken in by the eye may be greatly illustrated by describing the nature of objects which produce a similar effect through the touch this i call the beautiful in feeling it corresponds wonderfully with what causes the same species of pleasure to the sight there is a chain in all our sensations they are all but different sorts of feelings calculated to be affected by various sorts of objects but all to be affected after the same manner all bodies that are pleasant to the touch are so by the slightness of the resistance they make resistance is either to motion along the surface or to the pressure of the parts on one another if the former be slight we call the body smooth if the latter soft the chief pleasure we receive by feeling is in the one or the other of these qualities and if there be a combination of both our pleasure is greatly increased this is so plain that it is rather more fit to illustrate other things than to be illustrated itself by an example the next source of pleasure in this sense as in every other is the continually presenting somewhat new and we find that bodies which continually vary their surface are much the most pleasant or beautiful to the feeling as any one that pleases may experience the third property in such objects is that though the surface continually varies its direction it never varies it suddenly the application of anything sudden even though the impression itself have little or nothing of violence is disagreeable the quick application of a finger a little warmer or colder than usual without notice makes us start a slight tap on the shoulder not expected has the same effect hence it is that angular bodies bodies that suddenly vary the direction of the outline afford so little pleasure to the feeling every such change is a sort of climbing or falling in miniature so that squares triangles and other angular figures are neither beautiful to the sight nor feeling whoever compares his state of mind on feeling soft smooth variated unangular bodies with that in which he finds himself on the view of a beautiful object will perceive a very striking analogy in the effects of both and which may go a good way towards discovering their common cause feeling and sight in this respect differ in but a few points the touch takes in the pleasure of softness which is not primarily an object of sight the sight on the other hand comprehends colour which can hardly be made perceptible to the touch the touch again has the advantage in a new idea of pleasure resulting from a moderate degree of warmth but the eye triumphs in the infinite extent and multiplicity of its objects but there is such a similitude in the pleasures of these senses that i am apt to fancy if it were possible that one might discern colour by feeling as it is said some blind men have done that the same colours and the same disposition of colouring which are found beautiful to the sight would be found likewise most grateful to the touch but setting aside conjectures let us pass to the other sense of hearing   the beautiful in sounds  in this sense we find an equal aptitude to be affected in a soft and delicate manner and how far sweet or beautiful sounds agree with our descriptions of beauty in other senses the experience of every one must decide milton has described this species of music in one of his juvenile poems lallegro i need not say that milton was perfectly well versed in that art and that no man had a finer ear with a happier manner of expressing the affections of one sense by metaphors taken from another the description is as follows       and ever against eating cares      lap me in soft lydian airs     in notes with many a winding bout     of linked sweetness long drawn out      with wanton heed and giddy cunning      the melting voice through mazes running      untwisting all the chains that tie     the hidden soul of harmony  let us parallel this with the softness the winding surface the unbroken continuance the easy gradation of the beautiful in other things and all the diversities of the several senses with all their several affections will rather help to throw lights from one another to finish one clear consistent idea of the whole than to obscure it by their intricacy and variety  to the abovementioned description i shall add one or two remarks the first is that the beautiful in music will not bear that loudness and strength of sounds which may be used to raise other passions nor notes which are shrill or harsh or deep it agrees best with such as are clear even smooth and weak the second is that great variety and quick transitions from one measure or tone to another are contrary to the genius of the beautiful in music such transitions often excite mirth or other sudden or tumultuous passions but not that sinking that melting that languor which is the characteristical effect of the beautiful as it regards every sense i neer am merry when i hear sweet musicshakspeare the passion excited by beauty is in fact nearer to a species of melancholy than to jollity and mirth i do not here mean to confine music to any one species of notes or tones neither is it an art in which i can say i have any great skill my sole design in this remark is to settle a consistent idea of beauty the infinite variety of the affections of the soul will suggest to a good head and skilful ear a variety of such sounds as are fitted to raise them it can be no prejudice to this to clear and distinguish some few particulars that belong to the same class and are consistent with each other from the immense crowd of different and sometimes contradictory ideas that rank vulgarly under the standard of beauty and of these it is my intention to mark such only of the leading points as show the conformity of the sense of hearing with the other senses in the article of their pleasures   british church  it is something extraordinary that the only symptom of alarm in the church of england should appear in the petition of some dissenters with whom i believe very few in this house are yet acquainted and of whom you know no more than that you are assured by the honourable gentleman that they are not mahometans of the church we know they are not by the name that they assume they are then dissenters the first symptom of an alarm comes from some dissenters assembled round the lines of chatham these lines become the security of the church of england the honourable gentleman in speaking of the lines of chatham tells us that they serve not only for the security of the wooden walls of england but for the defence of the church of england i suspect the wooden walls of england secure the lines of chatham rather than the lines of chatham secure the wooden walls of england  sir the church of england if only defended by this miserable petition upon your table must i am afraid upon the principles of true fortification be soon destroyed but fortunately her walls bulwarks and bastions are constructed of other materials than of stubble and straw are built up with the strong and stable matter of the gospel of liberty and founded on a true constitutional legal establishment but sir she has other securities she has the security of her own doctrines she has the security of the piety the sanctity of her own professors their learning is a bulwark to defend her she has the security of the two universities not shook in any single battlement in any single pinnacle   but if after all this danger is to be apprehended if you are really fearful that christianity will indirectly suffer by this liberty you have my free consent go directly and by the straight way and not by a circuit in which in your road you may destroy your friends point your arms against these men who do the mischief you fear promoting point your arms against men who not contented with endeavouring to turn your eyes from the blaze and effulgence of light by which life and immortality is so gloriously demonstrated by the gospel would even extinguish that faint glimmering of nature that only comfort supplied to ignorant man before this great illuminationthem who by attacking even the possibility of all revelation arraign all the dispensations of providence to man these are the wicked dissenters you ought to fear these are the people against whom you ought to aim the shafts of law these are the men to whom arrayed in all the terrors of government i would say you shall not degrade us into brutes these men these factious men as the honourable gentleman properly called them are the just objects of vengeance not the conscientious dissenter these men who would take away whatever ennobles the rank or consoles the misfortunes of human nature by breaking off that connection of observations of affections of hopes and fears which bind us to the divinity and constitute the glorious and distinguishing prerogative of humanity that of being a religious creature against these i would have the laws rise in all their majesty of terrors to fulminate such vain and impious wretches and to awe them into impotence by the only dread they can fear or believe to learn that eternal lessondiscite justitiam moniti et non temnere divos  at the same time that i would cut up the very root of atheism i would respect all conscience all conscience that is really such and which perhaps its very tenderness proves to be sincere i wish to see the established church of england great and powerful i wish to see her foundations laid low and deep that she may crush the giant powers of rebellious darkness i would have her head raised up to that heaven to which she conducts us i would have her open wide her hospitable gates by a noble and liberal comprehension but i would have no breaches in her wall i would have her cherish all those who are within and pity all those who are without i would have her a common blessing to the world an example if not an instructor to those who have not the happiness to belong to her i would have her give a lesson of peace to mankind that a vexed and wandering generation might be taught to seek for repose and toleration in the maternal bosom of christian charity and not in the harlot lap of infidelity and indifference   index  abstract
